 Mr. President, after 19 years of dedicated  service to the court, U.S. Magistrate Judge Valerie P. Cooke will be  retiring on July 31, 2018. I wish to recognize Judge Cooke for her  excellent service to the Federal judiciary and the State of Nevada  while serving as U.S. Magistrate Judge for the District of Nevada since  1999.   As a third generation Nevada attorney, Judge Cooke has worked  diligently to advance communities across Nevada, notably working to  ensure equal protection under the law for the most vulnerable and  forgotten populations. Judge Cooke initiated the CLEAR--Court Led  Efforts at Recovery--court program, Nevada's first Federal reentry  court, which helps to alleviate the barriers that formerly incarcerated  individuals face as they attempt to reintegrate into society. She also  worked to ensure inmates received timely resolutions to their civil  rights claims by developing the District of Nevada's inmate early  mediation program and implementing electronic filing for civil rights  litigation.   Judge Cooke has also held leadership positions in a number of  prestigious organizations and committees. Judge Cooke served as the  2008-2009 president of the Bruce R. Thompson Chapter of the American  Inns of Court and continues to be active as an emeritus master. Judge  Cooke was also the president of the Northern Nevada Women Lawyers  Association in 1990 and was the 2001 recipient of the Outstanding Woman  Lawyer of the Year Award.   Prior to her tenure on the bench, Judge Cooke served on the Nevada  Tax Commission and the Nevada Judicial Discipline Commission. She has  also devoted significant time to the advancement of alternative dispute  resolution, serving on the Ninth Circuit's alternative dispute  resolution committee from 2001 until 2013 and chairing the committee  from 2009 to 2013. She has also conducted educational programs on the  subject across the country and abroad.   In addition to her work in public service, Judge Cooke has  consistently given back to her community. She has served as a mentor  and as a role model for youth in Nevada through her involvement with  Big Brothers Big Sisters, which led to her being named the 2009 School- Based Big Sister of the Year by Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northern  Nevada. Judge Cooke conducts annual presentations to elementary through  high school students on the work of a Federal judge and volunteers her  time each year to serve as a high school mock trial judge. Judge Cooke  embodies the Nevada values of leadership, service, and hard work. I ask  my colleagues to join me in commending Valerie P. Cooke for her many  years of service to the District of Nevada, the Federal bench, and  communities across Nevada and the Nation.                            ____________________
