 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, on July 4, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit Ridgecrest,  California. A day later, our Ridgecrest community experienced a 7.1  magnitude earthquake.   To put that in perspective, the Northridge quake that, 20 years ago,  severely cost 60 lives and others and crippled Los Angeles was less  than that.   People felt this throughout southern California, but the epicenter of  these earthquakes was located on the Naval Air Weapons Station China  Lake.   Hundreds of aftershocks have already occurred and are still  occurring.   The Navy announced that, due to earthquake-related damage, China Lake  was not mission capable and that nonessential personnel had to be  evacuated. This is significant because China Lake, along with  neighboring installations, form a cornerstone of our national defense  architecture that integrates all operational domains: air, land, sea,  space, and cyberspace.   The men and women who work here help test and develop the technology  needed to equip our warfighters with the very best weapons and tools to  ensure our military remains second to none.   Now, my amendment, which I offered with Congressman Cook, was  included in the en bloc package. It would authorize $100 million to  help address China Lake's most immediate needs, and it requires the  Department of Defense to develop a plan by October 1 to assess, repair,  and modernize the infrastructure and facilities at China Lake and other  installations in the R-2508 Special Use Airspace Complex that was  damaged by the earthquakes.   The extent of this damage is still being assessed, but we need to  ensure that we are not only repairing this important base to address  the threats facing our Nation today, but in the years ahead.   Mr. Chairman, I want to be clear to my constituents in Ridgecrest, in  Kern County, this amendment is just an initial step in helping China  Lake and the communities I represent impacted by these earthquakes make  sure they recover.   Over the coming days, weeks, and months, I ask my colleagues in this  Chamber and the U.S. Senate to join with me to ensure Ridgecrest, China  Lake, and all communities impacted by earthquakes and natural disasters  have our full support and are provided the resources they need to  quickly rebuild and get back to normal.   I also ask my colleagues to join me in thanking all the local first  responders, the local, State, and Federal emergency response officials  who have worked nonstop over the past several days to ensure our  constituents affected in Ridgecrest were safe, have food and water and  a place to sleep.   Finally, I also want to thank the thousands of residents across our  communities for their help, their actions, and their prayers for their  neighbors in need.   It is said adversity does not build character; it reveals it.  Earthquakes can shake our foundations, but the residents of Ridgecrest  should hold their heads high. In this time of adversity, their true  character has shown and is an inspiration to all of us.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.                                time  1915
