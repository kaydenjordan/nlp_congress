 Mr. Speaker, as has been pointed out each year, public  companies convene these shareholder meetings at which the companies'  shareholders vote for the companies' directors and on other significant  corporate actions that require shareholder approval.   As part of this annual process, the Securities and Exchange  Commission requires public companies to provide their shareholders with  a proxy statement before those meetings.   A proxy statement includes all important facts about the matters to  be voted on at the meeting, including, for example, information on  board of directors candidates, director compensation, executive  compensation, related party transactions, securities ownership by  management, and eligible shareholder proposals.   The information contained in the statement must be filed with the SEC  before soliciting a shareholder vote on the election of directors and  the approval of these other corporate actions. Solicitations, whether  by management or shareholders, must disclose all important facts about  the issues on which the shareholders are being asked to vote.   Institutional investors, including investment advisers to mutual  funds and pension funds, typically hold shares in a large number of  public companies. Each year, the investment advisers to these funds  vote billions of shares on behalf of their clients on thousands of  proxy ballot items.   What you have heard about, really, was the theoretical way this is  supposed to run. Unfortunately, that is not reality, and that is not  what you are hearing from the other side, because in 2003, the SEC  adopted a rule under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, requiring an  investment adviser that exercises voting authority over its clients'  proxies to adopt policies and procedures designed to ensure that the  investment adviser votes those proxies in the best interests of their  clients. Perfect. That is exactly what they should be doing.   The SEC's release adopting the rule clarified that ``an adviser could  demonstrate that the vote was not a product of a conflict of interest  if it voted client securities, in accordance with a predetermined  policy, based upon the recommendations of an independent third party.''   Okay so far, but here is where we see the problem. As a result,  institutional investors increase their reliance on these proxy adviser  firms to help them decide how to vote their shares.   In 2004, the SEC staff, without a Commission vote, just the staff,  issued two ``no action'' letters ``effectively blessing the practice of  investment advisers simply voting the recommendations provided by a  proxy adviser,'' according to SEC Commissioner Dan Gallagher.   Largely, as a result of the SEC's regulation, proxy adviser firms now  wield tremendous outside influence on the U.S. proxy system. Studies  have shown that the two largest proxy adviser firms are comprised of  approximately 97 percent of all the proxy advisory industry and can  control a significant percentage of share votes in corporate elections,  which is sometimes as high as 40 percent. There have been numerous  instances where these two firms have issued vote recommendations on  publicly traded companies that include errors, misstatements of fact,  and incomplete analysis.   Additionally, some proxy advisory firms' recommendations have been  made without any sort of communication or contact with the public  company that they are actually reviewing. In fact, these same proxy  advisory firms even encourage companies to join their service on the  other side of the ledger in order to have the privilege to  ``influence'' an advisory firm's recommendations.   Members heard from the ranking member about a teacher having to check  with a student about what their grades are going to be as a student.   Well, what this is, Mr. Speaker, this is the teacher shaking down the  student for their lunch money and milk  [[Page H10318]]  money to make sure that they are behaving.   So let's talk about reality here.   Regulators, market participants, and academic observers have  highlighted potential conflicts of interest inherent to this business  model and activities of these proxy firms. For example, proxy advisory  firms may feel pressured by their largest clients, who may be activist  investors, to issue voting recommendations that reflect those clients'  specific agendas, not the boards' or the corporations'.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, additionally, proxy advisory firms often  provide voting recommendations to investment advisers on matters for  which they also provide consulting services to public companies. Talk  about, again, a conflict of interest.   Some proxy advisory firms also rate or score these public companies  on their governance structures, policies, practices, and they are  trying to actually influence the corporate governance practices of  these companies.   Essentially, these proxy advisory firms have hijacked the proxy  system by aligning themselves with activist shareholders, who also  might be their clients, to push social and political initiatives rather  than using shareholder votes to maximize shareholder value and  increasing shareholder returns.                                time  1330    Well, H.R. 4015 is to the rescue on this. It would foster greater  accountability, competition, responsiveness, and, most importantly of  all, transparency.   This legislation would ensure that voting recommendations at proxy  advisory firms are, in fact, in the interest of long-term shareholders.   So let's not misunderstand. The role of these proxy advisory firms  serves a very important place in our economy. However, these firms  aren't immune to conflicts of interest.   The good work of my friend, Mr. Duffy, on H.R. 4015 will improve that  transparency.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   It is not enough that my friends on the opposite side of the aisle  just voted to give the biggest tax breaks to America's richest  corporations. They are back here now supporting the control and the  dominance of corporations over our investors who need protections. The  difference between us and them, they are for deregulation of Dodd-Frank  and protection for consumers to support, however they can give it, the  biggest corporations in America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Carolyn B. Maloney), the distinguished ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of investor protection and in opposition to H.R. 4015.   Proxy advisers provide recommendations to institutional investors on  how to vote on board of director elections and shareholder resolutions.   Big institutional investors are shareholders at thousands of public  companies, and they simply don't have time to carefully review every  single hundred-page proxy statement in detail, especially because most  public companies hold their shareholders meetings at about the same 3- month period.   So institutional investors rely on proxy advisers for vote  recommendations, which are often tailored to the investor's particular  corporate governance preferences. They also rely on proxy firms for  their data management on shareholder votes and corporate governance.   This is healthy. Proxy advisers do actually have the time to  carefully read all of the statements and proposals because they are  professionals that are hired to do just that.   I agree that the current regulatory system for proxy advisers is not  perfect. Two proxy advisory firms account for 97 percent of the  market--ISS and Glass Lewis--but, for some reason, they are regulated  differently. ISS is a registered investment adviser, while Glass Lewis  is not. Surely, this is not an ideal setup, so I am open to the idea of  a better and more consistent regulatory regime for proxy advisers.   But there are several things in this bill that concern me deeply. I  don't see why companies should have a statutory right to receive and  comment on a proxy adviser's draft recommendations before they are sent  to investors. Proxy advisers aren't Federal agencies with a notice-and- comment for private companies. They are working for private companies  that are providing a valuable service. This is not appropriate at all.   Asset managers that use proxy advisers also tell me that they would  find proxy advisers a lot less useful if the proxy firm had to give the  company an opportunity to comment on their vote recommendations before  sending them to the asset manager.   And a new addition to the bill is very troubling. This would raise  the possibility of proxy advisers being forced to send the clients the  companies' own complaints about the proxy adviser's recommendations,  even if the complaint is completely untrue.   This is totally inappropriate and, I would say, plain wrong. So while  I am sympathetic to the idea that a better and more consistent  regulatory regime could be developed, I cannot support this bill, and I  have good company here.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Comptroller of  the State of New York, Comptroller DiNapoli; a statement from the AFL- CIO of the United States of America; a statement from the Council of  Institutional Investors; a statement from the Consumer Federation of  America, and a statement by Glass Lewis.   This is a troubling bill. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on it.  It is bad for safety and soundness and for good governance in this  country.                                                  State of New York,                                 Office of the State Comptroller,                                      Albany, NY, December 14, 2017.      Re Opposition to H.R. 4015, Corporate Governance Reform and           Transparency Act of 2017.         Dear Members of the NYS Congressional Delegation: I write       to express my strong opposition to H.R. 4015, the Corporate       Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017, which I       understand will soon be voted on by the United States House       of Representatives. I believe that H.R. 4015, if passed and       enacted, would require unnecessary and expensive regulation.       Further, this legislation was not promoted by those it       purports to protect: shareholders. It would weaken corporate       accountability and shareholder oversight, undercut proxy       advisory firms' invaluable independence, increase costs to       consumers of research and redirect proxy advisors to answer       to companies rather than the clients it serves.        As Comptroller of the State of New York, I am the Trustee       of the New York State Common Retirement Fund (Fund) and the       administrative head of the New York State and Local       Retirement System (the System). As a fiduciary responsible       for the benefits of over one million state and local       government employees, retirees, and beneficiaries, I am       especially troubled by H.R. 4015's provisions that would       weaken corporate accountability and shareholder oversight.        The system of corporate governance that has evolved in the       United States relies on the accountability of boards of       directors to shareholders, and proxy voting is a critical       means by which shareholders hold boards to account.       Currently, proxy advisors provide shareholders of       corporations with independent advice. The proposed bill       threatens that very independence, which is integral to the       responsible exercise of a shareholder's voting rights.        In public comments defending H.R. 4015, members of the       Financial Services Committee have voiced the erroneous       assertions that proxy advisory firms dictate proxy voting       results and that institutional investors utilizing proxy       advisors do not make their own voting decisions. I personally       review and approve the Fund's customized Proxy Voting and       Corporate Governance Guidelines (Guidelines). In 2017, the       Fund voted on nearly 30,000 agenda items on its portfolio       companies' proxy statements, and every single one of those       items was voted pursuant to the guidelines which state:       ``proxy voting decisions are based on internal reviews of       available information relating to items on the ballot at each       company's annual meeting. . . . The Fund analyzes a variety       of materials from publicly available sources, which include       but are not limited to, U.S. Securities and Exchange       Commission (SEC) filings, analyst reports, relevant studies       and materials from proponents and opponents of shareholder       proposals, third-party independent perspectives and studies,       and analyses from several corporate governance advisory       firms.'' All of our proxy voting decisions are made       independently and in the best interest of our System's       participants.        Proxy advisory firms provide cost-efficient, informed, and       independent research,  [[Page H10319]]       analysis, and advice for institutional shareholders, which       often hold thousands of companies in their investment       portfolios. The independence of that advice is absolutely       essential, and if proxy advisors are required to obtain       corporate review and rebuttals before releasing their       research to investors, that independence would be       compromised, depriving public pension funds and other       institutional investors of a vital resource. Such a       requirement would also delay investors' access to research in       the already constricted time frame available to consider       ballot issues and develop independent voting decisions in an       informed fashion.        As you consider your vote on this bill, please take into       account the concerns I have expressed on behalf of the more       than one million members, retirees and beneficiaries of the       System for whom the Fund invests.        Thank you for your consideration of this very important       matter. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to       discuss these issues further.            Sincerely,                                                Thomas P. DiNapoli,      State Comptroller.                                   ____                                                          AFL-CIO,                                  Washington, DC, December 14, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I am writing       to express our strong opposition to the ``Corporate       Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017'' (H.R. 4015).       H.R. 4015 will create a costly and untested regulatory regime       for proxy advisory firms that provide research and voting       recommendations to shareholders. The bill claims to foster       ``accountability, transparency, responsiveness, and       competition in the proxy advisory firm industry,'' while in       reality it will interfere with shareholders' access to       impartial analysis and undermine shareholders' ability to       hold corporate management accountable.        For example, H.R. 4015 will undermine investors' ability to       hold corporate management responsible on issues such as       executive pay. H.R. 4015 would give corporate executives an       effective veto over proxy advisor recommendations by enabling       companies to delay vote recommendations. Corporate executives       will be able to object to any proxy voting recommendation       that is contrary to their own preferences, including votes on       their own executive compensation packages.        The bill is based on the false idea that shareholders       blindly follow the recommendations of proxy advisors. In       reality, proxy advisors provide independent and unbiased       research on proxy votes to help investors formulate their own       proxy voting decisions. This flawed bill will create       unnecessary regulations that undermine this free flow of       information to investors.        For these reasons, we strongly urge you to vote against       ``Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017''       (H.R. 4015).            Sincerely,                                                    William Samuel,      Director, Government Affairs Department.                                   ____                               Council of Institutional Investors,                                  Washington, DC, December 12, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Re H.R. 4015.         Dear Mr. Speaker and Minority Leader Pelosi: On behalf of       the Council of Institutional Investors (CII or Council), we       are writing to express our opposition to H.R. 4015, which we       understand will soon be voted on by the United States House       of Representatives.        CII is a nonpartisan, nonprofit association of public,       corporate and union employee benefit funds, other employee       benefit plans, state and local entities charged with       investing public assets, and foundations and endowments with       combined assets under management exceeding $3 trillion. CII's       member funds include major long-term shareowners with a duty       to protect the retirement savings of millions of workers and       their families. The Council's associate members include a       range of asset managers with more than $20 trillion in assets       under management.        Many of our members and other institutional investors       voluntary contract with proxy advisory firms to obtain       research reports to assist the funds in voting their proxies       according to the funds' own proxy voting guidelines. This       contractual relationship provides investors a cost-efficient       means of obtaining supplemental research on proxy voting       issues, which is particularly beneficial since many funds       hold thousands of companies in their investment portfolios.        H.R. 4015 would establish a new federal regulatory scheme       for proxy advisory firms that would (1) grant ``companies,''       apparently meaning corporate management, the right to review       the proxy advisory firms research reports before the paying       customers--investors--receive the reports; (2) mandate that       the proxy advisory firms hire an ombudsman to receive and       resolve corporation's complaints; and (3) if the ombudsman to       unable to resolve the complaints, and if the company       management submits a written request, proxy advisory firms       would be required to publish company management's dissenting       statement. These provisions would result in the federal       government interposing corporate management between investors       and those proxy advisory firms that investors hire to provide       them with research on issues, such as executive compensation,       in which corporate management can have its own interests,       sometimes in conflict with investors and with the corporate       entity.        Setting aside whether the provisions of H.R. 4015 are       consistent with First Amendment rights of freedom of speech,       the provisions are not practical. The provisions would       require proxy advisory firms to provide the management teams       of more than 4,000 corporations the opportunity to present       detailed comments on the firm's reports in a matter of weeks       before the reports are provided to investors. Thus, investors       would have limited time to analyze the reports in the context       of their own proxy voting guidelines to arrive at informed       voting decisions. Time is already tight, particularly in the       spring ``proxy season,'' due to the limited period between a       corporations' publication of the annual meeting proxy       materials and the date in which investors are permitted to       vote on proxy issues.        In addition, the provisions of H.R. 4015 would likely       result in fewer market participants in the proxy advisory       firm industry. The provisions would add significant costs       increasing barriers to new entrants and potentially leading       some existing firms to exit the industry altogether.        We also note that the United States Department of Treasury       recently performed extensive outreach to identify views of       company management teams and other market participants on       proxy advisory firms in connection with its recently issued       report to President Trump on ``A Financial System that       Creates Economic Opportunities, Capital Markets.'' In its       report the Treasury found that ``institutional investors, who       pay for proxy advice and are responsible for voting       decisions, find the [proxy advisory firm] services valuable,       especially in sorting through the lengthy and significant       disclosures contained in proxy statements.'' More       significantly, the Treasury did not call for legislation of       the proxy advisory firm industry.        Finally, we have attached for your information and review a       November 9, 2017 letter signed by 45 investors and investor       organizations describing in more detail the basis for their       strong opposition to H.R. 4015.        Thank you for considering our views. We would welcome the       opportunity to discuss our perspective on this important       issue with you or your staff in more detail.            Sincerely,                                                Jeffrey P. Mahoney,      General Counsel.                                   ____                                   Consumer Federation of America,                                                  December 18, 2017.      Re Vote No on H.R. 4015, the ``Corporate Governance           Transparency Act''.         Dear Representative: We understand the House is scheduled       to vote this week on legislation (H.R. 4015, the Corporate       Governance Reform and Transparency Act) that would undermine       the ability of shareholders to get reliable, independent       analysis of proxy issues on which they are asked to vote. We       urge you to vote no.        Although H.R. 4015 is presented as a bill to regulate proxy       advisory firms in order to better protect investors and the       economy, its effect would be to undermine their independence,       simultaneously increasing their costs and undermining their       value to the investors who use their services. Indeed,       several of the bill's provisions are specifically designed to       give the companies whose proxy proposals the firms are       supposed to independently analyze greater input into and       influence over their recommendations.        It would, for example, require proxy advisory firms to give       companies a first look at their draft recommendations and an       opportunity to comment on them before any recommendation to       investors is finalized.        Proxy advisory firms would also be required to employ an       ombudsman to take complaints about the accuracy of the voting       materials from the companies that are subjects of the       recommendations, and provide those companies with an       opportunity to include a comment in materials sent to       investors if their complaints are not resolved to their       satisfaction.      Together, these provisions would empower companies to bully       proxy advisory firms into dropping their objections to       management proposals or watering down their recommendations.        We certainly agree that proxy advisory firms should be       subject to appropriate regulation. Rather than create a       bureaucratic new regulatory regime for a handful of firms,       however, we believe that is better achieved by regulating       these firms as investment advisers, with a fiduciary duty to       act in the best interests of the investors who rely on their       services and an obligation to minimize and appropriately       manage conflicts of interest.        For these reasons, we urge you to vote no on this misguided       and misdirected legislation. Please feel free to contact me       directly if you have questions about our position on this       bill.            Respectfully submitted,                                                     Barbara Roper,                                   Director of Investor Protection.  [[Page H10320]]                                          ____                                                   Glass Lewis,                                                  December 18, 2017.      Re HR 4015--Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act           of 2017.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: I am writing to       express opposition to HR 4015, the Corporate Governance and       Reform and Transparency Act of 2017, which seeks to exert       additional regulatory control over proxy advisory firms at       the expense of investors. I urge a no vote when this       legislation is considered by the full House of       Representatives.        Shareholder voting, a regulatory obligation for U.S.       registered investment advisors, is a primary means by which a       public company's owners can influence company operations,       corporate governance and activities of corporate social       responsibility. As such, it is important for institutional       investors (pension funds, mutual funds and other asset       managers) to have access to the resources--including unbiased       proxy research--that enable them to execute their votes in       accordance with their views.        Glass Lewis is dedicated to helping institutional       shareholders of public companies better understand and       connect directly with the companies in which they invest. Our       duty, as a proxy advisory firm, is to support--not usurp--the       role of our clients as investors/owners, a distinction we       take very seriously. It is reflected in how we develop and       update our proxy voting policies, create our research, and       engage with public companies, shareholders and other       stakeholders.        H.R. 4015, as drafted, would damage investors in public       companies by attempting to silence research firms that       provide investors data, analysis and independent voting       recommendations to support their fiduciary activities related       to proxy voting. It would require the SEC to develop a new       registration scheme that would compel proxy advisory firms to       share their proprietary research reports with the subject       public companies prior to distributing those reports to their       investor clients--thereby granting the subject companies an       unprecedented right of prior review. The proposed legislation       also would establish a system whereby issuers could dispute       recommendations of proxy advisory firms before the investor       clients of proxy advisory firms were granted access to the       research.        No other investment research analysts are subject to these       prior review rules; in fact, FINRA prohibits investment       research analysts from doing this to avoid conflicts of       interest.        In SEC Staff Legal Bulletin No. 20 (June 30, 2014), the SEC       restated that investor consumers of proxy advisory firm       services are responsible for holding their advisors       accountable. These investor consumers are satisfied with the       current system. Indeed, it is telling that the call for       regulating proxy advisory firms is coming not from investors       but from the companies that are the subjects of the advisors'       reports.        In October, the United States Department of Treasury issued       its report to President Trump on ``A Financial System that       Creates Economic Opportunities, Capital Markets.'' As part of       that report, extensive outreach was undertaken to identify       views of company management teams and other market       participants on the role and activities of proxy advisors.       Treasury found that ``institutional investors, who pay for       proxy advice and are responsible for voting decisions, find       the [proxy advisory firm] services valuable, especially in       sorting through the lengthy and significant disclosures       contained in proxy statements.'' More significantly, the       Treasury did not call for legislation of the proxy advisory       industry.        Further, in 2012, the European Securities and Markets       Authority (ESMA), which comprises all the securities       regulators in Europe, and the Canadian Securities       Administrators (CSA) conducted comprehensive reviews of the       proxy advisory industry and its activities. Both regulatory       agencies concluded that neither binding nor quasi-binding       regulation of proxy advisory firm activity was warranted.       ESMA and the CSA each recommended the development of an       industry code of conduct. In accordance with the specific       direction of these regulators, the Best Practice Principles       for Shareholder Voting Research (``Principles'') were       launched in 2014.        Glass Lewis and ISS, the largest U.S.-based proxy advisory       firms, apply the Principles globally. The Principles       encourage transparency, conflict management and disclosure,       and engagement with companies when appropriate. Glass Lewis       meets the' Principles' standards by making its full       guidelines; research approach and methodologies; conflict       avoidance and disclosure policies; and public-company       engagement procedures available publicly on its website.        Most recently, in an effort to ensure that the Principles       remain fully aligned with applicable regulation, a global       consultation was launched in order to seek views from       investors and companies on whether the Principles have been       effective in ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the       services provided by shareholder voting analysts and       advisors. The review is being carried out by a Steering Group       comprised of five representatives of the current Principles'       signatories, chaired by Chris Hodge, former Director of       Corporate Governance at the Financial Reporting Council in       the UK, and supported by an Advisory Panel whose members have       broad experience and knowledge of investors, companies and       different national markets, including the United States. By       way of example, one of the key items on the agenda is the       consideration of what actions will be needed in order to       ensure the Principles are fully compatible with the revised       EU Shareholder Rights Directive, which includes mandatory       requirements for proxy advisors operating in the EU,       scheduled to take effect in 2019.        The Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act is an       attack on investors to the detriment of their beneficiaries--      notably the millions of U.S. teachers, municipal employees,       law enforcement officers, firefighters, retirees and mutual       funds investors. If enacted, it will result in less informed,       more time-constrained investors who will be less able to       properly hold companies accountable for poor returns,       overpaying executives at underperforming companies and       ignoring shareholders and shareholder interests.        Glass Lewis joins with the many pension funds,       institutional investors, and consumer advocates urging you to       vote no on HR 4015 to protect shareholder rights.            Sincerely,                                                Katherine H. Rabin,                                           Chief Executive Officer.
