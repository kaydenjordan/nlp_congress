 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I honor a great man, public servant, and Vista Heights  Middle School's head custodian, Roger Morgan, from Saratoga Springs,  Utah.   When COVID-19 disrupted normalcy last year, Roger did what he always  does: He anticipated the needs of others and sprang into action.  [[Page H2640]]    He installed plexiglass and hand-sanitizing stations. He stayed late  each night to disinfect the entire school. During the summer, he  cleaned out the air vents to increase filtration.   He was proactive and diligent in filling PPE from district, State,  and school funds. As shipments arrived, he organized and distributed  the supplies.   When the State of Utah requested a rapid testing site at Vista  Heights, Roger worked overtime to set it up and cleaned the units every  day to help facilitate the accessibility of this testing option.   The praise for Roger is overwhelming. He is a team player, and he  represents the Fourth District's spirit of service and compassion.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Roger, District Four's first hometown  hero.
