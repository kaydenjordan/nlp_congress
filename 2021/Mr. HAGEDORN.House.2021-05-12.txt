 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for holding this  Special Order. It is really a very important issue all across the  country. And it really doesn't matter which district a Member of  Congress represents; you are going to have these same problems.   Mr. Speaker, I spent the better part of last 2 weeks, during our  district work period, traveling southern Minnesota, meeting with all  sorts of businesses, meeting with labor, talking to the chambers of  commerce. I can tell you that, under normal circumstances, it is tough  enough to run a business and it is tough enough to be productive and  successful in small business. But when you have bad government  policies--and that is what we have here--it makes it extra tough. In  many cases it is limiting production.    We are seeing companies, like United Commercial Upholstery in New  Ulm, having to turn away work. They actually could do three times more  work right now if they could find another 50 employees. But it is  impossible.   It really doesn't matter if it is skilled work or unskilled work; it  is just across the board.   I was up in Lonsdale, Minnesota, in Rice County, and talked to their  chamber of commerce, talked to the packaging company, which is the  biggest employer in town. They have production disruptions across the  board. They just can't find the employees.   Recently, in Rochester, I was at Crenlo Industries, where they make  these high-end cabs for heavy production equipment--Caterpillar, John  [[Page H2264]]  Deere, those types of things. They have line employees, and they want  to get those cabs worked through the line.   Guess what happens?   Employees don't show up. They can't fill the jobs. They have lots of  disruption.   We are seeing these supply chain disruptions all across the country,  skyrocketing costs for materials and others. A lot of this is tied to  these bad policies.   What I do appreciate is some of the Governors across the country who  have taken it upon themselves to say: You know what we are going to do?  If you don't look for qualified work, if you don't accept work, you are  going to lose your unemployment compensation benefits.   Unfortunately, in Minnesota and some other States, you have Governors  that want to hang onto emergency powers and still not make those  requirements.   I think at the Federal level, in my Small Business Committee and  other committees represented here, we should look at how we can tie  those benefits to make sure that there are those strings attached and  we do everything possible to get folks back in the workforce. It is  time. And I know that that is always best for folks to have good, high- paying jobs, and be upwardly mobile and self-sufficient.                                time  1930
