 Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R.  2474, the Protecting the Right to Organize Act. This bill will go a  long way in restoring the right to organize for millions of hardworking  Americans while holding employers accountable for practices that  undermine collective efforts to improve the lives of their employees.   Over the past few decades, our country has seen profits for  corporations and executive pay rise exponentially. Sadly, this  prosperity has failed to trickle down to the average worker. This is  due to practices like union busting used by employers and legislation  such as right-to-work laws enacted by business-friendly state  legislators. The lopsided employee--employer relationship that has been  created thanks to these actions has led to the greatest level of income  inequality in my lifetime.   As a dues-paying member of the American Federation of Government  Employees Union, I understand how important unions are to ensure higher  wages, better benefits, and safer work environments for hardworking  Americans. Every worker across the country should have the opportunity  to organize and fight for a bigger paycheck, not just those that are  lucky enough to live in specific states or work in a certain industry.   The PRO Act gives workers the opportunity to hold fair union  elections while also preventing employers from interfering and stacking  the deck against workers. This bill also gives employees a fighting  chance when negotiating collective bargaining agreements with  employers. Loopholes that employers commonly use to exploit workers  would be closed off. And finally, the bill also holds employers  accountable by enacting meaningful penalties on employers that violate  the rights of workers.   Mr. Chair, it is time we restore the middle class and give workers a  fair shot when they fight for better pay and benefits. I urge all my  colleagues to support this legislation.
