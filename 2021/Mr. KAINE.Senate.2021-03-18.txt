 Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the  Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at George Mason University, OLLI  Mason, its 30th anniversary and on its continuing success in offering  educational programming for older Americans in Northern Virginia.  Programs like OLLI Mason provide lifelong learning opportunities for  seniors interested in maintaining an active intellectual life.   The Learning in Retirement Institute was founded in 1991 to establish  educational and social opportunities for a growing base of seniors in  Northern Virginia. The Institute soon became affiliated with George  Mason University as part of Mason's vision to extend its learning  mission in the community. The institute was generously endowed by the  Bernard Osher Foundation, a nonprofit that is dedicated to enhancing  quality of life in the United States through education and the arts.   What started two decades ago as a member-run Learning in Retirement  Center with 100 members operating and teaching out of one room in  Mason's Commerce II Building has burgeoned today into a robust, first- rate educational and social institute with 1,100 members.   OLLI Mason's mission is ``to offer its members learning opportunities  in a stimulating environment in which adults can share their talents,  experiences and skills, explore new interests, discover and develop  latent abilities, engage in intellectual and cultural pursuits, and  socialize with others of similar interests.'' OLLI Mason has fulfilled  this mission by offering retirees in Northern Virginia over 600 courses  from arts to zoology, religion to science, as well as excursions and  special events.   As the over 50 population across the Commonwealth continues to live  longer and healthier lives, I am pleased to recognize OLLI, George  Mason University, and the County of Fairfax for their initiative in  foreseeing decades ago the critical need to offer programs that meet  the needs, expand opportunities, and enhance the quality of life for  older Americans across Northern Virginia. I look forward to many more  years of their programming success.  [[Page S1643]]                                ____________________     Mr. President. In today's economy, ensuring access to a  variety of postsecondary programs has become even more critical in  light of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of the end of 2020, more than 10  million Americans were unemployed, and 3. 7 million of those  individuals have suffered permanent job loss. These workers will need  access to postsecondary education and training to reskill and reenter  the workforce. Notably, according to a poll conducted by Strada in June  of 2020, Americans strongly prefer nondegree and skills training  programs over degree programs as a way to access postsecondary  credentials during and post-pandemic.   However, when it comes to higher education, Federal policies are not  doing enough to support the demands of the changing labor market. Many  of the individuals who enter into skills and job training programs are  at the lowest end of the socioeconomic level, yet simply because their  goal is to enter the workforce rather than obtain a degree, they are  denied access Federal financial aid. The Federal Pell Grant Program-- needs-based grants for low-income and king students--can only be used  to offset the cost of programs that are over 600 clock hours or  [[Page S1649]]  at least 15 weeks in length. While many short-term programs provide  high-quality skills training that employers need and recognize, they  are not Pell-eligible.   Since the creation of the Pell grant, the profile of today's students  has evolved along with the types of postsecondary education and  training programs students look to enroll in. Today, 3 7 percent of all  postsecondary students are 25 years of age or older, 68 percent work  full-or-part-time while attending school and 26 percent have children  or dependents. While many of these students enroll in longer-term  degree programs, a significant number seek out shorter-term, workforce- oriented training programs that lead to in-demand jobs or stack to  longer-term education pathways. These short-term programs allow them to  advance their education and skills in a manner that works with their  life-situation of working and caring for children and other dependents.  Without such programs, many of these students cannot devote the four  plus years that many part-time students must spend to get an associates  degree, or six plus years to earn a four year degree. Our federal  higher education policy must be modernized to meet the needs of  students and employers. According to the Georgetown University Center  on Education and the Workforce, shorter-term educational investments  pay off--the average postsecondary certificate holder has 30 percent  higher lifetime earnings than individuals with only a high school  diploma.   Today, I am pleased to introduce with my colleague, Senator Portman,  the Jumpstart Our Businesses by Supporting Students or JOBS Act. The  JOBS Act would close extend Pell Grant eligibility to high-quality,  short-term job training programs offered at community colleges and  other public institutions, so workers can afford the instruction they  need to be successful in today's job market. Under the legislation,  Pell-eligible job training programs are defined as those providing at  least 150 clock hours of instruction time over a minimum of 8 weeks.  Eligible job training programs must also provide students with  licenses, certifications, or credentials that meet the hiring  requirements of multiple employers in the field for which the job  training is offered.   The JOBS Act also ensures that students enrolling in Pell-eligible  short-term programs are earning high-quality postsecondary credentials  by requiring that the credentials meet the standards of the Workforce  Innovation and Opportunity Act, are recognized by industry or sector  partnerships, and align with the skill needs of industries in States or  local economies. Job training programs under this Act must also be  evaluated by an accreditor and the State workforce board for quality  and outcomes. The Virginia Community College System has identified  approximately 50 programs that would benefit from the JOBS Act  including in the fields of manufacturing, maritime, architecture/ construction, energy, health care, information technology,  transportation, and business management and administration.   The JOBS Act is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that would help  workers and employers succeed in today's economy. As Congress works to  help Americans recover from pandemic job losses, I am hopeful that my  colleagues will join me in advocating for Pell Grants to be made  available to individuals enrolling in high-quality, short-term training  programs that lead to industry-recognized credentials and good paying  jobs.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN:   S. 873. A bill to establish the Climate Change Advisory Commission to  develop recommendations, frameworks, and guidelines for projects to  respond to the impacts of climate change, to issue Federal obligations,  the proceeds of which shall be used to fund projects that aid in  adaptation to climate change, and for other purposes; to the Committee  on Finance.
