 Madam President, today I rise in celebration of  Robert Joseph Nuelle's 95th birthday, who has and continues to live a  life defined by service.   Born on April 7, 1928, in Jennings, MO, to Eugene and Sophie Nuelle  alongside 11 siblings, Robert attended McBride High School in St.  Louis. Following World War II, he chose to serve his Nation and  enlisted in the U.S. Navy, the same path of his older brother Kenny.  Both served as SeaBees. While serving, Robert was stationed in  Pensacola, FL, and later served on a destroyer in the Korean war.   He played baseball for the Navy's team, and in a very unforgettable  moment, he had the opportunity to play with Major League Baseball Hall  of Famer Ted Williams. And following his honorable discharge from the  Navy, Robert played for the minor league affiliate of the Milwaukee  Braves and played semi-pro baseball for another team. While an accident  at work unfortunately ended his baseball playing career, Robert found  success in other arenas.   Robert worked at Telegraphic Services, later renamed to TSI Graphics,  a company that specialized in ``Lino-Type,'' which entailed printing  books using hot lead. While at TSI Graphics, Robert transformed the  company by expanding their business to major publishers in New York and  ensuring that the company operated as good corporate citizens. He  retired in 1993.   Following his retirement, Robert became heavily involved in  philanthropic efforts. He volunteered at Wings of Hope, a humanitarian  aviation organization, serving as the charity's chairman for their golf  tournament alongside helping in the charity's other efforts. Robert  also became involved with Friends of Kids with Cancer, where he still  volunteers to this day. He has been the chairman of their golf  tournament, delivered food to kids going through chemotherapy, and  aided in the charity's mission, which is to support children going  through cancer and their families. He still remains a cherished member  of their organization. Robert also volunteers at a food pantry every  Monday, undeterred by the pandemic.   Robert and his first wife, JoAnn, married in 1955 and moved to Creve  Coeur, MO. They had two children, Robert, Jr., and Mark. JoAnn passed  away in 2005 after 50 loving years of marriage. Robert was remarried to  Peggy Hummert in 2009. Outside of public service, Robert plays golf  every week, weather permitting, and enjoys spending time with his  children and grandchildren.   Robert truly embodies sacrifice and service. Having served proudly in  the military, spent his entire career at a single company, raised a  loving family, and dedicated his retirement to philanthropy, he is a  shining example of a great Missourian.                            ____________________
