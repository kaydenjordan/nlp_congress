 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  4760, Securing America's Future Act.   Mr. Speaker, our immigration system is broken. For decades,  administrations have offered temporary fixes or chosen to not enforce  certain provisions of the law. However, the election of President Trump  shows a clear desire by the American people to fix our broken  immigration system and secure our border.   The Securing America's Future Act addresses these issues and provides  needed solutions. The bill secures our border by authorizing a wall,  providing new border technology, and putting more boots on the ground.   The bill refocuses legal immigration on skills that are needed by  ending the visa lottery program and chain migration. It also prevents  future illegal immigration by mandating E-Verify for employers and  cracking down on sanctuary cities.   Important for my State of Kansas, this bill includes H-2C  agricultural visas which allows people to come work and provide the  skills our farmers need.   Finally, this bill gives stability to children brought here illegally  by providing a renewable legal status as long as recipients pay taxes  and obey the law, without providing a special path to citizenship  because no one should get to jump the line.
