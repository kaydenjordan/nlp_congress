 Mr. Speaker, this is not about one Member. This is about  who we are as a body and what we are as a democracy. This is about  whether it is acceptable to cheer on and encourage an insurrection  against our basic democratic processes. This is about whether it is  okay to demand Members swear in on a Bible of a religion they do not  practice. This is about whether it is okay to hold an assault rifle  next to Members' heads in a campaign ad and incite death threats  against them. This is about whether it is okay to encourage the murder  of the Speaker of the House.    As a survivor of civil conflict and civil war, I know political  violence and political rhetoric does not go away on its own. This is  about whether or not we will continue to be a peaceful and functioning  democracy.
