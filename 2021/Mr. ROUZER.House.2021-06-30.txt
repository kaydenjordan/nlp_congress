 Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today represents a missed  opportunity to produce good, strong bipartisan legislation focused on  the country's real infrastructure needs.   Instead, it is one focused on an agenda cloaked under the guise of  the term ``infrastructure.''    This bill is all about Green New Deal mandates. In fact, for every $2  spent, $1 of that goes to meet these mandates.   The bill rejects widely supported bipartisan projects streamlining  provisions that would save taxpayer dollars.   The bill creates 41 new programs and adds dozens of new eligibilities  to existing programs for progressive priorities, which means true  infrastructure needs are likely going to have access to fewer dollars.   The bill strips States of their ability to prioritize new roads and  bridges. And we all know States need more flexibility to meet their  infrastructure needs, not less.   Today's bill is also a missed opportunity to address our aging  wastewater infrastructure.   In the most recent Congress, we reached a bipartisan agreement on a  way to move forward on clean water infrastructure with realistic levels  of funding that address the needs of our rural communities. Well, not  this time.   Unfortunately, by choosing partisanship, the majority has chosen a  very rocky path that will make it unlikely any final infrastructure  package will be able to pass both Chambers and get to the President's  desk during this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, it didn't have to be this way.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  [[Page H3571]]  and I rise in opposition to the amendments en bloc.   These amendments en bloc would further expand upon the majority's  wish list of progressive priorities for water infrastructure, just like  the underlying bill.   These amendments create additional programs costing billions in  taxpayer dollars.   In addition, several of the amendments create additional burdens and  take discretionary, science-based regulatory decisionmaking out of the  hands of the experts.   Again, this bill is nothing more than a partisan exercise, and this  en bloc just throws together another bunch of bad ideas with little  opportunity for input or debate.   This group of Democrat amendments we are considering at the moment is  completely lopsided, and by considering them en bloc, they will not be  subjected to the scrutiny of standalone votes or debate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this en bloc amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), the ranking member of the Committee on  Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Gibbs).    Mr. Speaker, if I could inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Inquiry to the other side: Does the gentlewoman have  other speakers as well?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the debate today, and it  is a real shame that a surface reauthorization bill and a wastewater  reauthorization bill have to be partisan. They shouldn't be partisan.  We wanted a bipartisan process, but that is not what we got. And here  we are today. In fact, we probably could have avoided even en bloc  amendments had we had the opportunity to have a bipartisan process. But  that is not the path, unfortunately, that our friends in the majority  chose to take; and that, Mr. Speaker, is quite regretful. It is  regretful in a number of ways, but most regretful for the great  citizens of this country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to Lee amendment No.  132. This amendment would require that any applicant for wastewater  infrastructure funds undertake an assessment regarding the potential  impacts of climate change on the project and to adjust that project  accordingly.   Well, that sounds well and good, but this layers a new Federal  mandate on top of the multitude of Federal regulations that are already  being imposed on States, Tribes, and local governments in order to  maintain their wastewater infrastructure and serve their communities.   A one-size-fits-all regulation like this will create more process and  increase project costs, but not add any more protection for projects,  the environment or the climate.   States, Tribes, and local governments are already incorporating  resiliency into their infrastructure project planning and  implementation. This is not 1960.   For example, the State revolving loan fund programs already fund a  wide range of projects to add resiliency and climate change. That makes  this amendment unnecessarily redundant and an impediment for  communities looking to upgrade their wastewater infrastructure.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in my past career, I have served as a senior  staffer in the U.S. Senate, under George W. Bush during his  administration, as a member of the State legislature, and now as a  Member of Congress. It is interesting to me that--and I have never  quite understood this, but our friends on the other side of the aisle  seem to think that Washington knows best about everything.   Our local communities, our States, our local partners, they know what  they are doing. Let's give them the flexibility. Let's let them do what  they need to do for their communities.   Climate change is not a new notion. It has been around for a little  while. You have got a lot of States and a lot of folks in private  enterprise, in fact, that are incorporating changes, not at the request  of Washington, but because that is what they feel like they need to do.   We don't need a one-size-fits-all approach for any of this. In fact,  a lot of this could have been worked out, had we had a bipartisan open  process, but we didn't.   Mr. Speaker, that is regrettable. I encourage my colleagues to oppose  this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, again, we have had the opportunity here  tonight and before to have a very open bipartisan process. And that is  not what we have had, and that is quite regrettable. It is regrettable  from not only a standpoint of this institution, but it is regrettable  for the American people.   You know, all the proven successful surface reauthorization bills and  wastewater reauthorization bills, they went through a thorough  bipartisan process. That is not what we have had. Instead, we have just  had lip service.   When House Republicans held the majority, we led every successful  bipartisan effort in the last 30 years to reauthorize surface  transportation programs.   However, this time around, there has been little opportunity for  meaningful input from the minority, and this en bloc process just  continues down that same road.    Look no further than the number of Democrat amendments that we have  considered today, many of which have not been subjected to the scrutiny  of a standalone vote or debate. More than 100 Democrat amendments have  been approved by the Rules Committee, while less than 30 Republican  amendments have been made in order.   The majority argues they are moving this through regular order and  providing both sides with the opportunity to offer amendments. That is  not true.   Both sides should be appalled that this en bloc takes away from our  individual right to speak on these individual amendments and randomly  groups them with other items with zero input given to the amendments'  sponsor. It is all just a partisan move meant to further suppress the  minority's rights to fairly represent their constituents.   I think we can all agree that every Member deserves an opportunity to  be heard on these amendments.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote against this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, by direction of the House Republican  Conference, I send to the desk a privileged resolution and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 511         Resolved That the following named Member be, and hereby,       elected to the following standing committee of the House of       Representatives:        COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES: Mr. Sessions (to rank       immediately after Mr. Lucas).    The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
