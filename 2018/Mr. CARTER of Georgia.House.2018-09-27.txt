 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  September 25 as World Pharmacists Day 2018.   I am glad we have a day to recognize the pharmacy profession, which  plays a crucial role in keeping American people healthy.   Across our country, there are around 67,000 pharmacies that fill an  average of 12.2 million prescriptions every day.   Further, pharmacists are consistently ranked among the most trusted  healthcare providers, an important statistic because of the  responsibility the profession carries.   With the current opioid epidemic, pharmacists are possibly more  important than ever before because of their position on the frontlines  of patients' access to prescription drugs.   As the only pharmacist currently serving in Congress, I am glad to  see the growing number of young people entering the pharmacy  profession, working to make people healthier every day.   Thank you to all our pharmacists across the country.                            ____________________
