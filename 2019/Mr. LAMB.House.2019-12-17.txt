 Mr. Speaker, I echo the comments of my colleague from  Massachusetts, Mr. Moulton.   On December 9, the United States lost a great hero. Peter Frates once  crushed a home run into the bullpen at Fenway in Boston's Beanpot  Championship for his BC Eagles.   But Pete will be remembered for another reason: ALS would go on to  rob him of his physical gifts, but not his spiritual ones. Pete simply  refused to give up.   He helped launch the Ice Bucket Challenge, which raised more than  $220 million. These funds have already begun to change the world for  ALS patients. They helped find a new gene that may open pathways to  treatment.   It is said that, in the Bible, God breaks through to humanity 366  times to say, ``Do not be afraid,'' once for every day and once more in  case we just didn't get it.   In the Christmas season, we are reminded that God sent his most  precious gift to this planet for such a short time. We don't know why,  but we do know that he invites others to carry the message.   Pete was known for telling others, ``Do not be afraid to be great.''   I cannot think of better words to close out the year of our Lord 2019  or a better man for us all to honor.                            ____________________
