 Madam Speaker, the people  who, in fact, know the border issues the best--whether it is companies  or lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, border communities, trade  groups, economists, and law enforcement officials--all agree that  building a wall is unnecessary, impractical, ineffective, and it is a  complete waste of time and taxpayer money.   This wall, in fact, damages New Mexico's economy, and that is without  taking into account President Trump's idea to now impose a 20 percent  tax on Mexican imports to pay for it. In the end, we know that it is  American jobs, American consumers, and American companies that will be  hurt.   Given that the United States already maintains approximately 650  miles of border fence, drones, cameras, motion detectors, thermal  imaging sensors, ground sensors, and 21,370 Border Patrol agents, the  wall is completely unnecessary for the stakeholders who are, in fact,  most impacted. The only person it truly benefits is President Trump by  furthering his isolationist, divisive, and anti-immigrant agenda.   I agree that this country should be building, and I agree with my  colleague from El Paso, Mr. O'Rourke, that there is a wonderful thing,  an incredible thing about building bridges, building highways, building  buildings, and refocusing our energy on making sure that everyone has a  fair shot and that we are looking at those economic values and those  economic indicators. That is not what we are doing here. We are  diverting our attention for an unnecessary, huge, colossal mistake that  hurts the progress that border communities and border States have made.
