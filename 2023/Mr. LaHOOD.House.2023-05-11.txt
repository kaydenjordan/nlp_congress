 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, today, Republicans are following through on our promise  to the American people last fall in our commitment to a government that  is accountable.  [[Page H2284]]    I rise in strong support of H.R. 1163. This long-awaited bill is  needed to address the unprecedented levels of fraud in pandemic  unemployment programs.   Every dollar going to fraud is a dollar that did not go to those who  actually needed it. My home State of Illinois paid out nearly $2  billion in Federal funds for fraudulent unemployment claims, nearly  half of the money paid out by the State.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an audit by the State of  Illinois Department of Economic Security from June 2020.            STATE OF ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT SECURITY   Individual Nonshared Proprietary Fund, Financial Statements--For the                          Year Ended June 30, 2021  Performed as Special Assistant Auditors For the Auditor General, State                                of Illinois      Independent Auditor's Report on Internal Control Over Financial    Reporting and on Compliance and Other Matters Based on an Audit of   Financial Statements Performed in Accordance with Government Auditing                                 Standards       Hon. Frank J. Mautino      Auditor General, State of Illinois         As Special Assistant Auditors for the Auditor General, we       were engaged to audit, in accordance with the auditing       standards generally accepted in the United States of America       and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in       Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller       General of the United States, the financial statements of the       Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund (Trust Fund), an       individual nonshared proprietary fund of the State of       Illinois, Department of Employment Security (Department), as       of and for the year ended June 30, 2021, and the related       notes to the financial statements, which collectively       comprise the Trust Fund's basic financial statements, and       have issued our report thereon dated June 3, 2022. Our report       disclaims an opinion on such financial statements due to       material weaknesses in internal control over one of the       benefit payment systems, for which we were unable to obtain       sufficient appropriate audit evidence over related amounts.                  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting         In connection with our engagement to audit of the financial       statements, we considered the Department's internal control       over financial reporting (internal control) as a basis for       designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the       circumstances for the purpose of expressing our opinion on       the financial statements, but not for the purpose of       expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the       Department's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express       an opinion on the effectiveness of the Department's internal       control.        A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or       operation of a control does not allow management or       employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned       functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements       on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a       combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that       there is a reasonable possibility that a material       misstatement of the entity's financial statements will not be       prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis. A       significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of       deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a       material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by       those charged with governance.        Our consideration of internal control was for the limited       purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and       was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal       control that might be material weaknesses or significant       deficiencies and, therefore, material weaknesses or       significant deficiencies may exist that have not been       identified. We did identify certain deficiencies in internal       control, described in the accompanying Schedule of Findings       as items 2021-001 through 2021-003 that we consider to be       material weaknesses.                         Compliance and Other Matters         In connection with our engagement to audit the financial       statements of the Trust Fund, we performed tests of its       compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations,       contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with which       could have a direct and material effect on the financial       statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with       those provisions was not an objective of our audit and,       accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results       of our tests disclosed instances of noncompliance or other       matters that are required to be reported under Government       Auditing Standards and which are described in the       accompanying Schedule of Findings as items 2021-001 through       2021-003. Additionally, if the scope of our work had been       sufficient to enable us to express an opinion on the       financial statements of the Trust Fund, other instances of       noncompliance or other matters may have been identified and       reported herein.                    Department's Responses to the Findings         The Department's responses to the findings identified in       our engagement are described in the accompanying Schedule of       Findings. The Department's responses were not subjected to       the auditing procedures applied in the engagement to audit       the financial statements and, accordingly, we express no       opinion on the responses.                            Purpose of this Report         The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope       of our testing of internal control and compliance and the       results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the       effectiveness of the entity's internal control or on       compliance. This report is an integral part of an engagement       to perform an audit in accordance with Government Auditing       Standards in considering the entity's internal control and       compliance. Accordingly, this communication is not suitable       for any other purpose.               Current Findings--Government Auditing Standards   Finding 2021-001--Failure to Implement General Information Technology         Controls Over the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance System         The Department of Employment Security (Department) failed       to implement general Information Technology (IT) controls       over the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) System       (System).        In April 2020, the Department contracted with a service       provider to provide the System as a Software as a Service       (SaaS) and to provide hosting services for the System. The       service provider maintained full control over the system.        In order to determine if general IT controls were suitably       designed and operating effectively over the System, we       requested the Department provide a System and Organization       Control (SOC) report for the service provider. As was noted       in the prior audit, the Department could not provide a SOC       report, as the service provider's contract did not require       the service provider to undergo a SOC examination. Therefore,       we conducted testing of the general IT control of the System.      Change Control        As was noted in the prior audit, the service provider's       developers continued to have access to the production       environment. As a result, we were unable to determine if the       developers made unauthorized changes to the environment,       application, and data.      Security        The Department had not implemented internal controls over       the System's access.      Disaster Recovery        The Department had not implemented disaster recovery       controls.        The Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems       and Organizations (Special Publication 800-53, Fifth       Revision) published by the National Institute of Standards       and Technology (NIST), Maintenance and System and Service       Acquisition sections, require entities outsourcing their IT       environment or operations to obtain assurance over the       entities' internal controls related to the services provided.       Such assurance may be obtained via System and Organization       Control reports or independent reviews. In addition, the       Access Control section, sanctions the implementation of       internal controls over access. The Configuration Management       section also enforces logical restrictions with changes to       systems. Further, the Contingency Planning section makes       compulsory the development of a detailed disaster recovery       plan.        The Fiscal Control and Internal Auditing Act (30 ILCS 10/      3001) requires all State agencies to establish and maintain a       system, or systems, of internal fiscal and administrative       controls to provide assurance funds, property, and other       assets and resources are safeguarded against waste, loss,       unauthorized use and misappropriation and maintain       accountability over the State's resources.        The Department indicated the service provider's contract       did not require a SOC report to be provided. Additionally,       the Department indicated competing priorities resulted in the       other weaknesses.        As a result of the lack of general IT controls over the       System, we were unable to rely on the System and the proper       determination of claimant eligibility data and benefits paid.       Furthermore, as a result of the lack of internal controls       identified in this finding and finding 2021-002, we are       unable to obtain sufficient documentation to determine if the       Department's Fiscal Year 2021 financial statements are fairly       presented. Therefore, we are issuing a disclaimer of opinion       over the Department's Fiscal Year 2021 Unemployment       Compensation Trust Fund financial statements. (Finding Code       No. 2021-001, 2020-001)                                Recommendation         We recommend the Department ensure the service provider's       contract requires obtaining a SOC report or an independent       review. We also recommend the Department ensure the service       provider's developers' access is restricted and changes are       appropriate. Further, we recommend the Department develop and       implement security controls and disaster recovery controls.                             Department Response         IDES accepts the auditor's recommendation. In 2021, IDES       took action to address the points raised in the finding. The       improvements to the PUA system were implemented within a       timeframe that did not impact the entire 2021 audit period.       As recommended, a contract is in place requiring the PUA       system service provider to secure a SOC report for FY22. The       system access of the PUA service provider's developers has       been restricted  [[Page H2285]]       and accurately documented. In addition, documentation for PUA       system disaster recovery, as well as security controls, are       in place and have been reviewed and documented.    Finding 2021-002--Failure to Maintain Accurate and Complete Pandemic                   Unemployment Assistance Claimant Data         The Department of Employment Security (Department) failed       to maintain accurate and complete Pandemic Unemployment       Assistance (PUA) claimant data.        On March 27, 2020, the President of the United States       signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security       (CARES) Act which provided states the ability to provide       unemployment insurance to individuals affected by the       pandemic, including those who would not normally be eligible       for unemployment. Based on the Department's records, as of       June 30, 2021, 424,887 claimants had received benefits       totaling $8,168,499,998.        From June 2021 through January 2022, the Department       attempted to provide complete and accurate PUA claimant data       in order to determine if the claimants were properly       determined eligible. After several attempts and considerable       manipulation of the data to make the data more auditable and       organized, it was determined complete and accurate PUA       claimant data could not be provided. Therefore, we were       unable to conduct detailed testing to determine whether the       PUA claimants were entitled to benefits.        The Fiscal Control and Internal Auditing Act (30 ILCS 10/      3001) requires all State agencies to establish and maintain a       system, or systems, of internal fiscal and administrative       controls to provide assurance funds, property, and other       assets and resources are safeguarded against waste, loss,       unauthorized use and misappropriation and maintain       accountability over the State's resources.        Also, due to these conditions, we were unable to conclude       the PUA claimant data records were complete and accurate       under the Professional Standards promulgated by the American       Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AU-C 500.08 and       AT-C 205.35).        The Department indicated the PUA system limitations and       data entry errors resulted in the weaknesses.        Due to the inability to conduct detailed claimant testing,       we were unable to determine whether the Department's       financial statements accurately document the PUA benefits       paid during Fiscal Year 2021. Therefore, we are issuing a       disclaimer of opinion over the Department's Fiscal Year 2021       Unemployment Compensation Trust Fund financial statements.       (Finding Code No. 2021-002)                                Recommendation         We recommend the Department implement controls to ensure       the claimants' data is complete and accurate.                             Department Response         IDES accepts the auditor's recommendation. The department       continues to work with the PUA system service provider and       the Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT) staff to       refine the PUA database information and develop a reporting       structure that conforms with auditors' expectations. Errors       and anomalies within the PUA system have been identified and       are being addressed to ensure claimant data is complete and       reliable.       Finding 2021-003--Failure to Perform Timely Cash Reconciliations         The Department of Employment Security (Department) did not       prepare its year end bank reconciliations timely.        As part of our engagement, we requested the June 30, 2021       bank reconciliations. The reconciliations are between cash as       recorded in the Department's general ledger, and cash as       reported by the bank for each account. The Department did not       have the reconciliations prepared timely for audit fieldwork       and we received the final versions of the June 2021       reconciliations on December 23, 2021.        The timely reconciliation of cash accounts is a basic       control procedure that should occur every month to determine       the recorded amount of cash is accurate. Normally this       procedure is performed shortly after the end of the month       upon receipt of the bank statement. Most organizations have a       regular monthly accounting schedule whereby the monthly       general ledger cannot be closed without the preparation of       the cash reconciliation.        Concepts Statement No. 1 of the Governmental Accounting       Standards Board, Objectives of Financial Reporting (GASBCS 1,       paragraph 64), states, ``Financial reporting should be       reliable; that is, the information presented should be       verifiable and free from bias and should faithfully represent       what it purports to represent. To be reliable, financial       reporting needs to be comprehensive.'' The reconciliation of       cash accounts is a basic control to ensure the accuracy and       reliability of financial reports.        The Fiscal Control and Internal Auditing Act (30 ILCS 10/      3001) requires State agencies to establish and maintain a       system, or systems, of internal fiscal and administrative       controls to ensure State resources are used efficiently and       effectively. This includes the timely performance of bank       reconciliations.        Department management indicated the weaknesses were due to       turnover in personnel and the inability to quickly move       employees into this area to perform this function as       workloads increased significantly as a result of the new       CARES Act unemployment programs.        Since the Department has numerous cash transactions every       month, the risk of error due to misapplied cash transactions       is significant. Monthly there can be over $1 billion in cash       that flows through the Department's various cash accounts.       Monthly and annual financial statements could be materially       misstated due to the lack of timely bank reconciliations.       Failure to properly complete timely bank reconciliations       could also result in a misuse or misappropriation of cash       that could go undetected. (Finding Code No. 2021-003, 2020-      004)                                Recommendation         The Department should prepare a monthly reconciliation for       every cash account, reconciling the bank and general ledger       balances. Each monthly bank reconciliation should be timely       completed and reviewed and approved by a supervisor.                             Department Response         IDES accepts the auditor's recommendation. In 2021, IDES       contracted with a professional accounting firm to assist       department staff with the cash reconciliation work required       for seven programs, including the new federal programs such       as PUA and PEUC that were enacted in response to the       pandemic. In consultation with a professional accounting       firm, department procedures are undergoing review and       revision to ensure cash reconciliations for all programs are       completed on a timely basis.                         Prior Findings Not Repeated         A. Failure to Accurately Determine Claimants' Eligibility       for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance:        In the prior audit, the Department of Employment Security       (Department) failed to ensure Pandemic Unemployment       Assistance claimants met eligibility requirements.        In the current audit, the Department was unable to provide       complete and accurate claimant data. Therefore, we were       unable to conduct detailed testing as noted in Finding 2021-      002. We will review the Department's progress in the next       audit. (Finding Code No. 2020-002)        B. Inadequate Controls over Pandemic Unemployment       Assistance Program Processes:        During the prior audit, the Department did not implement       adequate controls over the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance       (PUA) program processes.        In the current audit, as noted in Finding 2021-002, the       Department was unable to provide complete and accurate       claimant data. Therefore, we were unable to conduct detailed       testing. We will review the Department's progress in the next       audit. (Finding Code No. 2020-003)        C. Inadequate Controls over Accruals:        During the prior audit, the Department did not have       sufficient internal control over the determination of       accruals for payments related to both the Unemployment       Insurance program (UI) and the Pandemic Unemployment       Assistance Program (PUA).        In the current audit, as noted in Finding 2021-002, the       Department was unable to provide complete and accurate       claimant data. Therefore, we were unable to conduct detailed       testing. We will review the Department's progress in the next       audit. (Finding Code No. 2020-005)        D. Inadequate Controls over Receivable Allowance:        During the prior audit, the Department did not have       sufficient internal control over the estimate of the       allowance for doubtful accounts recorded in its financial       statements.        In the current audit, as noted in Finding 2021-002, the       Department was unable to provide complete and accurate       claimant data. Therefore, we were unable to conduct detailed       testing. We will review the Department's progress in the next       audit. (Finding Code No. 2020-006, 2019-001)        E. Inadequate Controls over GenTax Access:        During the prior audit, the Department did not ensure       adequate security over the enterprise-wide tax system       (GenTax).        In the current audit, sample testing did not contain       significant errors that would affect the financial       statements. (Finding Code No. 2020-007, 2019-005, 2018-008)     Those fraudsters acted with intent and malice and  diverted critical relief for unemployed workers. Early on in the  pandemic, multiple red flags were raised by law enforcement agencies  about the threat of fraudsters using stolen identities to file false  unemployment claims.   The U.S. Secret Service raised the first alarm issuing an alert memo  in May 2020 warning of a well-organized Nigerian crime ring exploiting  the COVID-19 crisis to commit large-scale fraud against State  unemployment insurance programs.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record that memo from the U.S. Secret  Service.                                                       May 14, 2020.      From: United States Secret Service.        Massive Fraud Against State Unemployment Insurance Programs         The United States Secret Service has received reporting of       a well-organized Nigerian fraud ring exploiting the COVID-19       crisis to commit large-scale fraud against state unemployment       insurance programs. The primary state targeted so far is       Washington, while there is also evidence of attacks in North       Carolina, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Oklahoma, Wyoming and       Florida. It is  [[Page H2286]]       extremely likely every state is vulnerable to this scheme and       will be targeted if they have not been already.        In the state of Washington, individuals residing out-of-      state are receiving multiple ACH deposits from the State of       Washington Unemployment Benefit Program, all in different       individuals' names with no connection to the account holder.       A substantial amount of the fraudulent benefits submitted       have used PII from first responders, government personnel and       school employees. It is assumed the fraud ring behind this       possess a substantial PII database to submit the volume of       applications observed thus far.        This fraud network is believed to consist of hundreds, if       not thousands, of mules with potential losses in the hundreds       of millions of dollars. The banks targeted have been at all       levels including local banks, credit unions, and large       national banks.        Please communicate the information regarding this fraud to       the appropriate office at your local state level and liaison       with local financial institutions to identify mules and       potential seizures.     Mr. Speaker, the public needed to know what was happening  to these funds, yet not a single oversight hearing was held at the  time. Democrats turned a blind eye to the fraud and rejected Republican  efforts to stop it.   While considering the American Rescue Act in committee, Democrats  rejected Republican amendments that would have stopped the ``pay and  chase'' model of benefit delivery.   In September of 2022, Democrats voted against a resolution of inquiry  demanding communications showing the Department of Labor had knowledge  of unemployment insurance dollars flowing to international crime  syndicates.   Now, today, Republicans are taking action.   We will not turn our backs and walk away from the greatest theft of  taxpayer dollars in American history.   Currently, State workforce agencies have little incentive to pursue  costly investigations and prosecutions that do not pay out. This bill  here today, H.R. 1163, will jump-start efforts to recover what we can  by making the juice worth the squeeze for States still working through  a backlog of suspicious unemployment claims and appeals.   The number of individuals or entities facing UI fraud-related charges  has grown since March 2020 and will continue to increase as these cases  take time to develop.   Based on an analysis of the U.S. Department of Justice from January  13, 2023, Federal charges were pending against up to 240 individuals  for attempting to defraud pandemic UI programs.   States that take the initiative will be allowed to retain a portion  of the recovered funds to prevent future fraud by using the recovery  reward to improve program integrity, including hiring investigators to  go after criminals and modernizing State systems.    Mr. Speaker, this bill allows a State to retain 5 percent  of the recovered UI overpayments. This includes having commonsense  procedures in place, like preventing UI benefit payments from going to  incarcerated people and deceased people.   We have an opportunity today to gain some restitution for American  taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1163.
