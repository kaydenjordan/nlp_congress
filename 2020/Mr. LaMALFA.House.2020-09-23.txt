 Mr. Speaker, fire season continues to rage on in  California and in the West, and it continues to underline the need for  us to have active management of our forests, our wildlands, our  grasslands, everything to do with fire season and the increased fuel  loads that we are seeing.   We hear a lot of talk about climate change. Well, I keep coming back  to, If the climate is changing, what are we doing about it?   We can argue over whether it is manmade climate change or nature  caused, we are still allowing our forests, our grasslands, our  wildlands to be overloaded with fuel, and that puts our towns, people's  livelihoods in great danger and great peril.   I could list time after time the tragedies that we have seen in  northern California with people losing their homes, portions of small  towns, their livelihoods because we are not doing the job on our  Federal lands, and we are not telling the environment groups to back  off with their lawsuits that prevent the work from being done that so  desperately needs to be done.   We have to get cracking on this and get our job done here as Federal  representatives to help save our rural areas.                            ____________________
