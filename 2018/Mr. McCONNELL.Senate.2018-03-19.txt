 Mr. President, this is the start of another busy week  in the Senate. We have a lot to accomplish for the American people.   This week, we will take up an omnibus that builds on the bipartisan  funding agreement we reached back in February. It will provide our  Armed Forces with the stable funding they need to meet emerging  challenges.   Among other important matters, it will also strengthen our fight  against the scourge of opioid addiction--an issue the President has  already declared a public health emergency and is continuing to address  today up in New Hampshire.   We have several concrete opportunities to make America safer and more  secure. First, we will vote on the confirmation of Kevin McAleenan, the  President's nominee for Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border  Protection. Mr. McAleenan is a 16-year veteran of the CBP. He served  under administrations of both parties. His nomination carries the  unflinching support of a bipartisan group of leaders and was thoroughly  vetted in committee. Ensuring our national security means steady  control over what and who comes across our borders. I would urge  everyone to join me in voting to confirm him later today.   Later this week, the Senate will turn to another important matter  relating to America's safety and security. We will take up legislation  to combat the evil of sex trafficking. Keeping children safe from  exploitation has been a key focus for several of us going back some  years. In 1984, I advocated the passage of the Missing Children's  Assistance Act. In the 1990s, I was proud to introduce measures that  mandated centralized reporting for missing children's cases and created  a national database and screening system to identify abusers. In 2003,  I joined a number of colleagues as founding members of the Senate  Caucus on Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children. As recently as 2015,  the Senate passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. This  week, it is time to build on those achievements and take another step.   It is time to confront the reality that trafficking has largely moved  from the street corner to the smartphone. From 2010 to 2015, the  National Center for Missing & Exploited Children saw reports of  suspected child sex trafficking increase more than eightfold. Last year  alone, more than 8,500 cases were reported to the National Human  Trafficking Hotline. Part of the problem is a 1996 communications law  that is being misused to protect websites that knowingly facilitate sex  trafficking. The legislation before the Senate will reform that law and  ensure these institutions can be held accountable for facilitating  these heinous crimes. Senator Portman has worked long and hard on this  subject. He has helped assemble a broad, bipartisan coalition.   I would urge everyone to join me in voting to advance this  legislation later this afternoon.                                  Tax Reform    Mr. President, now, on one final matter, the good news about tax  reform keeps piling up. Here is one important headline from just a few  days ago. ``U.S. consumer confidence hits 14-year high.'' That is  right; tax reform is contributing to a dynamic, growing economy, and  Americans are taking notice.  [[Page S1774]]  In fact, according to the Wall Street Journal, ``Optimism improved  markedly for households in the bottom third of income distribution.''  Remember that the next time my friends across the aisle claim tax  reform is only helping the big guys. It is just a political talking  point.   In the real world, businesses large and small are thriving. In my  home State of Kentucky, Goodwood Brewing Company has crunched the  numbers and expects a tax reform savings of $30,000. They are planning  to use it to purchase new equipment and hire new employees. According  to the CEO, Ted Mitzlaff, tax reform is offering ``a significant  benefit--hardly crumbs.''   Last Wednesday, President Trump visited a Boeing manufacturing  facility in St. Louis to hear how tax reform is helping those  Americans. For Boeing's workers, tax reform means a new $300 million  investment in workforce development, training, philanthropy, and  workplace improvements, but the President didn't just hear from the  hometown crowd.   Bonnie Brazzeal works in the cafeteria at the College of the Ozarks-- that is in Southwest Missouri, more than 250 miles away from St. Louis.  Bonnie made the trip to tell President Trump: ``I work in the cafeteria  at [the] College of the Ozarks alongside the hard-working students and  I am grateful for the bonus. . . . I put mine in savings for my  retirement.'' Renee Crooker, also at the College of the Ozarks, said:  ``This bonus could not have come at a better time.'' Her daughter was  gravely ill but out of the country. Renee's tax reform bonus enabled  her to fly to her daughter's bedside. Brandon Pister is a supervisor at  Mid-Am Metal Forming. He received a tax bonus too. It helped him afford  the deductible when his 2-year-old son needed surgery.   These Americans' tax reform stories are amazing and so is the fact  that only one Senator from Missouri voted to help all this good news  happen. Their senior Senator joined Democrats in a party-line vote to  block tax reform and keep Washington's foot on the brake of our  economy. When Democratic leaders called these historic middle-class tax  cuts crumbs, the senior Senator from Missouri followed suit and called  them scraps.   I am proud that Republicans, including Missouri's junior Senator,  looked past this partisan rhetoric and stood up for the middle-class  families who deserve to keep more of their own money. Because we did,  Bonnie, Renee, Brandon, and millions more hard-working Americans are  already reaping the benefits.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that cloture on  the motion to proceed to H.R. 1865 be vitiated, and that at a time to  be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the  Democratic leader, on Wednesday, March 21, the Senate proceed to the  consideration of H.R. 1865; further, that the only amendments in order  be Wyden amendments Nos. 2212 and 2213; finally, that there be up to 4  hours of debate concurrently on the amendments, and that following the  use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote in relation to the  amendments in the order listed, with a 60-vote affirmative threshold  required for adoption of each amendment, the bill be read a third time,  and the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as amended, if amended,  with no further intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following  the resumption of the motion to proceed to H.R. 1865, on Tuesday, March  20, Senator Sanders, or his designee, be recognized to offer a motion  to discharge S.J. Res. 54; further, that there be up to 4 hours of  debate, equally divided between the opponents and the proponents of the  resolution, and that following the use or yielding back of that time  the Senate vote in relation to the motion to discharge.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the consideration of the following  nomination: Executive Calendar No. 471.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  vote on the nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  action; that no further motions be in order; and that any statements  relating to the nomination be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  H.R. 3731 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Grassley substitute amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to;  that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed;  and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  March 20; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed. I further ask that following  leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to  proceed to H.R. 1865. Finally, I ask that the Senate recess from 12:30  p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly conference meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:18 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, March 20, 2018, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
