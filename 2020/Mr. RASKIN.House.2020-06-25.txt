 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   In ``Leaves of Grass,'' Walt Whitman wrote that ``the United States  themselves are essentially the greatest poem.'' So each of our States  is like a stanza, a line in the remarkable and always unfinished  American poem, a lyrical whole far greater than the sum of its parts.   Four years ago, the more than 700,000 of our countrymen and women  living in Washington, D.C. exercised their rights and their powers  under the Ninth Amendment and the Tenth Amendment to vote to form a new  State and to petition us for admission to the Union. That vote carried  by a 6-1 margin.    Washingtonians ask us today to pierce the sound barrier of propaganda  in 2020 to hear once again, and to recall in our hearts, the poetry  that is America.   We began as 13 States, but Congress has exercised our powers under  Article IV, Section 3, 37 different times, to admit 37 new States, all  of them by simple legislative acts, none of them by constitutional  amendment. Each one was controversial in its own way:   They said Texas couldn't be admitted because it was a separate  republic; West Virginia used to be part of Virginia; Utah was too  Mormon; New Mexico was too Catholic; and, of course, everyone knew it  was unconstitutional to admit Hawaii and Alaska in 1959 because they  weren't contiguous.   Washingtonians do not ask us to convert the Federal district into a  State. They ask us, rather, to redraw the boundaries of the Federal  district, to shrink it to the White House, the Capitol, the Supreme  Court, and The Mall, to effectuate an exodus of the people from direct  Federal control, from the condition of being ruled in ``all cases  whatsoever'' by other people's elected representatives without equal  rights of self-government and representative participation.   If you have ever met any Washingtonians, you will know they are sick  and tired of being governed by other people's representatives. And who  wouldn't be?   That is how you get cheated out of $750 million in the CARES Act.   That is how your State militia gets turned against you with pepper  spray and tear gas and rubber bullets.   That is how the choices you make locally about reproductive freedom,  adoption, and public safety get trampled and rewritten by politicians  from other places who know nothing of the community whose decisions  they insist on controlling. This is called virtual representation, and  we fought a revolution to destroy that principle.                                time  1115    Those who are taxed, those who are governed, must be represented  directly in government by their own voting representatives.   Washington asks us to do something that is not only perfectly  constitutional, but time-honored. Congress has drawn and redrawn the  boundaries of the Federal District several times before. The passage of  the Organic Act in 1801 did not freeze the boundaries of the Federal  District, which by its own terms may be ``no more than 10 miles  square'' but has no minimum size set in the Constitution.   That is why Congress was able to redraw the Federal District in 1847  to shrink it and return Alexandria, Arlington, and Fairfax County to  the Commonwealth of Virginia.   It is true this was done to placate the slave masters who foresaw the  coming abolition of the slave traffic in the Federal city. That is what  Abraham Lincoln argued for.    Madam Speaker, if Congress can redraw the boundaries of  the Federal District to protect the property rights of a few hundred  slave masters in the 19th century, surely we can redraw the boundaries  of the Federal District to protect the democratic rights of hundreds of  thousands of Americans of all races and ethnicities living in the  Capital City in the 21st century.    Madam Speaker, the whole premise of civil government is  that we will be safer inside the social contract than outside of it,  the state of nature which Thomas Hobbes famously described as a state  of war, ``solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.''   So we give up the habits of violent self-help for trust in the rule  of law and the impartial administration of justice.   But where was the American social contract for George Floyd as  Officer Chauvin asphyxiated him with his knee as he begged for his  life; or Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT who was shot eight times in  her own bed by officers carrying a no-knock warrant; or Tamir Rice, a  12-year-old boy who had a water fight in the park, and then was shot  dead by a police officer getting out of his car?   The American social contract has always been contaminated by racism.  In the words of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott decision, our  Constitution began as a ``White man's compact'' in which the African  American had ``no rights the White man was bound to respect.''   The Civil War gave us the chance for a new birth of freedom, but  after 12 years of reconstruction, it was washed away by the KKK and Jim  Crow.    Madam Speaker, American apartheid lasted until the modern  civil rights movement, when the blood sacrifice of   John Lewis and  Medgar Evers, Schwerner, Chaney, and Goodman, and Dr. King gave us the  Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but we have  been brought back to the baseline of violent white supremacy by a  reactionary Supreme Court and a President who looks into the souls of  white supremacists and sees ``very fine people.''   This is the real deep state in America: violent white racism.   Black Lives Matter and America's young people have given us the  chance to launch a new birth of freedom, a third reconstruction in  America. Let's start today with the George Floyd Justice in Policing  Act.
