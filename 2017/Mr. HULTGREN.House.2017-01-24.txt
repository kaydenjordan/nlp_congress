 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming. I  am so grateful to be here to talk on this important subject.   Madam Speaker, Thomas Jefferson once said: ``The care of human life  and happiness, and not their destruction, is the first and only object  of good government.''   It is with Jefferson's words in mind that I rise today as an original  cosponsor in support of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and  Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act.   This legislation sustains Mr. Jefferson's vision of good government.  It makes permanent the Hyde amendment restricting Federal funding for  abortions and thereby ensuring the care of human life and not its  destruction. Most Americans oppose the use of their tax dollars to pay  for abortions.   Since 1976, the Hyde amendment has saved nearly 2 million unborn  children and continues to save more than 60,000 lives in the United  States every year. Americans also deserve to know--before they purchase  it--if their healthcare plans cover elective abortion.   H.R. 7 addresses the abortion secrecy clause in the Affordable Care  Act. It requires qualified plans to disclose to enrollees at the time  of enrollment whether a plan covers abortion. Americans should never be  forced to pay for someone's abortion. This legislation will restore the  status quo on government funding for elective abortions and make this  policy permanent and consistent across the Federal Government.   I commend Congressman Smith and Congressman Lipinski for their  bipartisan cooperation in introducing this bill, and I am pleased to  support it.    Madam Speaker, I want to give a sincere thank-you to  our distinguished chairman, Mr. Smith--the chairman of the Committee on  Science, Space, and Technology--for his work in this Congress and in  past Congresses in bringing this bipartisan package of legislation to  the floor.   I also thank my good friend and colleague Congressman Perlmutter from  Colorado, who has been just an active joint member in moving this  forward. I am so grateful for his efforts and his work.   Madam Speaker, the DOE Research and Innovation Act contains a number  of bipartisan provisions that put in place clear research and  development priorities so that Americans can maintain their leadership  position on the world stage and continue attracting the best and the  brightest to the only place they can do their work.   While I have the pleasure of representing Fermilab, our Nation's only  dedicated high energy physics laboratory, I have also had the  opportunity  [[Page H656]]  to visit with and to meet researchers from across the Nation who rely  on our national laboratory system to do their work. More than 30,000  researchers a year visit the DOE user facilities, such as the Advanced  Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory, just outside my district.  These facilities are normally operating 24/7, with researchers blocking  off time--sometimes just minutes--to use equipment that no one  university or business could build and maintain on its own. This is why  our national labs are truly the crown jewel in our research ecosystem.    The DOE Research and Innovation Act includes key provisions from my  prior legislation of improving technology transfer and helping get  research from the ``valley of death'' to a point at which the private  sector can pick it up and run with it. This legislation also frees up  the labs to be more nimble and work more easily with outside entities,  such as with nonprofits and universities.   Another provision in this legislation should, hopefully, be a key  priority for the incoming administration. Right now, China not only has  the fastest computer in the world, but the two fastest computers in the  world. Legislation which this body previously passed and is included in  this bill would call on the DOE to carry out a program to build an  exascale computer, which is close to the speed of the human brain. The  United States' computing capabilities have a wide-ranging use and  applications, and the DOE has led the way in developing this  technology.   One of the primary missions at the DOE is the maintenance of our  current nuclear stockpile. This is largely carried out through complex  simulations which require these increasingly powerful machines, but the  crosscutting benefits of this research may have the greatest impact.   When the NIH began its work on sequencing the human genome, it was  only a moonshot mission that many thought was not yet feasible.  Computing facilities at the DOE basically proved the concept and  allowed this work to be completed. In the era of precision medicine and  with the recent passage of the 21st Century Cures, our computing  facilities must be tapped to realize the benefits of targeted  treatments and cures.   Among other research priorities, this legislation also calls on the  DOE to resume its low dose radiation research program. This is  something I supported in the last Congress, working off recommendations  from the scientific community to fill the gaps in our knowledge of the  human health impacts from low dose radiation.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this important bill. I thank  the chairman and the ranking member for their bipartisan work to begin  this Congress by passing pro-growth, pro-science legislation.                                time  1600
