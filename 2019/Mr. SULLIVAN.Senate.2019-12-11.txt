 Mr. President, I want to thank my friend from the great  State of Montana, Senator Tester. This is actually a bill that he and I  have cosponsored out of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and it is a  companion bill that we are going to be bringing over from the House to  vote on here in a couple of minutes to hopefully get this on the  President's desk very soon to get him to sign it.   There is a lot of legislation that focuses on these kinds of issues:  How do we address this growing problem of suicide in our country?   The real tragedy is that all suicides are tragic, but there are very  high numbers of suicides that impact our veterans.   My State, the great State of Alaska, has more vets per capita than  any State in the country. We are proud of that patriotic fact. Sadly,  we also have some of the highest suicide rates in America.   So since I have come to this body, I have had the privilege to serve  my fellow Alaskans, and focusing on suicide has been a very, very  important issue for me. It is a very important issue for my  constituents, and it is a very important issue for America. As a matter  of fact, the first bill I cosponsored as a U.S. Senator was called the  Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act, which was named after a young marine  who had a number of deployments, and, unfortunately, when he was  seeking help, he couldn't really get it, and this young, brave hero  took his own life.   This should be a priority for the Senate. We have been prioritizing  the veterans and the members of the military who are in crisis when we  draft legislation that tries to address these challenges, but what we  are doing today is also important.   This bill actually focuses on the people who help our veterans. These  are suicide prevention coordinators. They are specially trained  employees at the VA medical centers who identify and connect high-risk  veterans with the care they need.   Across the Nation, these VA professionals conduct outreach, promote  [[Page S6967]]  awareness, and disseminate suicide prevention best practices. They are,  literally, on the frontlines.   But, as you can imagine, this isn't an easy job. This is a hard job,  and there are reports that many of these prevention coordinators  throughout the VA system are overworked and unable to keep up with  their many responsibilities. What we are focused on here is that we  want to make sure that the people who are helping our veterans are also  taken care of and adequately resourced so that they can do the best job  in terms of helping our veterans.   The VA must have a skilled and resourced workforce available, trained  to recognize the warning signs of a veteran in crisis, and then be able  to work with that veteran, hopefully successfully, to connect them with  lifesaving resources before it is too late.   That is what the Support for Suicide Prevention Coordinators Act  requires. That is what Senator Tester and I worked on together to bring  this out of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and, hopefully, if we get  that right, then, it has a positive impact on lessening this high rate  of suicide among our veterans.   Senator Tester mentioned what is in this, but it is not just  additional resources. It is also a comprehensive study by the GAO to  make sure that our coordinators are resourced and have a strategy to  make sure they can do their jobs most effectively to impact our  veterans.   It is an overall look at the VA system of preventing veteran suicide  with a focus on these frontline coordinators who do really, really  important work. They are not always recognized.   For those who are doing that work, I commend you, the Senate commends  you, and I think we are going to have an overwhelming vote here in a  couple minutes that will make sure of your ability to do this really,  really important job for our veterans and for our Nation and that you  are going to be able to do it better.   I applaud the leadership on both sides of the aisle for bringing this  bill to the floor, and I encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of  this legislation. Let's get it on the President's desk for his  signature soon, and we can take another step--another step--to make  sure that we are taking care of our veterans and are trying to address  this horribly tragic situation where far too many veterans in America  are taking their own lives.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Geoffrey  Clift, a Navy fellow in Senator Cruz's office, be granted floor  privileges for the remainder of the Congress.
