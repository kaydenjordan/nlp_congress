 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks before the vote.    Mr. President, I thank my esteemed friend and ranking  member of the Foreign Relations Committee for his kind words in support  of my amendment.   As we debate the Defense Authorization Act today, one of our most  pressing concerns is how we deter Iran from further escalating its  attacks. The decisions we make on this bill will have a direct bearing  on the options the President and the military have available to keep  our military, our citizens, and our friends and allies safe.   The Senate is poised to vote soon on my amendment, No. 861. It would  reaffirm what has long been American policy. Our military is authorized  to defend itself and to protect our citizens. Enacting this amendment  makes it clear to our military, as well as to any potential adversary,  that America does not shrink in the face of attack. This is not an  authorization to use military force against Iran or anyone else; it is  a statement of continued commitment to our national defense.   Under the Constitution, only Congress may declare war, but also under  the Constitution, the President can defend against attacks and can  respond in an appropriate manner to an attack that has been made.   As we all know, my esteemed colleague from New Mexico, Senator Udall,  has proposed an amendment on a related topic which I wish to briefly  address.   We do not need the Udall amendment to tell us what the Constitution  already demands--that Congress alone can declare war. His amendment is  clearly intended to limit the President in some other ways that he has  not yet explained to this body.   As it is written, the Udall amendment would dramatically limit the  existing authority that the Constitution provides to the President to  respond to Iran. It would prevent the President  [[Page S4599]]  from defending U.S. citizens, U.S. interests, and our allies. This is  not only my opinion; it is the carefully considered conclusion of the  U.S. Department of Defense.   In its letter on June 26 to Chairman Inhofe, it states this,  referring to the Udall amendment:         ``The Department strongly opposes this amendment . . . At a       time when Iran is engaging in escalating military provocation       . . . this amendment could embolden Iran to further       provocations.''    Tying the President's hands in some undefined way in the midst of the  current crisis is misguided, dangerous, and surely sends the wrong  message to both Iran and to our allies.   Last week, the Iranians continued their provocative escalation in the  Middle East. After weeks of buildup in which Iran attacked six  commercial ships, and its proxies bombed an oil pipeline and launched a  rocket into a commercial Saudi Arabian airport, Iran shot down an  American drone over international waters.   The Udall amendment raises serious questions about how the military  could respond to these attacks after the fact. Could we fire on the  missile launcher that downed our drone? Could we sink one of their  small, outboard motor vessels that attached the mines to the ships that  were attacked?   Imagine for a moment that in the future, another American aircraft,  perhaps one that is manned by an American pilot, were to be shot down  by an Iranian rocket. It is possible that the Udall amendment would  limit our military's options to subsequently respond to such an  outrage.   I don't pretend to know whether Iran will continue its pattern of  aggression, but I do know that when bad actors think they can escape  consequence for malevolent acts, such acts are more likely to occur in  the future.   I am glad that Senator Udall's revised amendment concedes the broad  point that our military has the inherent right of self-defense. But in  the case of a rocket hitting one of our planes, the President should  not have his hands tied in responding after such an attack in an  appropriate manner.   Note also that while the Udall amendment provides for the military to  defend itself from attack, it does not provide for the defense of our  citizens. Iran could take this as an invitation to attack Americans  abroad.   Further, it would prohibit our military from defending or responding  to an attack by Iran on our Iraqi partners so long as it didn't  directly hit American troops. Passing the Udall amendment would  effectively give a green light to Iranian forces to carry out attacks  in Iraq so long as they don't attack U.S. forces.   If Iran were to attack Israel, one of our NATO allies, the Udall  amendment would not allow the President to respond.   Finally, by carving out Iranian territory, the Udall amendment would  potentially prevent us from pursuing and taking out terrorists who seek  refuge in Iran.   I oppose the Udall amendment not because I want to go to war with  Iran or rush to respond without carefully evaluating our long-term  strategy to counter Iranian aggression. I know no one who wants to go  to war with Iran.   I fully concur with my many Senate colleagues who desire to reassert  the constitutional role of Congress in declaring war. But to engage in  this effort now, and in an undefined way, and then to attach that to  Iran when Iran has just shot down an American aircraft would send a  terrible message to the Ayatollahs and to the world.   I mean, think about it. Iran shoots down an American aircraft, and  what does the U.S. Senate rush to do? It rushes to vote in some  undefined way to restrict military consequence. That is simply  unthinkable.   My amendment is not about Iran. It does not even mention Iran. My  amendment is about affirming the constitutional authorities that any  President must have to properly protect and defend this Nation.   As the Department of Defense maintains, the President of the United  States must always have the option of responding to attacks by Iran or  anyone else at a time and place of our choosing--today and in the  future.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I will reassert the same thing I just  heard from the minority leader. I appreciate his words.   This amendment would reaffirm a basic principle. The United States  has the right to defend itself and our citizens when attacked. It  asserts what has always been a bedrock constitutional principle. This  is not an AUMF. It is not an authorization for the use of military  force.   Passing my amendment today would send a strong signal to our  adversaries that we will defend ourselves if our interests, our people,  our military, our allies are threatened and attacked.   My amendment is something that I believe everyone in this body can  and should support.    Will the Senator from New Mexico yield for a question?    Mr. President, I very much appreciate the perspective and  sincere thoughts and ideas coming from my good friend from New Mexico.   The Senator indicated that those who oppose this are trying to create  excuses for why we should ignore the Constitution.   I would note that in my remarks this morning I noted specifically  that this is not an authorization to use military force against Iran or  anyone else. It is a statement of continued commitment to our national  defense, and, precisely, it is saying that under the Constitution only  Congress may declare war. That is something I said specifically.   But the Senator goes on to note--he says that only the Congress-- specifically, his words are ``ignore the Constitution, open the door to  war with Iran without a vote.''   President Trump has said he was 10 minutes away from doing just that.  Is the Senator saying that if the President were to do what he was  contemplating, and that is to take out missile batteries with the  potential of the loss of life of as many of 150, but also it could be  with a prewarning, with no loss of life, but taking out missile  batteries that have fired upon an American aircraft--unmanned American  aircraft--if he were to have done that in response to their shooting  down an aircraft in international airspace, that constitutes going to  war and would have required a vote of Congress to authorize shooting  down or attacking missile batteries that have fired rockets at an  American airship?   I am referring to the Senator's comments precisely, and I will read  the entire point.   The Senator said: ``They are trying to create excuses for why we  should ignore the Constitution and open the door to war with Iran  without a vote.''   President Trump has said that he was 10 minutes away from doing just  that. So in the Senator's view, is responding in a very limited manner,  as he was contemplating, taking out missile batteries potentially-- would that have constituted going to war and required the vote of  Congress?   That is my question, because I believe that is not the case. I  believe the President has the constitutional authority and duty to  respond, if necessary, in an appropriate way to return fire on the very  batteries that have shot down an American aircraft.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
