 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the life of the  unborn and in support of pro-life legislation like the Heartbeat  Protection Act, a commonsense bill that would save an untold number of  unborn children. I encourage my colleagues to look at the evidence that  supports the pro-life movement.   I know that Scripture supports life. Jeremiah 1:5 tells us:         Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you. Before you       were born, I set you apart.    We also know that science supports life. Science now proves that  unborn children can feel pain starting at 15 weeks or earlier. With  enhanced ultrasound technology we see children in the womb moving and  kicking. With new technology, doctors can even detect the beating sound  of a child's heart.   Our Court supports life with the recent decision by the Court to  support Dobbs v. Jackson, which is a case that originated in the great  State of Mississippi, my home State, we now have a legal system that  has opened the door for a wave of pro-life support.   The American people also support life. Almost two out of every three  Americans support restrictions on abortion. Twenty-one States have  already implemented laws to protect the lives of unborn children. That  will now grow even further with nine more States considering their own  pro-life legislation in the coming months.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support Scripture, science, our  legal systems, our States, the American people, and the lives of our  unborn children by supporting the pro-life movement.
