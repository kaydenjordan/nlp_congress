 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this week the Judiciary Committee has been  considering the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy on  the Supreme Court left by the death of the late Justice Antonin Scalia.   I think it has been a remarkable opportunity for the country--indeed,  the world--to see not only somebody who is obviously very intelligent  but very articulate and very committed to the basic principles that  created this country, which were shaped in the framework of the  Constitution.   Sometimes people forget that judges aren't legislators and  legislators aren't judges and that we do have separate  responsibilities. Indeed, the separation of powers between the  President and the legislature and the judiciary is very important and  for a good reason.   Judge Gorsuch has done a tremendous job for the last 2 days handling  questions from both sides of the aisle with humility and with clarity.   I told him that I had hoped he would consider Chairman Grassley's  proposal that we have a camera in the Supreme Court courtroom.   Years ago, when I was on the Texas Supreme Court, we decided to have  a single camera--which nobody, really, frankly noticed--in order to  document and record the proceedings in the Supreme Court of Texas. It  didn't turn into a sideshow. It wasn't the O.J. Simpson trial. People  didn't misbehave because they were on camera. But it was a great  opportunity for people to see their government and their elected  officials in action.   Given the performance of Judge Gorsuch over the last couple of days  and the benefits that accrue to the country as a result of learning  more about his qualifications, his temperament, and his principles when  it comes to judging, I hope more people will want to see that. We could  all learn from it.   That would be good for our country, it would be good for the  judiciary, and I think it would be good for America's standing in the  world. We are in a vast minority of countries in the world when it  comes to having an independent judiciary, and that is essential to our  form of government and to who we are as Americans.   The country has learned a lot about Judge Gorsuch in the last few  days. His career has been marked by a dedication to the law. In his  decade on the bench interpreting the law, he has developed quite a  record. As a matter of fact, he said that he had decided to participate  in the decision of about 2,700 cases, and he has been reversed once. I  find that remarkable. It is really almost hard to believe. He is  clearly no extremist.   Some of our Democratic colleagues try to argue that he is not for the  little guy but, as he so ably points out, he is for whoever the facts  and the law say should win in a case. He doesn't view it as his role to  put his thumb on the scales of justice and to predetermine a case or  the outcome before the facts and the law have been applied. In short,  he is not a politician. It would be totally inappropriate for a judge,  given the fact that they are given lifetime tenure and they don't have  to stand for election in front of the people--it would be entirely  inappropriate for the judge to say: If I am confirmed, I will rule on  this contentious issue this way or that way. That is not what judges  do. That is what politicians do. That is why, when we stand for  election, we go out and campaign and we tell people: This is what I  believe in, and if you elect me, this is what I am going to do when I  am elected into office. That is entirely appropriate for members of the  legislative and executive branch because if the American people don't  like what we are doing, they can fire us in the next election or,  conversely and hopefully, if they like what we are doing, they will  return us to office.    So as the judge pointed out, he said that judges actually would make  ``rotten legislators,'' those are his words, not mine, because their  job isn't to write the laws, it is to interpret them. They don't stand  for election. They are not in intimate contact with the constituencies  we all represent. Importantly, as I said at the outset, he did affirm  his strong support of the separation of powers. Again, I think it is  really important for everyone to acknowledge the different roles  performed by different actors in our form of government. Legislators  play one role, executive officers, the Presidents, and Governors in our  State system play another role, and then the judiciary plays an  entirely different, important but limited, role in our government.   One of our colleagues was complaining about the judge's decision in a  case and that the so-called little guy lost in the case. Well, the  judge said,  [[Page S1916]]  while he didn't necessarily like the outcome, he felt bound by the  facts and the law that Congress had actually passed to render a  judgment as he did in that case. I pointed out, were it otherwise--were  the judge untethered to any sort of deference to precedent, that he  would basically be a loose cannon and making political decisions or  deciding what the outcome would be before he worked through the facts  and laws to determine what the appropriate outcomes should be. I  pointed out, and the judge confirmed, that if in interpreting a  statute, which the court did in that case, if Congress doesn't like the  outcome, then it is within Congress's power to change the law, to  change the statute which would mandate a different outcome in a future  case.   He pointed out, appropriately, that the role of the judiciary is for  neutral and independent judges to apply the law in the people's  disputes. So he is aware of the limits and the important role of the  judiciary in our form of government. He also made clear his judicial  philosophy is based on nothing more and nothing less than a faithful  interpretation of the text of our Constitution and laws. Now, sometimes  you hear people talking about, well, we have a living Constitution. To  me, that suggests there is something wrong with applying the text of  our existing Constitution, which was passed through constitutional  amendment or originally when the Constitution was ratified by the  States.   It kind of raises an interesting question. If a judge isn't bound by  the text of the Constitution or of a statute, what can he use? Does he  use his own value judgments? Does he use his own policy preferences?  Does he use his political agenda in order to do his or her job?  Obviously, I hope we would all agree that would be inappropriate.   Judge Gorsuch has also talked about the role of judicial courage,  meaning following the law and the facts wherever they may lead, even  though the judge, as a personal matter, may not agree with that or that  may not be his personal preference. I know it sounds hard for those of  us living in a political world, but actually judges do every day put  their personal policy preferences aside and decide cases on the facts  and the law. I believe it would be wrong of them and I believe a  violation of their oath of office for them to do otherwise. What  happens when there is a nominee like this who is so outstanding, so  articulate, and so principled? Some of our colleagues across the aisle  said: We are going to ask him some hypothetical questions. We are going  to smoke him out and see if he will take the bait and prejudge some of  these cases on controversial areas that will come before his Court or  some other court. The judge--and I would expect nothing less--said it  would compromise the independence of the judiciary and would be  unethical for him to prejudge the outcome of some future case that  might come before the Supreme Court. If you can imagine this, how would  you feel if in a case before a court, the judge had already made a  commitment to the outcome and you ended up on the short end of the  stick? You wouldn't feel that was justice at all. You wouldn't feel  that was fair at all. That is what the judge was doing in declining to  head down that path to prejudge cases. In doing so, he followed the  example of a number of previous nominees, people such as Justice  Ginsburg and Justice Kagan, both nominated by Democratic Presidents.  Knowing he can't answer, our colleagues have claimed they have no clue  how Judge Gorsuch would perform his job and have used that as a pretext  to oppose someone who is eminently qualified, but Judge Gorsuch has  given them all they need. They have all the information they need in  order to make an informed decision. He pledged to hear all sides of the  case, to look at the merits, based on the law in question, and then and  only then to come up with an unbiased and fair, impartial decision.    Can he do it? Well, the best evidence of ``can he do it'' is ``has he  done it'' and the answer to that is yes. He has a decade of time on the  bench, with hundreds of decisions, filled with millions of words, done  in exactly the way he said he would do, to decide cases, based on the  merits, in an unbiased and independent fashion.   So we have his record to judge him by, and his record is impeccable,  which is the reason some of the critics have to go down this path of  asking him hypothetical questions he can't ethically answer or  otherwise claiming to be in the dark about his qualifications,  temperament, and philosophy of judging.   It should come as no surprise that lawyers and academics and judges  all across the political spectrum have spoken out in favor of the  confirmation of Judge Gorsuch, agreeing that he is an independent  jurist, with integrity and the right temperament, intellect, and  experience to serve on the Supreme Court.   He was introduced to the committee by both of his home State  Senators, the junior Senator, a Republican, and the senior Senator, a  Democrat, who called Judge Gorsuch a man with ``a distinguished record  of public service'' and ``outstanding integrity and intellect.'' I  couldn't agree more.   Neal Katyal, a Solicitor General under President Obama, also spoke  glowingly of Judge Gorsuch and provided a strong endorsement of his  qualifications to serve on the bench. He was one of the first on the  other side of the aisle to urge the Senate confirmation of Judge  Gorsuch, citing his independence, his integrity, and his superb  qualifications. The bipartisan recognition of Judge Gorsuch's fitness  for this high office is nothing new because a decade ago, 10 years ago,  he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by voice vote, essentially  unanimously. Not one Member of the Senate opposed his confirmation, and  the truth is, nothing has really changed since then. So you would think  that if some of our colleagues across the aisle thought he was good  enough to be confirmed as a circuit judge to the Tenth Circuit Court of  Appeals, that they could have something they could point to if they  were inclined to vote no, something that happened within the  intervening 10 years, but I have to tell you, there is not much there  for them, if anything. In fact, his opinions have rarely elicited  dissent, and he has a rare record of reversal which I think is  remarkable.   In truth, he is a great jurist, and that is clear by the evolving  reasons coming from our friends on the other side of the aisle as to  why they had some concern. First, we heard some Senate Democrats would  fight a nominee who isn't in the mainstream. Well, Judge Gorsuch passed  that test with flying colors so they moved on. Next, they said they  would oppose him because of his refusal to answer questions about  issues that would come before the Court. As I said, not only do the  ethics rules prohibit him from doing that, but the tradition set by  Justices Ginsburg and Kagan rightfully dictated that he refuse to do so  during the hearing. Now we hear from our Democratic colleagues that his  vote must be delayed because of an ongoing FBI investigation that is  completely unrelated to him. I think that is just an indication of how  desperate they are to come up with a reason, any reason, to oppose this  judge's confirmation.   Watching Judge Gorsuch this week, it is clear our Democratic friends  are finding it hard to come up with a reason to oppose his nomination.  Indeed, they are struggling to do so, and they are desperate for an  excuse to oppose him, but they are not going to find a good excuse or a  good reason.   I hope our colleagues will help us confirm this good man, this good  judge for this office. I know our politics, when it comes to judicial  confirmation, have become very contentious, but it wasn't always that  way. Back when President Clinton was in office, before President Bush  43, judges were confirmed routinely by an up-or-down vote of the  majority of the U.S. Senate. Indeed, Justice Scalia, whose seat will be  filled by Judge Gorsuch, was confirmed overwhelmingly. I think it was  by 97 votes, if I am not mistaken. Justice Ginsberg, somebody from the  opposite end of the ideological spectrum, was confirmed with 96 votes  or thereabouts. So I hope it is a time we can get back to the  traditions of the past, which means not filibustering mainstream  nominees, as some of our colleagues across the aisle have threatened to  do even before the hearing began.   I would ask them this. If you can't vote for somebody like Judge  Gorsuch, you are not going to be able to vote for any nominee from a  Republican President because there simply isn't anybody better  qualified by virtue of his  [[Page S1917]]  experience, his education, his training, and his temperament for this  job. I hope they will reconsider.   I am happy to support his confirmation and urge all my colleagues to  do so as well. If they can't vote for his confirmation, at least allow  us to have an up-or-down vote, without setting the bar at 60 votes, but  making it a majority vote in the U.S. Senate, which has been the  tradition in this body for many, many, many years, excepting the last 8  years during the George W. Bush administration.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
