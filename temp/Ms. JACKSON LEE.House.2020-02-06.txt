 Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my Colleagues in support  of House Resolution 826, ``Expressing disapproval of the Trump  administration's harmful actions towards Medicaid.''   Great Presidents are made by landmark policy initiatives and programs  that bring a positive impact for the lives of the American people or  the world.   Trump has promised to introduce new proposals to protect those with  pre-existing conditions if the Affordable Care Act (ACA) bill is  replaced, but so far none of his administration's alternatives have  come close to providing the level of healthcare currently available.   The landmark bill, seen as one of the key pieces of legislation  signed by President Obama barred insurers from denying coverage, or  charging more, to those with a pre-existing condition.   Trump said during his State of the Union Address that he would  protect the rights of the insured with pre-existing conditions is not  true and the dishonesty of his statement is revealed by his  administration joining a lawsuit to take away this important  protection.   Through his actions Trump is doing all that he can to end the  protections for those with pre-existing conditions.   Trump's Justice Department joined a lawsuit that would end the  protections for pre-existing conditions.   In July of this year, Medicare and Medicaid will reach 55 years of  service to Americans from all walks of life.   On July 30, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson, another great  president, signed Medicare and Medicaid into law as part of the Social  Security Act.   This landmark legislation that truly represents Americans at our best  became a reality due to the tireless efforts of great leaders like  Teddy Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and Lyndon B. Johnson.   The signing of the law that established Medicare forged a promise  with American seniors that we must not allow Donald J. Trump to take  from them.   America's word matters and our promise to our seniors cannot be  allowed to be broken.   Both Medicare and Medicaid promise our nation's elderly and poor that  they could enjoy their lives with peace of mind and the security of  reliable, affordable, and high-quality healthcare.   Medicaid created a crucial partnership between the Government and the  governed to provide a basic health care safety net for some of the most  vulnerable Americans: children of adults with low incomes, persons with  disabilities and the poor.   Mr. Speaker, over half a century later, the legacy of these programs  has proven how powerful government action can be to the life and  wellbeing of our nation's most vulnerable.   Today, the Trump administration is trying to go back on this promise.   On January 30, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)  released its long-rumored guidance on Medicaid block grants.   This notice to state Medicaid directors invites states to restructure  their Medicaid programs in a radical manner previously rejected by  Congress, by capping federal funding at an artificially low level.  Millions of Americans will be denied health care because of this  draconian directive. Also persons who are disabled, children, and  seniors will be most impacted. We should vote no on cutting medicaid  and making Americans sicker.   Medicaid's financing is already based on federal matching of state  Medicaid costs.   The current program reimburses states as they spend money to pay for  Medicaid services, with the federal government paying for a portion of  state costs ranging from 50 percent to 90 percent, depending on the  nature of the cost and the state.   State fiscal flexibility is therefore built into Medicaid: States can  spend what is needed on Medicaid knowing that their match rate is fixed  in statute.   Today, 70 million Americans rely on Medicaid for health care, ranging  from preventive services, hospital visits, lab tests, to critical  medical supplies, and prescription drugs.   Before the Medicaid, funding poor families with children, pregnant  women, and low-income working Americans were not able to afford even  the most basic medical care they needed to remain healthy and  productive.   The most likely group to be block granted under HAO in the next  several months is therefore the Medicaid expansion population, composed  of adults who are under 138 percent of the federal poverty level and do  not otherwise qualify for Medicaid as disabled, as a very low-income  parent, or as a pregnant woman.   However, according to the guidance that CMS released, other groups of  Medicaid beneficiaries are also vulnerable to a federal approval of a  similar block grant if they are in any way optional for states to  cover.   The HAO guidance is a quid pro quo that proffers to states accept  financial risk in return for new flexibility.   But ``flexibility'' in this case is simply another route to cuts to  Medicaid that are not allowed under the Medicaid statute.   As detailed below, HAO allows states to make otherwise disallowed  cuts to Medicaid eligibility, benefits, and provider payment rates.   The underlying reason for changing eligibility is to reduce the  numbers of those covered.   In my home state of Texas and in communities across the U.S. Medicare  and Medicaid are vital programs that have significantly changed the  lives and improved health outcomes of many Americans over the past  century and represent the best American values where we believe Health  is a Human right not a commodity. Medicaid is also really needed when  communities face natural disasters like hurricane Harvey in Texas.   Unfortunately, Texas has the highest percentage of uninsured (27.6  percent) in the nation, 4 percent more than Louisiana the next state on  the list and has opted out of participating in Medicaid expansion.   The State of Texas' refusal to participate in the Medicaid expansion  created by the Affordable Care act has already put the poor residents  in my state in jeopardy, with this proposed change many more will be at  risk of losing health insurance.   In the 18th Congressional District there are 195,400 persons with  Medicaid.   Mr. Speaker, my constituents in the 18th Congressional District of  Texas favor access to universal health care, because they understand  the insecurity and feeling of helplessness of being uninsured or  underinsured.   I join my colleagues in support of H. Res. 826 because it sends a  clear message to this Administration and the American people that the  House of Representatives--the People's House will not tolerate harmful  changes to critical health care programs like Medicaid by this  Administration.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise with enthusiasm and support for  H.R. 2474, the PRO Act.   I would indicate that in America we would ask the question, When will  we have a 40-hour week or the weekend? All brought about by union  organizing and union leadership.   We need the PRO Act to ensure that Americans across the land have the  ability legally to organize and to be able to operate under the Labor  Management Reporting and Disclosure Act.   Let me also say that it is imperative that we begin to recognize that  the American people like unions. Over 64 percent of Americans and  millennials appreciate the idea of having representation for better  quality of life and work.   So I rise to add to this very important legislation an amendment that  extends whistleblower protections to employees of both employers and  unions under the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act. This is  a fair and balanced amendment. We remember Supreme Court decisions like  the Janus Act, and many others, who undermine the ability for unions to  be able to organize or to engage. This protects the people who are  trying to organize.   But the whistleblower protections allow employees of employers and  employees of unions to be protected if they see something wrong and  they want to make sure that it is right.   Let me give you an example:   Today, I met Kimberly Lawson, who is part of the Fight for $15. She  also came to share the problems she has had with sexual harassment on  the job. It happens to be in one of the fast-food operations. She said,  on the record, that if we could pass the PRO Act, she wouldn't be alone  trying to raise our hourly wage or face sexual harassment without a  union to help her.   This is important legislation. The whistleblower protection is  important because Ms. Lawson would have the ability to be able to  report what is happening to her without losing her job as a single  mother with a young child.   Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining?    Madam Chair, let me, first of all, thank the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), ranking member, for her  support.   Let me also thank the chairman of this committee for his leadership  and support, and the staff for working with my staff so very ably.   But let me add that, as I have seen, committee Democrats on this  particular committee strongly agree that allegations of corruption  should be fully investigated. They have not ignored it, and those who  are charged should be prosecuted and held accountable. They have not  ignored it. That is why we have robust criminal and civil penalties for  unions and companies.   This is about whistleblower protection, and I would say that no union  is against this. That is why this amendment particularly reinforces  that the employees of employers and employees of unions have the right  to bring to the attention anything that undermines  [[Page H912]]  their workplace or their quality of work.   I believe this is an amendment that all of us can support and that it  focuses on whistleblowers, and I ask my colleagues to support it.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time is  remaining for both sides?    Madam Chair, let me be very clear. It is an  important point to make that Democrats--the committee Democrats, in  particular--recognize that a few bad actors are not going to deter or  dissuade us from taking this historic step towards strengthening  workers' rights to organize and restoring balance to the economy.   As I said earlier, the growing support for unions is phenomenal.  Millions of Americans look for a better quality of life because unions  are negotiating on their behalf. If this particular employee at the  fast-food organization had a union, she would be able to organize and  ensure that she got $15 an hour, or to be able to make sure she had  better healthcare for her young 5-year-old.   Madam Chair, this is legislation that is long in coming. And my  amendment adds to the importance of it by protecting whistleblowers who  work for employers and work for unions. I also want to say that the  Government Accountability Project that protects whistleblowers is  supporting this legislation. I would ask that my colleagues support it  because we are standing up to corruption, but we are also standing up  for workers--workers who need opportunities and the ability to get a  better quality of life.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, do I have the right to close as the  proponent of the amendment?    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time is  remaining?    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from North  Carolina for us being able to come together around a very vital  amendment that gives protection to employees of employers and employees  of unions to be able to indicate when matters are wrong, incorrect, or  violate the law, or impact negatively on employees of any organization.   But what I would say is that it is important that this particular  legislation go forward because of the historic nature of ensuring the  ability to organize for willing individuals.   And let me cite Kimberly Lawson again. She is fighting for $15. A  union would help her provide for her family and organize for those  dollars. Maybe we don't know about those particular workers who are  living below the poverty line or living with wages that are below an  hourly wage or decent wage. Unions would help that.   We cannot talk about individuals already in the higher, upper brow of  work in this Nation. Their salaries may be going up. Hers is not.   Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to support and vote for the Jackson  Lee amendment and support the PRO Act.   Madam Chair, I would like to offer an amendment today that would  provide whistleblower protections to employees who report violations of  the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA). This  amendment covers BOTH employees of employers as well as employees of  labor unions.   The LMRDA is an important labor law passed in 1959 that protects  union members' through a ``bill of rights'' for members of labor  organizations, requires extensive reporting and  [[Page H913]]  public disclosure of labor union finances, guards against the failure  to observe high standards of responsibility and ethical conduct by  providing civil and criminal remedies against employers and unions who  engage in misconduct, and mandates transparency regarding arrangements  between employers and anti-labor consultants.   I am pleased that the PRO Act includes reforms to the LMRDA that  further clarify the original intent of the law by ensuring that  employers not only disclose arrangements they enter into with antiunion  consultants to directly persuade employees on how to exercise their  rights under the NLRA, but also to disclose arrangements where the  consultants are hired to engage in indirect persuasion activities.   Examples of indirect persuasion include planning employee meetings,  drafting speeches or presentations to employees, training employer  representatives, identifying employees for disciplinary action or  targeting, or drafting employer personnel policies.   The DOL has narrowly construed the law for too long and excludes up  to 75% of the arrangements with union busting consultants. To remedy  this, the PRO Act reinstates requirements of the Persuader Rule adopted  by the Obama Administration in 2016 but was unfortunately repealed by  the Trump Administration. That repeal, coupled with the Trump  Administration's refusal to defend the rule in court, ensures workers  remain in the dark about the activities of consultants hired to bust  union organizing drives.   Another way to strengthen the LMRDA is to provide whistleblower  protections; which is exactly what this amendment does. All workers  deserve whistleblower protections for reporting potential violations of  law, no matter their place of employment or the type of employer. This  amendment covers reporting alleged violations by an employee,  regardless of whether their employer is a business or a labor  organization.   This amendment allows employees to file complaints with the  Department of Labor and provides for a prompt investigation of  allegations of unlawful retaliation. It ensures employees have a right  to a hearing, and effective remedies including reinstatement, back pay  and attorney fees. And if the DOL fails to act in a timely manner,  employees have the right to bring suit in federal court to secure a  remedy. I urge all members to support this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I know that Senator Romney does not  need to have his words further edified, but there is something about  courage and something about his words that struck my heart.   So if I might, in the remarks that Senator Romney made yesterday in  his decision to cast a vote for article I, he said, briefly: The  Constitution is at the foundation of our Nation. We each take an oath  to defend it. Paraphrasing, he said: We arrived at different judgments,  and he hoped that we would respect each other's good faith. Senator  jurors swore an oath before God.   He said: ``I am profoundly religious. My faith is at the heart of who  I am.'' And he knew his decision would be hard.   I thought we lived in a nation that respected the heartfelt decisions  and deliberation that Members have to make. But after his decision and  vote there was an onslaught of ugly and nasty comments, individuals  calling him weak, #ExpellMitt.   I want to live in a nation that is better than that, that when we  have to make hard decisions, we will be respected by all of America.   We all love the Constitution. I want to thank Senator Romney for his  profile in courage. There needs to be more of that. He voted the right  way. We all did who voted ``aye'' on article I and article II.                            ____________________
