 Mr. Speaker, is Donald Trump running a Cabinet or a  country club?   Because every day it is getting harder to tell. Not only is the  President spending vast sums to ferry himself to and from his various  golf courses, but now it turns out that top leaders in his  administration have developed a special fondness for traveling by  private jet.   The Treasury Secretary used a taxpayer-funded plane to hop down to  Fort Knox to see the eclipse, for example, and he has also asked to use  one for his honeymoon in Europe.   Trump's EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, spent another $58,000 on  private jets. But the worst offender is HHS Secretary Price, who, in  his brief time in office, has already chalked up an astonishing 400  grand in flights on private aircraft. He flew down to Tennessee for all  of 6 hours, much of which was spent having lunch with his son. That is  nice. He also jetted off to an island off the coast of Georgia for a  trip that apparently featured far more recreation than government  business. Clearly, when it comes to travel on the taxpayers' dime, the  price does not matter to Tom Price. Ethics and personal responsibility  doesn't matter to Tom Price. Doing what is right doesn't matter to Tom  Price, and that is why he needs to resign immediately.                                time  1245    Now, don't take my word for it. Here is what President George W.  Bush's top ethics official, Richard Painter, said about Price's travel  habits: ``To use a charter flight on something that combines personal  and government business, I think, is highly unprofessional and really  inappropriate.'' Those are strong words.   But, Mr. Speaker, you know who summed up best how terrible it is for  someone to use private jets? Tom Price, himself. Let's see what Tom  Price said. In 2009, he described government officials taking private  planes as ``just another example of fiscal irresponsibility run amok.''  I couldn't agree more, Mr. Speaker.   Price spent nearly $25,000 to fly from D.C. to Philadelphia and back  for one single day. He could have spent, at last minute, $725 to get  there on United Airlines, or $133 to get there on Amtrak.  [[Page H7622]]    Mr. Speaker, I just checked, on my phone, that an Uber to Philly  right now, back and forth, would have cost Mr. Price about $450 round  trip. That means that, for the price of his private jet, he could have  ordered individual cars for himself and his 54 staff members. Every  American who works and pays taxes should find this totally appalling.   Amtrak was good enough for the Vice President of the United States,  Joe Biden, but, somehow, it is beneath the Treasury Secretary and HHS  Secretary to ride the train. Riding the train is apparently even  beneath the EPA Administrator.   Here is a good rule of thumb, Mr. Speaker: If you are spending more  on private jets than most American families make in 1 year, you are  spending too much on private jets.   Tom Price has plenty of time to go jetting around the country, but  not enough time, for example, to ensure that millions of kids won't  lose their coverage when CHIP expires soon.   There is apparently plenty of money at HHS for private jets, but very  little to help people sign up for health insurance. That is completely  unacceptable.   Secretary Price says he needs to fly around on his jet to connect  with ordinary citizens. I am not kidding. His press secretary told  reporters that these outrageous junkets were about ``getting outside of  D.C., making sure he is connected with the real American people.''   Mr. Speaker, here is how you really connect with your fellow  Americans: don't take a private plane; fly a middle seat in coach.   Of course, we should have seen this coming. News reports earlier this  year revealed that, when he was a Member of Congress, Price was guilty  of introducing legislation to benefit his own personal investments.  Even more egregious, he traded more than $300,000 in healthcare  industry stocks based on insider information.   There is no question Secretary Price needs to resign right now, and,  if he doesn't, President Trump needs to fire him.   Donald Trump claims that he loves firing people. He once said: I love  doing it if someone really, really, really deserves it.   Mr. Speaker, Secretary Price really, really, really deserves it.   Then again, we all know Trump won't actually do anything. We are all  familiar with the Trump way of doing business with its bad deals and  bankruptcies.   Here's the Trump way of doing government.   Number one, hire people proven to be corrupt.   Number two, create an environment in which corruption and bad  behavior are encouraged.   Number three, do absolutely nothing when the corruption and bad  behavior is exposed.   This administration talks about putting America first. This  administration talks about draining the swamp, but its Cabinet  officials are more interested in traveling first class.   This administration talks about making America great again, but they  are really only concerned about never ever having to wait at another  airport gate again.   This administration talks about fighting for working families, but  its top leaders are only concerned about lining their own pockets with  taxpayers' hard-earned money.   I am fed up, and so are the American people. Let's bring back  government to the people, for the people, instead of government for the  powerful friends of Donald Trump.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from California (Mr. Ted Lieu).   Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman  Gallego for that terrific presentation. We are also joined today by  Congressman Raskin, who will be part of our dialogue as well.   Today is Thursday. That means we all need to ask: Why does Jared  Kushner still have a security clearance? He already submitted two false  ones. But I digress. We are actually going to talk about three other  problems in the White House, one of which is Secretary Price.   To my left is a picture of the private jet that Secretary Price flew  on at taxpayers' expense. But in addition to Secretary Price, we also  have Secretary Mnuchin, who flew on a government jet with his wife to  Kentucky in order to watch the eclipse. Now, I get that was a pretty  cool thing to do, but you shouldn't be using taxpayer funds to do that.   And then we have got EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, which, according  to media reports, spent $58,000 on noncommercial flights to go to  different places. With $58,000, you can do a lot with that. VoteVets  put out a release today saying that with $58,000 you could hire a VA  spinal cord specialist at the Syracuse VA, a nurse for 1 year. Then  Secretary Price spent over $400,000 of your money, and that is a lot of  spinal cord specialists.   So we are talking about raiding the public funds and raiding the  public trust. That is why I have introduced the SWAMP FLYERS Act, and  what this act will do is stop this from happening in the future. It  will prohibit senior Cabinet officials from using noncommercial  flights, unless they certify, under penalty of perjury, that no  commercial flights were available.   So in this case, you had Secretary Price, for example, flying from  here to Nashville. I guarantee you there were lots of commercial  flights. There was no reason he had to take a noncommercial flight.    In addition to what we are seeing with these three Cabinet officials,  we do have sort of this culture of corruption that really needs to stop  because this flows from the top. With the President, what we have now  is the President staying at all these properties, private properties  that are his or owned by his family, and then he comes with this  massive entourage of Secret Service and other folks, and they are  paying money to these properties to stay there, to eat there, and all  of that money flows back to the Trump organization. So the President is  enriching himself and his family at taxpayers' expense. It is no wonder  that we have got these three Cabinet officials doing these insane  things with taxpayers' funds.   Now we have got a Republican Congress unwilling to do oversight on  this. You have got Speaker Ryan recently going on TV saying that he  thinks that the present administration is doing great. Well, you can't  have this kind of taxpayer waste when you have got the public trust at  issue.   We also have responses from these departments that are deeply  troubling. So the Treasury Department, in response to what Secretary  Mnuchin was doing, in addition to his noncommercial travel to Kentucky  to watch the eclipse, he also asked if the Air Force could fly him and  his wife on their honeymoon. The answer is no, you can't do that.   Now the response from the Department was, well, he needed to have  secure communications. Well, that was the wrong response. I can  guarantee you there are other ways of getting secure communications  other than to have the Air Force fly you around on your honeymoon.   With Secretary Price, again, the Department gave the wrong response.  They said, well, Secretary Price needs to go around meeting Americans,  and he shouldn't be waiting 4 hours at the airport. Wrong response.  Yes, he should be waiting 4 hours at the airport because that is what  other Americans do. And I can guarantee you no American flies for  $25,000 to meet other Americans. Again, the wrong response from that  Department.   What we need is to have these three Cabinet officials apologize. I  joined with Ruben Gallego, as well as Jamie Raskin and other Members  yesterday in a letter to ask for Price to resign, and all of us are  also coauthors of the SWAMP FLYERS Act.   What we need now is really for the public to get engaged because what  we are seeing is fraud, waste, and abuse with multiple members of the  Trump Cabinet.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the good gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the good gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the good gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the good gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the good gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the good gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the good gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the good gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 32 minutes remaining.    Representative Lieu, how often do you fly back, and  where do you fly back to?   Mr. TED LIEU of California. I fly about three times a month, and I  generally fly from Dulles back to LAX in my district, and I fly  commercial.    How long is your flight?   Mr. TED LIEU of California. It is about 5 hours to 5\1/2\ hours,  depending on the wind.    You and I have been Members of Congress since 2015. At  any point in any of your flights to and from your work--I am sorry-- from here to your home, have you ever used a charter plane?   Mr. TED LIEU of California. No.    Would you even be able to, by law, use a charter plane  according to the funds we are allowed to expense?   Mr. TED LIEU of California. No. If I did that, I would be the subject  of an immediate congressional ethics investigation.    So what makes Mr. Price think that he is somehow above  the law, that he is allowed to do this, considering that he knew, as a  Member of Congress, that was not allowed and that somehow he can just  take advantage of the situation now that he has suddenly moved up after  only just a few months of being in Congress, to be the Secretary of  Health and Human Services?   Mr. TED LIEU of California. That is a great point because what  Secretary Price, and Mnuchin, and EPA Administrator Pruitt did was not  only disrespectful to taxpayers, there were violations of the Federal  regulations. So I am just going to read to you what the Federal  regulation says. It says, ``Your agency must select the method most  advantageous to the government,'' when considering travel.   Advantageous to the government, not to Secretary Price, or Mnuchin,  or EPA Administrator Pruitt. They violated that Federal regulation  straight up. That is why Tom Price is under Federal investigation. That  is why the IG is investigating Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, and now we  call on an investigation of EPA Administrator Pruitt as well for  violating the Federal regulations.    While you were talking about that actual regulation, and  to see how well and easy it is not to violate the regulation, I  literally just typed into Google, ``flights to Philadelphia.'' And  there is a flight leaving in 46 minutes. And the cheapest I found right  now--well, no, I found one for $441. I found another one for $447. If  you want to connect to Philadelphia--which I don't know why you would-- but if you want to do that, JetBlue will take you there for $264.   So in Secretary Price's effort to live an extravagant lifestyle and  basically void himself of all commonsense, he also violated ethics  violations. And this is something that we consistently see within this  Trump administration.   On the other flip of that, we consistently see a Republican-led  Congress that is not doing their duty by the Constitution of oversight  on the executive. Not one, not one movement has been done by any  Republican, especially Republican leadership, to push back on this  egregious waste of taxpayer money.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to Representative Lieu.   Mr. TED LIEU of California. Let me again conclude by thanking  Congressman Gallego and Congressman Raskin for highlighting this issue  with me today. This really is an issue about the public trust. Taxpayer  funds should not be used for luxury private jet travel. It is a very  simple issue.   Please join us in supporting the SWAMP FLYERS Act. Please join  Congressman Gallego and us in calling for the resignation of Secretary  Price.   As Abraham Lincoln said: ``Public sentiment is everything. With  public sentiment, nothing can fail. Without it, nothing can succeed.''   Help us change public sentiment and help us tell the Trump  administration: Please stop using taxpayer funds for luxury jet travel.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Gallagher). The Chair would remind  Members to direct all remarks to the Chair and to formally yield and  reclaim time when under recognition.                            ____________________
