 Christopher A. Coons. Thank you, Mr. Charles E. Schumer.    Madam President, today has been great day for the American  people, a great day for our democracy and for bipartisanship. Some of  you may know that just hours ago, over at the White House, a determined  group of Republicans and Democrats, led by Senator Kyrsten Sinema,  Senator Rob Portman, Senator Joe Manchin, Senator Susan Collins, and a  number of others, announced a deal on an infrastructure package with  the White House that represents the largest investment in  infrastructure in a generation.   This is a big accomplishment that I will talk about in a few moments,  but I also want to bring attention to something that happened earlier  today on the floor here that may just go overlooked because of the  other important news of the day.   By a vote of 92 to 8, this Senate passed the Growing Climate  Solutions Act, introduced by my friend and colleague from Michigan  Senator Debbie Stabenow, the chair of the Agriculture Committee, and my  friend and colleague from Indiana Senator Mike Braun, who is my cochair  of the Climate Solutions Caucus.   This bill, the Growing Climate Solutions Act, is a great example of  how we can bring everyone to the table to find common ground on  solutions that will protect our environment, help create jobs, and  combat climate change.   It will help farmers and foresters in Delaware, in Michigan, in  Texas, across our whole country, and we will benefit from changes in  the way that they care for their land or forests, and it will help them  to participate in carbon credit markets. It will provide a framework  for rewarding America's farms and forests, and those who tend them, for  climate-smart practices.   This is a commonsense, broadly bipartisan bill that will help us  create a more sustainable future for our communities, our country, and  our planet, with our farmers and our agriculture community taking the  lead.   It reminds me of another signature moment that happened just at the  very end of last year when, in December, the bipartisan Energy Act of  2020 was passed. Senators Murkowski and Manchin shepherded that into  law late last year, and it modernizes our country's energy policies  across a dozen different major areas.   Each of these bills--the Growing Climate Solutions Act and the Energy  Act of 2020--were, in part, fostered by the bipartisan Senate Climate  Solutions Caucus. Founded in 2019, this caucus has held more than 30  events and meetings, including many focused on natural climate  solutions such as the Growing Climate Solutions Act.   Every Member, all 14 Members, of this bipartisan caucus cosponsored  the Growing Climate Solutions Act, and I applaud Senators Stabenow and  Braun for building a significant coalition here in the Senate to  support it, a coalition that ranged from some of the most engaged and  active environmental groups to the American Farm Bureau, one of the  strongest voices for America's agricultural community.   Our work on climate is far from done. Members of the Climate  Solutions Caucus have introduced a whole series of bipartisan bills  that would promote natural climate solutions. Senator Portman and I  have the Tropical Forest and Coral Reef Conservation Reauthorization  Act; Senator Shaheen is leading the Forest Incentives Program Act;  Senator Rubio, the Restoring Resilient Reefs Act; and many more.   We should advance these and many other bipartisan bills that every  Member of our caucus supports and on which we are taking the lead. Let  me be clear. I support bold action on climate. I support President  Biden's climate agenda. And there are many more things we can and  should do, but I think it is possible for us to both move ahead on  those things that have enduring bipartisan support in this Chamber and  across the country and to move ahead on those things that perhaps do  not yet enjoy bipartisan support but where the need to act is urgent.                            ____________________     Madam President, let me also, if I can, speak for a few  more moments about the historic deal reached earlier today on  infrastructure.   This is about creating jobs. This is about investing in our economy  and our communities and our country, and this is about strengthening  the United States globally against our adversaries and competitors.   I need not remind you that just 1 year ago public health and economic  crises created by the COVID-19 pandemic were ravaging communities all  over our Nation. And today, under the leadership of the Biden  administration, COVID-19 cases and deaths are down by over 90 percent.  More than 70 percent of adults over the age of 30 have been vaccinated.  As a result, businesses are opening, communities are opening, States  are opening, our unemployment rate has come down significantly, and our  economy is recovering at a robust pace.   But if our economy is going to be sustainable, if it is going to be  long term, if it is going to be robust, we have to make long-overdue  investments in infrastructure. Globally, the United States now ranks  13th in infrastructure. In every State, we have roads, bridges,  tunnels, and water systems that are crumbling or aged. Just in my  little State of Delaware, we have more than 200 miles of highway deemed  in poor condition.   And as the climate continues to change, low-lying States like mine  are particularly susceptible to increased damage. We had more than 10  extreme weather events causing up to $2 billion of damage in the last  decade, and a lot of that damaged our infrastructure because it is  built right up against the waterways, the coasts, the bays.   We have one of the most important rail lines in the entire country,  the  [[Page S4750]]  Northeast corridor, that runs right through Wilmington, DE. One day  without service on this Northeast corridor costs our economy $100  million. And that day isn't hypothetical; it happened during Superstorm  Sandy, the hurricane that pummeled the east coast a few years ago.    Across our State and every State, infrastructure is in dire need of  repair, of resiliency, and of upgrade, and doing that can help create  jobs and strengthen our country.   We are losing our competitive edge, and our global competitors, like  China, are outpacing us. That is why I was so encouraged to see the  bipartisan U.S. Innovation and Competition Act pass this body just a  few weeks ago. A key piece of it was the bipartisan CHIPS Act that  recognizes we need to invest in cutting-edge R&D, in semiconductors,  and in the industries of the future.   But we can't move people, capital, products, and ideas if we don't  invest in our infrastructure--in the broadband, the highways, the  ports, and the roads that make us competitive globally.   The $559 billion in new Federal spending on infrastructure that is  the core of the deal announced today is a downpayment on rebuilding our  roads and bridges, fixing our lines of public transit, and expanding  port and airport capacity. It also includes $47 billion toward climate  resiliency, critically needed work to make sure that our infrastructure  can sustain the growing storms all across our country.   I think this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to put America on  the right track and exactly at a moment when the leaders of China and  Russia are telling the world that American democracy can't work; that  the riot that occurred in this building on January 6 is foreshadowing  the collapse, the failure of American democracy. It is important for us  to show our citizens here at home and our competitors abroad that  American democracy still works and that we can deliver meaningful  solutions for our States, for our country, and for the world.   There is a lot more for us to accomplish on President Biden's  agenda--the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan--and we  will have to move that forward, but I think this is a day for us to  celebrate legislating together and finding a pathway to the House and  to the President's desk for the biggest investment in infrastructure of  my lifetime.   This is a great day for this institution and our country.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today in this Chamber to pay  tribute to a dedicated Delawarean, a friend who is wrapping up 36 years  of public service to our State and our Nation.   Lynne Terry Phifer of Newark, DE, a valued member of my Senate staff,  is retiring at the end of this month. She has been a high-spirited,  pure-hearted presence for us as long as I have known her, and I am  deeply grateful to Lynne for her service and grateful for her  significant contributions.   Before I say farewell, though, it is only fitting to highlight her  long career and offer up some thanks and some thoughts from her  friends, family, coworkers, and well-wishers.   Her story didn't start and doesn't end with her more than 8 years  serving in my offices for the Senate and for Wilmington, DE. She grew  up in a community along the banks of Naamans Creek, where it empties  into the Delaware River. It is known as Claymont, DE, an area that has  become better known, perhaps, because of Claymont's favorite son, our  President, Joe Biden.   Lynne graduated from Claymont High School in 1972, the same year  Biden was first elected to this Chamber. It was at Claymont High School  where, some members of my staff report, in good humor, Lynne made a  name for herself ``playing a mean clarinet.'' I didn't know clarinets  could be mean.   Lynne's public service career began shortly thereafter. She started a  10-year run with Delaware's Department of Labor, the Department of  Health and Social Services, and the Division of Personnel. After that,  her career continued across city, county, State, and Federal  governments.   From 1988 to 1992, she worked for well-known Mayor Dan Frawley of  Wilmington. She later took on similar responsibilities for our  Lieutenant Governor and now-Governor, John Carney, and later for Paul  Clark, my successor as county executive in New Castle County. Paul said  it was his good fortune to have hired Lynne.         She was a shining light in the field of government       service--    County Executive Clark said--         and an absolute joy to work with. I am privileged to call       Lynne my friend and wish her the best in retirement.    Governor Carney offered similar sentiments, saying:         When I was Lieutenant Governor, Lynne helped make our       office run smoothly and always offered a helping hand to       constituents. She is a compassionate, hardworking colleague       and a good friend, and I am personally grateful for Lynne's       many years of dedicated service. . . . I wish her and her       family all the best in retirement.    For more than 8 years in my office in Wilmington, Lynne has  seamlessly managed my front office and my college internship program.  And I can't tell you how hard a job it is to be the person who answers  the phone, day in and day out, particularly when serving a Senator like  me who seems to draw all sorts of attention and angry phone calls.   So Lynne, thank you in particular for handling all the calls and  complaints and concerns of Delawareans who call in day in and day out.   Lynne has remained our beloved gatekeeper, the first person to greet  visitors, the familiar voice on the main telephone line, someone who  has handled sometimes literally hundreds of calls a day. She is known  for being reliable and trustworthy. She is highly regarded by my whole  team and recognized for her breadth of knowledge of our State, who is  who, which call needs to be answered first, who are the movers and  shakers.   She is known for always staying calm and professional when helping  constituents. And, trust me, some of these calls can be incredibly  emotional and difficult, whether assisting someone needing a  vaccination appointment or dealing with a veterans benefit question.   She has run my internship program flawlessly, and that is a true  testament to Lynne. During her more than 8 years of running that, she  has interviewed, hired, trained, mentored, and supported more than 150  college interns--a good number of whom have gone on to join our full- time professional staff.   She is, as Brendan Mackie would say, a true force multiplier. Several  of our interns, as I have mentioned, have gone on to be staff, both in  Wilmington and in Washington, and many others have gone on to executive  branch Agencies or to be activists, attorneys, nonprofit leaders,  mentors, and volunteers.   It is a profound understatement to say that my team and I, and my  wife Annie and I, will deeply miss Lynne. Annie and I have known Lynne  going all the way back to their time together in the Women's Democratic  Club of Delaware, when we were young couples and looking forward to  someday both being parents of twins.   On my current staff, Marcus Wright, who is my outreach coordinator,  added:         Lynne is always at the top of her game. As her counterpart       in DC, I [learned to] lean on her knowledge and followed her       example. She helped me be a better staffer, and I owe her an       enormous debt of gratitude.    Desiree Burritt, one of my most seasoned and capable caseworkers,  said:         Lynne is ever-present and incredibly dependable.    Jessica Glass, my deputy scheduler said:         Lynne not only helped me through the intern program . . .       but I'm learning so much . . . sitting on the other side       [now] and getting to interview interns with her! She . . .       [has] watched me go full circle during the past four years.    Brian Cunningham, a beloved former staffer, said:         I always appreciated Lynne's warm greetings to the littlest       guests in the office--    He means his kids--         when [my] kids came to visit, or sit with their parent to       help finish out the workday, it was Lynne who . . . had a       stash of snacks [and always a kind word].    Among her coworkers, she has earned a lot of good-natured nicknames:  Lynney, Lynney-Boo, Lynne-yrd Skynyrd, and others I won't repeat, but  she is clearly omnipresent in the hearts and minds of those who served  alongside her in Delaware.  [[Page S4751]]    Her dedication goes far beyond government service. She has  volunteered her time with so many groups. I mentioned the Women's  Democratic Club. She has also served as chair of the 22nd  Representative District Committee, serving Hockessin, Pike Creek, North  Star, and Newark for many, many years.   And she was honored with the Distinguished Service Award from the New  Castle County Democrats in 2008 for her tireless service.   On the homefront, her pride and joy include Dennis Phifer, her  husband, and their twin sons, Matthew and Christopher.   We can't forget the beloved family canine, Elle. In her retirement,  Lynne will have more time to spend with Dennis, Matt, and Chris, and  her network of friends, going all the way back to her Claymont days.  She looks forward to spending her mornings with Dennis, she says,  making him coffee, reading the paper together, and staying up late, as  Dennis dozes off, trying to finish the daily crossword.   She surely will have more time with Elle, walking her around the  neighborhood and spoiling her with treats. Dennis said of Lynne, who  absolutely loves animals, that she wants to use her newfound time to  volunteer to help service dogs and other support animals.   Alice Paul, the famous suffragette, in speaking about the fight for  women's rights, said: ``I always feel the movement is a . . . mosaic.  Each of us puts in [our own] little stone, and then'' at the end, you  see a beautiful mosaic.   When looking back at Lynne's years of public service--36 years--this  analogy seems apt. Lynne has been a hard-working and headstrong person,  someone who has done incredible things, often behind the scenes, and  helped create her own great mosaic through her decades of dedication  and service to our community, our city, our county, our State, and this  Senate.   Whether it was throwing her support behind Joe Biden amid a Senate  reelection run or helping constituents in my office or the hundreds of  folks she has trained and recruited and mentored, Lynne's mosaic will  last long and reach far, leaving her mark on Delaware for many, many  years to come.   Lynne will undoubtedly continue to accomplish good and meaningful  things, finding those moments in small pieces of colored stone or glass  or ceramic and putting those in place, adding to her ongoing mosaic of  life.   In closing, through her career, her volunteerism, and her civic  activism, Lynne has made a real difference. I can't thank her enough  for her first-class dedication and her friendship. Lynne will be deeply  missed in the Senate, and filling her shoes will be near impossible.   Lynne, thank you. Best of luck in all your future endeavors. You are  treasured, and we will cheer you on your way as you celebrate this next  chapter of your life.   With that, I yield the floor.
