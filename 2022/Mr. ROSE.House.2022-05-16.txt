 Madam Speaker, today, I rise as average gas prices across  the country approach $4.50. The average American household will now  have to spend an extra $2,000 per year thanks to President Biden's war  on American energy.   On his very first day in office, he canceled the Keystone pipeline.  He has since raided the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, leaving us  unprepared for national security emergencies. He has made it more  difficult and expensive to drill for oil. And just last week, President  Biden canceled drilling permits in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. It is  apparent that he wants gas prices to continue to rise. I don't know how  else to say it.   The folks of middle Tennessee know exactly who to blame for rising  energy costs: President Joe Biden.   Madam Speaker, President Biden must do better. The President's energy  policies are crushing middle Tennesseans while the answer to this  crisis lies right under our feet. We can't afford to wait for the next  President to unleash America's energy independence.                            ____________________
