 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able  to finish my remarks before the vote.    Madam President, I rise today in support of Denis  McDonough. Denis is President Biden's choice to lead the Department of  Veterans Affairs.   Though there is a great political divide in our Nation, I believe  that veterans across the country and Members on both sides of the aisle  are united by a very basic expectation: that the next VA Secretary be  an individual of honesty, integrity, and vision. This individual must  listen to veterans and put their well-being above all else.   Denis McDonough has demonstrated that he is, unequivocally, the man  for this job. And to be clear, this is not an easy job. But Denis is  used to making tough calls. He has shown an exemplary commitment to  public service and a strong willingness to do right by those who have  worn the uniform and sacrificed on behalf of our liberties.   As White House Chief of Staff, he quickly earned a reputation for  getting the job done, working across Federal Agencies, and finding  common ground. For the last 20 years, he has played a key role in many  decisions surrounding sending our military men and women to war and  knows that taking care of these folks when they return home is a cost  of war and a shared responsibility.   Veterans need someone like Denis fighting in their corner, but the  truth is there is simply too much at stake.   With more than 400,000 Americans dying from COVID-19 in less than a  year, the VA Secretary's top responsibility will be ensuring that the  Department has everything it needs--from vaccines to personal  protective equipment, to additional healthcare and supportive  services--to care for veterans and to protect the VA's employees.   He will be held accountable when it comes to swiftly implementing a  number of historic reforms, from the John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental  Health Care Improvement Act, a bill that is out-of-box thinking to help  our veterans in the mental health challenges and suicides that have  resulted, to the Deborah Sampson Act, an act to help the largest or the  fastest growing group of veterans, our women veterans, have access to  care, to the expansion of presumptive coverage for thousands of  additional Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange and overdue  coverage for our Vietnam veterans--not to mention a myriad of other  critical priorities that have been in the works for years and need  serious attention, such as the Caregivers Program and the electronic  health record modernization effort.   But Denis is fully prepared to take on these responsibilities. He is  ready to build the trust of our Nation's servicemembers, veterans, and  their families, and treat them with the respect that they have earned.   Now more than ever, veterans need a strong leader who will prioritize  delivering timely and quality healthcare and benefits over making  political points. I am confident that, as VA Secretary, Denis will be  squarely focused on serving these needs.   I ask my colleagues to join me today in confirming him to this role,  where I have no doubt that he will be successful. Our Nation's veterans  are counting on us.   Now, unfortunately, my friend and colleague, the ranking member of  the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Jerry Moran, couldn't make it  back in time for this nomination due to bad weather and flight delays.  But he was planning on voting to advance this nomination today because  he believes Denis McDonough is someone who shares his commitment to  taking care of our veterans.   With that, I yield.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to meet  during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                        Committee on Foreign Relations    The Committee on Foreign Relations is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Monday, February 8, 2021, at 6 p.m., to  conduct a classified hearing.                            ____________________
