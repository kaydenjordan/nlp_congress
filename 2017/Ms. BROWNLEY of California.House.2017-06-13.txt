 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  bill to hold bad actors accountable and make the VA a stronger system  for our Nation's veterans.   Since the unacceptable wait time scandal came to light in 2014, the  House Veterans' Affairs Committee has worked diligently to fix the  long-term problems at the VA and to ensure we are serving our veterans  as well as they have served us.   From top to bottom, the number one priority for almost every VA  employee is serving our veterans. But when an employee does not live up  to this mission, engages in misconduct, or puts veterans at risk, we  must ensure that the VA is able to hold them accountable.   It is critically important that we acknowledge that the vast majority  of the 350,000 VA employees, a third of whom are veterans themselves,  are hardworking individuals who have dedicated themselves to serving  our country and our Nation's veterans. By being able to hold  accountable the few bad actors in the VA, we not only serve our  veterans, but we make the job of the rest of the workforce easier to  perform.   Because we need a world-class, 21st century VA, this bill also  provides the Secretary with direct hiring authority for senior  management so that we can bring on the talent we need to properly serve  our veterans.   This is an important example of what we can get done when we work in  a bipartisan manner. I want to thank Chairman Roe and Ranking Member  Walz, both the chairman and ranking member of the Senate for working  with our VSOs and the VA to find a compromise on this issue.    Mr. Speaker, I support this compromise. I ask my colleagues to vote  ``yes.'' This is a very good bill.
