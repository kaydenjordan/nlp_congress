 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 954 removes the use restrictions on a 1-acre parcel  of Federal land provided to Rockingham County, Virginia.   In 1989, Congress authorized Rockingham County to use a 3-acre parcel  of Federal land for the purpose of establishing a childcare center  under the condition that the land continues to be used for this  purpose. If the county no longer needs the land for a childcare center,  the land reverts back to ownership by the United States or the county  has the option to purchase it at a fair market value.   The Federal Government has a long tradition of providing public land  to State, county, and local governments. Fair use of Federal land and a  fair return to the American taxpayer has yet to be at the forefront of  these transactions.   Removing public-purpose requirements and use restrictions should only  be done when it is deemed appropriate and necessary, and in this  particular case, the sponsor of this bill has worked with the National  Park Service to develop legislation that is both fair and transparent.   The land provided to Rockingham County includes a garage previously  used by the National Park Service that the county has determined could  benefit Plains Area Daycare Center. The Park Service no longer needs  the garage, and removing the use restriction on one of the 3 acres will  allow this childcare provider to access financial assistance in order  to upgrade and rehabilitate the garage so that it is suitable to their  needs.   This is a worthy goal, and I commend the gentleman from Virginia for  this legislation, and that is why we support the adoption of H.R. 954.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I yield back  the balance of our time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1397 authorizes the National Park Service and the  Federal Highway Administration to comply with a longstanding agreement  regarding two parcels of land near Claude Moore Colonial Farm in  McLean, Virginia.   Specifically, the bill transfers a small parcel within the boundary  of the George Washington Memorial Parkway from the Department of the  Interior to the Department of Transportation. The bill also transfers a  half acre within the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center from the  Department of Transportation to the Department of the Interior.   Simply put, this bill permits a one-time land transfer that was  agreed to 15 years ago. Ultimately, this will improve management  efficiency and save taxpayer money.   The bill is noncontroversial and has been a longstanding legislative  priority of the National Park Service. I commend the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) for her bipartisanship, and I urge my  colleagues to support its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation represents the final part of a  collaborative land agreement between the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, located in  southern Arizona, and the Tucson Unified School District, TUSD.   H.R. 1404 will transfer a 40-acre parcel currently managed by TUSD  under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act into a trust for the  Tribe. Two additional parcels of land will be transferred to the TUSD,  provided that the TUSD pays fair market value so that it may better  plan for the future needs of the school district in the areas near the  Tribe's reservation.   I want to commend the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), the  ranking member and sponsor of the bill, not only for his leadership on  the Natural Resources Committee, but for bringing this legislation  forward.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).    Mr. Speaker, briefly, the bill is identical to H.R.  2009, which passed in the 114th Congress by voice vote. That is why, as  well as what we have heard today, I urge quick adoption of this  legislation once again.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1541 authorizes the National Park Service to expand  the boundary of the Fort Scott National Historic Site in Fort Scott,  Kansas.                                time  1700    Fort Scott was designated as a National Historic Landmark back in  1964. Eight years later, in 1972, Congress established the site as a  unit of the National Park Service ``to commemorate the significant role  played by Fort Scott in the opening of the West, as well as the Civil  War and strife in the State of Kansas that preceded it.''   The site is currently a modest 16 acres. The additions authorized by  this bill will add approximately 3.8 acres to the park. The properties  to be added include the only intact Civil War era building, Civil War  entrenchments and fortifications, and home sites of the first African- American families who settled in the area after the war.   Preserving the story of freedom on the frontier is an important goal,  and I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1719 authorizes the National Park Service to expand  the boundary of the John Muir National Historic Site and acquire 44  acres of land from the Muir Heritage Land Trust. The donation will  expand the site and help carry on Muir's important legacy of  conservation and environmental stewardship.   John Muir is one of our Nation's most respected and revered  ecologists. His writings have inspired millions, and his activism and  advocacy led to the establishment of some of our first and most iconic  national parks.   From the moment he set foot in Yosemite Valley, John Muir was  consumed with its natural wonder and beauty. He became Yosemite's most  vocal champion, but he didn't spend his whole life there.   From 1890 until his death in 1914, Muir lived on a farm not far from  San Francisco. It was from this corner of the bay area that Muir  cofounded the Sierra Club and helped lay the groundwork for a century  of conservation.   John Muir's tireless advocacy led to the creation of Yosemite and  Sequoia National Parks, and his spirit and enduring legacy led to the  protection of much more.   Passage of H.R. 1719 will contribute to John Muir's legacy and it  will help to protect and conserve the place where he found solace and  inspiration in his later years.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the bill's sponsor, Representative DeSaulnier  from California, and I urge swift passage of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1913 establishes the Clear Creek National  Recreation Area and the Joaquin Rocks Wilderness Area on land  administered by the Bureau of Land Management in the central coast  region of California. From hiking and hunting to off-highway vehicle  use, those designations will improve and enhance access for a variety  of recreational activities, while ensuring that ecologically sensitive  and unique areas are managed in a way that supports their lasting and  permanent protection.   In addition to the many ecological benefits they provide, including  clean air and clean water, wilderness areas throughout the country play  a large role in supporting the approximately $646 billion per year  outdoor recreation economy, so I am pleased that we are advancing this  bill to add 21,000 acres of the National Wilderness Preservation  System.   This bill has strong local support from San Benito County government  officials and a number of off-highway vehicle and wilderness groups.  These advocates understand that Clear Creek is important to the  economy, and they have fond memories of the recreational opportunities  when they were younger.   I have received numerous support comments from my constituents, the  off-highway vehicle community, and other California residents about the  importance of Clear Creek to their family and how the closure has  impacted them. It is time to honor the desire of my constituents in  California's 20th Congressional District and pass this bill once again.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters in support of the bill.                                              San Benito County,                                        Hollister, CA, June 1, 2017.      Re Letter in Support of H.R. 1913.       Hon. Jimmy Panetta,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Panetta: I would like to express my       support of proposed legislation H.R. 1913. On at least three       previous occasions, the San Benito County Board of       Supervisors has formally expressed their support of this       proposed measure in the form of H.R. 1776 as submitted by       then-Congressman Sam Farr.        As background, the Serpentine Area of Critical       Environmental Concern (ACEC) of the Clear Creek Management       Area (CCMA) was closed in 2008 based on a study by the EPA       which concluded that naturally occurring asbestos (NOA) posed       a public health risk. However, in 2010, the Off Highway Motor       Vehicle Recreation (OHMVR) Division of the State of       California Department of Parks and Recreation Commissioned an       independent OHV-specific risk assessment of NOA exposure       within the Serpentine ACEC of the CCMA.        This report, completed by the International Environmental       Research Foundation (IERF), concluded that management and       operation strategies could be employed to allow for off-      highway vehicle (OHV) recreation in the CCMA without exposing       the public to higher than acceptable levels of NOA and       without presenting a serious risk to human health.       Specifically, the risk of OHV usage five days per year, for       eight hours on each of those days, was equated to being       similar to the lifetime risk of smoking less than one       cigarette one the same one year period, and the report noted       that other recreational activities, such as swimming, hiking       and snow skiing, are over 100 times more dangerous.        In light of this report which directly contradicts the       conclusions of the EPA study and undermines the necessity of       BLM actions taken since 2008 in reliance of that study, it       would appear that closure of the ACEC is not scientifically       warranted, and especially not during winter months when dust       from OHV activity is greatly reduced.        Therefore, the County supports opening the area to OHV       users once again and allowing the public access to this       natural area which is easily accessible to the urban       residents in the San Jose/San Francisco metropolitan areas.       H.R. 1913, which would establish the Clear Creek National       Recreation Area in San Benito and Fresno Counties, is       essential to enhancing public access to natural and scenic       areas within our State.        The lack of evidence of a serious health risk is reinforced       by the fact that there is  [[Page H5411]]       the lack of any documented case of any person, whether       recreational, visitor or governmental employee, injured by       NOA within the ACEC despite the use of the area for decades.       Therefore, the activities taken to close the area are       especially troubling considering the effect of the closure on       the public generally, as well as the local economy.        Access to recreational areas within San Benito County,       including the CCMA, provides a necessary and substantial       component to the local economy which has been drastically       affected by the recent economic climate. The BLM's past       decision to close the Clear Creek area has already seriously       affected San Benito County's economic vitality. The County       could understand such action if there was truly a serious       health risk presented by use of the CCMA, but there is no       generally accepted scientific evidence, especially during       wetter winter months.        The Clear Creek Management Area was among the five most       popular areas cited by California off-highway-vehicle (OHV)       users in a 1990 study conducted by the California Department       of Parks and Recreation. Many of these users were residents       of the San Jose and San Francisco Bay. In 2003 and 2004,       there were an estimated 50,000 visitors to the CCMA, largely       attributable to allowed OHV usage.        In conclusion, the Board of Supervisors supports the       proposed legislation, as well as designation of the Clear       Creek Management Area as a National Recreation Area,       designation of OHV recreation as a ``prescribed use'' within       the National Recreation Area, and providing that the       management plan of the Clear Creek National Recreation Area,       including OHV routes, open areas, number of permitted OHV       events and other recreational activities should be as set       forth in the 2005 Clear Creek Travel Management Plan.        Thank you for your consideration of this letter.            Respectfully,                                                  Jerry Muenzer,                                              Supervisor District 4,      Board of Supervisors.                                   ____                                    California Wilderness Project,                                     Cottonwood, CA, April 20, 2017.      Hon. Jimmy Panetta,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Panetta: We greatly appreciate your sponsorship of       H.R. 1913, the Clear Creek National Recreation Area and       Conservation Act. The legislation will permanently protect       21,000 acres of BLM land in Fresno and San Benito counties by       its inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System.        The proposed Joaquin Rocks Wilderness follows the steep       northern slope of Joaquin Ridge which climbs high above the       floor of the western San Joaquin Valley.        Rising up over 4,000 feet from the valley floor, the       striking Joaquin Rocks are the centerpiece of this remote       area. These three scenic 250' tall monoliths are the eroded       remnants of an ancient vaqueros sandstone formation.        The Joaquin Rocks are named for the legendary Joaquin       Murieta, believed by some to be a heroic figure early       California and an outlaw by others. The Joaquin Rocks are       said to have provided a secluded hiding place for him and his       band place during the 1850s. The area also shows       archeological evidence of past Native American occupation.        The rugged area features deep canyons where oak woodlands       cloak the numerous spur ridges that descend to the valley.       Vegetation in the area includes, blue oak, California       juniper, grey pine, chaparral, and native grasslands. Due to       the cooler climate provided by its elevation, the area       provides outstanding displays of native wildflowers well into       summer.        The steep cliffs of the Joaquin Rocks--and the numerous       other towering sandstone formations found throughout the       area--are host to numerous falcons, hawks and owls. They       could also provide potential nesting habitat for the       California condor which has been reintroduced into the nearby       Gavilan Range. One of the peaks of the Joaquin Rocks--La       Centinela--hosts a vernal pool that supports fairy and       tadpole shrimp.        The Joaquin Rocks proposed wilderness represents a unique       opportunity to preserve one of central California's most       outstanding natural landscapes and we sincerely appreciate       Mr. Panetta's efforts to protect it for future generations.            Best Regards,                                                    Gordon Johnson,      Director.                                   ____                                                     April 10, 2017.      Hon. Jimmy Panetta,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Panetta: As representatives of national       motorized recreation organizations we write in support of the       ``Clear Creek National Recreation Area and Conservation Act''       (H.R. 1913). This legislation would designate 75,000 acres of       Federal land in San Benito and Fresno Counties in California       as the Clear Creek National Recreation Area (NRA) and would       ensure access for the responsible use of off-highway vehicles       (OHVs) in the area into the future.        Clear Creek was closed in 2008 based on a questionable       safety rationale related to exposure to asbestos.       Subsequently the California Off-Highway Motor Vehicle       Recreation Commission commissioned an independent risk       assessment study which concluded that management and       operational strategies could be effectively employed in the       area to allow OHV use without exposing the public to       unacceptable risks. H.R. 1913 would guarantee that moving       forward, the area will be managed in such a way as to provide       for all sorts of legitimate and responsible recreation, while       also providing for the safety of all of the area's visitors.        Our support for H.R. 1913 is possible because of the       endorsement of the bill from a broad array of local OHV       organizations, businesses and enthusiasts. This local support       is warranted not only because the legislation would reopen       the popular OHV area, but because a diverse group of       constituencies worked together on the bill.        We thank you for your statement upon introduction which       makes it clear that you recognize the importance of multiple       uses on public lands--``This bipartisan bill not only       bolsters our area's conservation efforts, it also promotes       recreation and tourism in our region. When this bill passes,       locals and visitors will no longer be restricted from       enjoying all that Clear Creek Management Area has to offer.''       We applaud this approach and hope that other Members of       Congress will look to H.R. 1913 as a model for how to garner       support for land use legislation.        Thank you for introducing this important bill. We look       forward to working with you as it moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,          Larry Smith, Executive Director, Americans for             Responsible Recreational Access;          Nicole Nicholas Gilles, Executive Director, American Sand             Association;          Don Amador, Western Representative, BlueRibbon Coalition,             Inc.;          Duane Taylor, Director, Federal Affairs, Motorcycle             Industry Council;          Russ Ehnes, Executive Director, National Off-Highway             Vehicle Conservation Council;          Tom Yager, Vice President, Recreational Off-Highway             Vehicle Association;          Stuart D. Gosswein, Sr. Director, Federal Government             Affairs, Specialty Equipment Market Association;          Kathy Van Kleeck, Senior Vice President, Government             Relations, Specialty Vehicle Institute of America;          Steve Egbert, Vice President, United Four Wheel Drive             Associations, Inc.                                   ____                                               California Wilderness                                                       Coalition,                                         Anderson, CA, May 19, 2017.      Subject: Support for H.R. 1913, the Clear Creek National           Recreation Area and Conservation Act      Hon. Jimmy Panetta,      U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Panetta: We are pleased to offer our       support for H.R. 1913, the Clear Creek National Recreation       Area and Conservation Act. We strongly support the       designation of the proposed 21,000-acre Joaquin Rocks       Wilderness and the protection of over 31 miles of streams as       wild and scenic rivers. We believe that the bill strikes a       reasonable balance between environmental protection, off-road       vehicle recreation, public safety and other considerations in       the Clear Creek-Joaquin Rocks area.        Joaquin Rocks is one of the dramatic scenic features in the       region, with its three prominent pinnacles of rock standing       like sentinels above the San Joaquin Valley. Its oak       woodlands, grasslands and other plant communities provide       important habitat for sensitive plant and wildlife species.       Joaquin Rocks also has important historical values as, among       other things, the former hideout of the notorious outlaw       Joaquin Murrieta.        Thank you for introducing and working to advance the       legislation. Please do not hesitate to contact us if we can       assist you in this or any other public lands-related matter.            Sincerely,                                                       Ryan Henson,                                            Senior Policy Director.     Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill, and I thank  Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva for their leadership, their  work, and assistance in getting this bill to the floor of the House of  Representatives. I also thank Representatives David Valadao, Jeff  Denham, and Paul Cook, as well as my predecessor, Representative Sam  Farr, and our staffs for their work on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge quick adoption of this legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1306 is a culmination of years of work to address  the wrongs of the past. The termination era in Federal Indian policy is  one of the darkest chapters in American history.   In Oregon, all but one of the Tribes lost their Federal recognition.  Fortunately, the Federal Government eventually saw the error of their  ways and restored the Tribes, but they were now left with nonexistent  or inadequate land bases.   H.R. 1306, the Western Oregon Tribal Fairness Act, will go a long way  in  [[Page H5414]]  helping reestablish, long-promised land bases for the Oregon Tribes,  while also giving them the ability to effectively manage their land on  their own terms.   I want to thank our colleagues from Oregon, Mr. DeFazio and Mr.  Walden, for listening to the needs of the Oregon Tribal people and  continuing to push this bipartisan legislation.   The previous version of this bill passed the House by voice vote last  Congress, and I now urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In one of the worst civil engineering failures of the 20th century,  the breach of the Saint Francis Dam, on March 12, 1928, tragically took  the lives of over 400 Americans. To honor the memory of those who lost  their lives on that fateful day, H.R. 2156 establishes a national  memorial at the disaster site in California's Santa Clarita Valley. The  memorial will provide a permanent place of remembrance and a place for  healing.   In addition to the memorial, H.R. 2156 establishes the Saint Francis  Dam National Monument on 440 acres of public land managed by the Forest  Service. The national monument designation authorizes the U.S. Forest  Service, in consultation with a range of stakeholders, to develop  educational programs and improve the health of regional watersheds.   I want to thank Congresswoman Julia Brownley, as well as Congressman  Knight, along with the Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society, for  bringing the legacy of the Saint Francis Dam disaster to the attention  of Congress. As we have all heard: ``Those who cannot remember the past  are doomed to repeat it.''   This bill received strong support last Congress and was voted out of  the House. This is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support its  adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Along with dozens of other California Tribes, the Lytton Band of Pomo  Indians had its relationship with the Federal Government terminated in  1958. That resulted in the loss of its Federal status and all of its  Tribal lands.   The Tribe's federally recognized status was eventually restored, but  their reservation lands were not. As a result, with the exception of a  small parcel of land that Congress provided for gaming in San Pablo,  the Tribe has been left essentially landless and without a reservation  since it was terminated.   This bill will take approximately 511 acres in Sonoma County into  trust as part of the reservation of the Lytton Rancheria. By directing  these lands into trust, the United States will ensure that the Lytton  Rancheria will finally have a permanently protected homeland on which  they can, once again, live communally and plan for future generations.   I commend Representative Denham, my neighbor to the east, for this  bipartisan legislation, and I urge quick adoption of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
