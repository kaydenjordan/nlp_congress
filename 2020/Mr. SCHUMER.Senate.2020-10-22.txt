 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, before I get into the substance of my  remarks, I will briefly redress the Republican leader.   He came on the floor and, with his typical vitriol, made all kinds of  accusations. The bottom line is McConnell is angry. Why? Because we  Democrats have exposed that he has defiled the Senate as an institution  more than any person in this generation and many generations, because  we Democrats have exposed the hypocrisy of holding up Merrick Garland  because it was 8 months before an election and rushing through Amy  Coney Barrett because it is ``something we can do.''   The bottom line is Leader McConnell, of course, doesn't like hearing  these things, but they are the truth, and they will live on in history.  The man who defiled the Senate, the man who created one of the greatest  hypocritical acts in the history of the Senate, sits in that chair.   Now, the Republican majority is steering the Senate toward one of the  lowest moments in its long history, and the damage it does to this  Chamber may very well be irrevocable.   After thwarting the constitutional prerogative of a duly elected  Democratic President to appoint a Supreme Court Justice because it was  an election year, the Republican majority is rushing to confirm a  Justice for a Republican President 1 week--1 week--before election day.   Four short years ago, all of our Republican friends argued that it  was principle--that is the world they used, ``principle''--to let the  American people have a voice in the selection of a Supreme Court  Justice because an election was 8 months away.   Those same Republicans are preparing to confirm a Justice with an  election that is 8 days away. What a stench of hypocrisy.   In the process, the majority has trampled over every norm, rule, or  standard that could possibly stand in its way. It ignored health  guidelines to conduct in-person hearings in the middle of a pandemic  after Republicans Members of the committee themselves had contracted  COVID.   It has broken longstanding Senate precedent. Never in the history of  the Senate has a Supreme Court nominee--a lifetime appointment--been  considered so close to an election. The Presiding Officer of the Senate  confirmed this yesterday in response to this Senator's inquiry. Never  in the history of the Senate has a Supreme Court nominee been confirmed  after July of an election year.   Before even we arrived at this sordid chapter, the Republican  majority broke the rules of the Senate to change the rules of the  Senate, lowering the number of votes required for a Supreme Court  nomination so that Republicans could confirm whomever they wanted.   They changed the rules of the Senate again to limit the amount of  time the Senate spends considering judicial nominations so they could  pack the courts with their rightwing appointees even faster.   It is a hallmark of democracy that might does not make right, but the  Republicans are blatantly ignoring this principle. Here, in Leader  McConnell's Senate, the majority lives by the rule of ``because we  can.'' They completely ignore the question of whether they should.  Morality, principles, value, consistency are all out the window.   Here, now, we have the culmination of this Republican majority's  systemic erosion of rules and norms in pursuit of raw political power:  a Supreme Court nominee who will be confirmed on a party-line vote  after the rules were changed to allow it, in complete contradiction to  the supposed principle  [[Page S6386]]  that the same party so vehemently argued only 4 years ago, 8 days  before an election in which the American people will choose exactly  whom they want to pick Supreme Court Justices for them.   This idea that because now the Presidency and the Senate are in one  party, the rule doesn't apply--they never said that when they blocked  Merrick Garland. It is fakery. It is, again, part of the house of lies  that is being built by the majority to rush a Supreme Court Justice  like this.   It is absurd. It is outrageous. It is a stain on this body and an  indelible mark on this Senate majority that will live in history. The  Senate Republican majority is conducting the most rushed, most  partisan, and least legitimate process in the long history of Supreme  Court nominations, and Democrats will not lend an ounce of legitimacy  to that process.   Today the members of the minority on the Judiciary Committee have  boycotted the markup of Amy Coney Barrett. The rules of the Judiciary  Committee require that two members of the minority be present in order  to conduct a markup.   True to form, Chairman Graham decided to break the rules to move  forward with a vote on Judge Barrett anyway--steamrolling over the  rules of the Judiciary Committee, just like Republicans have  steamrolled over principle, honesty, fairness, consistency, and decency  in their mad rush to confirm a Justice before the election. To  steamroll over rules--that is the mark of an autocratic society, not  the mark of a democracy, and the Republican majority is going along  with that kind of autocracy, the same kind exhibited by President  Trump. It is a shame that the principles of the Republican Party are  out the window.   Today, the Democratic seats on the dais in that committee room  remained empty. In their place were reminders of what is ultimately at  stake in this nomination--the fundamental rights of the American  people. In their place were photographs of Americans whose lives would  be devastated if Judge Barrett delivers the decisive vote to strike  down the Affordable Care Act, ripping away healthcare from tens of  millions of Americans and eliminating protections for 130 million  Americans with preexisting conditions.   You could imagine, alongside their faces, the faces of women who  cherish the right to make their own private medical decisions; the  faces of LGBTQ Americans who want to marry whom they love and not be  fired for who they are; the faces of American workers who are breaking  their backs to make ends meet, who need their union to help them get a  better wage; the faces of young people who know the planet is in peril  in their lifetimes.   I hope that when Republican members of the committee took their seats  this morning, they looked at those faces. They ought to think about  what this nomination means for them. I hope they actually took one  moment to think about what it says about their sham of a process that  Democrats were forced to take the extraordinary step of refusing to  participate.   While they may realize it or not--or they may not even care--the  Republican majority's monomaniacal drive to confirm this Justice in the  most hypocritical of circumstances will forever defile the Senate and  curtail the fundamental rights of American people for generations to  come.   To every one of my colleagues: History will remember what you have  done. Democrats will play no part in it.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote  occur at 12:59 today.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the  motion.    Thank you.    Mr. President, this morning, the Judiciary Committee  voted Amy Coney Barrett out in violation of its rules. The rules of the  Judiciary Committee say, before you can vote a nominee to the floor,  there must be two members of the minority. That has been obeyed by  Democrats and Republicans for a very long time. I remember it in  existence for all of the years I was on the Judiciary. Yet, typical of  this Republican majority, when there were not two Democrats there, they  just steamrolled the nominee through in violation of the rules. That  has been typical. This whole thing has been a steamroller operation of  one of the most important appointments we can all make--weeks before a  Presidential election--of a nominee whose views, in the judgment of  most Americans, are far away on healthcare, on reproductive rights, on  labor unions, and on guns from where the average American is.   It is a steamroller, and this was in violation of the rules, which is  not surprising given this rush to judgment--given this maniacal desire  to get this nominee through before Americans vote. It is in violation  of the rules.                                Point of Order    Mr. President, I make a point of order that the Barrett nomination  should not be placed on the Executive Calendar because it was reported  in violation of the rules of the Senate Judiciary Committee.    Mr. President, I appeal the ruling of the Chair and ask  for the yeas and nays.
