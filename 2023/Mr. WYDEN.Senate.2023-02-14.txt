 Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I just want my  colleague to know that what you just heard from Senator Brown is why,  every single day, he gives public service a good name. He shows up, and  he works for the people. It is thrilling to see that, as always, he  recognizes that he can't do it by himself. He has got staff, and it is  so appropriate to hear him and his gracious remarks about his colleague  who is moving on.   Mr. President, it is great to see you.   For those who aren't familiar, those of us on the Senate Finance  Committee have been so proud to work with our colleague Senator  Warnock, particularly his championship of affordable medicine and  affordable insulin, where he has been a leader for all of us on this  side of the aisle. And had he had his way, all Americans--not just  those who depend on Medicare--would already have the benefits of more  affordable medicine.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following members of my team be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of the Congress: Erika Fountain, Erin Evans, Aaron Tyler  Mentzer, Eric LoPresti, Allison Crha, Nicole Brussel Faria, Eleanor  DeGarmo, and Aaron Parzuchowski.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S401, February 14, 2023, in the third column, the  following appears: I ask unanimous consent that the following  members of my team be granted floor privileges for the remainder  of the Congress: Erika Fountain, Erin Evans, Aaron Tyler Mentzer,  Eric LoPresti, Allison Chra, Nicole Brussel Faria, Eleanor  DeGarmo, and Aaron Parzuchowski.
