 Madam Speaker, this week we recognize the 75th  anniversary of D-Day, and we recognize a Mainer who helped to liberate  France and then Europe from Nazi control in World War II during the  invasion of Normandy.   Charles Norman Shay is a Penobscot Tribal elder and a decorated  veteran of both World War II and the Korean war. He has received the  Bronze Star, the Silver Star, and the Legion of Honor, making him the  first Native American in Maine with that distinction.   Charles Norman Shay was drafted at 19 and served as a medic in the  16th Infantry Regiment, First Infantry Division. When he landed at  Omaha Beach  [[Page H4209]]  in the first wave, it was his first time in combat. Armed with only his  medical supplies, Mr. Shay charged Omaha Beach dozens of times, pulling  struggling soldiers from the sea, bandaging wounds, making splints out  of pieces of wood, or comforting soldiers through their final moments.   Mr. Shay makes a pilgrimage back to Normandy every year to remember  his fellow soldiers, and at 94 years old, Mr. Shay is returning for the  75th anniversary of D-Day.   Mr. Shay is a hero to all Mainers, the Penobscot Nation, and all  Americans. Our country is indebted to him.                            ____________________
