 Madam President, I rise today in support of the  legislation that my colleague from Michigan just talked about. This is  H.R. 3076, the Postal Service Reform Act. What it really is, though, is  ensuring that the post office works, that it works for the constituents  whom I represent and people all around the country.   Unfortunately, right now, the post office is in trouble. It is in  dire need of reform, and if we don't do it, we are going to have big  problems. The post office just had its 15th consecutive annual net loss  in 2021, and they projected they are going to be insolvent in the next  few years unless we make these reforms and other reforms as well that  can be made by the post office itself. In fact, they project a 10-year  loss of $160 billion if we just continue with the status quo.   The reality is that the Postal Service is delivering less and less  first-class mail. We are all online. We are not sending as many letters  as we used to. Yet there are more and more addresses that they deliver  to because more and more people want to get the mail they do deliver,  the packages, the direct mail, and so on. So it doesn't work. It is a  recipe for ruin if we don't adjust to the new reality and make some  necessary changes.   Last year, Senator Peters and I did introduce the legislation he  talked about. We had 26 cosponsors, equally divided between Republicans  and Democrats. We kept this bipartisan from the start. In fact, I would  even say we tried to keep it nonpartisan. What could be more  nonpartisan than trying to save the post office? Everybody cares about  the post office and wants to be sure it is working well and working  efficiently. It is not a partisan issue; it is of importance to all  Americans--young, old, urban, rural, everybody.   I hear a lot about it back home from my constituents. A constituent  from Butler County, OH, wrote me recently and said:         My father, a veteran of the Vietnam war, has COPD and is 70       years old. He receives his lifesaving medication through the       mail. My father can't breathe without his daily inhaler.    We have to be sure the post office works for him.   A constituent from Montgomery County wrote:         As a disabled veteran, I need to vote by mail.    We have the ability to vote by mail in Ohio. It is no-fault absentee.  But it requires the Postal Service to work, right? It doesn't work well  if the ballot is late and is not counted.   A constituent from Richland County, OH, wrote:         The post office is essential to millions of Americans,       including seniors and veterans who depend on it for       medications, small business owners who are already       struggling.    Everybody. Everybody.   Putting the Postal Service on sound financial footing cannot be  accomplished through an act of Congress alone. This is not just about  passing a law here. We are going to do that. We had a good vote last  night, and I think we will get more people supporting it, I hope, as we  go through the week. But it is also about reforms that the post office  is going to make itself.   The current Postmaster General, Louis DeJoy, has embarked on an  ambitious plan to transform the Postal Service by finding efficiencies,  including transforming existing capabilities to more efficiently meet  the needs of the American people. He is taking on a 10-year plan to  make certain changes to make the post office more efficient, but he has  made clear to us that he needs the financial space to do that. He needs  some headroom here by us making some important changes here in  Congress.   We have a role to play too. This is what we do:   First, we eliminate a burdensome and unique prefunding requirement  for retiree health benefits. Congress mandated this back in 2006 for  current employees, regardless of age. That has crippled the Postal  Service financially. Prefunding of retiree health benefits is not  something that anybody else has to do. It is really uniquely the post  office. The Federal Government does not do that. The private sector  does not do that. In fact, very few private sector entities, of course,  offer retiree health benefits. They rely on Medicare. So the Federal  Government doesn't do it. The private sector doesn't do it. Why is the  post office doing it? That is a good question. We are just trying to  bring the post office in line with what everybody else is doing with  regard to retiree health benefits.   Second, it requires Postal Service employees who are retiring--who  have been paying into Medicare their entire career, by the way--to  actually enroll in Medicare Part B and Part D. Everybody is in Part A,  but about 25 percent of postal employees are not in Part B. Instead,  they rely on the Federal employee health benefit plan, which is far  more expensive.    This includes the ability for these post office retirees to get into  Medicare Advantage. That is very important to me. So just like happens  under current opportunities to enroll in Medicare Advantage under the  Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, they would be able to use  the Medicare Advantage Program, which I like. It is kind of a  wraparound program that gives you more opportunities for more options  and benefits. It is more like a private sector plan. A lot of my  constituents in Ohio like it and use it.   Currently, again, about 25 percent of postal employees don't enroll  in Medicare even though they are eligible for it. Again, they paid  their HI payroll tax, the HI tax you see on your paycheck. This means  the Postal Service is currently paying higher premiums for FEHB than  other public or private sector employers who require Medicare. This is  a big savings for them.   Third, it requires the Postal Service to maintain its current  standard of 6-day-a-week delivery through an integrated delivery  network of mail and packages. This was important to a lot of my  colleagues--particularly those representing rural areas--that they keep  this 6-day-a-week delivery. It is important to the guy who is from  Butler County who gets his COPD medication through the mail. So it  requires the post office to continue to do that even while finding  other efficiencies.   In terms of the integrated delivery network of mail and packages  together, it underscores through a rule of construction that this has  no impact on existing rules governing how the Postal Service attributes  costs between packages and mail.   Let me repeat that. We provide for an integrated delivery system of  mail and packages, and that makes sense. If you are going to deliver  mail to somebody, you should also be delivering the package, right?  That is much more efficient. But we say that this has no impact on  existing rules governing how the Postal Service attributes costs  between packages and mail.   This is important to me because this makes sure that the private  sector will not be subject to unfair competition.   In addition to doing all of these things, the Congressional Budget  Office estimates that the bill will result in a little more than $1  billion in savings in outlays and $458 million in savings in direct  spending.   The bottom line is, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, the  nonpartisan group up here in Congress, has looked at this and said  there is going to be a $1.5 billion savings to the taxpayer because of  this legislation--$1.5 billion savings to the taxpayer.   Because it makes sense, this legislation received strong bipartisan  support when it was taken up in the House of Representatives. In fact,  it was passed by a vote of 342 to 92. Not much gets passed with those  kinds of big bipartisan numbers these days. Republicans and Democrats  alike looked at this and said: You know, the post office is in trouble.  We have to do something.   Some say: Well, this may not be perfect. Well, it is not perfect.  Nothing is around here. But it is a whole lot better than the  alternative, and it does get the post office back on track.  [[Page S856]]  Again, along with the reforms that are being undertaken at the Postal  Service itself, this legislation gives them the financial breathing  room they need to be able to save the post office.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. Let's  put the post office in a position to succeed and provide those  essential services that small businesses, veterans, and rural  constituents rely on so much.   I appreciate working with my colleague Senator Peters on this over  time to find consensus. Both sides had to make concessions to get to  this point. We have ended up with a good bill. Let's pass this bill and  ensure that the post office is healthy for our constituents moving  forward.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
