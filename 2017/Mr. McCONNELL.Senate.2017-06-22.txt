 Mr. President, 7 years ago, Democrats imposed  ObamaCare on our country. They said it would lower costs. It didn't.  From 2013 to 2017, premiums have on average doubled in the vast  majority of States on the Federal exchange. Next year, ObamaCare  premiums will go up across the country once again, potentially by as  much as 43 percent in Iowa, 59 percent in Maryland, and even a  staggering 80 percent in New Mexico. Does it sound as if ObamaCare is  working?   They said it would increase choice. They said it would increase  choice, but of course it didn't. This year, 70 percent of American  counties have had little or no choice of insurers under ObamaCare. Next  year, at least 44 counties are projected to have no choice at all,  meaning, yet again, Americans could be thrown off their plans in States  like Missouri and Ohio and Wisconsin. Does this sound as if ObamaCare  is working?   Now Democrats tell us it would be wrong for the Senate to actually  address these problems in a serious way while the law they have  defended for 7 years teeters, literally teeters on the edge of total  collapse. They were wrong before; they are wrong again now because  ObamaCare isn't working. By nearly any measure it has failed, and no  amount of eleventh-hour reality denying or buck-passing by Democrats is  going to change the fact that more Americans are going to get hurt  unless we do something.   I regret that our Democratic friends made clear early on that they  did not want to work with us in a serious bipartisan way to address the  ObamaCare status quo, but Republicans believe we have a responsibility  to act, and we are--for our constituents, for our States, and for our  country.   We have long called for a better way forward, and we have been  engaged in intensive talks on how to get there. Through dozens of  meetings, open to each and every member of the conference, we have had  the opportunity to offer and consider many ideas for confronting the  ObamaCare status quo.   We have debated many policy proposals, and we have considered many  different viewpoints. In the end, we have found that we share many  ideas about what needs to be achieved and how we can achieve it. These  shared policy objectives and the solutions to help achieve them are  what made up the healthcare discussion draft that we finished talking  through this morning.   We agree on the need to free Americans from ObamaCare's mandates, and  policies contained in the discussion draft will repeal the individual  mandate, so Americans are no longer forced to buy insurance they don't  need or can't afford. We are repealing employer mandates, so Americans  no longer see their hours and take-home pay cut by employers because of  it. We agree on the need to improve the affordability of health  insurance, and policies contained in the discussion draft will do that.  It will eliminate costly ObamaCare taxes that are passed on to  consumers, so we can put downward pressure on premiums; expand tax-free  health savings accounts and deploy targeted tax credits, so we can help  defray out-of-pocket costs; and shift power from Washington to the  States,  [[Page S3698]]  so they have more flexibility to provide more Americans with the kind  of affordable insurance options they actually want.   We agree on the need to stabilize the insurance markets that are  collapsing under ObamaCare as well, and policies contained in the  discussion draft will implement stabilization policies, so we can bring  financial certainty to insurance markets and hope to Americans who face  the possibility of limited or zero options next year under ObamaCare  and ultimately transition away from ObamaCare's collapsing system  entirely, so more Americans will not be hurt.   We also agree on the need to strengthen Medicaid, preserve access to  care for patients with preexisting conditions, and allow children to  stay on their parents' health insurance through the age of 26.    I am pleased we were able to arrive at a draft that incorporates  input from so many different Members, who represent so many different  constituents who are facing so many different challenges.   The draft containing the solutions I mentioned, along with many  others, is posted online, and I encourage everyone to carefully review  it. There will be ample time to analyze, discuss, and provide thoughts  before legislation comes to the floor. I hope every Senator takes that  opportunity.   Next week we expect the Congressional Budget Office to release a  score. After that, we will proceed with a robust debate and an open  amendment process on the Senate floor--a process I would encourage each  of our 100 Senators to participate in.   When legislation does come to the floor, it will present Senate  Democrats with another opportunity to do what is right for the American  people. They can choose to keep standing by as their failing law  continues to collapse and hurt more Americans, but I hope they will  join us, instead, to bring relief to the families who have struggled  under ObamaCare for far too long. Either way--either way, it is time to  act because ObamaCare is a direct attack on the middle class, and  American families deserve better than its failing status quo. They  deserve better care, and that is just what we are going to continue to  work to bring.                            ____________________     Mr. President, reserving the right to object, my  colleague Senator Cornyn was going to ask a question, which I will  answer, which was that the minority leader is referring to a bill that  he hasn't seen a copy of because it hasn't yet been released. So the  speech we just heard was about a bill that he hasn't seen.   With regard to his unanimous consent request, I object.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want  to thank my friend the assistant Democratic leader for confirming that  the majority leader's remarks obviously were made on the basis of news  accounts. The bill has only been posted online for the last 20 minutes.    I will yield for a question.    I object.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, all postcloture time on the Billingslea  nomination expire at 2 p.m. today and that if cloture is invoked on the  Svinicki nomination, the postcloture time not expire until 5:30 p.m. on  Monday, June 26.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of Executive Calendar Nos. 120 through 152  and all nominations placed on the Secretary's desk in the Air Force,  Army, Marine Corps, and Navy, with the exception of COL Darius Gallegos  in Calendar No. 140; that the nominations be confirmed, the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order; that  any statements related to the nominations be printed in the Record;  that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and  the Senate then resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 4 p.m., Monday,  June 26; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day; finally, that following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to  executive session and resume consideration of the Svinicki nomination.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Wyden.
