 Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would  like to talk a little bit about not just Ms. Williams--who as my friend  from Montana has mentioned--I actually think she is qualified--but the  issues that are in front of the Fish and Wildlife Service, as we speak,  that relate to my State, the great State of Alaska.   Unfortunately, it has been one Executive order, Executive action,  delay targeting Alaska--some from the Fish and Wildlife Service that  has had an enormously negative impact on my State.   I agree with the Senator from Montana. Fish and Wildlife Service is  important. He mentioned that it manages 89 million acres nationwide.  Well, 77 million acres of that 89 are in Alaska. Eight-five percent of  Fish and Wildlife Service land that is managed is in one State, the  great State of Alaska, a size bigger than the State of New Mexico, just  for Fish and Wildlife Service land control.   So this Agency, this nominee will have an enormous impact on my  constituents and, indeed, right now is having an enormous impact on my  constituents, and I can't get them to do anything constructive for the  people I represent.   Let me give you two, and perhaps my colleague from Montana can help  me out with this. These are two directly--directly--in the jurisdiction  of the Fish and Wildlife Service that we have been asking for support  on and haven't gotten it. One is the Russian River land exchange. This  is a vital exchange that needs to happen for a highway project on  Alaska's Kenai Peninsula.   Here is the thing about this land exchange. It has been in the works  since 1975--44 years, to be exact. We believe it is the longest running  federally led environmental impact statement in the history of America,  which is actually what happens a lot in the great State of Alaska.  Groups come up; they don't want any resource development; they don't  want any access to land and they sue and they stop and they try to  delay things. This one has been delayed, in one form or another, for 44  years.    Now, the previous administration, to its credit, heard the voices of  Alaska, responded to the input from different stakeholders, and  actually put forward a reasonable land exchange that was approved by  the Federal Government. The regional office of the Fish and Wildlife  Service sent the approved package to headquarters in Washington, DC, in  November, where it sits--where it sits.   So one thing I would like to do before this nominee moves forward is  get a commitment to approve that. It is very simple--44 years. I don't  think we are asking too much, but it is delayed.   Let me give you another one. Many of you have heard about the King  Cove road. You are going to hear about it again because it is an issue  that every Alaskan, even those who don't live out on the Aleutian  Island chain, are passionate about. Only in Alaska could this happen.  It is an 11-mile, single-lane gravel road that will save lives for  people in the community of King Cove--primarily Alaska Native--and they  need approval of that through another land exchange. We have been  working on that for over 40 years--40 years. People in my communities  in that part of the State have died because there is no road to access  an airport. There are a lot of storms in that part of the world, the  Aleutian Islands. When they need access to get out on a plane, they  often don't have it because we can't build a single lane, 11-mile  gravel road.   We have a land exchange approved by the previous administration. This  administration has said they are looking to approve it too. That is  great news, but the Secretary of the Interior has said she is not going  to fully endorse it until she goes out to King Cove and sees it  herself. OK. We have been waiting for that visit for a year--for a  year.   There is a theme here. With the new administration, if there is  something that has been helpful to my State, primarily by the previous  administration, the Trump administration, on so many issues, bipartisan  issues for Alaska, which has helped us in historic ways--on those  helpful things, the new administration comes in, and they say: We are  going to delay it. We are going to delay it. We have to relook at it.  We don't know. If the Trump administration did it for Alaska, it must  have been bad. That is their thing.   But on things that harm my State, this administration on day 1 has  expedited so many things. Day 1, the President is in office for 1 hour,  and he issues an order dealing with ANWR, which this body approved in  2017. If it helps Alaska, they delay it. If it hurts Alaska, they are  all over it.   What we have in the first year of the Biden administration--first  year--are 21 Executive orders and Executive actions negatively  impacting my State across the board on every topic you can imagine:  access to lands, tourism, fishing--21 Executive orders or actions.   I gave a speech on this before the holidays, and it was 20--now it is  21--solely focused on Alaska. There is no other State in the country  that is getting this kind of attention from this administration. I am  sure the great State of Montana isn't.   It is not just about resource development. These actions are hurting  the ability of my constituents to put food on the table, lights on in  their homes, jobs, cultures.   And one area that doesn't nearly get enough attention, these actions,  so many of them, are actually negatively impacting the Alaska Native  community of the great State of Alaska. The Native people of my State  are targeted. Let me give you one example. The previous administration,  working with this body in a bipartisan way, finally passed a bill that  provided justice to Alaska Native Vietnam veterans who served their  country during Vietnam. The Alaska Native community is one of the most  patriotic communities in the country. They serve at higher rates in the  military than any other ethnic group in the country.   When many of them went to fight in Vietnam, they came home, and a law  that had been on the books since 1906--the ability to get a Native  allotment--had expired. They came home and said: Wait, I can't get my  native allotment? So we finally fixed that almost a half century later.  Of course, a lot of radical enviros hated it because it is giving land  in Alaska to people.   The No. 1 issue I raised with Secretary Holland during her  confirmation process was to make sure the Executive order to get these  lands to Vietnam veterans--Alaska Native Vietnam veterans--stays on  track. The Trump administration did all they could to make it happen.  All they had to do was hit ``send.'' She delayed it for 2 years-- delayed it for 2 years. She wasn't even going to tell the delegation. I  guarantee you, in the next 2 years, as this is being delayed, a lot of  these Vietnam vets--Alaska Vietnam vets--will die before they even get  their lands. So we are starting to hear it.   I want to make one final point. This is very important. This  administration talks a lot about racial justice, environmental equity.  They talk about it all the time, but it comes with a caveat. They say  they want to help disadvantaged communities, minority communities. I  think that is a good goal, but it comes with a caveat--racial justice,  environmental equity, unless it is for the indigenous people of Alaska,  and then they get targeted.   A lot of these Executive orders are targeting them. I have a whole  list where some of the most disadvantaged Americans in the country are  being targeted--in my view, because of their race--by this  administration.   I have submitted these before, but I am going to submit them again  for the Record, several letters from Alaska Native groups talking about  this unwarranted lack of consultation and targeting of their interests  in my State.   I ask unanimous consent to have one of these letters printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                    Voice of the Arctic Inupiat,                                                  December 10, 2021.      Re Executive Order 13985         Dear Secretary Haaland: My name is John Hopson Jr., and I       am President of Voice of the Arctic Inupiat (VOICE). VOICE is       a nonprofit corporation whose members include representatives       from Alaska's North Slope tribal councils, municipal       governments, Alaska Native Corporations, our local school       district, regional health organization, and the tribal       college from the North Slope  [[Page S557]]       of Alaska. I am writing today to provide comments on       Executive Order 13985 calling on federal agencies to advance       equity by identifying and addressing barriers to equal       opportunity that underserved communities face due to       government policies and programs.        The North Slope region is one of the most remote areas in       the United States and all eight communities in our region are       considered ``underserved.'' We see many barriers and       challenges when addressing equity in government policies and       action. The focus areas identified in EO 13985 around       contracting, recreating on public lands and tribal       discretionary grants are part of a larger problem when       addressing the issue for native communities that we see, in       addition to recent decisions by this administration around       resource development and the economy our region relies on.        As an organization built on inclusiveness, we emphasize the       importance of addressing equity in several ways: most       importantly, with continued dialogue because we still see and       feel the effects of a federal government that treated our       people as a burden and an impedance. Several of our       communities are still dealing with the cleanup of toxic       materials leftover from military occupation and the       development of Distance Early Warning--``DEW line''--sites       during the Cold War. One of our communities, Kaktovik, was       forced to relocate three times in recent history and their       homes and gravesites were bulldozed to flatten out a runway       for Air Force activity without restitution or even an       apology. Trust in our federal government is still being       built, and the basis of that relationship is meaningful       consultation, collaboration and only then can greater equity       be seen for underserved communities like ours.        In terms of equity, we understand that the Biden       Administration has made promises domestically and       internationally to curb this country's emissions and we, as       Inupiat people whose homelands are on the front lines of       climate change, can understand the need to move in that       direction when it comes to address government policies. What       we cannot support, however, is that those efforts are made on       the backs of indigenous peoples without even a conversation,       that is not how more equity is achieved. The federal       government must allow us the time and resources for a       thoughtful, deliberate, and sustainable transition of our       economy but instead we have seen secretarial and executive       actions that threaten our way of economic sustainability and       therefore our way of life.        Our most pressing concern is the imminent threat to the       North Slope Borough economy that started on day one of this       administration, with little warning nor communication through       reversing Records of Decision, halting new projects, and a       reductionist climate agenda that singles out and vilifies the       oil and gas industry as an alternative to creating a       realistic, multi-dimensional climate strategy. The State of       Alaska has some of this highest and most rigorous       environmental protection policies in the country with respect       to oil and gas development. Our regional government, the       North Slope Borough (NSB) is a home-rule government       responsible for more territory than any other local       government in the nation, an area roughly the same size as       the state of Indiana. The NSB receives 96% of their revenue       from property taxes that are levied on oil and gas industry       infrastructure on the North Slope, which enables them to       provide services that were historically inaccessible in the       Arctic. The Borough School District provides vocational and       academic education for people of all ages; NSB health clinics       provide modern medicinal services to residents in even the       smallest and remote of villages. The Municipal Services       Department operates water, sewer, and electric utilities,       plows roads and runways, and maintains landfills. The       Planning Department provides a third level of oversight to       the oil industry within our region on top of State and       federal oversight and regulations. Other NSB departments       provide housing, police and fire protection, search and       rescue, and other critical services to our communities. They       do this independently, without assistance from state nor       federal government. The benefits of modern American       civilization, common in the rest of the nation, have been       built on the foundation of the North Slope oil industry.        In terms of equity for our region and as economies       transition, the U.S. government must work to create as much       stability as possible and make every effort to not leave our       residents to deal with the volatility and instability that       will likely result from policy changes made in the name of       decarbonization. Fossil fuel usage will no doubt decrease       over time as renewable resources become more widely available       and affordable. However, renewable resource technology has       not developed to a place where it can be widely applicable in       our region; charging an electric car is not easy in villages       that experience blackouts or still rely on diesel generators       for power. Instead of trying to score short term political       capital by drastically changing oil and gas extraction and       ignoring local perspectives, a long-term realistic outlook       and working with the people in the places that currently rely       on these resources is not only the right thing to do, but an       obligation of the government under its trust responsibility       with its indigenous peoples. Without that cooperation and       relationship, equity will be impossible to achieve as       indigenous and local voices will ignored.      Contracts for Businesses with Characteristics that Align with the                    Definition of Underserved Community         Impacts on equity seen through the contracts and businesses       awarded by federal agencies are visible in many ways. Our       region has had little investment or resources put in place to       develop businesses that can help build capacity to provide       the ability to search for, apply and win government       contracts. If a local business has an economic development       arm, most are not comparable to outside larger firms who have       an advantage and can adjust their business models easily to       bid and be awarded government contracts. The businesses that       do get contracts typically do not align with local traditions       and practices or rarely have the potential to bring tangible       economic return to the community beyond short-term labor       positions. When and if activity does occur, some larger       businesses fail engage with local tribes, and sometimes even       the awarding agency fails to communicate with residents on       what project or business opportunities are upcoming in their       own community. The Department of the Interior       (``Department'') can use power of procurement to contract       with and support businesses that align and respect native       communities, particularly small and disadvantaged businesses       that align with local traditions.        We recommend that the Department find more creative ways to       distribute information via social media and local media in       addition to helping facilitate matching programs for small       businesses to become teaming partners. The Department can       also do better by communicating opportunities that are       available to tribal businesses by facilitating additional       networking through conferences, forums or meet and greets.       Another way would be for the Department to implement       additional policies requiring large businesses to work with       smaller businesses on contracting opportunities, like the       small businesses acting as a sub-contractor to a prime       contractor, allowing for partnership and mentorship between       the companies of different sizes. Regional non-profits can       help facilitate this partnership and have capacity that       smaller tribes and communities may not.        Another way to improve the process and relationships around       federal contracting would be to help provide clearer       communication channels for businesses to access the       Department's point of contacts. As most interactions with the       federal government, it is difficult finding answers to       questions in a timely manner, creating additional issues for       smaller and tribal businesses who are trying to navigate the       application process.        We also see barriers surrounding the application processes       themselves. No two agencies have the same procurement or       application requirements. This builds additional stumbling       blocks into the system and requires local businesses, often       an incredibly small team of people, to do significant       additional work. Streamlining federal grants and contracts to       have similar requirements would greatly improve equity and       the ability of small indigenous companies or entities to be       successful through these processes.      Recreation Access to DOI-managed Lands for Underserved Communities         The Inupiat people and the residents who call the Arctic       home have a unique relationship with the lands and water.       Historically our people regularly roamed hundreds of miles in       search of game and hunted up and down our coastlines to       survive. But many of our communities continue to have a       strained relationship with the federal government and       agencies with the Department because of historical slights       and being denied access to lands that were historically used.       On top of that, additional burdensome Departmental and agency       regulations and policies have created additional barriers       when trying to access and recreate on across our homelands       that are now public lands which surround many of our       communities. Two communities in our region, Anaktuvuk Pass       which lies inside the Gates of the Arctic National Park and       Kaktovik which lies within the Arctic National Wildlife       Refuge are impacted by Department agencies that have not       implemented their rights under the 1980 Alaska National       Interest Lands Conservation Act (``ANILCA''). There are       several provisions under ANILCA that have either not been       implemented or have been partially implemented that restricts       these communities access to their subsistence resources       through restrictions. Section 1110(b) was intended to protect       the traditional overland travel for these communities to       allow for summer access however the appropriate documentation       of traditional access has not been completed for Kaktovik       over 40 years after the passage of ANCSA. The regulation of       motorized vehicles on public land makes it harder for native       communities to access their own lands, let alone public lands       in the federal land system. The agencies have not worked with       either community in implementation of Section 1307 with       respect to tourism in either the park or the refuge. This is       the opposite of the question, in that the Department agencies       are issuing permits over the homelands of our people yet not       providing either Anaktuvuk Pass or Kaktovik the ability to       control tourism to their economic benefit by not following       Section 1307.                                Climate Change         Climate change appears in many different forms across       Alaska. It is well known that the Arctic is ``ground zero''       for climate change; on Alaska's North Slope, increased  [[Page S558]]       ice-free seasons have resuIted in greater coastal erosion and       difficulty accessing some of our subsistence resources;       melting permafrost has exacerbated this erosion in addition       to creating infrastructure damage that is expensive to       repair, ruining our traditional sigduaqs (ice cellars where       meat is stored) through flooding, and is making travel across       tundra more difficult. Elsewhere in Alaska, other regions are       also struggling with an increase in wildfires, the warming of       rivers that leads to stresses in the fish populations that       they rely on to subsist, flooding, and the introduction and       expansion of invasive plants and insects. Any response       mechanisms that the government introduces must be flexible       and robust enough to cover the varying changes that we are       seeing across our region and the State as a whole.        VOICE's overarching recommendation is that the Department       consider--in lieu of new ``top down'' policies that, while       well intentioned, don't always serve communities as they are       intended--setting up a grant program that allows affected       communities the flexibility and empowerment to respond to the       impacts that they are facing in a culturally responsible way       that fits their local environment and community. Overall, we       have not seen very many examples of government responses and       assistance to our climate related changes that have been       particularly useful. Any action related to a changing climate       falls to the NSB, to handle the responses in our communities,       including building sea walls to protect against erosion and       fixing roads and buildings damaged by permafrost thaw.       Through a multi-year effort, the NSB has been working through       the process of receiving funding and support from the U.S.       Army Corps of Engineers to build revetment in the community       of Utqiagvik, our largest community, to prevent erosion from       consuming many houses, businesses, and local infrastructure.       Utqiagvik is not the only community in our region that is       experiencing significant erosion; there are similar needs in       Point Hope and Wainwright. Programs and policies that would       assist in assessment of climate related changes and address       solutions and funding around these impacts are necessary.        In terms of climate change observation and other related       programs, we have seen most success in local observer       networks, when local people are trained to monitor and       measure the changes that they are seeing in their own       communities, this creates a sense of empowerment rather than       helplessness. Ideally, permanent, local jobs within our       communities threatened by climate change would be created by       an initiative from the federal government. We believe that       support of these local networks should be prioritized over       the many studies in our communities that are conducted by       multiple federal agencies. Current local network systems need       to be expanded to include all communities because they rely       heavily on indigenous and traditional knowledge of our       environment in a way that no western scientist can compare.       VOICE recommends that there are clear definitions developed       around climate change terminology, for example, `climate       change resilience' is ambiguous and is geographically       variable. The truth is that in the Arctic, and in Alaska in       general, we are well beyond the point of mitigation and have       firmly moved into the realm of adaptation. From retrofitting       existing infrastructure to moving entire communities,       adaptation is incredibly expensive. Federal agencies should       take a stronger initiative in partnering with our local       communities to better understand the impacts of climate       change and the viability of available renewable technologies       that can be utilized in arctic conditions. All of our       communities currently run off of hydrocarbons and we hear       from those unfamiliar with our ecosystem that we should begin       the switch to run our communities off of renewable resources,       but we have yet to see a legitimate solution to our energy       needs that is viable in the unique and challenging Arctic       conditions.            Applying for and Accessing Tribal Discretionary Grants         One way the process around discretionary grants for tribes       that can be improved would be to set up additional offices       and positions in regional offices like Tribal grant liaisons       to assist tribes and help build a sustainable beneficial       relationship. A regional grant liaison dedicated to tribes       would also be able to help the department create more       targeted communication grant campaigns and they could act as       a point of contact for tribes navigating the grants process.       Small tribes like those in our region often have a difficult       time building relationships with the federal government and       understanding the federal regulations around the grants they       are applying for. As I mentioned the burdensome reporting       process can create challenges with tribes that have low       capacity or high turnover, leaving them ineligible for future       grants. Federal agencies should take a stronger initiative in       partnering with our local communities to better understand       them before developing and awarding grants.        Thank you for the opportunity to comment on addressing       equity in government policies. We hope that this conversation       will be ongoing and that our comments will be useful as the       United States Government decides how best to address this       issue.            Quyanaq,                                                  John Hopson, Jr.,                                                         President.    Here is one. It is from the president of the Voice of  the Arctic Inupiat, John Hopson, Jr.         In terms of equity [racial equity] we understand that the       Biden Administration has made promises domestically and       internationally to curb this country's emissions and we, as       Inupiat people whose homelands are on the front lines of       climate change, can understand the need to move in that       direction when it comes to address government policies. What       we cannot support, however, is that those efforts are [often]       made on the backs of indigenous peoples in Alaska without       even a conversation, that is not how more equity is achieved.       The federal government must allow us time and resources for a       thoughtful, deliberate, and sustainable transition of our       economy but instead we have seen secretarial and executive       actions [from this administration] that threaten our way of       [life and] economic sustainability and therefore our [entire]       way of life [in America's Arctic].    Another group: Apparently, consultation with all indigenous groups in  the country, except for those in Alaska, is this administration's  policy.   So, bottom line, I need commitments from the Fish and Wildlife  Service on these issues: the Russian River land exchange, the King Cove  land exchange. More broadly, I need the administration to end its war  on Alaska and our working families.   I am happy to discuss with the Senator from Montana on these issues  and maybe get his help, but for right now, I object.    Well, to my colleague, I look forward to working with  you on that and those amendments and look forward to moving her  nomination forward in that light.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
