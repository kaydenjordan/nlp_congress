 Mr. Speaker, Republicans have threatened to repeal and  replace the Affordable Care Act for 7 years, but earlier this week,  they failed again to deliver on this threat. So next week, the Senate  will vote on a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a  replacement.   If this bill were to pass, 32 million people will lose their health  insurance, insurance premiums will go up, and insurance markets will  unravel. That is exactly why this bill will not pass. But Mitch  McConnell and the Republican leadership are going to have a vote  anyway.  [[Page H5989]]    What is the point?   The American people are sick and tired of Washington failing to get  things done. It is time--in fact, well past time--for Republicans to  stop going it alone. All of us came here to serve our constituents, but  that is not going to happen unless Republicans are willing to work in  good faith with Democrats to make the necessary improvements to the  Affordable Care Act.   If we work together, none of us will get everything we want, which is  true, but our constituents will finally get the progress they have been  waiting for, and that is much more important.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I rise in opposition to the rule and urge my colleagues to defeat the  previous question so that we can take up the legislation that has just  been outlined by Mr. Pascrell.   There is no more responsibility that we have than creating good- paying jobs for the American people; and this is, after all, according  to President Trump, ``Make It in America'' Week, which, in fact, is a  centerpiece of the Democratic agenda. We have a number of bills that  are designed to help reinvigorate and strengthen American  manufacturing.   It is shocking for the American people to learn that we have a Tax  Code, as Mr. Pascrell outlined, that gives a tax break to companies  that ship American jobs overseas, exactly the opposite of what it  should be if we are really concerned about creating good-paying jobs  here in our own country. So defeating the previous question means we  could take up the stop offshoring now legislation, which would get rid  of this nonsensical provision in our Tax Code.   When you go out there and talk to constituents, you say: One of the  reasons we can't keep good manufacturing jobs here in America is  because we incentivize, we use some of your tax dollars to incentivize  companies to ship those jobs overseas. It makes no sense.   So how about, during ``Make It in America'' Week, rather than just  using that phrase, as the President has done, let's do something that  will actually help promote making things in this country--I know,  probably a challenging concept for the President, who does his  manufacturing overseas, not in the United States.   Let's take a bold step today. Remove that provision of the Tax Code,  and have a Tax Code provision that actually incentivizes creating jobs  in our own country and giving tax credits to companies that create jobs  in America. What a novel idea.   I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that we can  take this piece of legislation up, and perhaps it will then encourage  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to move forward on a  number of bills that are part of the Democratic Make It in America  agenda to help rebuild American manufacturing and put people back to  work in good-paying jobs.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of the privileges of  the House and offer the resolution that was previously noticed.    Yes.    Mr. Speaker, this resolution raises the question of  the privilege of the House pursuant to rule IX, clause 1, as it  affects, ``the rights of the House collectively, its dignity, and the  integrity of its proceedings,'' insofar as it raises the House's  failure to undertake its constitutional responsibility of oversight and  the obligation of all elected officials to ensure decisions are made  free of conflicts and with the public interest in mind.   In particular, matters related to the House's constitutionally  granted powers have been recognized as valid questions of the  privileges of the House. The Origination Clause that requires that  revenue bills originate in the House includes the issues related to  revenues generated by our Tax Code.   Clearly, the issues raised by this resolution cover these matters  contemplated by the Origination Clause. There is nothing more of a  threat to the integrity of the House than ignoring our duty to provide  a check and balance to the executive branch.   To restore the dignity of the House, we must use our authority to  request President Trump's tax returns and give the American people the  transparency they deserve.   The stunning conflicts of interest are piling up as the President,  his family, and his friends profit in their personal business endeavors  while serving in public office. President Trump has not divested  himself from his businesses as was recommended.    I understand, Mr. Speaker. My point is, in order to  rule on this, it is important for the Chair to understand that the  severity of the questions with respect to the integrity of our  proceedings are undermined because of the potential conflicts of  interest and the lack of information about the tax returns and related  materials of the President.   So you can't make an argument about the rights of the House  collectively, its dignity, and the integrity of the proceedings without  understanding the presence, the evidence of the conflicts of interest,  of the potential foreign entanglements, of the self-dealing that tax  returns would reveal and help illuminate.   You also can't protect the integrity of our responsibilities as a  check on the executive branch without understanding that we have a  responsibility to examine these financial interactions, the influence  of the Russians, and interfering with our elections, the firing of  Director Comey, the secret meetings between the President's campaign.    Mr. Speaker, I understand the ruling of the Chair with  respect to confining my remarks. These remarks, in fact, relate  directly to whether or not this resolution, which seeks the production  of the President's tax returns, relate to ``the rights of the House  collectively, its dignity, and the integrity of the proceedings.''   What I am suggesting, Mr. Speaker, is that in order for the House to  fulfill its responsibilities, its constitutional responsibilities of  oversight, and check and balance on the executive branch and to  faithfully honor our responsibilities under the Origination Clause that  says the House is the place that revenue generation must begin--and we  are contemplating a reform of the Tax Code--in order to do that, free  from the potential conflicts of interest, the House and the American  people have a right to know what are the real interests of President  Trump, where are his investments, what are the tax policies, will they  benefit him, or will they benefit the American people.    Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the Chair.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
