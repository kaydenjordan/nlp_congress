 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition of  this bill because we have a crisis along our southern border.   We have record numbers of migrants seeking to come into our country.  The number of unaccompanied children illegally crossing the border  increased 63 percent last month. This is truly a humanitarian and  security crisis, but the current administration is not adequately  addressing it. In fact, they are not addressing it at all.   Instead of doing more to protect our border, the administration is  rolling back policies that discourage this kind of mass migration.   Today, we are considering a bill that does nothing to solve the  problem. In fact, it shows that there are no repercussions for breaking  our laws and encourages more to attempt to enter the country illegally.   We need a comprehensive and bipartisan solution to this crisis that  discourages entering illegally and rewards following the law.
