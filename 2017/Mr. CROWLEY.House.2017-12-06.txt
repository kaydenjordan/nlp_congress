 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I must have missed something in my religious training. Were there 11  Commandments by God? I know about the first 10, but I missed that 11th  one that thou shall have the ability to bear arms. I missed that one,  that God-given right.   Was it a God-given right for someone to take that God-given right and  execute 58 people at a concert? Was that a God-given right?   Mr. Speaker, the American people have spoken with nearly a unanimous  voice. They want Congress to keep their families safe by passing  commonsense gun safety legislation, legislation that will keep guns out  of the hands of criminals; protections that will keep those who want to  cause terror in our churches, in our schools, at concerts, and in our  communities from getting those firearms.   The bill before us does the exact opposite. It would force States  like New York to weaken their own gun safety laws and allow concealed  carry. It puts families like yours and mine at risk. And for what? To  appease the NRA? That is shameful.   In the 66 days since the Las Vegas massacre, Congress has done  nothing, absolutely nothing, to address the clear loopholes in our laws  that allowed one man to kill and injure so many.   It has been 66 days since numerous Republicans denounced the bump  stocks and promised a fix, only to turn around and do this bill. At a  time when we have seen one horrific mass shooting after another,  Republicans are forcing through a bill that will put each and every  American in harm's way. What is more, this egregious proposal comes  days before the fifth anniversary of the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook.   This will put us in further danger of another Las Vegas, another  Orlando, and another Sandy Hook. The American people are sick and tired  of this. They want this Congress to protect them, not enable criminals.
