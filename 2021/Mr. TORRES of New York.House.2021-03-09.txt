 Madam Speaker, a law is only as strong as the  power to enforce it. For far too long, the NLRB has been too powerless  to enforce the National Labor Relations Act. For too long, workers have  been left to largely fend for themselves in the face of retaliation and  intimidation and arbitration.   The PRO Act would breathe new life into the National Labor Relations  Act. It would empower the NLRB to impose civil penalties on and empower  workers to seek punitive damages against retaliatory employers. Most  importantly, the PRO Act would preempt the Orwellian right-to-work laws  so that union organizing is given the freedom  [[Page H1160]]  to flourish everywhere in the United States.   The PRO Act requires an employer to disclose every time it seeks the  services of a professional union-buster.                                time  1430    I am proud to introduce an amendment that requires DOL to make these  disclosures available through an app. App-based notification would  empower essential workers to be vigilant in defending their essential  right to organize.
