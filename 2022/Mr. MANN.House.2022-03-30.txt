 Madam Speaker, in preparation for reauthorizing the farm  bill in 2023, I rise today to deliver the sixth installment of my farm  bill impact series, where I am highlighting various aspects of the farm  bill that deserve Congress' awareness and support. For this legislation  to be effective, it must support the efforts of both today's farmers,  ranchers, and agricultural producers, as well as those of the next  generation.   I had planned to get up on the floor today to talk about how  America's hope for food security in the future lies on the shoulders of  young Americans who are voluntarily bearing the burden of feeding,  fueling, and clothing the world. I was going to talk about all the  great programs and organizations that we have in this country for young  people who are interested in agriculture. I was going to talk about the  new Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program through USDA, and  the importance of preserving the stepped-up basis in the Tax Code to  ensure that family farms in America don't get taxed out of existence.   Then President Biden's disastrous budget came out earlier this week.  President Biden threatens the stepped-up basis yet again as we know it  in the budget that he just released. If it becomes law, the food  security and, therefore, national security of America hangs in the  balance.   Here is why the stepped-up basis exists and why it is so important.  Let's say you are a young person working on your family's farm, and you  are slowly taking on responsibility and risk. You work for your parents  in the operation until the time comes for you to inherit the land,  equipment, and livestock. When that happens, the Federal Government  should not jump in and impose taxes on the unrealized gain of your  inherited land and assets. This principle is called the stepped-up  basis, which has long been precedent in the Tax Code.  [[Page H3977]]    The President's budget imposes new capital gains taxes at death,  which will kill family farms. This is appalling. America is trying to  recover from a pandemic, and farmers, ranchers, and agricultural  producers are struggling to survive as they cope with crises that this  administration has caused, like the broken supply chain and rampant  inflation. And now this administration wants to impose new taxes on  these people?   And the President didn't stop there. His budget also includes a new  capital gains tax that I am going to call the farm killer tax. In  Biden's budget, unbelievably, there is a proposal to impose capital  gains taxes on farms that have been in families for over 90 years.  Think about that. In 1940, the average cost of Kansas farmland was $50  per acre. Now, irrigated land is over $4,000 per acre. Imagine the  capital gains tax implications in that history of ownership. This  proposal would impose hundreds of thousands of dollars in new capital  gains taxes on farmers, killing their businesses overnight.   Again, I was going to stand here today and talk about how important  it is for Congress to support farmers, particularly the men and women  who operate family-owned-and-operated multi-generational family farms.  I was going to talk about how, in the name of supporting America's  incredible producers, Congress needs to think carefully and critically  about the programs we reauthorize in the 2023 farm bill.   I didn't expect that I would see the farm killer tax in the budget  this week. This new tax is not a game-changer, it is a game-ender for  thousands of family farms. I am, frankly, in disbelief.   Farming is a multi-generational calling. Farmers, ranchers, and ag  producers are my family and friends. They are America's heroes, and the  ideas in this budget, threatening the stepped-up basis and imposing the  new farm killer tax, are going to destroy the livelihoods of many in  agriculture and make our country less secure. The President needs to  wake up to reality. Farmers, ranchers, and agriculture producers have  earned our support, and his budget ideas are the opposite of that. They  are a gut punch to the people who feed, fuel, and clothe this Nation.   This week, I am introducing a bipartisan resolution, along with 66 of  my colleagues, that supports the preservation of the stepped-up basis,  opposes any efforts to impose new taxes on family farms and small  businesses, and recognizes the importance of generational transfers of  farm and small business operations. Again, this is something I was  going to do anyway because of how important preserving the stepped-up  basis is. Today, given Biden's disastrous budget, this message is more  important.   If we want to invest in the future of our country, which I think we  can all agree that we do, we need to invest in the next generation of  America's farmers, ranchers, and ag producers. I will be back on the  floor soon to deliver another installment of my farm bill impact series  and highlight more programs and titles within the bill that Congress  must understand and support to ensure that agriculture thrives in  America. Hopefully, when I am standing here to speak next time, I won't  have to address any more ideas that this administration may have had  for destroying the livelihoods of America's farmers, ranchers, and ag  producers. We must kill Biden's farm killer tax.                            ____________________
