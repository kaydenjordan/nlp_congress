 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Samuel D. Roberts for  his lifetime of service to the people of New York.   Sam's career began with General Motors, where he was a union worker  who served as chairman of the UAW Local 465 Education and Civil Rights  Committees. While at GM, Sam served five terms as an Onondaga County  legislator. Then the people of New York State's 128th Assembly District  sent him to represent them in Albany.   After 5 years in the State assembly, Governor Andrew Cuomo tapped Sam  to serve as commissioner of New York's Office of Temporary and  Disability Assistance, a $5.4 billion office that oversees more than  2,000 workers.   Sam recently retired from government to serve as a special advisor to  SUNY Oswego's president.   Throughout it all, Sam has kept community first. He has created  positive change that will last for generations both in Onondaga County  and throughout the State of New York.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating Samuel  D. Roberts, a pioneering community leader.                            ____________________
