 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the schedule for next week.   I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), our distinguished  majority leader.    Madam Speaker, I know the gentleman and I have been  having the conversation for well over a month now about this crisis at  the border. I am glad to hear that there is the possibility, maybe the  likelihood, that there will be legislation coming to the floor to  address the crisis.   I am also aware, as the gentleman is, that the Senate did just pass  legislation out of committee to address the crisis. It was a 30-1 vote,  a very bipartisan vote, to address the crisis.   In fact, I know that the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats in  the Senate, worked closely with the White House to get to a point  where, while they don't completely agree on all the details, it seems  clear that the White House would be able to have this bill signed by  the President, which, again, addresses the crisis before it becomes  imminent shutdown.   There was a letter sent just days ago, and Secretary Azar has been  making it very clear how serious of a crisis this is, literally to the  point where they are about to run out of money to take care of young  children who are coming over illegally, many of whom have serious  health problems.   They want to take care of these kids. They are properly taking care  of these kids, but they are about to run out of money to take care of  these kids.   They just sent an Antideficiency Act notice, which means they  basically are out of money that has been appropriated by Congress. It  would be a violation of the law to spend any money after they have run  out of money appropriated by Congress. Under this act, they can spend  money in violation of that law if it is to preserve life and safety.  They are at that critical of a point.   I make all of these points just to ask the gentleman: As we look at  the Senate bill, while it might not be ideal, it can be signed by the  President. We haven't seen any details of what my friend is working on  right now. I am not sure how closely the gentleman has been working  with the White House. Has the gentleman been working with the White  House to come up with a bill that can actually be signed by the  President in time to avert this crisis before they run out of money in  a matter of days?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    I just can't urge enough that as these conversations are  happening and as this work is going on over the weekend that it is work  not just among Democrat appropriators and Democrat leadership but that  the  [[Page H5023]]  majority is working with Republicans as well and with the White House  as well because we have been hearing that there may be some of what  would be considered poison pills that might be added.   There are things that the agency is doing. For example, HHS is trying  to find more places to house these children. They have over 13,000  children in their custody right now, in their care, and they want to  take care of them. They need the money to take care of them. They are  literally days away from running out of money to take care of them.   This is the midnight hour, but it is not the midnight hour because  they just dropped it. This has been known for over a month. They have  been asking for this money for over a month. They are days away from  running out.   If this becomes a game where only a partisan bill is brought to the  floor with poison pills that everybody knows the White House can't  support, when we have seen the Senate take action with a 30-1 vote on a  bill that the President can support, if a bill comes out of the House  that does have those kinds of poison pills and limits the ability of  the agency--not on the wall.   We are not even talking about all the other problems with the border  and things that are causing so many people to come over illegally. We  still have to deal with that. Now we are just talking about taking care  of these kids.   The Senate proved that they can pass a bill in a very bipartisan way  that can be signed by the President. We need to be working not just  among Democrats but among Republicans with the White House on a bill  the President can sign because if we don't pass a bill by the end of  next week--the gentleman from Maryland makes the schedule. He knows the  schedule. We are not here on July Fourth recess. Once we leave next  week, if we don't have a bill that the President can sign passed  through the House and through the Senate, they go into shutdown mode.  They will literally be in shutdown mode after the July Fourth recess.    The employees of HHS will not get paid. They will have to be finding  money to feed these young kids, over 13,000 of them, with moneys that  are not appropriated by Congress. They will be out of money.   I appreciate that the gentleman has a group working on a bill, but I  can't urge enough that this bill has to be bipartisan and in a way that  the President can sign by the time we leave next week. If we go to  conference because the House passes a partisan bill when the Senate  proved that they can come together and pass a very bipartisan bill 30-1  out of committee that the President will sign--we have to be working on  that same track.   Otherwise, if we leave next week without a bill that is signed by the  President, they go into shutdown. Those 13,000-plus kids who are being  treated will be being treated by HHS employees who won't be getting  paid and with money to feed them and take care of their healthcare  needs from who knows what account.   There is no money left. Again, this isn't a new problem. This has  been known for over a month. We have been urging action.   I would just urge that while the work is being done over the weekend,  can we get an assurance that it will be done in a way that we will be  working with the White House like the Senate did, Republicans and  Democrats, a 30-1 vote out of committee, that kind of approach as  opposed to an approach that might include some poison pills that  everybody knows then poison the well where it won't be signed by the  President?   I yield to the gentleman, Madam Speaker.    I thank the gentleman for that commitment because I know  that our teams will be talking. The leadership teams will be talking  and working, hopefully, completely together in a way where, when we  look at the Senate bill, there are components of the Senate bill that I  would prefer not be in there, and I know there are things that the  White House would rather not have in that bill, but there is give-and- take.   There has been give-and-take, and it has gotten to a point where they  at least recognize that, with the things that they might not want,  there are no poison pills in it. At least it gives them the tools they  need so that the agency can take care of those 13,700-plus kids who are  here.   We can talk all day about why a mother and father would send their  12-year-old daughter on a journey from another country into America,  but it is happening. When they come here, they need to be properly  taken care of, and that money is literally about to run out in days.    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    I appreciate that, and obviously, when you see that  somebody would send their child--let's use Guatemala as an example  because they are one of the countries where a lot of these young  children are coming from. They went through Mexico. Mexico offered them  asylum, and they turned that down and, ultimately, came to America.   I appreciate the fact that people look to America as that beacon of  freedom. We are the beacon of freedom for a lot of reasons.    One of the reasons is because we are a nation of freedom and laws. We  are a nation of laws, and we need to find a way to get back to the rule  of law so that we can have an immigration system that works for  everybody, not just for the people who come over one way but for the  people who follow the rule of law to come here legally.  [[Page H5024]]    Millions of people are waiting today to come to this great country  and ultimately will become part of the American Dream. They will add to  the richness and greatness of our Nation.   But as those 12-year-old children are coming over, they are right now  in the custody of HHS because of our laws. But under our law, they are  literally running out of money.   The HHS Secretary sent a letter to all of us over a week ago. In that  letter, he said that our valued Federal employees in ORR who care for  children and place them with sponsors would be required to work without  pay. That is from the Secretary of HHS. Under the law, his employees  would be required to work without pay if we break by the end of next  week without an agreement that is signed by the President to properly  fund the agency that is taking care of these 13,700-plus kids. That was  from the letter Secretary Azar and Secretary McAleenan, the Acting  Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, sent to every Member  of Congress over a week ago.   The agency has told us what the crisis is. They have told us they are  about to run out of money. They have sent the Antideficiency Act notice  to make it clear that under the law, if they run out of money, the only  money they can spend is for life and safety of those kids, and they are  going to be doing that.   But we can prevent that from happening. We need to prevent that from  happening.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, the gentleman and I need to and,  hopefully, will work closely together--not isolated, but together--over  the weekend to come up with a bill to solve this problem, recognizing  that the Senate is going to, hopefully, move their own bill that, while  flawed, does address the basic needs, so that those children can be  taken care of and the employees can be paid, and we can come together  and get a bill done by the end of next week.   The urgency of getting it done by the end of next week can't be  understated because, after that, they have made it very clear they do  run out of money. It is not a new issue. It is not something that is  thrown at us at the midnight hour. For more than a month this has been  identified.   So, I appreciate that we are going to work to get it done. Let's make  sure we do work to get it done.   I know there are a lot of other issues we can talk about: the  appropriations process, the need to come together on an agreement on  what the proper levels of spending are and should be, that the  President would also agree with us on, so that we can be writing  appropriations bills that would actually have the chance to get signed  into law and prevent a shutdown, that kind of impasse, by the end of  September.   This is the emergency, immediate need. There are other things that we  need to keep working on, and I look forward to working with the  gentleman in the coming days and weeks to address those problems as  well.   If the gentleman has anything else, I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, the political differences between the  parties are not mutually exclusive to Republicans. Clearly, we have had  ours within the Budget Committee.    Now that you are in the majority, the Democrats on the Budget  Committee could not come to an agreement amongst themselves about how  to get a budget, which is why the Democrat majority, the gentleman's  Democrat majority, didn't pass a budget. The first time in 9 years that  the Budget Committee hasn't produced a budget out of committee.   We produced all 8 years we were in the majority. We had differences,  clearly, and some of those were well written about in the press, but we  ultimately came together and passed our budgets, every year of the 8  years, out of committee.   Many of those not only got through the floor but went into law.  Sometimes we got those 2-year budget agreements so we didn't need the  second year.   This is the time to be working on negotiating our differences. I am  glad we are having these conversations on finding out if we can get to  a caps deal.   Even the Acting Chief of Staff, Mr. Mulvaney, who was mentioned,  would like to get a 2-year deal. I am sure he has some things he would  like in a deal that the gentleman wouldn't agree to, but that is going  to be negotiated. That is why we have negotiations in June, not in  September when it is the midnight hour.   So, I am glad we are having these talks now. Of course we have  differences within our parties, the gentleman's party and mine.  Ultimately, amongst ourselves, we will have differences, but the ideal  objective is that we come together well before the September 30  deadline.   That is why it is important that these discussions are being held  now, not in September, so that we can hopefully get that agreement and  then write appropriations bills.   I think the gentleman knows, the bills that he is moving through the  process this week, next week, are not bills that will be signed into  law, not only because, in many cases, the spending levels are well  above what we would agree to but, also, the many poison pill amendments  that will ultimately get worked out in a conference committee. They  won't be in a final product.   But let's at least try to get in agreement on a caps deal. We are in  a time frame where, at least, it is responsible to have these  differences earlier, not later, in the fiscal year.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    I do appreciate this is part of the process. And, again,  I say the reason that it is good that we are having these talks now is  because, as we have our differences--the gentleman within his own  party, the gentleman with us, us with the Senate, maybe with the White  House--we have time to work that out now, and we don't wait until mid- September, late September, to try to get that kind of agreement.    So, we will continue to have these discussions. I am glad we are  having these discussions at this early point so that it is not  midnight-hour discussions like we were talking about on the  supplemental.   Final point: I wanted to just commend the gentleman. We had a very  good meeting yesterday, our two leadership teams, with the Canadian  Prime Minister.   Mr. Trudeau was here to talk to us about a number of things. Of  course, USMCA is the most imminent and most up-front issue. Mexico just  passed the agreement.   I know we are having discussions to see if we can find a path forward  for the House to move USMCA and get a better deal with our partners,  both on the south and north, Canada and Mexico.   They loaned us Lord Stanley's cup. We are going to loan them the NBA  trophy for a little while. But, beyond those trade issues, we do, I  think, have some common ground on some trade issues that had been  needed to be resolved for a long time.   I know we are going to continue to have those discussions, Mr. Hoyer  with the White House, to hopefully get to a point where we can, then,  get that agreement in place. But I do appreciate that we had a very  productive, bipartisan meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr.  Trudeau, and we appreciated that he was here on behalf of his Nation.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    I am equally hopeful we can get that resolved, and I  appreciate the gentleman's work on that.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
