 Mr. Speaker, today, I am joined by my colleagues from  Virginia.   As you know, Mr. Speaker, this past Tuesday marked the 1-month  anniversary since we lost three Virginians in Charlottesville.   Today, my colleagues and I stand here to observe a moment of silence  in honor of Heather Heyer of Charlottesville, Virginia; Lieutenant H.  Jay Cullen of Midlothian, Virginia; and Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates  of Quinton, Virginia.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that the House now observe a moment of silence.                            ____________________
