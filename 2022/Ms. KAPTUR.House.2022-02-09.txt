 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today as co-chair of the 50-member  bipartisan Congressional Ukraine Caucus to voice our strong support for  Ukraine and her people.   Ukraine is the scrimmage line for liberty on the European continent-- our very closest allies. Right now, the world is watching with growing  alarm as Russia again beats the Kremlin's drums of war.   Vladimir Putin, with his thirst for force over reason and the rule of  law, is severely isolated from the norms of human decency and the  global community. Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014. Fourteen thousand  people have been killed. While Ukraine is Putin's most immediate  target, it certainly is not the only one he has his eyes on. As we have  watched, Russia has taken pieces of Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, and the  message is clear.   Thirty years ago, the people of Ukraine voted by more than 90 percent  to establish their independence. Ukraine was a signatory to the  Budapest Memorandum in which the West guaranteed Ukraine's security in  return for all nuclear weapons staged on its territory be removed.   Will the West keep its promise?   For decades, the Soviet Union held Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia,  Lithuania, Moldova, and so many others under its iron fist suppressing  any notion of freedom. We have a map here that clearly shows how small  Ukraine is compared to the vast Russian Empire. We are not talking  about equal partners here.   In 1991 the world rejoiced when, at long last, the Communist Iron  Curtain fell--a moment the free world did not expect to see in modern  time. Upon its fall, liberty and opportunity, which once had only been  dreams, now became new possibilities in Ukraine. Over these last 30  years, Ukraine has struggled to cast off Russian interference and grow  into a strong, proud, and vibrant nation. It has been a struggle every  day of every year.    Having visited Ukraine more than any other Member of Congress, I know  her people, her communities, her culture, and her struggle. In 2014 I  joined then-Vice President Joe Biden and Senator John McCain to attend  the inauguration of a new President of Ukraine. As our delegation  walked down the streets of the capital city, I can guarantee you, Mr.  Speaker, the applause and cheers that rang forth from the crowd as  America walked down the street was absolutely unforgettable and  astounding. Ukraine's freedom-loving people were exclaiming their love  and friendship with the United States, but, most of all, with the idea  of liberty. Liberty. It is a memory that I cherish and will never  forget.   The people of Ukraine, yes, they have hopes and dreams, and they want  to live with safety, stability, and enduring prosperity, but, most of  all, with liberty. Those hopes and dreams face constant threat by  Russia. It seems to never stop. Ukraine has no desire to have its back  broken under Russia's repressive command.   In 2014 Russia illegally invaded, as I mentioned, and now over 14,000  of her people have been killed in Ukraine. Over 1 million more have  been displaced, and the country probably has under 40 million people  now.   Russia's physical territory represents Goliath in his battle against  David. The maps clearly show how vast Russia is--over 13 time zones  compared to Ukraine.   We see the Russian military amassing at all the borders of Ukraine.  If Russia again invades Ukraine, the internal opposition would be  fierce and bloody, and that country suffered more than any other people  in the world during World War II, that infamous period of time when so  many Americans died on the European continent for the very idea of  liberty in Europe.   The response that is needed from global leaders is clear. When  freedom and liberty fall under attack, the free world has an obligation  to rise up in its defense.   The United States is doing its part. I support President Biden and  his administration having committed to end the Nord Stream 2 project if  Russia invades Ukraine further. We must continue to stiffen sanctions  and work to establish European energy independence and forge a global  defensive shield for the protection of Ukraine.                                time  1515    The United Nations, NATO, and the Organization for Security and Co- Operation in Europe have the ability to rally a global coalition to  ward off Putin and his thirst for domination over countries that do not  welcome him.   Russia cannot be allowed to operate as the outlaw on the European  Continent. So let us seek to build, not destroy. The time has come for  the free world to soundly reject Putin's ugly schemes and work together  to safeguard Ukraine now and forever.   There are several Members who are joining us here today on the floor  to participate in this Special Order. I would like to especially  recognize Brian Fitzpatrick, the co-chair of Ukraine Caucus from  Pennsylvania.   We also have, I believe, Congressman Kweisi Mfume of Maryland,  Congressman   Andy Levin of Michigan, and Congresswoman Victoria Spartz  of Indiana, thus far. I thank them all for being here.   I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Fitzpatrick for  his strong support of Ukraine and for the substance he has given from  his own life prior to his service here in the Congress of putting that  life at risk many times on behalf of liberty around the world. I thank  him so very, very much.   I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin), who is a very  fervent supporter of Ukraine, and thank him for adjusting his schedule  to be here with us this evening.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Levin for his leadership  on this, and we will work with him on the vigil at the Holodomor  Memorial here in Washington, D.C.   I thank the gentleman for taking the time to delay his flight back  home, I am sure, to be with us. The gentleman reminds me when we look  at the map of Russia in red and Ukraine in yellow, we think about David  and Goliath--at least I do--and David deserves attention and respect.   We thank you for your time this evening. And also I wanted to say to  Congresswoman Victoria Spartz from the State of Indiana who is joining  us this evening, sometimes the heavens produce someone in the Congress  at a moment in history that becomes pivotal.   As I introduce her, I thank her extremely for her excellent  participation in the Ukrainian Caucus, her leadership, and her ability  to change her schedule at any point in order to be a strong voice for  liberty. No one knows  [[Page H1110]]  better than she what it is like to live under a tyrannical, repressive  regime.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Spartz).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Spartz very much for  being here and for being such a strong voice for liberty, having known  the other side of that. I thank her for her time today, for her  heartfelt remarks. We continue to be benefited by her extraordinary  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, our final speaker today is the very distinguished  gentleman from the State of Maryland who knows a whole lot about the  rule of law and human rights.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Mfume), who  we are fortunate has returned to Congress after serving in so many  national positions. We are so grateful for his life and his presence  here today.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Mfume for his sterling  remarks. His presence here adds enormous value to what we are  attempting to do, to stop war, to promote diplomacy and peace, and to  help protect a David against a Goliath. This is a very noble calling.   As we close today, I want to say for the record, for teachers who may  be listening, for scholars, for other Members of Congress, there is a  book by Dr. Timothy Snyder of Yale University titled ``Bloodlands.'' If  you want to understand the struggle for liberty, that is a book that is  a must-read.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the call of the  Private Calendar be dispensed with on Tuesday, March 1, 2022.
