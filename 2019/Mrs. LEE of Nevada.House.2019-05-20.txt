 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott and Ranking  Member Foxx for their work in bringing this bipartisan Stronger CAPTA  to the floor; as well as Representative Watkins, for drafting our  bipartisan amendment that ensures that poverty alone cannot be used as  evidence of abuse and neglect.   The fight against intergenerational poverty has many fronts, but one  of the most important things we can do is preserve family stability for  as many children as possible. Families struggling with poverty need  supports to preserve stability, not additional toxic stress that can  alter child development.   Let me be clear: Abuse and neglect know no socioeconomic barriers.  Poverty alone is neither abuse nor neglect. I am proud that our  amendment will ensure that no child is removed from  [[Page H3992]]  their family solely because that family is living in poverty.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bipartisan  bill.
