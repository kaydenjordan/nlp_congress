 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  ``Clean Commute for Kids Act,'' which I introduced today.   I know firsthand how outdated diesel school buses expose our children  to harmful and unnecessary pollution. I grew up in the San Fernando  Valley and for many years, I rode a bus to school. I can still smell  the diesel exhaust that my classmates and I would breathe in on our way  to and from school.   Before the COVID-19 pandemic, nearly 25 million American children  were exposed to this same diesel exhaust when they ride over 500,000  predominantly diesel buses to school nationwide. This pollution not  only harms our children's health, but it also impacts student  achievement. Studies show that transitioning to cleaner bus fleets can  spur both health and academic improvements.   As we work to build back better and combat climate change, we must  help school districts accelerate the deployment of zero-emission buses  to reduce the exposure of our children to pollutants and cut greenhouse  gas emissions.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bill together with Senator  Warnock to authorize $25 billion for a new grant program to help school  districts replace existing buses with clean, zero-emission buses.   This funding represents an essential aspect of building more  equitable, sustainable transportation infrastructure, and it represents  an investment in our children, our environment, and our future.   This legislation recognizes the disproportionate impact this  pollution has on underserved populations by setting aside 40 percent of  the grant funding for replacing school buses serving environmental  justice communities.   Some of California's school districts have already begun the  transition to zero-emission buses. The California Air Resources Board  has leveraged federal funding to assist school districts and local air  boards with the costs of school bus replacements. This bill will  accelerate this transition and provide funding to reach more schools in  California and across the nation.   I want to thank Senator Warnock for co-leading this bill with me, and  I hope our colleagues will join us in support of this bill that would  transform our nation's school bus fleet, protect air quality, and  improve the health and wellbeing of our children.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself and Mr. Brown):   S. 1274. A bill to limit the authority of States or other taxing  jurisdictions to tax certain income of employees for employment duties  performed in other States or taxing jurisdictions, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on Finance.
