 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  50-year career of Deborah R. McBride, better known as Debby.   Debby was born to Clarence and Miriam McBride in Washington, D.C.  After graduating high school, she moved to Birmingham, Alabama, to  attend Birmingham-Southern.   During her senior year in college, she came to Capitol Hill and lined  up a job with former Democratic Congressman Bill Nichols and worked as  a caseworker until his death in 1988.   She stayed on with the office of Alabama's Third Congressional  District until Dr. Glen Browder, also a Democrat, was elected in a  special election in April of 1989. She continued her work as a  caseworker, as well as scheduling and office manager.   In 1996, Bob Riley was elected. Although a Democrat, Debby continued  to work for him through his three terms doing casework, serving as  office manager and taking on coordinating tours and flags.   I was elected in 2002 and, like before, Debby stayed on to work for  me, continuing in her roles and her service to east Alabama. Debby has  been with me since day one. If you polled the Third Congressional  District, she would certainly be more popular than me.   She has institutional knowledge that cannot be replaced, and I know I  will miss her very much. Debby has a heart of gold and has touched many  lives. The Third District of Alabama will not be the same without her.   Madam Speaker, please join me in thanking Debby for her unwavering  service to the people of Alabama and our country.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the  time.   Today I rise in strong support of securing our borders. There is a  crisis at the southwest border that can no longer be denied.   Changing demographics have created unprecedented challenges for  Border Patrol agents. Today, record large groups of women and children  from Central American countries are overwhelming Border Patrol  facilities and undermining the safety of migrants and staff.   Family apprehensions for fiscal year 2019 are already 800 percent  higher than fiscal year 2013.   Customs and Border Protection statistics indicate that border  apprehensions are on pace to hit a 10-year high.   Human smugglers are exploiting loopholes in our broken immigration  system and using children as visas to gain entry into the U.S.   Further, drugs are pouring through our porous borders. As you just  heard the gentleman mention, in fiscal year 2018, Customs and Border  Protection seized almost 900,000 pounds of drugs at the border, the  majority of which were seized between the ports of entry. That includes  approximately 2,000 pounds of fentanyl, which equals a lethal dose for  the entire United States population.   To address this crisis, we need an all-of-the-above solution to  border security that includes manpower, 21st century technology, and a  barrier. With this approach, we will stem the flow of drugs that are  devastating our communities. We will stop human smugglers and others  from crossing hundreds of miles of open desert with innocent children.   Border security used to be a bipartisan issue. I have been on the  Homeland Security Committee since it was established as a select  committee after 9/11.  [[Page H2811]]                                     time  1315    Not one time in the history of that committee has there been any  partisan dispute about the need for a barrier, the wall, until Donald  Trump became President, and now it is a toxic issue.   I stand by President Trump's actions to keep Americans safe, and I  encourage my colleagues to do the same. Vote against the effort to  override the President's veto.
