 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking member  for their support.   Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of S. 1438, the Gateway Arch  National Park Designation Act. And I would like to start by thanking  Senator Blunt and Congressman Clay for their leadership on this issue.  Renaming the Gateway Arch and the area surrounding it will finally make  its name consistent with how people from around the world identify it,  and our city. We are, indeed, the gateway to the West.   In 1935, the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial was created as a  unit of the National Park Service, and, today, it includes a museum,  the old St. Louis courthouse and the Gateway Arch National Monument. It  was built to honor the role that President Thomas Jefferson played in  opening the American West and the settlers who followed the footsteps  of Lewis and Clark and their Corps of Discovery.   In addition, it encompasses the old St. Louis courthouse, where Dred  Scott filed suit seeking his freedom, furthering the fight to ensure  that all men are, indeed, created equally. It was also the site where,  in 1872, Virginia Minor asserted that women were  [[Page H753]]  citizens of the United States and, therefore, were entitled to vote.   The Gateway Arch itself is the largest man-made monument in the  United States of America and has been welcoming visitors to the banks  of the Mississippi River since its construction in 1965.   When people come to visit the Gateway Arch National Park, the name  will now reflect the Gateway Arch, but it will stand for so much more.  Visitors will see how St. Louis embodies its history as the Gateway to  the West.   Explorers, settlers, civil rights leaders, and many more have passed  through our city and found promise in what lies ahead. That is the  spirit our city embodies, and the name of our national park will now  match what is at the heart of our culture.
