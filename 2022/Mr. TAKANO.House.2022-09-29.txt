 Mr. Speaker, I honor the life and lasting legacy of an  [[Page H8226]]  LGBTQ pioneer in my district, David St. Pierre.   David was the longtime owner of The Menagerie, a welcoming LGBTQ  nightclub and restaurant in downtown Riverside.   Since taking ownership in 1999, David made it his purpose to  cultivate an inclusive safe haven for the LGBTQ community of Riverside  and the surrounding Inland Empire, while adding in a touch of fun,  lively entertainment.   He did that for just over 20 years. With his passion for throwing an  extravagant party, his experience in generating crowd enthusiasm as the  host of many events, and a keen eye for craft and style from his  background in theater, David was always the life of a fabulous time.   He made a name for himself within the LGBTQ community and was highly  regarded for standing up to hate crimes and injustice and declaring  that homophobia will have zero tolerance in our community.   In the words of Harvey Milk, ``I know you can't live on hope alone,  but without hope, life is not worth living.'' David, you gave our  community hope, hope to live freely, be accepted, and continue to fight  for LGBTQ rights. You will be greatly missed but never forgotten. On  behalf of the constituents of California's 41st Congressional District,  thank you for your commitment to the LGBTQ community and to our  community as a whole.                            ____________________
