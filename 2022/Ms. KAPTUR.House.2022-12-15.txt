 Mr. Speaker, I rise to share a good news story from  Ohio's Ninth Congressional District.   During this holiday season, I humbly ask all Americans to do what  they can to buy goods made right here in the USA. What America makes  and grows, makes and grows America.   Recently, I had the pleasure of patronizing two longstanding Toledo  businesses, Fulkerson Jewelers and Clock Shop and Keystone Press. Both  are small legacy businesses in the heart of our community. Together,  they have existed for well over 160 years.   Both establishments and their able, friendly staff embody American  ingenuity, craftsmanship, hard work, and perseverance.   At Fulkerson, a friendly young repairman replaced the battery in my  watch in the blink of an eye. He even does laser welding.   At Keystone, I dropped off materials to print for our office holiday  mailings. This printing shop has been in business for over 100 years.   Small family businesses embody all the charm, diversity, and  creativity of America. So may I urge all Americans this holiday season  to buy local, buy American, and support your hometown businesses that  build and grow America.                            ____________________
