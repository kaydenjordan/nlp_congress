 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the official  start of the 2018 hurricane season and to promote American resiliency.   The 2017 hurricane season brought with it 17 named storms, of which  six were major hurricanes. These storms caused widespread destruction  and devastation, and no individual or family should have to ever endure  that again.   As a resident of Staten Island, where the impact of Superstorm Sandy  can still be felt, my district in New York City has also seen this kind  of widespread destruction.   Importantly, the Army Corps of Engineers is constructing a major  seawall to protect my constituents from future storms.   With the 2018 hurricane season now underway, we must ensure that we  are as prepared as possible to protect ourselves, our loved ones, our  homes, and our communities.   This means double-checking insurance policies; signing up for local  alerts and warnings, as well as apps, like Notify NYC; and putting  together emergency kits.   For the 2018 season, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration is forecasting a 70 percent likelihood of 10 to 16 named  storms, of which one to four could become major hurricanes.   While we cannot control where these hurricanes will make landfall, we  can control our resiliency.   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response,  and Communications, I hope that all Members will join me in promoting  the importance of preparedness.                            ____________________
