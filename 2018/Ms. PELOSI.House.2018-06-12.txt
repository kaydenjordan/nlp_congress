 Mr. Speaker, I am very delighted to join my colleague  from the bay area, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, in wearing the blue and  the gold to celebrate the new American dynasty, the Golden State  Warriors.   On Friday, as you probably know, the Warriors swept the great team,  the Cleveland Cavaliers, led by LeBron James--what a magnificent  athlete--making the victory all the more sweet to secure the 2018 NBA  championship, the Warriors' third title in 4 years.   This historic achievement secures Golden State's position as not only  the best team in the sport, but as an extraordinary force in ushering  in a new era of professional basketball and transforming the future of  the sport.   The Golden State Warriors are distinguished by both their talent and  their extraordinary teamwork. The 2018 Warriors played with exceptional  chemistry and intuitive brilliance on the court, dazzling America with  their true strength in numbers   Steph Curry, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, MVP twice in a row Kevin  Durant, played with extraordinary skill, strength, and determination,  each making history in their own way.  [[Page H5029]]    Golden State continues to make the bay area and America proud with  their leadership, both on and off the court. Led by the extraordinary  Coach Kerr--indestructible, he is--the Warriors honor our American  values of equality, fairness, and respect for all with their words and  their actions.   It gives me great pride to be a member of Dub Nation. Right,  Congresswoman Lee? We are members of Dub Nation, and I extend my  invitation to the Warriors. Joining Congresswoman Lee, who represents  Oakland, we join in extending an invitation to the Warriors to once  more come to the Capitol to celebrate this historic accomplishment.   On behalf of San Francisco, I extend well-deserved congratulations to  the Golden State Warriors.                            ____________________
