 Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of rights listed in  our Bill of Rights. In the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights, there  are five rights that are mentioned. The first right in the First  Amendment is mentioned first, in my opinion, because it is the most  important right, and that is the right of religious freedom.   If you notice the wording in that right, it protects the right to  freely exercise one's religion. It is more than believe whatever you  want to believe religiously. You have the right to practice your  religion and freely exercise it. Wise words from the Founders and the  writers of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.   Now we have a situation in our country where that right is being  threatened. Even this morning, the attempted terror attack should  remind us that we need to be vigilant of the war on terror because  people, in the name of terror, commit crimes against other Americans  because they hate them. They hate their religion and what they stand  for.   This year, more than 100 bomb threats and other threats of violence  have been made against 81 Jewish community centers. A Jewish community  center is not the synagogue, but sometimes it is close to it. It is  where the Jewish kids and adults go for community.   There have been over 100 bomb threats just this year against 81  Jewish community centers in 33 States. Many of these centers were  forced to close because of the threat that was made against them.                                time  1745    These attacks are clearly directed at these facilities due to the  religious nature of the buildings and the religious activities that go  on there.   Despite this fact, terroristic threats against community religious  centers are currently not punished as hate crimes under Federal law.   This bipartisan legislation would amend the Church Arson Prevention  Act to ensure that other individuals, who make bomb threats and other  credible threats of violence against community religious centers based  on the religious nature of that center, can be prosecuted under our law  as a hate crime.   The bill also adds new language that would create a penalty of up to  5 years imprisonment if any violation of the statute results in damage  or destruction to the property.   We must make it abundantly clear that we will not tolerate acts of  violence and hate against any group in America, especially religious  groups. It is incumbent upon us, as Congress, to make sure that the  First Amendment is protected, and that is our job: to protect religious  freedom.   I urge support of this legislation, and I thank the chairman for  bringing it to the floor.   And that is just the way it is.    Mr. Speaker, the auctioneer shouted: ``Does anybody  want to buy a worker? Here is a worker, a big strong man. He will dig.   ``What is the bid? What is the bid?   ``Sold to the highest bid of $400.''   Mr. Speaker, West Africans go to Libya thinking that they will get a  job in Europe but, instead, are sold in Libya to labor and sex  traffickers. These Africans simply seek a new life, free from  terrorism, persecution, and famine; however, they become victims of  modern-day slavery.   In the years following the United States' overthrow of the Libyan  Government, the nation became a failed state. Sinking further into  despair, the failed state became a brothel of slavery: human sex and  labor trafficking. People are bound to the slave block and sold at the  marketplace of sex slavery and labor trafficking.   Mr. Speaker, slavery is a crime against humanity, and the United  States must exercise caution when toppling regimes without  understanding the long-term consequences like human slavery.   And that is just the way it is                            ____________________
