 Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to amendment  No. 3074.   Agriculture is the economic engine of Nebraska, and the beef industry  is the largest segment of Nebraska agriculture.   In fact, in Nebraska, cattle outnumber people by more than three to  one.   The industry plays a critical role in my State's economic viability  with nearly $7.2 billion in annual cash receipts.   Nebraska is also the No. 1 cattle-on-feed State, illustrating our  commitment to provide American families and dinner tables around the  world with affordable, safe, high-quality Nebraska beef.   As a Nebraska cattle rancher, I understand the purpose of the  checkoff program and its direct impact on producers' ability to market  their products.   It is an investment into the future of my State's No. 1 industry.   Funds collected from producers are used for research and promotion  programs designed by producers to benefit the entire industry.   Producer control has been a defining feature of the beef checkoff  since its inception and is what drives its success.   Since 1985, producers have proven perfectly capable of deciding how  to spend their money and should be allowed to continue to do so.   This amendment would harm agricultural producers and the rural  communities they support.   I strongly urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.   Thank you.
