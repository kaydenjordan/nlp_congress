 ROSE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)    ROSE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, today, I rise with my  colleague from Tennessee, Mr. Cooper. As he has already indicated,  earlier today, a devastating tornado tore through Middle Tennessee,  including much of the area that I represent and call home.   While rescue workers are still in the critical phase of sorting  through debris and accounting for those who are still missing, we know  already that many lives have been lost and dozens of people were rushed  to emergency rooms.   I, along with countless Tennesseans, are lifting those people up in  prayer, and we hope that everybody will join us.   I am working diligently alongside my fellow Representatives, the  administration, Governor Lee, Senators Alexander and Blackburn, and  emergency officials to get much-needed Federal aid to the affected  areas.   Homes, schools, businesses, churches, farms, and other buildings and  numerous communities have suffered serious and, in some cases,  overwhelming damage.   I stand today with those affected by this disaster and pledge every  effort will be made to give shelter to those who need it, give care to  those who are hurt, and give assistance in the critical effort to  recover and rebuild.                            ____________________
