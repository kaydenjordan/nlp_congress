 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the $1.9  trillion spending boondoggle that is going to be on the House floor  this week.   While there are many irresponsible and careless facets of this bill  worth noting, the elimination of alternative wage programs for workers  with disabilities is one of the most devastating aspects of this bill,  impacting over 5,800 Missourians and thousands more across our Nation.   In fact, this provision will likely cause the end of these programs.  By doing that, it will strip many individuals of their voice, workplace  family, independence, and sense of community.   That is why I am offering an amendment to protect the choices and  voices of the Missourians next to me. They deserve a government that  supports their efforts, not one that runs them out of business.   With only 35 percent of individuals with disabilities employed in the  competitive market, it is our duty to look for ways to expand  employment opportunities for them, not diminish them. I urge my  colleagues to support this amendment and, if it does not pass, please  oppose this bill.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 5,  the so-called Equality Act.   This bill should be called the inequality act as there is nothing  equalizing about it. In fact, this bill hijacks the Civil Rights Act,  codifying inequality into Federal law. Simply put, this piece of  legislation blatantly discriminates against women, girls, parents,  people of faith, and many more.   To start, H.R. 5 dismantles Title IX, ending equal opportunity for  females in education and sports. Similar policies are already wreaking  havoc at the local level. In Connecticut, the State's Interscholastic  Athletic Conference accepts boys who identify as females in their  competitions. Two of these male athletes have gone on to claim 15  women's track championship titles since 2017.   As someone who enjoyed playing sports and coaching high school track  for many years, imagining the damage these policies will cause to women  and girls is heartbreaking.   The inequality act further discriminates against a woman's right to  privacy and protection, especially while seeking refuge in a domestic  violence shelter. We have already seen similar policies in Alaska and  California put vulnerable women in danger.   H.R. 5 also discriminates against parents. Parents who dare to oppose  doctors performing life-changing surgeries or using hormone-altering  drugs on their children will be considered abusive and neglectful. This  has already happened in Ohio as a couple lost custody of their daughter  after advocating against male testosterone supplements.    This abhorrent destruction of parental rights is why I introduced an  amendment that would ensure parents retain their right to make  important choices for their children, especially concerning mental and  medical care. Predictably, Democrats did not even consider my  amendment, highlighting their desire to silence the voices of families  across the country.   Faith-minded individuals and organizations would also face  discrimination under the inequality act, including adoption agencies  and charities. Again, similar policies already exist in New York,  Illinois, and Pennsylvania, forcing faith-based adoption agencies to  shut down rather than violate their sincerely held religious beliefs.  These policies only harm would-be parents and children in need of a  forever home.   Shockingly, it doesn't stop there. The inequality act clearly  stipulates that religious beliefs and faith no longer matter in the  Democrats' new world order. Living by your faith will be viewed as evil  instead of good.   Sadly, this bill contains no language to protect businesses or  healthcare providers from being forced to pay for abortions. It also  may require healthcare providers to facilitate abortion services.   The biggest impact? Hundreds of thousands more innocent, unborn  children will tragically perish from abortion, with Americans footing  the bill.   This grossly misnamed bill punishes everyday citizens, silences free  speech, and instills discrimination. I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no.''
