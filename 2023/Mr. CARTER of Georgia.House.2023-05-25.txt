 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Jewish American Heritage Month.   The Jewish-American community has played a critical part in shaping  American culture and history since the country's inception. The Jewish  community in my home district has strong roots, going back all the way  to when Georgia was first founded as a colony.   In Savannah, Georgia, you can find Congregation Mickve Israel, or the  Hope of Israel, which is one of the oldest synagogues in the United  States and the first synagogue built in Georgia.   Historic communities like the Hope of Israel synagogue highlight the  importance of Jewish-American communities in Georgia's past, as well as  how they continue to impact Georgia today.   It is a pleasure to be able to honor the Jewish-American community  that has had such a big impact on both Georgia's and America's history.                            ____________________
