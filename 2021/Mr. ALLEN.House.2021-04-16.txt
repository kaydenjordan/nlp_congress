 Madam Speaker, during the first week of April, the world's  top golfers are invited to my hometown of Augusta, Georgia, as they  compete in the most prestigious tournament in the world known as The  Masters. As people from around the world visit the Augusta National  Golf Club or tune in from the comfort of their homes, they get to  experience a tradition unlike any other.   After the 2020 Masters Tournament was postponed to the fall with no  spectators due to the pandemic, there was a lot of excitement to be  back this year--even at limited capacity.  [[Page H1849]]    Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Ridley and members of Augusta  National for putting on a safe and memorable tournament this year.   And I want to extend my personal congratulations to the 2021 Masters  Champion, Hideki Matsuyama. He is the first-ever Japanese professional  golfer to win a men's major golf championship, and he has made his  nation of Japan very proud.   Hideki is an inspiration to young golfers around the world, showing  that you can reach the pinnacle of your profession through dedication  and hard work.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1195.   Madam Speaker, our healthcare and social service workers deserve  tremendous praise for their work over the past year, as they have faced  unprecedented challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. They also  deserve protections, as they face a significant risk of workplace  violence.   This complex issue deserves an evidence-based solution, not a rushed  and costly top-down government mandate.   Unfortunately, H.R. 1195 would prevent workers and stakeholders from  giving meaningful input based on experience regarding how to address  this highly technical issue. It forces the Occupational Safety and  Health Administration, or OSHA, to issue an interim final workplace  violence prevention rule within 1 year, significantly impacting the  healthcare industry as they remain on the front lines of combating this  pandemic.   I have heard firsthand from our healthcare facilities--especially our  rural hospitals--that the pandemic has caused serious financial  struggles, and many are already at risk of closure.   The CBO estimates that the rushed rule will cost private entities at  least $1.8 billion in the first 2 years that the  [[Page H1856]]  rule is in effect and $750 million annually after that. For public  facilities, it will cost at least $100 million in the first 2 years and  $55 million after that.   The last thing our healthcare facilities need right now is another  costly top-down mandate from Washington.   Our Founders envisioned a government by the people. I am always  amazed that the intellectuals in this town know more about solving  problems than the great people on the front lines. My colleagues are  approaching this issue the wrong way. We must address this from the  bottom up by empowering healthcare workers, hospital leadership, the  scientific community, and the public to have a say in the development  of a new comprehensive standard.   That is why I oppose this bill today and I urge my colleagues to  ensure our healthcare workers and caregivers are protected in the  workplace by allowing them to give their input directly.
