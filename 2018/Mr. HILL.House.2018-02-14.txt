 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to come before  the House during this rules debate on this package of bipartisan bills  that have been worked on for two Congresses now and that address a  number of issues that I think Members on both sides of the aisle and  our committee recognize would improve the capital market system,  improve access to capital for business and consumers, and, also, reduce  the red tape, the bureaucracy associated with trying to run a community  bank and provide services to our consumers, both businesses and  families, that has been made so challenging since the passage of the  Dodd-Frank Act almost 8 years ago.    You know, I was coming to Washington yesterday, and I was reading the  weekend business section. There was a story there about Richard Griffin  from Crossett, Arkansas, who has owned a community bank there for  decades. It is about a $30 million, $35 million bank.   He just said that, with his 13 employees, he just couldn't comply  with the level of regulatory burden following Dodd-Frank that was so  geared to our biggest financial institutions, our most complex  financial institutions, companies like those headquartered up in New  York. He just felt compelled to exit the business and leave that town,  leave the local board of directors, the local management team, and turn  it over to an out-of-State company.   Crossett, Arkansas, is a fine town, and it deserves a good banking  presence by a number of competitors, home to Georgia-Pacific and all of  their activities there.   Mr. Speaker, these bills are, as I say, bipartisan, and they are  needed across this country. Let me just touch on a few of them.   The ones that I think provide the most benefit to community bankers  and businesses and customers of those local banks are, first of all,  Mr. Stivers' bill, which eliminates a barrier, a well-intended  licensing provision if you wanted to make mortgage loans after the '08  crisis.   Congress thought it was a good idea to make sure that mortgage  lenders were qualified, so they made them get a license. We can debate  whether that was too much work or not or whether it was worthwhile or  not. They made bankers get it and nonbanks.   But in this bill, Mr. Stivers simply says, if you are going to try to  change jobs and you hold a mortgage license, that you just have a  transition period where you don't have to go requalify for that if you  are going to work for a nonbank or you are going to work for somebody  in another State. It only passed our committee 60-0, so it doesn't get  much more bipartisan than that. That will help banks reduce red tape,  recruit loan officers, and get them to work faster serving customers.   Likewise, the TRID Improvement Act of 2017 is something that I worked  on in a variety of ways, and it is included in this package. It allows  States where you can buy both a personal policy for your title  insurance as well as the title coverage for a closing to show you the  real discount.   Mr. Speaker, the real irony here is that, when Elizabeth Warren was a  staffer and a college professor, one of her goals for the CFPB was  simplification, that we take all these complicated forms and we would  make them easier to use.   Well, here is an example of the exact opposite. The new Truth in  Lending forms for real estate settlements were made more complicated.  After 8 years of dealing with it, this was a classic example of trying  to make it simpler.   Let's actually show the consumer what the real closing costs are for  their title insurance. This will speed mortgage closings. This will  reduce errors in mortgage closings. This will reduce consumer confusion  about the so-called Know Before You Owe rule. I would argue this rule  has made it much more difficult to know what you owe before you borrow  it, and this is a small step in improving that.   Mr. Speaker, these things help our community banks.  [[Page H1143]]    There is one other in this package we are considering today, Mr.  McHenry's bill, which allows community banks that originate loans,  consumer loans, commercial loans, that are selling those loans to a  nonbank, a nonbank servicer or a nonbank packager, to be able to pass  through the rate that they originated the loan for. There was a Supreme  Court case that has made that more complicated, that said you can't  pass through the rate and that State banking laws don't preempt our  State usury laws for this kind of work.   So I commend Mr. McHenry for this, because this improves liquidity to  our community banking system and, again, lowers rates for consumers,  makes products more accessible, and makes our small community banks  more competitive.   I will close by just touching on a couple of other measures that I  think help businesses, help capital markets, help capital flow.   One, you just heard my friend from California (Mr. Royce) talk about  his bill. That will help capital markets flow. That will create parity  among our exchanges, lowering costs for companies that want to go  public and have their action there, raise capital on the public  markets.   Mr. Duffy has a bill that requires the SEC to actually get a subpoena  if they want to get source code from a capital markets provider,  someone who is managing money, someone who is offering to manage  portfolios or offer a mutual fund company, and this is very, very  helpful. I think, when you want to get your secret sauce for your  business and the government wants it, they ought to have a subpoena.   That is all that this bill does. It doesn't change the rules about  that. It doesn't change anything other than saying, if you want this  information, you ought to go and get a subpoena, and I believe that  will improve capital formation.   So, Mr. Speaker, these are good bills. These are bipartisan bills.  These are bills that we have worked on for two Congresses that will  help consumers, increase access to credit, lower the cost of that  credit, and increase capital flows to the business sector to support  the growth that the American people want.   I appreciate the Rules Committee allowing me to speak on these bills.  I appreciate Chairman Hensarling putting them together.   And to my friends on the other side, these are bills that went  through regular order.                                time  1300    These are bills that are bipartisan. These are bills that have the  support of the opposition. We have put them together in a bipartisan  package today under this rule because our friends down the hall in the  United States Senate are rapidly moving a bipartisan package of  improvements for our capital markets and our banks, something that we  want, something that we have waited some 8 years for. So this allows us  to work better with our colleagues over in the Senate, where 14  Democrats have partnered with Senator Crapo on the Banking Committee to  move bipartisan legislation that will help us grow our economy.    Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 3978, the  TRID Improvement Act.   I want to focus my comments on the actual improvements to the Truth  in Lending and RESPA form, TILA-RESPA, which is now referred to as  TRID.   Back in 2010, when Dodd-Frank was being considered, one of the goals  that then-White House staffer Elizabeth Warren, now Senator Elizabeth  Warren, had was: Well, we are going to make this a win for both banks  and consumers. One of the things we are going to do is we are going to  make forms simpler and consumer disclosure better. America's exhibit A  today is the TILA-RESPA form.   TILA was about truth in lending, and let's make sure the interest  rate you are going to pay on your mortgage is calculated right, it is  accurate. And RESPA, the Real Estate Settlement Act, said that whatever  you were paying in extras, such as title insurance, was disclosed  accurately.   Well, we now flash forward a number of years.   Back in 2013, the CFPB finalized this new, combined rule, the TRID  rule: know before you owe. It should have been called: know before you  confuse.   This rule, finalized in 2013, was still subject to delay due to  errors that the CFPB made, and it finally got put in place back in  2015.   There was $1.5 billion in software compliance costs for banks to try  to merge this form that is supposed to be so simple and so easy for  consumers. The CFPB offered no concrete guidance about it. So this  House came together and over 300 Members of this House voted to direct  the CFPB to improve this rule; that it was not a success story.   So, in fact, in April 2016, the CFPB decided to open the rulemaking  for TILA-RESPA and try to find some clarifying and amending procedures  that would make it more clear.   Well, as you can hear, it is a massive, complex rule that is  expensive. The American Bankers Association said if there was one thing  to fix in consumer compliance, it would be TILA-RESPA; the TRID. It  wouldn't be the qualified mortgage definition. It wouldn't be all the  capital rules embedded in Dodd-Frank. It would be this rule.   When I have been at home in my district, I have heard about it  countless times from mortgage bankers and community bankers.   So we are still not there, which is why we are here today, Madam  Speaker. And that is, this bill does one simple thing, which says: if  you buy a title insurance policy, in the majority of States, the CFPB  rule is not accurate.   You can see here that the rule for Arkansas on a $200,000 sales price  house says that the consumer should pay $382.50 after this complex  formula when, in reality, they are really paying either $525 or the  actual charge of $35. So it is not an improvement.   In these States, the CFPB is not allowing for the calculation of a  discounted rate, known as a simultaneous issue, which is a rate title  insurance companies provide to consumers when they purchase both the  lender's and owner's title policy simultaneously.   Madam Speaker, this bill offers clarity and actually takes a complex  rule and makes this part of it simpler so our consumers actually will  see on the closing statement what the cost of the title insurance is.  It will be transparent.   There are many other challenges with this rule, and we have talked  about them in our committee. Today, we are only debating and discussing  one small one.   But I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--when this bill  came out of our committee--bipartisan--this is a bill that Members of  Congress have heard from across this country and all 50 States from  community bankers, mortgage bankers of all sizes who are trying to  provide an accurate, fast closing for our most important thing we do as  a family, and that is to decide to buy a home.   I thank the chairman of the full committee for yielding. I urge my  colleagues to support this full package of bipartisan bills through  regular order, through our committee, and that are presented here to  improve our economy, improve the balance in our regulatory system, and  help make credit more accessible for consumers at better prices.
