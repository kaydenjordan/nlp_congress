 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute as in morning business.    Madam President, yesterday, we had debate on the Green  New Deal. I wonder how many Americans realize that this debate on the  Green New Deal was not on a bill before the Congress that would become  law but was on nothing but a nonbinding resolution. Rather than working  on specific changes in the law, the authors chose vague aspirations for  dramatic action in the future. That is the difference between an active  environmentalist and an environmental activist.   I am proud of my accomplishments that have had a real, positive  impact on the environment. For instance, I authored the production tax  credit for wind energy back in 1992. During my leadership on the Senate  Finance Committee in the 2000s, I oversaw the establishment,  enhancement, and renewal of numerous clean energy tax incentives.   My point is not to say that I made some impact on the environment but  to say that there is a difference between offering a bill and, in turn,  just a nonbinding resolution, which--the Democrats haven't put forth  any real law.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition Of The Majority Leader
