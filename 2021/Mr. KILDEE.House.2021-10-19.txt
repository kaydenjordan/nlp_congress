 Madam Speaker, last week I lost my uncle, and the people  of my State and this country lost a leader, former Congressman Dale  Kildee.   Our hearts go out to my Aunt Gayle, and to my cousins David, Paul,  and Laura, who are experiencing the kind of loss that I and so many of  us know far too well.   He served here for 36 years, and he believed that this place, this  Congress, and our government could be a force for good.   During that time, he had many, many legislative accomplishments  around education, the environment, things that he cared deeply about,  but I think perhaps his greatest contribution was the fact that he  served here so long and left with so many friends because he served  here with dignity, with kindness to everyone, with respect for everyone  regardless of their position or their point of view.   I hope we can remember him for that, and I hope we all take note of  that. It is an important message, especially now.   He believed that the role of government was to preserve, to protect,  to defend, and to enhance human dignity. His life was a testament to  that promise.   I would ask all present to join us in a moment of silence for my  Uncle Dale.                            ____________________
