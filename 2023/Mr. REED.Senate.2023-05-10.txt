 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, today I am introducing the Rhode Island  Fishermen's Fairness Act along with my colleague Senator Whitehouse. I  am also pleased that my colleague Representative Magaziner will be  introducing a companion measure in the House of Representatives.   Our legislation will give Rhode Island a voice and voting  representation on the Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council, MAFMC,  which manages some of the most important fish stocks for our State's  commercial fishing industry--chief among them squid. Indeed, the  National Marine Fisheries Service reported that Rhode Island led  Atlantic States in the harvest of squid in 2022, bringing in 31.5  million pounds and helping make Point Judith, RI, one of the most  productive and valuable commercial fishing ports in the United States.  For years now, Rhode Island's landings of stocks managed by the MAFMC  have outpaced the landings of those managed by the New England Fishery  Management Council, where Rhode Island is represented. Moreover, Rhode  Island has a larger stake in the Mid-Atlantic fishery than many of the  States that currently hold seats on the MAFMC.   Because so much is at stake for our State in every decision the MAFMC  makes, our bill would expand the MAFMC by two seats in order to ensure  that Rhode Island will have the minimum number of seats guaranteed to  other States on the council. It will allow Rhode Island to continue to  have representation on the New England Fishery Management Council,  where it still has significant interests.   This proposal is not unprecedented. In fact, it is modeled on a  provision of the 1996 Sustainable Fisheries Act that added North  Carolina to the MAFMC in 1996 while allowing it to retain its  membership on the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council. Moreover,  it will join States like Florida  [[Page S1606]]  and Washington which all have representation on more than one fisheries  management council.   This is a commonsense proposal and one that my colleagues and I will  be working to advance either on its own or as part of the  reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and  Management Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. Warner):   S. 1523. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow  rehabilitation expenditures for public school buildings to qualify for  rehabilitation credit; to the Committee on Finance.
