 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and  Communities Act. This bill is the product of many months of hard work  by several committees in the House and Senate. It is important that we  pass this bill today as another step in addressing the opioid crisis  that is ravaging every community in our Nation.   Last year, a record 72,000 Americans died of drug overdoses; that is  about 200 people dying every day, and this is a national crisis that is  devastating families and that this Congress must act on.   And while this legislation will not solve every problem, I do believe  it includes important policies that will help turn the tide of this  tragic opioid epidemic. It will also improve treatment options for  those battling other substance-use disorders.   I am proud that H.R. 6 builds upon CARA, the Comprehensive Addiction  and Recovery Act, by including a provision championed by my colleague,  Congressman Tonko, that would allow all advanced practice registered  nurses to treat patients with bupe for opioid-use disorder. It also  gives nurse practitioners and physician assistants the authority to  treat patients with bupe permanently, and it codifies the 275 patient  physician cap. This is a critical step in expanding access to the  treatment of these drugs, one of the major challenges that we continue  to face in the fight against this epidemic.   Mr. Speaker, the legislation also expands access to coverage. It  includes an important provision that I worked on with Ways and Means  Committee Ranking Member Neal that expands Medicare coverage of opioid  treatment programs and medication-assisted treatment.   In the Medicaid space, I am pleased to see the inclusion of several  Democratic priorities. This bill requires State Medicaid programs to  cover all forms of medication-assisted treatment, which plays a  critical and lifesaving role in treating opioid use disorder.   It provides grants to State Medicaid programs to help increase the  number of substance use disorder providers and services. It increases  access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment for  children and pregnant women covered by CHIP, and it ensures former  foster youth are able to keep their Medicaid coverage across State  lines up to the age of 26. And it improves the continuity of Medicaid  coverage for juveniles in the justice system.   I am also pleased that we have been able to improve upon the House- passed IMD policy. This bill adds new safeguards to ensure that States  continue to provide an adequate level of outpatient services and offer  medication-assisted treatment. It does this by making clear that this  policy does not impact the more comprehensive efforts to provide care  in IMDs that is ongoing in many States today.                                time  1045    H.R. 6 also includes provisions from my legislation, the SCREEN Act,  that would give the Food and Drug Administration the ability to take  action against illicit controlled substances coming in through  international mail facilities across the country.   FDA will now be able to prohibit the importation of drugs by people  who have repeatedly imported illicit drugs. It also allows the agency  to cease distribution of or recall controlled substances, like opioids,  if they are endangering patients.   These provisions also provide FDA expanded authority and capacity  needed to more effectively combat the influx of deadly synthetic  opioids, like fentanyl, from reaching our shores through the mail in  the first place.   It also provides the Federal Trade Commission with stronger  enforcement tools to go after bad actors that are taking advantage of  the suffering of individuals combating addictions.   Mr. Speaker, there is one provision that is concerning and that I do  want to mention. It did not go through regular order and was not  properly vetted. In fact, it was added at the very last minute. That is  a proposal by Senator Rubio to create a new criminal antikickback  statute.   I know this proposal is well-intentioned in addressing the serious  problem of patient brokers who are taking advantage of individuals with  opioid use disorders and referring them to substandard or fraudulent  providers in exchange for kickbacks. This is an issue, but since the  bill was introduced last Tuesday night, multiple stakeholders have  raised concerns that the language does not do what we think it does. It  may have unintended consequences.   Mr. Speaker, I hope this is a good lesson to all of us that passing  legislation that has not been properly vetted, and that the public has  not had an adequate chance to review, is unwise. I hope to get a  commitment from Chairman Walden and Chairman Goodlatte to work to  address any technical problems with this provision in the upcoming  months.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, these are all policies that have the  potential to make a real impact on this epidemic, but our work here is  not complete. An epidemic of this size will take a long-term commitment  to improving health insurance coverage, treatment, access, and  affordability.   This bill is an important step, but I want to stress that we have to  do a lot more. The opioid crisis continues to get worse. A lot more  needs to be done to provide treatment and expand the treatment  infrastructure. More resources are needed to support the families and  communities impacted by this crisis. So what we are doing today is  clearly helpful, but it is not enough.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), the ranking member of the Ways and Means  Committee who worked so hard on this legislation as well.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Cummings), the ranking member of the Oversight and  Government Reform Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Tonko), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), also a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas  [[Page H9247]]  (Mr. Gene Green), the ranking member of our Health Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains  on each side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Mexico (Mr. Ben Ray Lujan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, before we conclude debate, let me just take a moment to  thank everyone for all of their hard work getting this bill across the  finish line.   This bill represents a collection of Member ideas and policies across  the political spectrum. Many people may not know this, but the staff of  the House and Senate committees negotiated this bill in a matter of  weeks, and that is no small feat. It took a lot of effort, long hours  and weekend work to pull this off. It is a product we can all be proud  of.   So let me thank all legislative counsel and CBO for their efforts as  well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.

Mr. Speaker, I do urge support for this legislation. It is a good  bill. It expands access in a number of ways in coverage. But I do also  want to point out that there are limitations to the bill. In other  words, we do need to do a lot more.                                time  1130    For example, we still haven't expanded Medicaid coverage in many  States. Medicaid coverage is crucial, in terms of providing treatment.   The bottom line is that the treatment infrastructure in our country  is very much inadequate. Many people really do not have access to  treatment in many parts of the country, including my home State.   I want to close by urging everyone to support this bipartisan and  bicameral bill, because it does do a lot. At the same time, I remind my  colleagues that we have a lot more to do if we are going to address  this opioid crisis, which actually is getting worse instead of better.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
