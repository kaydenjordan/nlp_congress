 Mr. Speaker, to go grocery shopping, some Americans  walk down the block or drive a few miles to the store. But for those  living in food apartheids, their experience is different.   I call them food apartheids, instead of food deserts, because deserts  are naturally formed. There is nothing natural about food apartheid. It  is manmade. It happens on purpose, often influenced by systemic racism.   Earlier this week, I was in Leominster, Massachusetts, to unveil a  new food truck and refrigerated van for the Spanish American Center, a  nonprofit with deep roots in the area, to make it easier to bring  nutritious and culturally appropriate meals to everyone in the  community.   Mr. Speaker, I was proud to secure $110,000 in Federal funding for  this project. We should continue to increase Federal investments in our  local antihunger infrastructure to help those who have a short trip to  the grocery store and especially those who do not. We should do all we  can to end hunger now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Cole), my good friend, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I  yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let's begin. We are dealing with this default on America  bill. It is a doozy, even by the measurements that we judge this  current majority in Congress. How did we get here?   I will tell you how we got here. The process is lousy. It stinks. We  heard promise after promise after promise about how great Republicans  would be when they were in charge; about how open and transparent and  fair things would be here. It is clear now that it was all a bunch of  talk, all phony. They never meant any of it.   There was no hearing, no markup, no amendments, no nothing. The CBO  score came out 5 minutes before the hearing started. The manager's  amendment released at 12:45 a.m. The Rules Committee met for 6 hours  and then we adjourned until 11:30 p.m. Democrats sat waiting in an  empty room for 45 minutes.   We were told to come back at 1:45 in the morning.   In the midnight seance that the Republicans conducted in the  chairman's office, out comes this new language that is supposed to  satisfy the extreme rightwing of the extreme rightwing.   Basically, some of my Republican colleagues had an objection that the  bill didn't screw people fast enough. Get this, after all their talk  about how horrible the Inflation Reduction Act was, we find out that  some of their Members actually love parts of the Inflation Reduction  Act and demanded that we protect it, even if it meant changing the bill  at 2 a.m. in the morning.   Let me tell everyone else, in case you missed it--because some people  go to sleep before 2 a.m.--this all happened at 2 a.m. Shhh. Secret.   Speaker McCarthy said himself that you just can't throw something on  the floor. Those were his words. But here we are and this bill is being  thrown on the floor.   Mr. Speaker, 25 of the 32 rules this Congress has done have been  completely closed. The Rules Committee has allowed to the floor only 91  amendments so far. When I was in charge, at this point we had allowed  to the floor 199 amendments.   Mr. Speaker, 92 percent of all Democratic amendments have not been  allowed to be debated. Republican Whip   Tom Emmer told us yesterday  that the bill was closed. It is not getting changed, he said. And then  what did they do just a few hours later? They changed it.   Mr. Speaker, I asked Chairman Smith last night in the Rules Committee  if he liked the way this bill was being brought up. You know what he  said to me?   I am not in charge.   Well, it is his committee. Who is in charge of whether or not they  hold a hearing or a markup?   Just as a lesson for our new Members who demanded more regular order,  this is not it. I would like a single Republican to come down here and  defend the process that was used here. I bet they won't because they  cannot.   Here we are debating this bill, the default on America act. We are  happy to have a conversation on our spending priorities. Absolutely. We  welcome that conversation. This isn't a conversation. They handed us a  ransom note.   They say that in order to agree to pay our bills for 1 year, we have  to make 10 years of deep cuts that will hurt our constituents. This is  a ransom note. Then what happens a year from now? What is next? Do you  want our first-born children in exchange for paying the bills on time?   Republicans have said that unless we screw regular people, working  people, veterans, the environment--I could go right down the list-- unless we do that, Republicans are going to push this economy off a  cliff, damaging our credit rating, crashing Wall Street, resulting in  all kinds of job loss, and putting us into a recession. That is the  choice they are giving us here today.   Here is the deal, and this is what is really galling. Republicans are  telling us that in order to get our fiscal house in order so we can pay  our bills, not a single dollar can be saved at the Pentagon, that  billionaires can't pay another cent in taxes. To get our fiscal house  in order, we need to nickel-and-dime moms and dads, workers and  veterans, and regular people.   Billionaires and CEOs received trillions in tax cuts when Republicans  were in charge. Trillions. They want to screw the people that I came to  Congress to represent--it takes my breath away, Mr. Speaker--regular  people, working people, the farmers, and the veterans. They want to  kick people off healthcare. They want to cut funding to stop drugs from  coming into America. They want to fire teachers, and they want to take  food away from women, infants, and children. What is wrong with them,  Mr. Speaker?   I know my friend, Chairman Cole--and he is my friend--cares deeply  about programs like Head Start. In his own State, this bill would cut  3,300 children off of Head Start. These are real kids for God's sake.  Don't take my word for it. The National Head Start program says:         Make no mistake, the current debt limit and budget       legislation under consideration in the House of       Representatives will cause irreparable damage to Head Start.    It is not mathematically possible to make the cuts that they are  talking about without hurting our own constituents. All this so that we  can appease the extreme MAGA wing of the Republican Party.   The contempt that so many on the other side of the aisle have for  people who are poor, who are struggling, who are working hard but  having trouble making ends meet because the other side won't even raise  the minimum wage, it is stunning.   Mr. Speaker, we have a bill loaded up with all these new work  requirements and hurdles for people to jump through. It will result in  people losing SNAP, losing Meals on Wheels benefits, losing assistance  to pay for infants and children. Yet, there has not been a single  hearing on this topic. Not one.   Mr. Speaker, I asked: Who are these people in real life that you  claim don't work who are on SNAP? Who are the people you are talking  about?   The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and the chairman of the  Budget Committee gave me a blank stare. I asked: What is the average  SNAP benefit? That is a pretty basic question if you feel strongly  about this program. They had no idea. Not a clue. Not even a guess.   Mr. Speaker, I asked: What is the average length that someone is on  SNAP? They had no idea. This is not about substance or reality, Mr.  Speaker.   By the way, the average SNAP benefit per person per meal is about $2.  The average time somebody is on the benefit is less than a year. This  is not about substance or reality.   The bottom line is if this is what the American people want, as the  Republicans say--many of them kept saying it over and over in the Rules  Committee, which I could not believe because I think most people in  this country are horrified about what they are trying to do here--if  they think that is what the American people want, then they should win  the White House and win the Senate.   They were supposed to win the House by a huge margin, but that red  wave turned into a pink splash. I don't think you are going to be  around in the leadership here much longer, quite frankly.                                time  1230    Enough is enough, Mr. Speaker. America pays our bills. This is a  ransom note.   Republicans want to default on America, and all Democrats are asking  for is that you listen to Trump. You know him. He is the guy you are  all afraid of. He said: ``I can't imagine anybody ever even thinking of  using the debt ceiling as a negotiation wedge. . . . That is a very,  very sacred thing. . . . We could never play with it.''   That is the guy whom you are all afraid of. That is what he said.   Listen to Speaker McCarthy in 2015: ``When the United States makes  promises, it keeps them, which is why the House voted today to avoid  the threat of a debt default.''   That was Speaker McCarthy. I guess he forgot.   This is a simple, routine part of doing our job, something all of us  should be able to get behind.   If you want to have a conversation about spending priorities, that is  the  [[Page H1962]]  appropriations process or the budget process, but it is not holding our  Nation hostage. It is not a ransom note.   Don't default on America, Speaker McCarthy. Do your job. Do what you  said we would do: keep America's promises. Don't mess around with the  full faith and credit of the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this rule and a ``no'' vote on  the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a report by The  Balance titled: ``President Trump's Impact on the National Debt.''                     [From the balance, Jan. 26, 2022]               President Trump's Impact on the National Debt                            (By Kimberly Amadeo)         The national debt increased by almost 36 percent during       Trump's tenure.        Republican candidate Donald Trump promised during the 2016       presidential campaign that he would eliminate the nation's       debt in eight years.        Instead, his budget estimates showed that he would actually       add at least $8.3 trillion, increasing the U.S. debt to $28.5       trillion by 2025. But the national debt reached that figure       much sooner. The national debt stood at $19.9 trillion when       President Trump took office in January 2017, and it reached a       high of $27 trillion in October 2020.        The national debt reached another high of $28 trillion less       than two months after President Trump left office. In       December 2021, Congress then increased the debt limit by $2.5       trillion, to almost $31.4 trillion, as debt rose again under       President Joe Biden.                     How Did the National Debt Increase?         At first it seemed that Trump was lowering the debt. It       fell $102 billion in the first six months after he took       office. The debt was $19.9 trillion on Jan. 20, the day Trump       was inaugurated. It was $19.8 trillion on July 30, thanks to       the federal debt ceiling.        Trump signed a bill increasing the debt ceiling on Sept. 8,       2017. The debt exceeded $20 trillion for the first time in       U.S. history later that day. Trump signed a bill on Feb. 9,       2018, suspending the debt ceiling until March 1, 2019. The       total national debt was at $22 trillion by February 2019.       Trump again suspended the debt ceiling in July 2019 until       after the 2020 presidential election.        The debt hit a record $27 trillion on Oct. 1, 2020 before       reaching further peaks in 2021 that caused Congress to act       again to raise the debt limit in December.        Trump oversaw the fastest increase in the debt of any       president, almost 36 percent from 2017 to 2020.                Did President Trump Reduce the National Debt?         Trump promised two strategies to reduce U.S. debt before       taking office: He would increase growth by 4 percent to 6       percent, and he would eliminate wasteful federal spending.                              Increasing Growth         Trump promised while on the campaign trail to grow the       economy by 4 percent to 6 percent annuallv to increase tax       revenues. Once in office, he lowered his growth estimates to       between 2 percent and 3 percent. These more realistic       projections are within the 2 percent to 3 percent healthy       growth rate.        President Trump also promised to achieve between 2 percent       and 4 percent growth with tax cuts. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act       cut the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent       beginning in 2018. The top individual income tax rate dropped       to 37 percent. The TCJA doubled the standard deduction and       eliminated personal exemptions. The corporate cuts are       permanent, but the individual changes expire at the end of       2025.        According to the Laffer curve, tax cuts only stimulate the       economy enough to make up for lost revenue when the rates are       above 50 percent . It worked during the Reagan administration       because the highest tax rate was 70 percent at that time.                    Eliminating Wasteful Federal Spending         Trump's second strategy was to eliminate waste and       redundancy in federal spending. He demonstrated this cost-      consciousness during his campaign when he used his Twitter       account and rallies instead of expensive television ads.  [[Page H1963]]         Trump was right that there is waste in federal spending.       The problem isn't finding it. The problem is in cutting it.       Each program has a constituency that lobbies Congress.       Eliminating these benefits may lose voters and contributors.       Congressional representatives may agree to cut spending in       someone else's district, but they resist doing so on their       own.        More than two-thirds of government spending goes to       mandatory obligations made by previous acts of Congress.       Social Security benefits cost $1.2 trillion in Fiscal Year       2021. Medicare cost $722 billion, and Medicaid cost $448       billion. The interest on the debt was $378 billion.        Military spending must also be cut to lower the debt       because it's such a large portion of the budget. But Trump       increased military spending in Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 to $933       billion. That includes three components:        $636 billion base budget for the Department of Defense        $69 billion in overseas contingency operations for DoD to       fight the Islamic State group        $229 billion to fund the other agencies that protect our       nation, including the Department of Veterans Affairs ($105       billion), Homeland Security ($50 billion), the       State Department ($44 billion), the National Nuclear       Security Administration in the Department of Energy ($20       billion), and the FBI and Cybersecurity for the       eDepartment of Justice ($10 billion)        Only $595 billion was left to pay for everything else       budgeted for FY 2021 after mandatory and military spending.       That includes agencies that process Social Security and other       benefits. It also includes the necessary functions performed       by the Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue       Service. We'd have to eliminate it all to make a dent in the       $966 billion deficit.        You can't reduce the deficit or debt without major cuts to       defense and mandated benefits programs. Cutting waste isn't       enough.         Did Trump's Business Debt Affect His Approach to U.S. Debt?         Trump said in an interview with CNBC during his 2016       campaign that he would ``borrow, knowing that if the economy       crashed, you could make a deal.'' But sovereign debt is       different from personal debt. It can't be handled the same       way.        A 2016 Fortune magazine analysis revealed Trump's business       was $1.11 billion in debt. That includes $846 million owed on       five properties. These include Trump Tower, 40 Wall Street,       and 1290 Avenue of the Americas in New York. It also includes       the Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C., and 555 California       Street in San Francisco. But the income generated by these       properties easily pays their annual interest payment. Trump's       debt is reasonable in the business world.        The U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio was 129 percent at the end of       2020. That's the $27.8 trillion U.S. debt as of December       2020, divided by the $21.5 trillion nominal GDP at the end of       the second quarter this year.        The World Bank compares countries based on their total       debt-to-gross domestic product ratio. It considers a country       to be in trouble if that ratio is greater than 77 percent.        The high U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio didn't discourage       investors. America is one of the safest economies in the       world and its currency is the world's reserve currency.       Investors purchase U.S. Treasurys in a flight to safety even       during a U.S. economic crisis. That's one reason why interest       rates plunged to historical lows in March 2020 after the       coronavirus outbreak. Those falling interest rates meant that       America's debt could increase, but interest payments remain       stable.        The U.S. also has a massive fixed pension expense and       health insurance costs. A business can renege on these       benefits, ask for bankruptcy, and weather the resulting       lawsuits, but a president and Congress can't cut back those       costs without losing their jobs at the next election. As       such, Trump's experience in handling business debt did not       transfer to managing the U.S. debt.                      How the National Debt Affects You         The national debt doesn't affect you directly until it       reaches the tipping point. It slows economic growth once the       debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds 77 percent, for an extended period       of time. Every percentage point of debt above this level       costs the country 0.017 percentage points in economic growth,       according to a World Bank analysis.        The first sign of trouble is when interest rates start to       rise significantly. Investors need a higher return to offset       the greater perceived risk. They start to doubt that the debt       can be paid off.        The second sign is that the U.S. dollar loses value. You       will notice that as inflation rises, imported goods cost       more. Gas and grocery prices rise. Travel to other countries       also becomes much more expensive.        The cost of providing benefits and paying the interest on       the debt will skyrocket as interest rates and inflation rise.       That leaves less money for other services. The government       will be forced to cut services or raise taxes at that point.       This will further slow economic growth. Continued deficit       spending will no longer work at that point.     Mr. Speaker, talk about spending. The national debt  increased by almost 36 percent from 2017 to 2020 during Trump's tenure.   I say to the gentleman who just spoke--a lot of yelling here. The  last time I heard that kind of tone was when he was yelling about the  need to have more regular order here. I guess he has forgotten about  that. Just because the gentleman yells doesn't mean he is right.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the State of  Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to debunk this talking point that I hear over and  over again from my friends. I just heard it right now when we were  talking about spending.   Let's remember a couple of things.   First, when Donald Trump was in charge, $8 trillion was added to the  national debt. That is a 39-percent increase. It is one-quarter of the  entire debt from all of American history. So, please, give me a break.   Second, let's be clear: Inflation is a global problem. Mr. Speaker,  if you think that the American Rescue Plan drove up prices in Italy or  the U.K., then I have news for you. If you think emergency rescue  checks are responsible for inflation in Brazil and Australia, maybe you  got your economics  [[Page H1964]]  degree from Trump University. That is not how things work. Don't take  my word for it. Look at the numbers. Actually, look at the research.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Social  Security Administration, which states that Republican spending cuts  would eliminate field offices, drive up wait times for initial  disability and retirement claims processing, lengthen phone wait times,  and create backlogs across the board.                                    Social Security Administration,                                                The Commissioner,                                      Baltimore, MD, March 17, 2023.      Hon. Rosa L. DeLauro,      Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member DeLauro: Thank you for your January 19,       2023 letter asking for information to help Members of       Congress understand the impacts of capping fiscal year (FY)       2024 discretionary spending at the FY 2022 enacted level,       which would be approximately a six percent cut from our FY       2023 enacted funding. Returning SSA to the FY 2022 funding       level or, more drastically, cutting funds by 22 percent from       the 2023 enacted level, would greatly harm our ability to       serve the public as we are already struggling to recover from       the effects of the pandemic.        We are actively using the funding increase we received in       FY 2023 to support our hiring efforts to increase staffing as       we work to restore sufficient staffing from our lowest       staffing levels in over 25 years, particularly in our field       offices, teleservice centers, processing centers, and State       disability determination services (DDS). Hiring new staff is       necessary to improve major workload challenges that affect       the public we serve, including people waiting far too long       for a disability decision. Funding cuts of the magnitude       described above would take us backwards and hurt our       customers.        If we return to FY 2022 funding levels in FY 2024, we       would:        Close field offices and shorten hours we are open to the       public, cutting off vital access to face-to-face service       delivery.        Increase the amount of time individuals wait for a decision       on their initial disability claim, leading to an average wait       time of 9 months, or up to 30 percent longer than today.        Implement a hiring freeze for the agency and the DDS, which       means a reduction of over 5,000 employees who are essential       to processing retirement claims, making disability decisions,       answering the National 800 Number, and issuing new and       replacement Social Security cards.        Furlough staff for over 4 weeks and lay off approximately       6,000 employees--producing even longer wait times than       customers experience today on our National 800 Number and in       our field offices, causing delays to decisions on retirement       claims and delays in processing Social Security cards and       verification of Social Security Numbers for individuals       seeking employment.        Eliminate overtime pay, reducing our ability to keep pace       with claims and other service requests.        As noted above, a cut to FY 2022 levels (a six percent cut       below current funding) would significantly affect our ability       to serve the public and undermine our core mission--producing       longer wait times for benefits and to reach SSA       representatives, as well as reduced access to in-person       service.        Congress expressed an expectation for continued       modernization of our IT by providing dedicated funding for       this purpose. A six percent reduction would support IT       funding only for basic operational requirements and would       halt our efforts to improve the customer experience, expand       our online services, and enhance our systems to improve       employee efficiency. We would have to drastically cut IT at a       time when we need it to help mitigate other cuts like office       hour reductions, a hiring freeze, and layoffs.        The impacts would be even more significant with deeper       cuts. If we are faced with a cut of more than six percent, it       would be catastrophic for the agency and for the people       depending on Social Security programs supporting their daily       needs. For every $100 million below the 6 percent reduction,       we would have to lay off an additional 1,000 people, further       undermining services to the public. Every 1,000 staff lay off       is the equivalent of closing over 40 field offices.        Cuts on this scale would dramatically undermine our ability       to function effectively. It would cut in-person access to our       field offices, drive up wait times for initial disability and       retirement claims processing, lengthen phone wait times,       prohibit development of online tools to compensate for the       difficulties to reach us by phone and in-person, and create       backlogs across the board. It would take years to recover and       restore services to levels the public expects.        Millions of Americans depend on Social Security programs to       provide income support essential to meeting daily needs, and       significant budget cuts prohibit us from providing people       with access to vital support. The payments and benefits our       programs provide are integral to the economic fabric of our       Nation. We appreciate the opportunity to explain the harm a       return to FY 2022 funding levels or less would cause for the       public we serve, as well as our employees.            Sincerely,                                    Kilolo Kijakazi, Ph.D., M.S.W.,                                               Acting Commissioner.     Republicans are trying to make it harder for seniors to  access the benefits that they have earned.   Mr. Speaker, I urge that we defeat the previous question. If we do,  then I will offer an amendment to the rule to provide for consideration  of a resolution that allows the House to state unequivocally that it is  our responsibility to defend and preserve Social Security and Medicare  for generations to come and reject any cuts to these vital programs.   By the way, these two programs have come under attack by Republican  after Republican.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from New Mexico (Ms. Stansbury).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I am a little confused after the last speech.   Mr. Speaker, with the way the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), my  friend, has been talking, you might think that President Biden caused  inflation all on his own. That is just simply not the case, and  everybody here knows that.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from the nonpartisan,  nonprofit Economic Policy Institute titled: ``Rising Inflation is a  Global Problem, U.S. Policy Choices Are Not to Blame.''             [From the Economic Policy Institute, Aug. 4, 2022]   Rising Inflation is a Global Problem. U.S. Policy Choices Are Not to                                   Blame            (By Josh Bivens, Asha Banerjee, And Mariia Dzholos)                                key takeaways         An international comparison among OECD countries shows that       rising inflation is a global phenomenon, not unique to the       United States.        This fact argues strongly that high inflation in the U.S.       has not been driven by any unique American policy--not the       American Rescue Plan and other generous fiscal relief during       the pandemic recession and recovery nor anything else U.S.-      centric.        Some have argued that the global rise of inflation means       that many countries--including the U.S.--overstimulated their       economies and generated excess aggregate demand. But this       explanation is not supported by the data. The countries with       larger declines in unemployment over the past 18 months have       not seen larger inflation spikes.        Consumer price data for June 2022 showed another month of       rapid inflation, with overall inflation rising 9.1 percent       year-over-year and core inflation (which doesn't include       volatile energy and food prices) rising by 5.9 percent. This       level of inflation has obviously become a major political       issue this year. But however this issue resonates       politically, as an economic matter a common narrative that       blames the Biden administration and its policy choices for       causing the inflation is deeply misleading.        This is not simply a case for exonerating the Biden       administration's choices--how the recent inflationary       outbreak is interpreted will have huge consequences for how       policymakers respond. A loud chorus of economic analysts and       influential policymakers continue highlighting the need for       the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates       sharply to slow growth to ``rein in'' inflation. This       approach risks terrible consequences and threatens to cast       aside the amazing policy achievement of a full jobs recovery       from the pandemic recession. In the COVID-19 recession, the       economy lost over 22 million jobs. But by June 2022 (after 28       months), the level of employment in the U.S. matched the last       month pre-pandemic (February 2020). Compare this with job       growth after the Great Recession of 2008-09, when it took       more than six years (75 months) to regain the just under 9       million jobs lost and match pre-recession employment levels.       The far faster recovery from the COVID-19 recession was       significantly driven by a much more aggressive fiscal policy       response.        This more aggressive fiscal response is often blamed for       the inflation outbreak over the past 18 months. The most       persuasive evidence casting doubt on this interpretation is a       comparison of inflation between the U.S. and a large set of       other rich countries that undertook a wide array of fiscal       responses. Despite the different fiscal responses,       essentially all of these countries have experienced a rapid       acceleration of core inflation. This means that today's       inflation is not a uniquely U.S. problem, and therefore not       connected to the necessary and effective economic policies       that spearheaded the rapid economic recovery we see today.        In Figure A, we focus on core inflation (stripping out the       prices of energy and food) because that is widely considered       a better target for basing decisions about macroeconomic       stabilization. Energy and food prices are not just volatile,       they are also set on global markets, meaning that their price       changes carry very little information about whether the U.S.       economy specifically is currently experiencing macroeconomic       imbalances. It's also useful to highlight core inflation       because much commentary has claimed that inflation in other       advanced economies is overwhelmingly about energy and food       prices, and far less about core prices. This claim is not       supported by the data in Figure A.        As Figure A shows, all but one Organization for Economic       Co-operation and Development (OECD) country saw an       acceleration in core inflation. More significantly, this       international comparison tells us that the U.S. is not an       outlier in its experience with accelerating core inflation       (the one obvious outlier in this data--Turkey--is currently       experiencing inflation over 40 percent and is not included in       the figure). The U.S. is on the higher side of inflation       experiences, but far from the top and not that far above the       average (or even the median) for all other OECD countries.       The upshot of the figure is clear: A global phenomenon--      accelerating inflation--demands a global explanation, and       ``Biden policies'' obviously do not provide that.        Some have argued that the global rise in inflation is       actually just evidence that the excess demand growth they see       as driving inflation is also global. Of course, even this       perspective provides some small bit of exoneration for       American policymakers: if every advanced country in the       entire world made similar policy decisions, then it seems       hard to argue that the American approach was an avoidable       mistake. But, another cut at the international data casts       doubt on a simple story of macroeconomic imbalances driving       the global inflation surge. Specifically, countries with       larger declines in unemployment over the past 18 months have       not seen larger inflation spikes.        In Figure B below, the vertical axis is the acceleration of       core inflation relative to pre-pandemic trend that we showed       previously in Figure A. On the horizontal axis, we subtract       the average unemployment rate of March-May 2022 from the       average unemployment rate that prevailed in 2018-2019. This       can be taken as an indicator of how much unemployment has       improved in a country in the  [[Page H1966]]       recent period relative to pre-pandemic conditions. The higher       the number on the horizontal axis, the lower is current       unemployment relative to pre-pandemic averages. If one       interprets unemployment that is lower today than pre-pandemic       times as evidence of strong demand growth, one would expect       to see a positive relationship between the improvement in       unemployment (horizontal axis) and the acceleration of       inflation (vertical axis). But there is no such significant       relationship (in fact, there is a weak relationship the other       way, with countries with higher unemployment relative to pre-      pandemic times seeing higher inflation).        This finding should further complicate the claim that the       ``macroeconomic overheating'' argument should simply be       applied globally. And if there is not strong evidence that       today's global inflation is simply driven by excess global       demand, the payoff to strongly reining in demand could be       quite small, and the damage caused by this quite large.        Rather than the specific policies of the Biden       administration driving inflation, the roots of today's       inflation are a more complicated cocktail of other forces:       from the spike in raw material, energy, and commodities       prices due in large part to the Russian invasion of Ukraine,       to lingering supply chain disruptions and distorted consumer       demand patterns stemming from the pandemic. These shocks and       their unexpectedly large ripple effects are the global       explanation for rising inflation.        Again, this is not an academic exercise or simply providing       political cover for any particular policymaker. Instead,       there is real economic danger from misdiagnosing the       inflation problem. An engineered, unnecessary recession will       only cause more economic pain to those still just recovering       from the COVID-19 recession, and will undercut the strong       economic recovery underway.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article by Mark  Zandi of Moody's Analytics which states that Speaker McCarthy's radical  cuts would meaningfully increase the likelihood of a recession and  result in 780,000 fewer jobs by the end of 2024 compared with a clean  bill to avoid a default.                          [From Moody's Analytics]                       The Debt Limit Drama Heats Up                     (By Mark Zandi and Bernard Yaros)         The political drama over the Treasury debt limit is       suddenly heating up. With April tax receipts coming in weaker       than expected, at least so far, it appears that the X-date,       when the Treasury will run out of the cash needed to pay the       government's bills on time, may hit as soon as early June.       House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's recent unveiling of proposed       legislation to increase the limit is thus none too soon. In       exchange for increasing the debt limit just enough so that it       will not be a problem again until about this time next year,       the Speaker wants to significantly cut discretionary spending       over the next decade, impose stricter work requirements on       healthcare, food and other assistance for low-income       households, and roll back much of the Biden's       administration's agenda on climate change and student       lending. In this note, we assess the macroeconomic       consequences of the Speaker's debt limit legislation.                                  The X-date         The Treasury debt limit--the maximum amount of debt that       the Treasury can issue to the public or to other federal       agencies--was hit on January 19, and since then the Treasury       has been using ``extraordinary measures'' to come up with the       additional cash needed to pay the government's bills. Nailing       down precisely when these extraordinary measures will be       exhausted, and Treasury will run out of cash and thus be       unable to pay everyone on time--the so-called X-date--is       difficult. It depends on the timing of highly uncertain tax       receipts and government expenditures.        Since Moody's Analytics began estimating the X-date early       this year, we have thought it to be in mid-August. But April       tax receipts are running 35 percent below last year's pace,       which is meaningfully weaker than anticipated. And despite       weaker tax refunds than anticipated, it appears that the X-      date may come as soon as early June. If not, and Treasury is       able to squeak by with enough cash, then the X-date looks       more likely to be in late July. That is because Treasury will       get a cash infusion from non-withheld tax payments around the       June 15 estimated tax deadline, and then another tranche of       extraordinary measures will become available, providing       Treasury with a few more weeks of cash.                            Investors take notice         Regardless, time is running out for lawmakers to act and       increase or suspend the debt limit, and global investors are       suddenly focusing on the risks posed if they do not act in       time. Credit default swaps on Treasury securities--the cost       of buying insurance in case Treasury fails to pay its debt on       time--have jumped in recent weeks. At close to 100 basis       points, CDS spreads on six-month and one-year Treasury       securities are already substantially more than in 2011 when       that debt limit drama was so unnerving it caused rating       agency Standard & Poor's to strip the U.S. of its AAA rating.        This may overstate investors' angst as the CDS market for       buying insurance in the case of a Treasury default is not       actively traded, and it does not take much trading to push up       the cost of insurance. A few hedge funds speculating on the       CDS could drive up the cost since they are purchasing       something akin to a lottery ticket. Moreover, the current       spread remains far from signaling that investors are       attaching much of a probability on a default. For context,       during the European debt crisis in 2011, the CDS spread on       the sovereign debt of stressed countries in the periphery of       the euro zone, including Greece, topped out at 1,400 basis       points. Even the CDS for core euro zone countries such as       Germany and France were more than 200 basis points at the       time.        That said, the run up in Treasury CDS should not be       dismissed out of hand. The recent sharp decline in one-month       Treasury bill yields also signals mounting investor angst. As       it has become clear in recent days that April tax receipts       were coming in weak and the X-date may be just a few weeks       away, investors have piled into the safety of one-month       Treasury securities. Yields have plummeted, from 4.75 percent       at the start of April to less than 3.4 percent currently. At       the same time, yields on three-month Treasury bills have       continued to rise. The difference between one- and three-      month Treasury bill yields has never been as wide. Global       investors thus appear to be attaching non-zero odds that the       debt limit drama will end with a default sometime in June or       July.                          House Republican proposal         It is thus none too soon that House Speaker McCarthy       unveiled the ``Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023'' on April 19.       House Republicans hope the legislation will put political       pressure on President Biden to negotiate changes in fiscal       policy in exchange for an increase in the debt limit. The       president continues to reject these efforts, arguing for a       so-called clean debt limit increase--an increase in the debt       limit without substantive changes to policy. His position is       that increasing the debt limit is necessary to pay the       government's bills resulting from past fiscal policy       decisions, over which there can be no negotiation.        Speaker McCarthy's proposed legislation would increase the       debt limit by $1.5 trillion or until March 31, 2024,       whichever comes first. In exchange, it would cut government       spending by $4.5 trillion over the next decade and implement       a number of consequential changes to fiscal policy. The most       significant spending cuts would come by setting fiscal 2024       discretionary spending equal to fiscal 2022 spending levels.       Annual spending growth would then be capped at 1 percent for       the next decade. While not stipulated in the legislation,       Republicans would likely work to exclude discretionary       spending on defense and veterans' benefits from the cuts,       putting the burden of the cuts on nondefense, non-VA       discretionary programs. If nondefense discretionary outlays       were to bear the full brunt of the proposed budget cuts, they       would fall to 2 percent of GDP by fiscal 2033, the lowest       since at least the early 1960s.        The Speaker's debt limit legislation also works to roll       back a number of President Biden's policy initiatives. On       energy policy, the legislation would focus on increasing       fossil fuel supplies through the enactment of House       Republicans' energy package, which aims to boost oil and gas       production and mining by cutting down on the time it takes to       greenlight energy projects. It would also end tax breaks for       clean-energy projects and qualifying electric vehicles       included in the Inflation Reduction Act.        On student lending, the legislation would prevent a couple       of key executive orders by the Biden administration,       including the White House's plan to provide up to $20,000 in       student loan forgiveness for some borrowers. That hit a       roadblock last year when it was met with several legal       challenges, and the Supreme Court is expected to decide its       fate later this year. An income-driven repayment plan rolled       out by the Education Department earlier this year is also in       the crosshairs.        The Speaker's legislation also imposes restrictions on       income support programs, including work requirements on       Medicaid recipients who do not have children, an increase in       the age limit for work rules under Supplemental Nutrition       Assistance Program (food assistance), and a requirement that       states report on work outcomes under the Temporary Assistance       for Needy Families program. It eliminates much of the       additional funding provided to the IRS last year to help       increase tax enforcement efforts and improve taxpayer       services, and it rescinds unspent COVID-19 relief funds. And       the legislation would also require congressional approval       before major regulations could take effect.                            macroeconomic impacts         The Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023 would cut into near-term       economic growth if passed into law. Compared with a scenario       that includes a clean debt limit increase and no other       significant changes to fiscal policy under current law, real       GDP in the year ending in the fourth quarter of 2024 would be       0.65 percentage point lower. That is, in the Clean Debt Limit       scenario, real GDP is expected to grow 2.25 percent in the       year compared with 1.6 percent if Speaker McCarthy's       legislation becomes law.        While the economy skirts recession in both scenarios,       recession risks are uncomfortably high, with a consensus of       economists and many investors and business executives       expecting a downturn beginning late this year or early next.       The timing of the government spending cuts in the Limit,       Save, Grow Act  [[Page H1967]]       is thus especially inopportune as it would meaningfully       increase the likelihood of such a downturn. Indeed, under the       legislation, GDP growth is so weak that employment declines       in the first three quarter of 2024, and the unemployment rate       rises by more than a percentage point to 4.6 percent by the       fourth quarter of 2024. Compared with the Clean Debt Limit       scenario, by year-end 2024, employment is 780,000 jobs lower,       and the unemployment rate is 0.36 percentage point higher.        The significant government spending cuts in the Limit,       Save, Grow Act are substantial headwinds to near-term       economic growth. The cuts reduce nondefense outlays by $120       billion in fiscal 2024 compared with the Clean Debt Limit       scenario, equal to about half a percentage point of GDP. The       multipliers on this spending--the change in GDP a year after       a change in spending--are estimated to be just over 1, as the       programs suffering budget cuts are essential government       services and tend to benefit lower-income households that       quickly spend any support they receive from the government.       Adding to the economic headwinds created by the legislation       is the considerable uncertainty created by having to address       the debt limit again a year from now. Given that 2024 is a       presidential election year, that future debt limit drama may       well be even more heated than the current one. This is sure       to weigh on investor, business and consumer confidence and       thus economic activity.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Deluzio).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I say to the gentleman, extortion is not a negotiation.  President Biden actually has a budget that will reduce the deficit. It  would be better if the Republicans actually came up with a budget, and  we could talk about that. We are willing to have a conversation, but we  are not willing to be extorted here.   Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt about the fact that this bill could  monumentally hurt our Nation's heroes.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Paralyzed  Veterans of America and a letter from the Veterans of Foreign Wars in  opposition to this bill.          [From the Paralyzed Veterans of America, Apr. 25, 2023]      Congress, Protect All Services and Programs Needed by Paralyzed                        Veterans and Their Families         Washington, D.C.--Today, Paralyzed Veterans of America       Executive Director Carl Blake issued a statement in light of       the House' consideration later today of the debt limit       package (Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023).        ``Right now the House of Representatives is preparing to       take action on legislation that would couple raising the debt       limit with significant cuts in federal spending. PVA has       received assurances from some Republican leaders that       veterans' funding will not be a target of these cuts, and we       appreciate these assurances! But the pending legislation       provides no specific protections for veterans with       catastrophic disabilities, specifically the services and       supports they and their families depend on. Efforts to       address the federal deficit must provide concrete protections       for veterans, their families, and caregivers, which means       explicit direction that the Department of Veterans Affairs'       budget will not suffer significant cuts.        Although ensuring the VA will have the funding needed to       meet its fiscal year 2024 needs is our foremost concern, we       urge Congress to remember that veterans with significant       disabilities depend upon many other Federal services and       supports outside of the VA that protect their disability       civil rights, employment support, affordable accessible       housing, as well as provide benefits that help their families       and caregivers. Our responsibility as a nation is to ensure       that those who have already sacrificed so much for our way of       life are not forced to do so again.''                                   ____                                         Veterans of Foreign Wars,                                                     April 25, 2023.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Speaker of the House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker McCarthy: On behalf of the 1.5 million members       of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and its Auxiliary, a       significant number of whom rely on U.S. Department of       Veterans Affairs (VA) health care and benefits, we write to       express our grave concerns with the proposed reports of       returning to Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22) funding levels for the       federal government and its potential effects on veterans       programs. Congress has championed monumental advancements in       veteran care and benefits in the past few years and we       believe we need to continue pushing forward instead of taking       steps backward in serving our veterans.        Plainly stated, the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 did not       exist when funding levels were set for FY 2022. The VFW is       gravely concerned the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023 missed       the mark by not protecting the advances in care and benefits       for toxic-exposed veterans. This could set our collective       hard work back years and make veterans once again have to       fight for the care and benefits they have earned.        Through PACT Act reforms, we believe we are on the cusp of       resolving many issues that have plagued VA for decades,       thanks to the years of hard work from veteran advocates       around the country, as well as our faithful supporters in the       past few Congresses and across multiple Presidential       Administrations. Military Toxic Exposure claim denials, VA       processing backlogs, hiring delays, and unacceptable       appointment wait times will hopefully be a thing of the past,       and we will once again be able to point to VA as a world-      class provider of healthcare and benefits. These advancements       will fade away if they are not resourced properly, which is       why the VFW believes returning funding levels to FY22 would       likely jeopardize the care and benefits our nation's veterans       have earned.        Bills aiming to return the budget to FY22 funding levels,       without explicitly securing care and benefit programs for       veterans are intolerable to our organization. The service       members, veterans, and families we represent have seen the       true cost of more than 20 years of war, and it is       unacceptable to ask them to now pay the bill.        Mr. Speaker, the VFW understands your goal of fiscal       responsibility, but we respectfully ask that in the context       of Limit, Save,  [[Page H1968]]       Grow, that you provide explicit assurances on how Congress       will continue to properly invest in VA programming--      specifically, the reforms authorized through the PACT Act.       The members of the VFW and our Auxiliary hope you will       continue to honor the promise made to the men and women who       served our country by reinforcing your long-standing support       of those who stood in harm's way. Returning VA to FY22       funding levels will negatively affect millions of Americans       across the country and we look forward to working with you to       make sure this does not happen.            Sincerely,                                                  Ryan M. Gallucci,                         Executive Director, VFW Washington Office.     Mr. Speaker, it is clear our veterans are against this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez), a distinguished  member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, my good friend from Oklahoma said that we are engaged  in theatrics. Well, let me put that to rest. I mean, we are dealing  with real numbers.   Last night in the Rules Committee, I asked the chairman of Ways and  Means and the chairman of the Budget Committee some basic questions  about the SNAP program. They had no clue.   People who don't have a clue shouldn't be writing legislation to  determine policy. They should do the hearings and learn about what the  facts are.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following:   A letter from the Department of Energy, which states that reductions  of this magnitude in this bill would have significant setbacks on U.S.  competitiveness to adversarial nations like Russia and China;   A letter from the Department of Labor which states that these cuts in  this bill would prevent more than 4,000 veterans experiencing or at  risk of homelessness from receiving critical employment care;   A letter from the Department of Education, which states that under  these radical cuts, funding for more than 100,000 teaching jobs  nationwide would be eliminated, and it would reduce aid for more than  6.6 million Pell Grant recipients;   A letter from the Small Business Administration, which states that  Republican spending cuts would mean that almost 300,000 fewer small  businesses would be able to participate in their entrepreneurial  development program;   A letter from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which  states that 286,000 families will lose rental assistance under the  Republicans' proposed budget cuts and thousands more would be at risk  for homelessness;   A letter from the Department of Homeland Security, which states that  the proposed cuts could lead to more illegal drugs entering our  country, including 350,000 grams of fentanyl. That is over 200 million  fatal doses of fentanyl that Republicans will be responsible for  letting into our country.   Madam Speaker, I also include in the Record a letter from the  Department of Agriculture detailing how these radical Republican budget  cuts would lead to more than a million new mothers losing WIC  assistance.                                        The Secretary of Energy,                                     Washington, DC, March 17, 2023.      Hon. Rosa L. DeLauro,      Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Representative DeLauro: I share the concern expressed       in your letter dated January 19, 2023, about potential       impacts of proposals that would cap fiscal year (FY) 2024       discretionary spending at the FY 2022 enacted levels. While       Congressional Republicans have not released a specific plan,       cuts on this scale would have very real and damaging impacts       on our families, our communities, our economy, and our       competitiveness--undermining a broad range of critical       services the American people rely on in their everyday lives.        President Biden's FY 2024 Budget, which he released on       March 9, details his plans to invest in America, continue to       lower costs for families, protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare, and reduce the deficit. Meanwhile,       Congressional Republicans have reportedly proposed       unprecedented cuts in FY 2024 funding for key services,       programs, and protections such as education, public safety,       research, nutrition and more. Such action would have serious       consequences for Department of Energy programs and       initiatives at the Federal, state, Tribal, and local levels,       and would jeopardize recent bipartisan gains targeted at       improving the lives of everyday Americans.        Impacts would be felt across the country and could rise to       the level of jeopardizing the Department's ability to do its       part in protecting national security interests from energy       security and nuclear security threats.        Capping funding at this level would also hamper our ability       to cut energy costs for families and businesses across the       country, reduce the number of everyday Americans that can       access tax breaks for clean energy, and reduce the impact of       the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.        Specific examples of potential impacts are listed below.        Scenario l. Across-the-board cap on FY 2024 discretionary       spending at FY 2022 levels. Example impacts are listed below:        A reduction to FY 2022 funding levels would delay all       National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) major       construction projects of at least one year, increasing       operational risks and the likelihood of cost increases. The       FY 2022 funding level represents a \1/3\ reduction from       planned execution in FY 2024.        The W93 and W87-1 warhead modernization programs would be       delayed at least 1-2 years, with significant risks for the       aging U.S. stockpile, DoD plans for delivery system       modernization, and U.S. support for the United Kingdom's       Replacement Warhead.        Hundreds of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy research       projects and 2-3 large infrastructure projects at national       labs would be cancelled or paused, resulting in up to one       thousand (1,000) layoffs within the labs, partner       organizations, and the local construction and support       workforce across the country. This would negatively impact       the ability of the national laboratories to continue to       advance cutting edge research.        Scenario 2. Across-the-board 22 percent reduction to       current enacted funding levels (FY 2023) for FY 2024. Example       impacts of this scenario are listed below. Scenario 1 impacts       would also be intensified:        At a minimum, research at Office of Science national       laboratories and universities would be reduced by about $700       million, resulting in substantial reduction of nearly 5,200       scientists, students, and technical staff.        Many of the Administration research priorities would       receive significantly less funding resulting in curtailed       research efforts in the areas of Climate Change; Artificial       Intelligence; High Performance Computing; emerging       technologies in Quantum Information Science,       Microelectronics, and Biotechnology; Fusion Energy; and       Isotope Production.        At a minimum, Office of Science facility operations funding       would be reduced, resulting in only 68 percent of operational       funding and a substantial reduction of over 6,000 users of       the over 38,000 annual users at the 28 scientific user       facilities across the national laboratories.        All facilities would have a significant reduction in force       of personnel, with loss of critical expertise. A review would       be required to determine which facilities to close to       maintain adequate operations at the remaining user       facilities. Facilities cannot operate safely at this funding       level. This action would result in major economic impact to       the United States, both in the short-term and in the long-      term as the U.S. will be subject to loss of scientific talent       and leadership.        At a minimum, thousands of low-income households (anywhere       from 4,400-8,800) would be deferred from weatherization       services, and reductions in state energy programs more       broadly would limit efforts to cut energy costs for families       and businesses, disproportionately affecting smaller states       and US territories.        Reductions of this magnitude would have significant       setbacks of U.S. geopolitical competitiveness to adversarial       nations like Russia and China.        This would include the reduction of the Idaho National       Laboratory operational status to the minimal allowable for       safe and secure support of DOE and national security programs       and research.        It would also include elimination of all efforts to support       the deployment of American nuclear energy technologies as the       preferred alternative to Russian and Chinese technologies in       countries looking to implement large scale power sources.        These are a few examples of the serious impacts of these       scenarios on ongoing efforts by the Department in the areas       of national security, safety of critical infrastructure,       threats to the Nation's competitive edge, and impacts on       consumers and industry.            Sincerely,      Jennifer M. Granholm.                                   ____           U.S. Department of Labor, Office of the Assistant             Secretary for Congressional and Intergovernmental             Affairs,                                                    Washington, DC.      Hon. Rosa DeLauro,      Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member DeLauro: Thank you for contacting the       Department of Labor (DOL) with important questions about the       impact of capping discretionary spending levels at the fiscal       year (FY) 2022 enacted level on workers and their families.       The Department of Labor's mission is to foster, promote, and       develop the welfare of the wage earners, job seekers, and       retirees of the  [[Page H1970]]       United States; improve working conditions; advance       opportunities for profitable employment; and assure work-      related benefits and rights. This includes centering our work       on the most vulnerable and marginalized workers, those facing       barriers to employment, misclassified workers, and workers in       temporary jobs or other jobs that heighten their economic       insecurity and vulnerability.        On March 9, 2023, the President released his Fiscal Year       (FY) 2024 budget. The FY 2024 budget request builds on the       Biden-Harris Administration's successes, reinforces President       Biden's investments in America, continues to lower costs for       families, protects and strengthens Social Security and       Medicare, and reduces the deficit. The Department's role in       this effort is to ensure that all workers and job seekers in       America--particularly those from disadvantaged communities--      have access to high-quality jobs that can support a middle-      class life. That includes accessing training and finding       pathways to high-quality jobs as well as protecting workers'       rights and benefits, health and safety, and wages once they       are employed.        The potential cuts you describe in your letter would have       very real and damaging impacts on our families, communities,       economy, and competitiveness--undermining a broad range of       critical services the American people rely on in their       everyday lives.        These drastic reductions in spending proposed by certain       Congressional Republicans would be devastating--undermining       our ability to protect our nation's most vulnerable workers       and hindering our efforts to address critical issues like       exploitative child labor. These types of cuts would send an       unmistakable message that the workers who were essential       during the pandemic are expendable, diminishing the value of       their work and failing to honor them by ensuring their wages,       health, and safety are protected. Additionally, drastically       cutting funding levels would mean fewer resources for       workforce training programs designed to ensure there is a       workforce armed with the skills needed to fill high-quality       jobs in our growing economy.        Below please find specific examples of how funding cuts       would impact Department of Labor programs and the workers we       aim to serve. For each example, the Department analyzed two       scenarios: (1) FY 2024 appropriations equal to 22 percent       below currently enacted levels and (2) FY 2024 appropriations       equal to the FY 2022 enacted levels.     Limiting Access to Training for Job Seekers and Workers Across the                                  Country         The Employment and Training Administration provides grants       to states for running the Adult, Youth, and Dislocated Worker       employment programs, which provide training and job       assistance services. Reductions to each of those programs       would result in people losing critical services they need to       obtain and retain better jobs.        Workfbrce Development & Training: A 22 percent reduction       would prevent about 750,000 job seekers from accessing       services and training through ETA-funded programming. A       return to FY 2022 enacted levels would result in about       125,000 fewer job seekers receiving services and training       from the workforce development system.        Registered Apprenticeship: A 22 percent reduction would       lead to over 100,000 fewer workers being employed through       Registered Apprenticeships. A return to FY 2022 enacted       levels would lead to 76,000 fewer workers being employed       through Registered Apprenticeships.        Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP): A 22       percent reduction would lead to almost 10,000 fewer low-      income older workers participating in paid community service       work.        Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC ): If funding       levels were reduced by 22 percent, there would be significant       processing delays across the labor certification programs.       Labor certification decisions for nonimmigrant visas,       especially for seasonal nonagricultural businesses, would be       delayed. Employers would have to wait up to 2 additional       months for decisions on their ability to hire H-2B workers.        In the PERM immigrant program, labor certification decision       would increase 73 percent, from 188 days (FY 2022) to       approximately 325 days. Similarly, if funding levels reverted       to the FY 2022 level, and workloads continued to rise,       average processing times in the FLC programs would continue       to increase. OFLC would prioritize available resources to       address more time-sensitive H-2A and H-2B applications for       farmers and seasonal nonagricultural businesses.              Weakening Wage and Safety Protections for Workers         The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) promotes compliance with       basic labor laws and ensures that workers receive the       protections they are entitled to under the law. Last year,       WHD staff recovered more than $213 million in back wages for       nearly 153,000 workers--an average of $1.400 per worker.       These recovered wages make a real difference for workers       struggling to pay rent. buy food, pay for childcare, or cover       gas or transportation costs to get to their jobs.        Cuts to WHD funding levels would undermine the agency's       ability to ensure workers receive the wages that they've       earned. WHD would be forced to reduce the number of       compliance actions, investigations, and targeted inspections       that result in recovery for thousands of workers.        Specifically, a 22 percent reduction in funding levels       would result in about $156 million less in back wages for       135,000 workers or an average over $1,000 per worker. A       return to FY 2022 enacted levels would result in $24.5       million less in back wages recovered for nearly 21,000       workers.        The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)       works to assure safe and healthful working conditions. Every       worker deserves to return home safely at the end of the day.       Cutting OSHA's budget by one-fifth would mean fewer       inspections, fewer staff, less enforcement, and less safe and       healthy workplaces.        A 22 percent budget reduction would result in OSHA losing       at least 270 inspectors and conducting 10,800 fewer       inspections. This would be by far the lowest level of       enforcement in OSHA's 52-year history. Fewer inspections       would significantly reduce OSHA's ability to conduct       proactive and more complex inspections such as those       involving chemical exposure, heat, musculoskeletal injuries,       and workplace violence. A return to 2022 enacted levels would       result in 2,800 fewer safety inspections and 715 fewer health       inspections.        OSHA would drastically cut back on responding to worker       complaints and proactive inspections, including strategic       priorities like silica, heat, and fall protection. Reducing       OSHA's ability to conduct preventive inspections would result       in more workplace injuries and illnesses--allowing       unscrupulous employers to put workers in danger under a       weaker, more predictable, and less strategic OSHA.        The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) works to       prevent death, illness. and injury from mining and promote       safe and healthful workplaces for U.S. miners. MSHA's       enforcement responsibilities--statutorily mandated       inspections, accident investigations, and responding to       hazard complaints, among others--have contributed       significantly to the reduction in fatal mining accidents.        Significant budget cuts would jeopardize the health and       safety of the nation's miners. For example, under a 22       percent reduction, MSHA would not be able to complete       approximately 4,400 mandatory inspections of surface and       underground mines. Fatal accident investigation activities       would continue but MSHA could not perform serious injury       accident investigations and could only investigate 75 percent       of hazard complaints in a timely manner. Targeted safety and       health initiatives that address hazards associated with the       leading causes of mining fatalities and occupational       illnesses would not occur. Approximately one third of coal       mine plan and addenda approvals, which are necessary for       operators to continue mining operations, would be delayed by       approximately a month.        At the FY 2022 funding level, MSHA would not be able to       complete approximately 2,200 mandatory inspections of surface       and underground mines. Fatal accident investigations would       continue, but MSHA would be limited in its ability to perform       any serious accident investigations and could only       investigate 50 percent of the hazard complaints in a timely       manner. Approximately 3,200 samples for respirable dust,       silica, diesel particulate matter, and other toxic substances       would not be taken, putting miners at risk of developing       preventable debilitating occupational illnesses like Black       Lung and silicosis.            Eliminating Critical Employment Services for Veterans         The Department's Veterans' Employment and Training Service       helps veterans transition to employment, protects their       employment rights, and promotes their employment       opportunities.        The Jobs for Veterans State Grants (JVSG) program provides       intensive employment and job placement services for eligible       veterans, and JVSG fund allow states to hire qualified       veterans to provide these services. There are currently over       1,800 JVSG staff at 2,300 American Job Centers (AJC)       nationwide. A 22 percent reduction would result in 4,282       fewer veterans experiencing or at risk of homelessness       receiving employment services through the Homeless Veterans'       Reintegration Program (HVRP). A return to the 2022 enacted       level would lead to a reduction of 16 staff serving veterans       at AJCs as well as 1,428 fewer veterans experiencing or at       risk of homelessness receiving employment services through       HVRP.        I have seen first-hand the positive impacts of the Biden-      Harris plan. 202 1 and 2022 were the two strongest years of       job growth in our nation's history. More than 12 million jobs       have been created since President Biden took office--      including nearly 800.000 manufacturing jobs. The unemployment       rate has been below 4% for more than a year, and a record       number of small businesses have started since President Biden       took office. Black Americans and Hispanic Americans have       near-record-low unemployment rates and people with       disabilities are experiencing record-low unemployment.        The Department stands ready and committed to continuing the       plan as laid out by the Biden-Harris Administration to build       an economy and a labor market that is more just and equitable       and creates opportunity for all.

[[Page H1971]]                                          ____                                    The Secretary of Education,                                     Washington, DC, March 17, 2023.      Hon. Rosa DeLauro,      Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member DeLauro: Thank you for your letter of       January 19, 2023, requesting details regarding the potential       impact of proposed budget cuts on the economy, neighborhoods,       and other essential government functions that keep people       healthy and safe.        President Biden's FY24 Budget lays out a detailed plan to       invest in America, continue to lower costs for families,       protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare, and       reduce the deficit. Meanwhile, Congressional Republicans have       proposed unprecedented cuts in fiscal year (FY) 2024 funding       for key services, programs, and protections such as       education, public safety, research, nutrition and more. Cuts       on this scale would have very real and damaging impacts on       our families, our communities, our economy, and our       competitiveness--undermining a broad range of critical       services the American people rely on in their everyday lives.        Your letter specifically references a plan to cap fiscal       year 2024 discretionary spending at the fiscal year 2022       enacted level. Your letter makes clear that the impact of       such a plan on agency appropriation levels is at this time       unknown, as the specifics of the plan have not been publicly       released. If we assumed that defense funding would be       shielded from budget cuts under this plan, it would equate to       a cut of about 22 percent to non-defense discretionary       funding. Accordingly, we analyzed impacts at two levels: 1)       FY 2022 enacted and 2) 22 percent below the currently enacted       level for FY 2023.        As you know, the Federal government has long played a       critical role in supporting States, school districts, and       postsecondary institutions in meeting the needs of students,       especially underserved students and children in under-      resourced communities, children with disabilities, English       learners, and those experiencing homelessness. While       representing but a small portion of overall education funding       nationwide, Federal resources help States and school       districts fill gaps in State and local support and meet       critical needs for our most vulnerable students. From       supporting additional staff positions and educational       materials, to expanding after school programming, providing       access to life-changing education and training, and helping       students afford college, the Federal investment in education       makes a positive difference in children's lives every day.        The Department of Education has examined several of our       most significant programs to assess potential impacts       resulting from 1) receiving FY 2022 funding and 2) receiving       funding 22 percent below currently enacted levels:        ESEA Title I Grants to LEAs--a reduction to the FY 2022       enacted level would cut $850 million in funding from this       program--a cut equivalent to removing more than 13,000       teachers and service providers from classrooms serving low-      income children; a 22 percent reduction from the currently       enacted level would cut approximately $4.0 billion in       funding, impacting an estimated 25 million students and       reducing program funding to its lowest level in almost a       decade--a cut equivalent to removing more than 60,000       teachers and related service providers from classrooms       serving low-income students.        IDEA Grants to States--a reduction to the FY 2022 enacted       level would cut $850 million in funding from this program--a       cut equivalent to removing more than 13,000 teachers and       service providers from classrooms serving low-income       children; a 22 percent reduction from the currently enacted       level would cut more than $3.1 billion in funding, impacting       an estimated 7.5 million children with disabilities and       reducing Federal support to its lowest share since 1997--a       cut equivalent to removing more than 48,000 teachers and       related services providers from the classroom.        Title II-A (Supporting effective instruction State grants)       and Title IV-A (Student support and academic enrichment       grants)--a reduction to the FY 2022 enacted level would cut       more than $35 million for these activities; a 22 percent       reduction from the currently enacted level would cut more       than $500 million in annual support for teachers and       students, curtailing learning opportunities for teachers and       school leaders, and hampering school districts' efforts to       promote a well-rounded education for students in safe       schools.        Pell Grants--a reduction to the FY 2022 enacted level would       likely have a minimal effect on students and parents, while a       reduction of 22 percent from currently enacted levels would       likely reduce the maximum Pell award by nearly $1,000,       decreasing aid to all 6.6 million Pell recipients and       eliminating Pell Grants altogether for approximately 80,000       students. Cutting the discretionary funding by 22 percent       without cutting the maximum award would eliminate the surplus       and create a $17 billion shortfall by 2026. The program       cannot function with a shortfall that large.        Administering Student Financial Aid--a reduction of 22       percent from currently enacted levels would cut $468 million       in federal support to determine, disburse, and service       student aid. This level of funding would have devastating       effects on student and parent interactions with the       Department, as well as on their ability to successfully apply       for and receive student aid. However, even if funding were       kept at the FY 2022 enacted level, more than 40 million       student loan borrowers would be impacted through decreased       service hours and longer turnaround times to make changes to       student loan repayment plans, or obtain a deferment,       forbearance, or discharge of student loans. More than 17 .6       million students and parents applying for student aid and       calling the Department for information could experience       multiple-hour wait times and reduced center hours, and       student aid applicants requesting specific assistance with       the FAFSA, student loan promissory notes, PLUS loan       applications, or other student aid applications could see       their requests take weeks longer to process. Additionally,       the oversight of the more than 5,500 schools and enforcement       of the Higher Education Act would suffer, putting taxpayer       dollars at risk.        Federal Work-Study Program (FWS)--a reduction to the FY       2022 enacted level would provide less aid for all program       recipients and eliminate FWS financial support for       approximately 11,000 students; a cut of 22 percent from the       currently enacted level would provide less aid for all       program recipients and eliminate Work-Study financial support       for approximately 85,000 students. Schools would be forced to       make impossible decisions around whether to cut essential       positions reliant on FWS funds or the amounts that students       are able to earn under the program.

Sincerely,                                          Miguel A. Cardona, Ed.D.,      U.S. Secretary of Education.                                   ____                                                 U.S. Small Business                                                  Administration,       Washington, DC, March 20, 2023.      Hon. Rosa L. DeLauro,      Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Representative DeLauro: Thank you for your January 19,       2023 letter to the U.S. Small Business Administration       (``SBA'') regarding plans by House Republican Leadership to       cap Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 discretionary spending at the FY       2022 enacted level. President Biden's FY 2024 Budget lays out       a detailed plan to invest in America and the small business       economy, continue to lower costs for families, protect and       strengthen Social Security and Medicare, and reduce the       deficit.        Strong Federal support and investments by Congress ensure       that America's 33 million small businesses have the resources       they need to create jobs across our nation. SBA offers access       to affordable capital, training, and technical assistance to       help small businesses grow and thrive. These resources have       been critical especially during the surge of new-start small       businesses over the past two years under the Biden       Administration. Congressional Republicans have proposed       unprecedented cuts in FY 2024 funding for key services and       programs. While Congressional Republicans haven't released a       specific plan, cuts on this scale would have very real and       damaging impacts on our small businesses, our communities,       our economy, and our competitiveness--undermining a broad       range of critical services the American people rely on in       their everyday lives. That is why I share your concern that       proposed budget cuts could have a negative impact on SBA's       ability to deliver important services to American citizens       and small businesses who rely on the SBA for guidance and       support and capital.        One example of the potential impact is to the SBA's       Entrepreneurial Development appropriation which funds       critical programs that served 1.2 million small businesses in       2022. If Entrepreneurial Development program funding levels       are capped at FY 2022 levels--a cut of $29.9 million from FY       2023 enacted funding levels--we estimate that up to 125,000       fewer entrepreneurs and small businesses would have access to       free business counseling supported by SBA, including the       Small Business Development Centers, that help bolster the       small business economy. If Entrepreneurial Development       Program funding levels were reduced by 22 percent from FY       2023 enacted, this would be a reduction of $70.4 million,       which would equate to nearly 295,000 fewer small businesses       being served. Either scenario would have a significant impact       on the agency's ability to ensuring that undeserved       communities such as Veterans, Women, and Native American       entrepreneurs receive the support they deserve. We estimate       that thousands of veterans and women entrepreneurs would be       impacted negatively as they look to start or grow their own       businesses. For instance, we would have fewer opportunities       to further expand equity efforts for underserved and       underrepresented small business communities, including       specific reduction to support Veterans, Women, Native       American entrepreneurs.        Additionally, reductions to SBA's Salaries and Expense       funding would be detrimental to SBA's operations. If funding       is reduced to FY 2022 enacted funding levels in FY 2024, SBA       will not have sufficient funding to fully support the       Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Certification       program. A cut to funding in this program could significantly       impact SBA's ability to certify service-disabled veteran-      owned small businesses. This certification is crucial to the       35,000 veterans and service-disabled veterans that  [[Page H1972]]       compete for and provide integral services to the Federal       Government.        Reverting to FY 2022 spending levels would also shrink       SBA's staffing by up to 203 positions which has a direct       impact on the agency's ability to deliver and oversee       services for small businesses. Staff reductions will result       in SBA customer service degradation in loan processing, small       business outreach, training and counseling, processing       government contracting, and validating small business       certifications. Small businesses and resource partners will       likely experience longer wait times, and SBA may become to       network and cybersecurity infrastructure threats and attacks       at the risk of all SBA stakeholders.        A 22 percent reduction from FY 2023 enacted levels would       reduce Salaries and Expenses by nearly 385 positions, which       could not be attained without a reduction in force and       further reductions to services and outreach to small       businesses provided across the board. This would also reduce       Disaster Loan Program Administration by nearly $8 million, or       over 45 positions, hurting SBA's ability to respond quickly       when a disaster strikes to ensure access to capital for       disaster survivors.        Finally, maintaining SBA's Office of Inspector General       (OIG) funding at the FY 2022 enacted level would decrease       OIG's investigative and fraud enforcement capabilities by       over $25 million in FY 2024, and would undermine the SBA's       OIG mission to fight fraud and abuse, including in COVID-19       relief programs. SBA is committed to combating fraud, waste,       and abuse, and the taxpayers benefit greatly from the       Inspector General's ongoing efforts. We need to ensure that       we continue to build on that commitment.        I stand ready to provide Congress with any further       information to ensure the small business owners and       entrepreneurs can continue to be supported. Thank you for       your partnership in helping the American people and the       economy.            Sincerely,                                          Isabella Casillas Guzman,      Administrator.                                   ____           U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the             Secretary,                                    Washington, DC, March 17, 2023.      Hon. Rosa L. DeLauro,      Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member DeLauro: Thank you for your letter       requesting the impact of the proposed House Republican       Leadership 2024 budget cuts on Department of Housing and       Urban Development (HUD) programs and assisted families. In       short, the reduced funding scenarios would represent the most       devastating impacts in HUD's history.        On March 9th, President Biden released his Budget showing       his plans to invest in America, continue to lower costs for       families, protect and strengthen Social Security and       Medicare, and reduce the deficit. Congressional Republicans       are reportedly planning unprecedented cuts in 2024 funding       for key services, programs, and protections such as       education, public safety, research, nutrition and more. While       Congressional Republicans have not released one specific       plan, cuts on this scale would have very real and damaging       impacts on our families, our communities, our economy, and       our competitiveness--undermining a broad range of critical       services the American people rely on in their everyday lives.       This letter will consider two scenarios, a reduction to 2022       enacted levels and a 22 percent reduction to 2023 enacted       levels.        Most HUD programs received modest increases in 2023.       Increases in the 2023 enacted budget levels relative to 2022       primarily serve to maintain existing programs, not to permit       program expansions. Except for targeted funding increases for       homeless assistance and tenant-based Housing Choice Vouchers       (HCV), almost all of HUD's programs remained at or near level       funding with zero or minimal increases. Consequently, any       cuts to the 2023 level do not eliminate ``extra'' funding       added in 2023 but translate to direct cuts to the 2022       baseline. These cuts, in turn, would reduce existing services       that families and communities rely on, including programs       housing low-income families.        Today's HUD rental housing programs' funding levels are       necessary to maintain existing rental assistance to keep       currently assisted families in their homes. Under the 22       percent potential funding cut scenario, it would be       impossible to stave off mass evictions.                    If These Draconian Cuts Were Made--                 Thousands Would Lose Housing Choice Vouchers         Nearly the entire increase in voucher funding between 2022       and 2023 (aside from small amounts for homeless veterans and       at-risk youth) supported renewal of existing assistance to       families in their current units. The dollar increase relative       to 2022 was necessary to match major cost increases in the       housing market. For example, between 2022 and 2023 the       national population-weighted average Fair Market Rent (FMR)       increased by nearly 10 percent, with 16 HUD Metro FMR Areas       increasing by 20 percent or more. Rents are expected to stay       high in 2024, even as growth slows down. Any cut to the 2023       funding level will not simply revert to the same number of       families that could be supported in 2022, but will put large       numbers of the most vulnerable and lowest income American       families at risk of losing their rental assistance entirely.       HUD rental assistance serves the most vulnerable low-income       families, with an average income of only $15,000 per year,       and includes older adults, persons with disabilities, and       families with children. The Housing Choice Voucher program       currently assists approximately 2.3 million families.        2022 flat--eliminates funding for 350,000 families.        22 percent cut to 2023 funding--eliminates funding for       640,000 families.     Families Living in Public Housing Would be Exposed to Unsafe Living                                 Conditions         The needs of public housing portfolio continue to grow, so       major cuts to this program threaten to remove important       affordable housing assets from the inventory. If there is a       22 percent cut, HUD calculates an expected 78 percent       proration for the Operating Fund. At this level, there would       be significant impacts to PHA operations. All PHAs would need       to drastically cut operations, including regular property       maintenance, services to families, and likely staff layoffs       to right-size operations to expected revenues. Deferred       maintenance would decrease housing quality, potentially       exposing families to unsafe living conditions such as mold       and lead-based paint. Finally, there would be the likelihood       of PHA insolvency or other program failures. The projected       $700 million cut from the capital grants would leave no       funding to address backlog needs and $2 billion in unfunded       accrual needs. Unmet capital needs mean the further       deterioration of the inventory and contribute to lower       occupancy rates, higher costs for utilities, less resilience       to climate change, and increased health and safety risks for       residents.    There Would be an Unprecedented Loss of Existing Affordable Housing,                         Leading to Mass Evictions         HUD's Project-Based Rental Assistance (PBRA) program, which       serves approximately 1.3 million families, needed almost $1       billion above 2022 levels to just renew the existing owner       contracts for 2023. These increases are statutory and reflect       increased costs, and HUD cannot avoid them within the       contracts. As a result, any cuts to the 2023 level would       force HUD to short fund or cancel existing contracts between       the federal government and private property owners. The       termination of contracts with rental owners will likely lead       the owners to convert their housing to market-rate, leaving       currently supported tenants in units that are now       unaffordable to them, likely resulting in evictions. This       would represent an historically unprecedented loss of       existing affordable housing, a breach of federal contracts,       and a repudiation of decades of long-term bipartisan federal       investment.        2022 flat--eliminates funding for approximately 87,000       families        22 percent cut to 2023 funding--eliminates funding for       approximately 286,000 families         States and Localities Would Be Prevented from Making Basic                        Infrastructure Improvements         In addition to rental assistance, HUD's programs also       include the most popular and effective funding programs for       states, cities, counties, and towns: Community Development       Block Grants (CDBG) and HOME Investment Partnerships. CDBG       and HOME provide flexible block grant assistance whereby       funding decisions are locally controlled.        CDBG: The median CDBG annual grant is $1 million provided       through a block grant allocation formula. Urban and rural       municipalities and counties rely on the funding for basic       housing-related infrastructure such as rehabilitation of       existing affordable housing, water and sewer connections,       sidewalks, as well as direct assistance for small businesses,       economic development, and essential services. The estimated       impact of the funding cut of 22 percent will reduce the       average grant by approximately $440,000.        HOME: As with CDBG, the vital HOME Program received zero       increase in 2023. Funding cuts to HOME would result in fewer       new affordable rental and homeownership opportunities for       low-income families, fewer grants for repair and       rehabilitation of existing affordable housing, and less       tenant-based rental assistance available, resulting in       increased risk of homelessness. This will directly exacerbate       the existing national affordable housing crisis. The       estimated impact of the funding cut of 22 percent from 2023       to the average HOME formula grant of $1.5 million will reduce       the average grant by $330,000 and will result in more than       6,700 fewer units of affordable housing produced.          Thousands More Americans Would be Sleeping on the Streets         HUD received a targeted increase in funding for Homeless       Assistance Grants in 2023, which would sustain existing       resources for emergency shelter, increase availability of       permanent supportive housing, and continue to provide other       homeless assistance to the most vulnerable Americans. Undoing       this increase will severely curtail the services that       communities across the country would be able to provide to       those experiencing homelessness. Cuts to the Emergency       Solutions Grants (ESG) program from the 2023 baseline would       result in less emergency shelter, homelessness prevention,       and rapid rehousing. A funding cut of 22 percent would result       in over 24,000 fewer people receiving assistance, likely       leading to large increases in the number of people sleeping       on the streets.        In the Continuum of Care and Youth Homelessness       Demonstration Program, funding provides permanent supportive       housing for people with severe disabilities and illnesses,       and rapid rehousing and transitional  [[Page H1973]]       housing for youth and adults to help them achieve housing       stability and self-sufficiency. In recent years, HUD has       significantly expanded assistance to people fleeing domestic       violence. Providing funding at the 2022 level for CoC       renewals would result in at least 54,000 fewer homeless       people and domestic violence survivors receiving assistance       than in 2023, and a 22 percent cut from 2023 levels would       result in nearly 95,000 fewer people receiving assistance.       These cuts would eliminate new funding for the Youth       Homelessness Demonstration Program, an effort that has helped       reduce the number of homeless unaccompanied youth by more       than 25 percent since 2017.        Dire Housing Conditions in Indian Country Would be Exacerbated         Housing conditions in Indian Country are among the most       dire in the United States. Thus, any cuts to the 2023 formula       funding level would have a significant impact on the program,       which is the single largest source of funding for Indian       housing assistance. It would make it almost impossible for       most Tribal grantees to construct new affordable housing       units and a challenge to meet the basic operations and       maintenance needs of their existing housing. It would also       make it extremely difficult to leverage other non-Federal       resources to develop affordable housing. Funding for the       formula block grant component would be reduced by $173       million with a 22-percent cut, which would reduce funding for       Native American Housing Block Grants to its lowest level       since it was implemented in 1996 (adjusting for inflation).                Efforts to Abate Lead Hazards Would be Slowed         HUD's Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes programs to       reduce lead poisoning hazards for children in lower income       families, together with a variety of programs aimed at       reducing indoor home health hazards. Home health hazards are       scientifically proven to cause lifelong damage when ongoing       exposure occurs during childhood. For example, even low       levels of lead exposure during childhood have been linked       with lifelong impacts on intelligence, attention, and       academic achievement. Further cuts below the previous 2022       level would substantially slow and adversely affect the       Federal government's planned efforts to abate lead hazards       and prevent home health hazards from negatively affecting       child development.                    Critical Research Would be Jeopardized         The Office of Policy Development and Research (PD&R)       enables the Congress, the Secretary, and other HUD principal       staff to make evidence-informed decisions on budget and       legislative proposals and strengthens housing and community       development policy. The total investment for research,       evaluation, and technical assistance was essentially level       between 2022 and 2023. Thus, any cuts would substantially       reduce HUD's ability to conduct research, program       evaluations, and provide critical technical assistance (TA)       and capacity building support, including, for example,       through the Distressed Cities TA program that supports small,       rural and underserved localities. A 22 percent cut to PD&R's       2023 funding would result in a $32 million cut to existing       activities and investments, placing major PD&R-funded survey       efforts at risk, such as the American Housing Survey,       jeopardizing critical research providing the next generation       of evidence on how HUD can most effectively support       affordable homeownership and quality rental housing.     Efforts to Combat Housing Discrimination Would be Severely Impacted         A 22 percent cut to Fair Housing Programs would severely       impact the ability of the Fair Housing Assistance Program       (FHAP) to support state and local agency enforcement of the       Fair Housing Act nationwide. FHAP agencies currently       investigate about 75 percent of all fair housing complaints       filed under the Fair Housing Act, and this level of funding       would jeopardize the FHAP agencies' ability to conduct       investigations, litigate complaints, retain staff, and keep       up with inflation. This level of funding would also hinder       the Department's ability to admit new FHAP agencies into the       program.        A 22 percent cut to the Fair Housing Initiatives Program       (FHIP) would significantly impact the geographical       representation of and activities performed by fair housing       organizations nationally. Last year, as usual, HUD was unable       to fund all Education and Outreach Initiative (EOI) qualified       applicants. A reduction would further limit HUD's ability to       fund organizations in underserved and unserved communities.       This also could prevent HUD from maintaining the current       maximum level of funding under the Private Enforcement       Initiative (PEI), which funds fair housing organizations to       conduct testing, investigations, and public education and       outreach on the rights and responsibilities under the Fair       Housing Act. Lastly, the Fair Housing Accessibility FIRST       program would be severely limited in maintaining a broad       scope of services, especially focused on addressing       accessibility compliance in federally-assisted affordable       housing programs.                    Highlighted Impacts on HUD Operations       Salaries and Expenses (S&E)        If HUD's 2024 appropriation were equal to the 2022       appropriation, that would result in a reduction of $152       million from our current 2023 enacted level and require HUD       to absorb a staffing reduction of over 650 full time       equivalents (FTE), which would have devastating impacts on       HUD services in all Program Offices. A reduction of this size       would require an immediate hiring freeze and the potential       for at least some furlough days, which would cause HUD       services to the public to be suspended or delayed, including       providing assistance to existing FHA homeowners, increasing       homeownership opportunities for potential homebuyers,       processing fair housing complaints and conducting complex       closings of multifamily properties.        A 22 percent reduction from the 2023 enacted level would       reduce S&E by $390 million and require a staffing reduction       of more than 1,700 FTE. Given HUD is unable to attrit that       amount of FTE during a fiscal year, it would require either       implementing a Reduction in Force (RIF), incurring up to 60       furlough days, or a combination of the two, which would cause       HUD services to the public to be delayed or suspended.       Additionally, it would result in dramatic reductions in       contractor support services to include areas such as federal       protection services for building security and financial       oversight and audit support services.      Information Technology (IT)        Reducing the Department's IT resources to the 2022 level       represents a significant operational vulnerability. Such a       reduction will have agency-wide implications on HUD       operations and program administration. At this reduced       funding level, the current operations and maintenance       contracts will be scaled back resulting in a diminished       service level for software and systems across the Department.       While HUD will make every effort to keep public facing       systems operational and available for external partners and       the public, HUD cannot guarantee full functionality of these       systems with budget reductions of this magnitude.        A 22 percent reduction in IT resources creates an extremely       high level of risk to the Department's core technology       infrastructure and services. At this level, a portion of       HUD's existing operations and maintenance contracts will stop       work due to insufficient funds. The likely impacts include       prioritization of contractor support for existing major       systems and cancelation of support for systems within the       nonmajor portfolio. This diminished support will lead to       grantee and stakeholder interruptions due to inability to       access HUD grant systems and financial interfaces. Such       challenges may delay state, local, and non-profit partners       access to formula grant funding and rental assistance due to       service disruption in relevant IT systems and contractor       support. Local governments would face delays in implementing       the plans that they put in place to, for example, construct       affordable housing or provide support to Meals on Wheels, as       they waited for HUD's systems. New homebuyers and affordable       housing developers could experience delays in FHA and       multifamily loan processing to service disruptions to       associated systems.        All IT development will stop and existing contract support       for these and any new efforts will terminate. As you can see,       the proposed funding cuts would have a catastrophic impact on       the ability of HUD to provide quality, affordable homes for       all and to develop equitable, inclusive communities. Please       do not hesitate to reach out for any additional assistance.            Sincerely,      Marcia L. Fudge.                                   ____                                                  U.S. Department of                                               Homeland Security,                                     Washington, DC, March 19, 2023.      Hon. Rosa L. DeLauro,      Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member DeLauro: Thank you for your January 19,       2023, letter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).       Secretary Mayorkas asked that I respond on his behalf.        On March 9, President Biden released his Budget for DHS       that equips our Department to address the threats of today       and prepare for the threats of tomorrow. The President's       budget invests in programs that protect us against the threat       of terrorism, strengthen the security of our borders, ensures       the swift response to and recovery from natural disasters,       and more.        As requested, DHS conducted an analysis of what capping FY       2024 discretionary spending at the FY 2022 enacted level       would mean to the services the Department provides to the       American people.        The entire Department and the critical services we provide       would be impacted, including but not limited to the       following:        A reduction in CBP frontline law enforcement staffing       levels of up to 2,400 agents and officers;        A reduction in our Department's ability to prevent drugs       from entering the country;        Cuts in federal assistance to state, local, tribal,       territorial, and private sector partners for disaster       preparedness; and        Reductions in TSA personnel that would result in wait times       in excess of 2 hours at large airports across the country.        The analysis in the enclosure provides additional details       on just some of the significant impacts that may occur.  Operational Impacts of Returning to FY 2022 Funding Levels--Department                            of Homeland Security                   U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)         Sea and Land Ports of Entry: CBP's Office of Field       Operations (OFO) may need to reduce hours of service at all       sea and land ports of entry (220 ports in total) and would  [[Page H1974]]       deny landing rights at all 241 airports outside of core hours       of operation based on personnel availability. With reduced       hours, wait times would increase and some land ports of entry       may close with commercial and private traffic still in       queues, which would result in exacerbated supply chain issues       potentially impacting food stuffs and American manufacturing.        Staffing: CBP may be forced to implement a hiring freeze,       which would impact the agency's ability to hire the       additional 300 Border Patrol Agents (BPAs) provided for in       the FY 2023 budget and the 150 CBP Officers (CBPOs) and BPAs       requested in the FY 2024 Budget. A hiring freeze would also       result in attrition of frontline law enforcement officers by       perhaps as much as 1,000 CBPOs and 1,400 BPAs.        Fentanyl Impacts:        Any impacts on CBPO staffing levels, described above, would       negatively impact fentanyl seizures as well as other       narcotics seizures.        Impacts could also affect the operations at ports of entry       for lawful travel and goods presented for admission to the       United States. Approximately 90 percent of resources at ports       of entry go through these regular operations, which impact       the special operations teams responsible for targeting,       enforcement, and analysis. Reductions to these special       operations teams will result in a reduction in targeting       opioids for both inbound and outbound operations.        With limited resources, OFO would only be able to perform       enhanced inspections upon primary or threshold level targets.       Reducing or eliminating outbound operations will result in       more money not being interdicted leaving the U.S. and enable       more trafficking and deeper concealments, likely increasing       the amount of fentanyl entering the country.        Air and Marine Operations: CBP's Office of Air and Marine       Operations would experience 56 percent reduction in       operational capabilities equating to 45,833 unexecuted       aircraft hours and 11,448 boat hours. A reduction of this       magnitude would result in a reduction in our operations       equivalent to the following:        154,657 lbs. of cocaine not seized        859 lbs. of fentanyl and 1,948 lbs. of heroin not seized        17,148 lbs. of methamphetamine not seized        $9M in currency not seized        561 criminals not arrested, and 57,594 apprehensions not       made        361 people not rescued        Trade: CBP enforces trade laws and implements measures such       as penalties, suspensions, and debarment while enforcing       anti-dumping and countervailing duties as well as forced       labor laws. Decreasing the capacity of the Office of Trade       would result in unprecedented gaps in defending America's       economic security, resulting in revenue loss to the U.S.       government and economy. Additional impacts include       degradation of trade enforcement operations resulting in       increased violations of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)       such as the production of counterfeit goods, duty evasion       through transshipment, misclassification, country of origin       claims, and use of forced labor in the production of goods       in U.S. supply chains.        Agriculture: Due to decreased inspectional staff and       capacity, these cuts would result in increased risk of       introductions of foreign animal disease, including African       Swine Fever, and plant pests due to significant increases in       cargo and passenger wait times.           Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)         Cyber Resiliency: Budget cuts would stifle CISA's early       efforts to support cyber resiliency across state, local,       tribal, and territorial governments. This critical support       ensures resource-poor jurisdictions (or their management       service providers) are cognizant of threats and prepared to       face them, and are hardening the defenses of the national       critical functions under their stewardship (e.g., water       supply, wastewater treatment, and emergency communications).       Specifically, cyber resiliency provides support to       stakeholders and mission partners in their efforts to       predict, adapt, and dynamically recover from threats in high-      risk areas who are significantly underserved with current       resources. Without this funding, CISA will not be able to:        Design targeted assessments for highlighting cybersecurity       threats and vulnerabilities to emergency communications       systems nor identify mitigating actions;        Identify requirements, develop, and deliver curriculum that       improves cybersecurity and interoperability in the face of       evolving IP-hosted communications technology used during       responses of varying size/complexity;        Design specific assessments for urban areas to evaluate and       enhance cybersecurity; nor,        Expand Emergency Communications Coordinators' support to       stakeholders via CISA's regional service delivery model.        In addition, the reduction of funding would eliminate the       Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM)/Federal Acquisition       Security Council (FASC) program. This would impact CISA's       execution of DHS's responsibility as the FASC's Information       Sharing Agency (ISA) and would terminate support on the       development of a doctrine required to respond to Federal       Government-wide supply chain risks and planning coordination.        Cyber Protection: CISA would not have the resources to       implement requirements of the Cyber Incident Reporting for       Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA). CIRCIA requires       CISA to develop and implement regulations requiring covered       entities to report cyber incidents and ransomware payments to       CISA. These reports enable CISA to rapidly deploy resources       and render assistance to victims suffering attacks, analyze       cross-sector trends, and quickly share information with       network defenders to warn other potential victims.       Implementation of this new congressional mandate will result       in an exponential increase in the number of incident reports       coming from critical infrastructure. If funding is held at FY       2022 levels, CISA would not have any dedicated funding to       respond to this new requirement and therefore would be unable       to collect and rapidly share information with critical       infrastructure owners and operators.        Cyber Incident Response: CISA's Operations Center would       lose the ability to ingest, triage, collate. record, and       visualize information from over 50,000 cyber incidents over a       one-year period. CISA would be unable to provide critical       infrastructure owners and operators with analyzed reports,       statistics, or trends, leading to a significant decrease in       their ability to proactively avoid known and emerging threats       and vulnerabilities to the nation's critical infrastructure.        State and Local Impacts: Budget cuts would lead to a 13       percent reduction in CISA's regional field forces. The       regional workforce is a critical component of CISA's service       delivery model. With reduced funding, CISA would have to       reduce assistance provided in response to ransomware and       other cyberattacks. It would also have to reduce security       assessments and chemical inspections, thereby impacting       businesses, healthcare providers, K-12 institutions, state       and local governments, municipalities, and critical       infrastructure entities. In addition, CISA would have to       reduce the number of engagements and support of pre-election       security assessments of polling places in communities       nationwide. This would result in limiting interactions with       local election officials where CISA helps to assure the       security of election offices, polling places, and election       infrastructure. The number of impacted jurisdictions would       vary by state, as some states have tens of election       jurisdictions, and some states have more than a thousand.                  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)         FEMA grant assistance to support and help state, local,       tribal, and territorial governments (SLTT) and the private       sector could be reduced by half. This would negatively impact       SLTT capabilities to implement preparedness strategies       successfully and reduce or eliminate longterm risks to people       and property from hazards and their effects.                 Transportation Security Administration (TSA)         Passenger Security Wait Times and Aviation Security:        In FY 2024, passenger volume is anticipated to increase by       9.2 percent over FY 2022 levels. Fewer Transportation       Security Officers would increase passenger wait times from 10       minutes in FY 2023 to upwards of 30 minutes in FY 2024. At       larger airports, passengers would experience wait times in       excess of two hours where a steady influx of passengers makes       it impossible to recover without the necessary staffing.       These high wait times would also result in large crowds of       unscreened people in the checkpoint queues, increasing       potential soft targets.        Transportation security equipment maintenance would have to       be reduced, impacting equipment reliability and increasing       passenger wait times while resulting in costly actions to       modify contracts.        Furloughed positions would impact transportation security       now and in the future as TSA would see fewer staff at       checkpoints. Additionally, TSA would have a greater gap       between experienced staff and staff with minimal experience.                          u.s. Secret Service (USSS)         Cyber Fraud Task Forces: Secret Service would eliminate or       severely reduce the capacity of the 42 Cyber Fraud Task       Forces across the country that partner with private industry,       state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement       agencies and federal and state prosecutors to prevent,       detect, and mitigate complex cyber-enabled financial crimes.        Cyber Forensics Training: Secret Service would shut down       the National Computer Forensics Institute (NCFI) and       eliminate training for state, local, tribal, and territorial       law enforcement, prosecutors, and judges used to combat cyber       threats. NCFI graduates conduct cyber forensic exams across       the USSS, completing over 150,000 exams in FY 2022 that were       for cases involving murder, rape, and child exploitation.        COVID-19 Fraud: Cuts would reduce the ability of Secret       Service to combat COVID-19 related crime by over 50 percent.       USSS is currently focused on four broad areas of COVID-19       related crime and to date has arrested over 500 criminals,       recovered $1B and responded to over 5,000 investigations and       inquiries.                           U.S. Coast Guard (USCG)         The United States Coast Guard would immediately cease the       advancement of acquisitions, procurement, and construction       resulting in a reduction to operational readiness along the       maritime borders. Specifically, the inability to progress the       Coast Guard's two highest acquisition priorities, the       Offshore Patrol Cutter and the Polar Security Cutter, would       create an operational gap and further delay of the U.S.       presence in the polar regions and reduce the ability detect,       deter,  [[Page H1975]]       prevent, and disrupt terrorist attacks and other criminal       acts in the U.S. maritime domain as well as our National       Defense Strategy.                                   ____                                                               USDA,                                         Office of the Secretary,                                     Washington, DC, March 17, 2023.      Hon. Rosa L. DeLauro,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Appropriations, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member DeLauro: Thank you for your letter of       January 19, 2023, requesting an analysis of the impact of       potential non-Defense spending cuts on the American people       that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) serves. I am       very concerned about the unprecedented cuts in FY 2024       funding that Congressional Republicans have proposed. While       Congressional Republicans haven't released a specific plan,       cuts on the scale suggested would have a very real and       damaging impacts on our families, our communities, our       economy, and our competitiveness--undermining a broad range       of critical services the American people rely on in their       everyday lives such as food and nutrition security,       protection of life and property from catastrophic wildland       fires, a safe food supply, and more. President Biden released       a Budget on March 9th that demonstrates his commitment to       invest in America, continuing to provide the critical       services the American people depend on, and reducing the       deficit.        USDA analyzed two possible House Republican Leadership plan       scenarios. One assumes a funding level equal to that of       fiscal year 2022 and while the other assumes a 22 percent       reduction in funding for Government programs, which would       mean a reduction of about $6.15 billion for USDA in FY 2024.       A decrease of that magnitude would threaten the safety and       well-being of tens of millions of Americans, raise the risk       of homelessness for tens of thousands of Americans, and lead       to thousands of farm families not having access to the credit       and help they need to continue to farm.        The attachment provides a few examples of impacts but does       not capture the entirety of the detrimental effects should       the House Republicans' plan come to fruition. I would be       happy to meet with you to discuss further or, if requested,       provide more information in writing.        I deeply profoundly hope that Congressional leaders will       reach an agreement that will does not result in these       draconian reductions to USDA. I look forward to working with       Congress to preserve the many priorities of rural America.        Again, thank you for writing.            Sincerely,                                                 Thomas J. Vilsack,                                                         Secretary.               Additional Analysis of Potential Spending Cuts       Bureau: Food and Nutrition Service      Program: Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,           Infants, and Children (WIC)      Reduction Amount: Up to $1.4 billion        WIC is a federally funded nutrition assistance program with       an average monthly participation currently projected to be       6.5 million in fiscal year (FY) 2024. Under both reduction       scenarios (FY22 level and a 22 percent reduction), State WIC       programs would have to reduce participation and establish       waiting lists using the priority system provided in       regulation. In the first scenario, nearly 250,000 monthly       participants would not receive benefits. A 22 percent       decrease would only allow the program to support about 5.07       million participants--a reduction of approximately 1,180,000       participants from the FY22 monthly average and 1,500,000       participants from current FY24 participation projections.        Since the late 1990's, the appropriations committees'       bipartisan practice has been to provide enough funds for WIC       to serve all eligible applicants. When funds are not       sufficient to support caseload, WIC agencies implement a       priority waiting list of individuals. The first to lose       benefits would be non-breastfeeding postpartum women and       individuals certified solely due to homelessness or migrancy,       followed by children. This means some of the participants       needing benefits the most would be cut off.        In addition, Nutrition Services and Administration funding       provided to States would be reduced, which would hinder State       agencies' ability to provide services in a timely manner and       result in losses of WIC-related State and local jobs.       Bureau: Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)      Program: Salaries and Expenses      Reduction Amount: Up to $250 million        Drastic changes to the FSIS' funding level would result in       an across-the-board furlough of as many as 400 and 1,800 Food       Safety inspectors at the FY22 and 22 percent reduction       scenarios, respectively. Since, Federal law mandates       inspection of meat, poultry, and egg products, approximately       6,800 establishments nationwide would experience production       impacts. At the higher threshold of the cut, USDA estimates a       lost production volume of more than 11.5 billion pounds of       meat, an additional 11.1 billion pounds of poultry and over       590 million pounds of egg products. Together, the industry       would experience a production loss of over $89 billion with a       total extended loss including distribution and retail of $416       billion. Consumers would experience a shortage of meat,       poultry, and egg products available for public consumption,       and the shortage may result in price increases for these       products. Restaurants, grocers, local merchants, and others       who rely on FSIS-inspected products would suffer multiplier       effects from the shortfall in production. The impact could       force smaller businesses and merchants out of business.       Industry workers would also be furloughed, resulting in over       $2.2 billion in lost wages. The livestock industry would also       incur additional costs for disruption of the pipeline from       farms to production establishments as farmers and livestock       producers would have to feed and store animals longer than       anticipated.        The FSIS would also eliminate export inspections, resulting       in losses for U.S. producers and causing additional storage       costs and or loss of product. Export inspections could       adversely affect other nations since the volume of products       would decline. Furthermore, public food safety could be       compromised by the illegal selling and distribution of       uninspected meat, poultry, and egg products. Because the FSIS       is also responsible for verifying the safety of imported       products, cutting import inspections would result in a       reduction of 1.1 billion pounds of imported meat, poultry,       and egg products entering the country, in addition to the       lost production capacity within the United States. Cutting       import inspections might be construed as an international       trade issue. Moreover, there is limited storage space       along the border so unless foreign countries stopped       shipments, chill/frozen storage capacity and refrigerated       truck/train/ship capacity would be compromised.       Bureau: Rural Development, Rural Housing Service      Program: Rental Assistance      Reduction Amount: Up to $325 million        The Rental Assistance Program helps eligible low-income       tenants, in the USDA-financed multi-family housing, pay no       more than 30 percent of their incomes for rent. Approximately       288,000 tenants receive the benefit of rental assistance in       almost all the apartment complexes financed by Rural       Development. The House Republican leadership's planned       reduction would cause between 40,000 and 63,000 current       recipients to lose rental assistance. The average annual       income of families and individuals receiving rental       assistance (generally female-headed households, elderly, and       the disabled) is approximately $12,501. These Americans are       the least able to absorb any increase in the rent due to the       loss of rental assistance. Loss of this rent supplement may       cause property owners to increase rents, making the units       unaffordable to the very low-income residents who have few       options for decent, affordable housing.        With the loss of rental assistance, or higher vacancies       resulting from very low-income Americans being unable to       afford higher rents, many properties would be unable to pay       all their operating costs. Owners may be unable to maintain       the property and allow it to fall into despair, or the       properties may become delinquent in their loan payments.       Currently, the USDA has 160 multifamily properties in the       foreclosure process, which may increase with reduction in       rental assistance. Ongoing delinquencies will lead to       defaults and foreclosure and may result in long-term loss of       affordable housing in rural communities in future years.       Bureau: Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)      Program: Conservation Operations      Reduction Amount: Up to $225 million        Most of the NRCS' funding is appropriated for the       Conservation Technical Assistance (CTA) which is the agency's       primary program to work with private landowners across the       country through the USDA's unique delivery system of local       field offices. Working one-on-one, NRCS helps producers use       new technologies and implement conservation practices such as       organic production systems, on farm energy management, air,       soil, and water quality improvement, and enhancement of       pollinator populations.        A reduction of up to $225 million would reduce Technical       Assistance Support, resulting in up to 84,000 fewer producers       (54 percent) receiving conservation planning assistance       (impacting up to 54,000,000 acres). These reductions will       have a deleterious impact on landscape-scale conservation,       water quality improvements, wildlife habitat protection, open       space protection, as well as natural infrastructure       restoration, carbon sequestration, weather prediction       capacity, plant material development and other programs and       services that support extreme weather and climate change       adaptation and mitigation.        Funding cuts of this nature will hurt farm programs and       rural America. The Administration is committed to working       with Congress to improve options and better target farm       programs, saving money for the Federal Government while       maintaining a robust farm safety net. Program improvements       can level the playing field by ensuring payments and       technical assistance support the farmers and ranchers       who need them most--not wealthy people, passive investors,       or large and profitable agribusinesses. We can strengthen       program integrity by excluding non-farmers and investors,       addressing duplicative payments and improving the       efficiency and effectiveness of the USDA's risk management       and mitigation tools.       Bureau: Farm Service Agency (FSA)      Program: Farm Loan, Salaries and Expenses, and Grant Programs      Reduction Amount: Up to $370 million        Funding cuts would drastically impact service levels       currently provided by the FSA.  [[Page H1976]]       At the upper level of the proposed cut, there would be 5,100       fewer direct farm operating loans and 1,500 other farm loans       (Emergency Loans, Guaranteed Operating Loans, Highly       Fractionated Indian Land, Heirs' Property Relending Program)       that could be made. The reduction of farm loan funding could       result in a loss of up to 26,250 private sector jobs (plus       the hundreds of farmers that would be forced out of farming       and into the off-farm job market), reduce the Gross Domestic       Product (GDP) by more than $1.6 billion, and reduce household       income by more than $1.3 billion.       Bureau: Forest Service      Program: Wildland Fire Management      Sequestration Amount: Up to $515 million for Wildland Fire           Management Salaries and Expenses, and Preparedness, and           Hazardous Fuels        Funding cuts under either scenario would place the United       States Forest Service (USFS) wildland fire fighting mission       in a decreased state of readiness and reduce agency capacity       to protect life and property. At the FY22 funding level,       efforts to modernize the workforce through pay reform and       additional hiring will virtually stop, and the strategy for       aerial wildland firefighting resource procurement and usage       will need to be significantly revised. The number of       firefighters, helicopters and airtankers will all need to       decrease which could lead to more fires that escape initial       attack and yield more large fires take weeks to contain,       endanger nearby communities, damage watersheds and diminish       other forest ecosystem services, and increase suppression       costs. At a 22 percent reduction, 2,200-2,700 wildland       firefighters would be furloughed. For both funding scenarios,       fewer firefighters would also reduce performance of hazardous       fuel treatments and maintenance of acres already treated,       including new priority acres that are at high and very high       fire risk (as high as 350,000 acres annually).     These are actual numbers. These are real statistics  compiled by real experts. When we talk about the fact that no one needs  to worry about what is being debated here, this is why we are worried.   This is the impact of what they are trying to do. What they are  trying to do will hurt regular people, will hurt veterans, will hurt  people who are struggling to put food on the table, will hurt teachers,  will hurt the people that we represent. It will hurt children.   This is unconscionable, what is going on here. We cannot just sit by  while everybody on the other side says: Oh, don't worry, be happy. It  will all just work out. No, it won't.   We don't share these values of these cuts. We have a separate set of  values if my friends think that it is okay to cut these programs and  hurt these people.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, what we have heard on the floor today is incredible,  astounding, unbelievable, unconscionable contempt for the people that  we are supposed to be here to fight for.   When people tell me that both parties are the same, that both parties  are equally bad or believe the same things, watch this debate and then  tell me what you think.   Democrats have different values than Republicans. They have no  problem racking up $2 trillion in debt when it comes to tax giveaways  for Wall Street and CEOs.   Nobody on the other side is talking about having billionaires pay one  cent toward reducing our deficit. Maybe that is why Speaker McCarthy  went to Wall Street to announce his plans essentially to screw Main  Street.   Now they want to demand--and I say demand because this is a ransom  note--demand 10 years of cuts unless we stick it to our own  constituents, unless we take away food from hungry people, unless we  kick people off of healthcare.   They didn't win the Senate, they didn't win the White House, and they  didn't win a big majority as they wanted in the House.   To get what they want, they want to default on America so they can  push through their radical MAGA agenda.   I have to be honest with you. I was disgusted by the debate in the  Rules Committee last night and even what has been said here on the  floor today.   This is unconscionably bad. This is not who we are. If you want to  have a discussion on the debt, let's have that discussion, but this is  an extortion.   You are saying if we don't agree to all these draconian cuts that are  going to hurt people that we fight for every day on this side of the  aisle, if we don't do that, you are going to run this economy off a  cliff.   That is just an all-time high in recklessness and stupidity, Madam  Speaker. We cannot accept that. The people we represent are the people  who will be impacted by these cuts that I just mentioned by including  in the Record all of the letters from the various agencies in our  government. Those are our people.   Billionaires don't need us, but regular people do. People who are  struggling to put food on the table are counting on us to be on their  side, not to be making their life more complicated or more difficult.   Yet, this represents kind of the antithesis of everything that I  believe is right. This is so wrong. It is so wrong.   I am not going to sit back and say, oh, well, let the process work  its will, and maybe it won't be so bad at the end of the day.   This is bad. This is unconscionable. This is not deserving of a vote  on the House floor today. People should reject it.   I urge my Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle:  Reject this. You represent these same people too. They deserve to have  you on their side, not working against them.   Wall Street, they have enough support. They have enough people  rooting for them to succeed. Regular people, people who are struggling  in poverty, they need us. They are counting on us.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this rule, ``no'' on the  previous question, and ``no'' on the underlying resolution. We have to  do better than this. This is beneath the dignity of this institution.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
