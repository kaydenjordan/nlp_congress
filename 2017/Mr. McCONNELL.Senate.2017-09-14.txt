 Mr. President, today the Senators will keep working to  pass the National Defense Authorization Act, the legislation that  authorizes the resources, capabilities, pay, and benefits that our  servicemembers rely on to be successful.   The operational missions and tasks ahead for our men and women in  uniform are as profuse as they are challenging. That is why it is  essential that we meet our commitment to them by providing the  equipment and the training they need to accomplish their missions. We  should always remember that we have an all-volunteer force, and, in  turn, we must support our warriors with the pay and benefits they and  their families count on at home. This National Defense Authorization  Act touches on every one of these issues.   We have already made an initial downpayment toward rebuilding the  military and restoring combat readiness with the spring funding bill.  Let's take this opportunity to add to that progress now.   As Chairman McCain pointed out yesterday, this bill is the product of  hard work from both sides. In committee, Republicans and Democrats  offered scores of amendments that were ultimately adopted to the bill  that is before us, and all 27 of the Armed Services Committee members  voted favorably to report this bill out. So there is no reason it  shouldn't earn the same kind of bipartisan backing from the full Senate  now.   I look forward to taking a vote in support of the men and women in  uniform who courageously put their lives on the line to protect and  defend each of us. As I do so, I will be thinking of the servicemembers  and their families back in my home State of Kentucky, and I know so  many other colleagues will be thinking of the servicemembers in their  home States and those deployed abroad as well.   Let's keep working to bring this Defense authorization bill over the  finish line.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in recent weeks the plight of the  Rohingya has received great international attention. Even in the best  of times, this beleaguered ethnic minority has eked out a marginal  existence in Burma's Rakhine State. The Rohingya are stateless and have  faced discrimination and isolation. Media reports indicate that their  existence has gotten much worse over the past several weeks.   I am deeply troubled by the humanitarian situation along the Burmese- Bangladesh border and the violence in the Rakhine State must stop. But  as I stated earlier this week, in my view, publicly condemning Aung San  Suu Kyi--the best hope for democratic reform in Burma--is simply not  constructive.   Yesterday I had a chance to speak with Suu Kyi on the phone. I would  emphasize that she is the same person she was before. Her position in  the Burmese Government is an exceedingly difficult one; she is State  Counsellor. But, by law, her civilian government has virtually no  authority over the  [[Page S5710]]  Burmese military. According to the Burmese Constitution, the Army is  essentially autonomous, and it has control on the ground of the  Rohingya situation.   Unfounded criticism of Suu Kyi exaggerates her ability to command the  military, which the Burmese Constitution does not actually allow her to  do, and the political evolution of representative government in that  country is certainly not over. She must work--and is working--to  promote peace and reconciliation within her national context. But  Burma's path toward a democratic government is not yet complete, and it  will not miraculously occur overnight.   I would like to report to the Senate that during our call, Daw Suu  agreed with the need for immediate and improved access of humanitarian  assistance to the region, particularly by the International Red Cross,  and she conveyed that she is working toward that end. She reiterated  her view of the universality of human dignity and the pressing need to  pursue peace and reconciliation among the communities in Rakhine State.   Daw Suu emphasized to me that violations of human rights will need to  be addressed. Moreover, she stressed that the situation in the Rakhine  State is a protracted, longstanding problem and that she is trying very  hard to improve conditions. We will soon receive a follow-on briefing  from her office.   Right now, the most important thing is for the violence of the  Rakhine State to stop and to try to ensure the rapid flow of  humanitarian aid through both Burma and Bangladesh to the affected  areas to help the Rohingyan refugees and internally displaced persons.  That is where our focus should be.   Burma's path to representative government is not at all certain, and  it certainly is not over. Attacking the single political leader who has  worked to further democracy within Burma is likely to hinder that  objective over the long run.                            ____________________     Mr. President, comprehensive tax reform represents the  single most important action we can take now to grow the economy and  help middle-class families get ahead. It is the President's high  priority. It is a priority we share here in Congress. The work of the  tax-writing committees on tax reform goes back literally years, and it  continues today.   This morning, the Senate Finance Committee will hold another in a  series of hearings on comprehensive tax reform. Under the leadership of  Chairman Hatch, the committee is working to simplify the tax system to  make it work better for American individuals, families, and businesses.  As Chairman Hatch knows, our current Tax Code is overly complex, with  rates that are too high and incentives that often literally make no  sense.   Senator Hatch understands how our broken code makes it harder for  American businesses of all sizes to compete and win in an increasingly  competitive global economy--how it actually incentivizes our companies  to ship operations and American jobs overseas. Chairman Hatch and  colleagues on both sides of the aisle understand how our broken code  makes it harder for middle-class families to succeed--how it depresses  wages, weighs down job creation, and crushes opportunity.   It is time to fundamentally rethink our Tax Code to make taxes lower,  simpler, and fairer for American families. Fortunately, we have a once- in-a-generation opportunity to do that.   This morning's hearing in the Senate Finance Committee is a part of  the wide-ranging conversation to shift the economy into high gear after  8 years of an Obama economy that too often hurt the middle class and  seemed to hardly work for anyone but the ultrawealthy.   With lower taxes and a growing economy, jobs can come back from  overseas and stay here, families can keep more money in their pockets  to spend in the way they want to, and individuals can have access to  more opportunities to buy a new home, to start a new business, or to  send their kids to college. To put it simply: Our efforts are about  more jobs, more opportunity, and more money in the pockets of the  middle class.   Without tax reform, American families will be forced to continue  living under an unfair Tax Code with rates that are too high, American  jobs will continue to be shipped overseas, and small businesses will be  increasingly uncompetitive against foreign companies. That does not  benefit the middle class. These are the real consequences of the  current Tax Code, and we should all want to work together to put an end  to it. Our friends on the other side of the aisle say they support  comprehensive reform of the system, and I hope they will join us in  this effort in a serious way.   Finally, I thank President Trump and his team for their work  throughout this tax process. We will continue to regularly engage with  them, working together to bring relief to the American people.   I also thank Chairman Hatch for his leadership on this issue. Along  with my colleagues, I will keep working to deliver relief and economic  hope to our middle class.                            ____________________     Madam President, I have just spoken with Chairman  McCain about the status of the Defense bill. He and Senator Reed have  already processed more than 100 amendments to the bill with broad  bipartisan input. Unfortunately, the two sides have now reached an  impasse on further amendments. Senator McCain has offered a reasonable  list that could have been voted on this afternoon, but it appears we  are not able to enter that agreement because of issues unrelated to  NDAA. Therefore, it is my hope that we can move to finish the bill  sooner rather than later and vote to invoke cloture this afternoon.  [[Page S5727]]    The Senate will vote on a critical HUD nomination after lunch, and it  is my hope that we can move the cloture vote on NDAA to occur in that  stack after lunch.   Our next order of business will be, following the Defense  authorization bill, the nomination of the Solicitor General. This is  the person in the Justice Department who argues before the Supreme  Court, and the Supreme Court October term begins shortly.                              Order of Procedure    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1 p.m. today, the  Senate proceed to executive session for the consideration of Calendar  No. 109, as under the previous order, and that following disposition of  the nomination, the Senate resume legislative session and consideration  of H.R. 2810.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 105, Noel Francisco.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call be waived.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent,  notwithstanding rule XXII, that at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, September 18,  the McCain amendment No. 545 be withdrawn, the Senate adopt the McCain  substitute amendment No. 1003, as modified, and the Senate vote on the  motion to invoke cloture on H.R. 2810; further, that if cloture is  invoked, all postcloture time be considered expired and the Senate vote  on passage of the bill, as amended.
