 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

BRADLEY (FFG 49)         The Government of Bahrain has requested refurbishment of       the Oliver Hazard Perry Class ship, ex ROBERT G. BRADLEY (FFG       49), spares, support, training, publications, and other       related elements of logistics and program support. The       estimated cost is $150 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of an important ally which is a force for       political stability and economic progress in the Middle East.       This sale is consistent with U.S. initiatives to provide key       allies in the region with systems that will enhance       interoperability with U.S. forces and increase security.        The proposed sale will refurbish and support the grant       transfer of the Oliver Hazard Perry Class ship, ROBERT G.       BRADLEY (FFG 49), which was authorized for transfer under       Public Law 115-232, Section 1020. Bahrain already operates       another Oliver Hazard Perry Class ship. Bahrain will have no       difficulty absorbing these defense articles and services into       its armed forces.        The proposed sale will not alter the basic military balance       in the region.        The principal contractor supporting the refurbishment has       not yet been selected for this potential sale. There are no       known offset agreements proposed in connection with this       potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Bahrain.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            ____________________
