 Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Francis Rooney), I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, the Davis-Bacon Act hinders economic growth and  increases the Federal deficit. It imposes enormous burdens, stifles  contractor productivity, ignores skill differences for different jobs,  and imposes rigid craftwork rules.   The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the Davis-Bacon  Act will raise Federal construction costs by $13 billion between 2015  and 2023.   Now, wages are often set at or above the union scale, despite the  fact that only 13 percent of the private construction workforce is even  unionized nationwide, Mr. Chairman.                                time  0010    The Davis-Bacon wage determinations have also been known to be lower  than the current market rate, which is equally problematic and  especially detrimental for local contractors. It is just erratic.   The GAO, the Government Accountability Office, has repeatedly  criticized DOL's Davis-Bacon wage determination process for its lack of  transparency in the published wage rates and its tendency to gather  erroneous data through unscientific wage surveys.   Repealing the DBA would allow the government to build more  infrastructure and create 155,000 new construction-related jobs at the  very same cost to the taxpayers. In fact, repealing Davis-Bacon would  have saved the Federal Government $10.9 billion, and that was back in  2011.   This amendment would uphold the government's responsibility to  deliver quality infrastructure improvements at the best possible price  to the taxpayers, which is certainly what we owe them. It is imperative  that all levels of government guarantee the general public that their  tax dollars are being spent in the most effective way possible.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Francis Rooney)  for his work on this amendment, and I withdraw my amendment.
