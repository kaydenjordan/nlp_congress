 Madam Speaker, exactly 3 weeks ago, five Justices on an  activist, extremist Supreme Court handed down a decision that upended  nearly 50 years of precedent and rolled back fundamental rights for  millions of Americans.   In the weeks since, I have watched in horror as State after State has  triggered laws that now prevent a woman or a girl from accessing an  abortion even in the case of rape and incest. These events have been  shocking to Americans, not only for millions of women across the  country but for the country as a whole.   You call yourselves conservative. We are talking about 50 years of  precedent in our Nation.   Because no Government has a place interfering in the decisions  between a woman and her doctor, criminalizing abortion, or restricting  women's healthcare options.   This is not a controversial position to the American people. A strong  majority of my constituents believe that the right to an abortion  should be protected by law. This is a freedom and a privacy issue, and  the government--not politicians in this room and not politicians in any  State in our Nation--should not have any part in this conversation at  all. This is a very personal decision between a woman, her family, her  doctor, and her faith.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in voting  ``yes'' to protect Roe today.
