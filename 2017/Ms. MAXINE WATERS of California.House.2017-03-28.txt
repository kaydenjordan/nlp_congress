 I would like very much to thank my  friend and colleague from California, Congressman John Garamendi, for  the time, and I commend him for organizing this Special Order on  Alzheimer's disease. It is fitting and appropriate that we would be  holding this Special Order hour this evening prior to the National  Alzheimer's Dinner, which will take place tonight.   The National Alzheimer's Dinner is an annual event, organized by the  Alzheimer's Association, that brings together staff, policymakers,  advocates, and families impacted by Alzheimer's disease from across the  country.   As the co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Task Force on  Alzheimer's Disease, I know how devastating this disease can be for  patients, families, and caregivers. I am proud to lead the task force  along with my co-chair, Congressman Chris Smith.   Alzheimer's is a tragic disease affecting millions of Americans and  has reached crisis proportions. There is no effective treatment, no  means of prevention, and no method for slowing the progression of the  disease.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that is  the CDC, 5 million Americans were living with Alzheimer's disease in  the year 2013. This number is expected to almost triple to 14 million  by the year 2050.   Alzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States.  In 2017, the direct cost of care for Alzheimer's disease and other  dementias is expected to hit $259 billion, with 67 percent of those  costs paid for by Medicare or Medicaid.   Alzheimer's disease and related dementias will increase exponentially  as  [[Page H2507]]  the baby boom generation ages. At the current rate, the cost of  Alzheimer's will reach $1.1 trillion in 2050. We must act now to change  the trajectory of this disease.   The national plan to address Alzheimer's disease calls for a cure or  an effective treatment for Alzheimer's by the year 2025. Reaching this  goal will require a significant increase in Federal funding for  Alzheimer's research.   Fortunately, Alzheimer's research did receive a substantial increase  in Federal funding in fiscal year 2016. Congress allocated $936 million  for Alzheimer's research at NIH in funding year 2016, an increase of  $350 million over the 2015 level. But that is still far less than what  is needed to confront the challenges we face.   In March of last year, I wrote a letter to the House Appropriations  Committee requesting an additional $500 million increase in funding for  Alzheimer's research, for a total appropriation of almost $1.5 billion  in funding year 2017. The letter was signed by a bipartisan group of 74  Members of Congress, including myself, co-chair Chris Smith, and one of  the greatest advocates on behalf of Alzheimer's patients not only in  the Congress of the United States, but even before he came here,  Congressman Garamendi.   Last summer, the Senate Appropriations Committee passed its version  of the funding year 2017 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education  Appropriations bill and provided a $400 million increase in funding for  Alzheimer's research at NIH, for a total appropriation of $1.39 billion  in funding year 2017.   Meanwhile, the House Labor, HHS, Education Appropriations  Subcommittee passed this bill for funding year 2017 on June 17. The  House bill provided a $300 million increase in Alzheimer's research.   Unfortunately, Congress still has not finished its work on funding  the year 2017 budget, so we don't know how much funding Alzheimer's  research or any other program, for that matter, will receive this year.   At the same time, Congress has already begun consideration of year  2018 funding levels. I am once again circulating a letter to the House  Appropriations Committee leaders requesting robust funding for  Alzheimer's research.   This year my letter requests a $414 million increase in funding for  Alzheimer's research in fiscal year 2018 above the level included in  the funding year 2017 Senate bill. That would be a total appropriation  of more than $1.8 billion for Alzheimer's research in funding year  2018.   Although this letter just started circulating, more than 25 Members  of Congress have already signed this letter, of course led by Co-Chairs  Chris Smith and Congressman Garamendi and myself.                                time  1830    I am also circulating a letter to House Committee on Appropriations  leaders in support of a program to address the problem of wandering  among Alzheimer's patients. This program helps local communities and  law enforcement officials quickly find persons with Alzheimer's disease  who wander away from their homes and reunite them with their families.   The majority of American Alzheimer's patients live at home under the  care of family and friends. According to the Alzheimer's Association,  more than 60 percent of Alzheimer's patients are likely to wander away  from home. Wanderers are vulnerable to dehydration, weather conditions,  traffic hazards, and individuals who prey on seniors.   Let me just continue my remarks by thanking all of the Members of  Congress who are signing letters, who are focused on this, who  understand what is going on. I would like to thank the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from California (Mr.  Garamendi) for their leadership and all the work that they have done  educating the Members and helping to give exposure to what we need to  do.
