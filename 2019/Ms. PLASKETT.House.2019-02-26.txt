 Mr. Speaker, the President's emergency declaration is,  in fact, a power grab to go outside the bounds of the law and get what  he failed to achieve in constitutional legislative process. After  failing to convince the American people and Congress to pay for his  ineffective, wasteful, multi-billion-dollar concrete wall, the  President is now trying a desperate end run around Congress with his  unlawful emergency declaration.   The President is declaring an emergency over a crisis that does not  exist. The statute only applies to national emergencies that require  use of the armed forces for military construction projects ``that are  necessary to support such use of the armed forces.'' The border wall is  not a military construction project. It does not require the use of the  military.  [[Page H2133]]    The immigration law is the responsibility of the Federal immigration  enforcement agencies, not the military.   The President's declaration violates Federal law and that is the  crisis. This is a crisis, a crime against our Constitution. It is an  assault; it is a rape, what the President is doing now, against the  Constitution, against this legislative body.   I am just in another world that I, as a constitutional, strict  constructionist, am on this side of the aisle on an issue like this.
