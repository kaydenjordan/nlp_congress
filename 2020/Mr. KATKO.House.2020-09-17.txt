 Madam Speaker, I am a Republican, and I rise in strong  support of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.   I was proud to join Chairman Nadler and Representatives Herrera  Beutler, McBath, and Scott in introducing this bill.   Simply put, no mother-to-be or mother in this country should have to  choose between being a parent and keeping her job.   Unfortunately, current Federal law lacks adequate protections to  ensure pregnant workers are able to remain healthy in the workplace.  With 30 States having already passed laws to provide these protections,  the need and support for a Federal standard is clear.   This bipartisan bill provides pregnant workers with an affirmative  right to reasonable accommodations in the workplace, while creating a  clear and navigable standard for employees to follow.   These accommodations, as simple as providing an employee with extra  restroom breaks or a stool to sit on, should not be controversial.   The arguments against this bill made by some Members of my own party  are based on inaccuracies and wrongfully detract from the importance of  this commonsense policy.   Reflecting the widespread support for this legislation, the bill has  received numerous endorsements from the business community, as well as  over 180 women's health, labor, and civil rights organizations.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support from a  coalition of business groups, including the Chamber of Commerce, the  Society for Human Resource Management, and the National Retail  Federation.                                                September 14, 2020.        To Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: We urge       Congress to pass the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (H.R.       2694). This bill would provide pregnant employees with       important workplace protections while also making sure       employers have clear and flexible options to ensure pregnant       employees can remain at work for as long as they wish to do       so.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA), as passed by the       House Education and Labor Committee, is a balanced approach       that clarifies an employer's obligation to accommodate the       known limitations of employees and job applicants that       accompany pregnancy. The PWFA uses an interactive, reasonable       accommodation process similar to the Americans with       Disabilities Act and specifies a pregnant employee may take       leave only after the employer and employee have exhausted the       possibility of other reasonable accommodations.        This bipartisan bill is a strong reminder that through good       faith negotiations, legislative solutions to important       workplace questions and problems can be found. We believe       that Congress should pass the PWFA with no changes.            Sincerely,      H.R. Policy Association,      International Franchise Association,      National Retail Federation,      Retail Industry Leaders Association,      Society for Human Resource Management,      U.S. Chamber of Commerce.    Madam Speaker, an excerpt from that says that this  bipartisan bill is a strong reminder that through good faith  negotiations, legislative solutions to important workplace questions  and problems can be found.   It is high time for our Nation to provide women in the workforce with  the basic rights and respect they deserve. I strongly urge my  colleagues to support passage of this important legislation.                                time  1115
