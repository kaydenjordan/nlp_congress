 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  concur in the Senate amendments to the bill (H.R. 4227) an act to  require the Secretary of Homeland Security to examine what actions the  Department of Homeland Security is undertaking to combat the threat of  vehicular terrorism, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendments is as follows:   Senate amendments:       (1)On page 2, line 16, insert ``and the Committee on       Commerce, Science, and Transportation'' after ``Affairs''.      (2)On page 3, strike lines 17 through 20 and insert the       following:        (2) Vehicular terrorism.--The term ``vehicular terrorism''       means an action that utilizes automotive transportation to       commit terrorism (as defined in section 2(18) of the Homeland       Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 101(18))).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4227, the Vehicular  Terrorism Prevention Act, introduced by the gentleman from Ohio,  Representative Latta.   H.R. 4227 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to examine the  threat of vehicular terrorism and develop a strategy to improve DHS  support for the efforts of emergency responders and the private sector  to prevent, mitigate, and respond to such a threat.   Terror groups, including ISIS and al-Qaida, have urged supporters to  carry out attacks in their home countries using any means necessary,  including vehicular ramming. Terrorists and inspired homegrown  extremists have heeded this direction and have carried out vehicular- based attacks in the past several years, including in France, England,  Spain, Ohio, and New York City.   DHS has existing resources and programs that can be better utilized  to prepare frontline personnel in local communities to address the  threat of vehicular terrorism. H.R. 4227 requires the Secretary to  develop a plan on how to improve and increase these capabilities.   This bill passed the House on March 22 of this year. The Senate made  minor changes to this measure and passed it with unanimous consent on  December 18.   I thank Representative Latta for his work on this important measure,  and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Latta), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I was not present for rollcall vote  No. 467 on Motion to Table. Had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea.''                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Retirement, Savings, and Other Tax Relief Act of 2018.   In a long overdue move, and one with strong bipartisan support, this  bill modernizes the IRS and improves the efficiency of the agency in  dealing with taxpayers.   As one of the only former State treasurers in Congress, I understand  our need for our country's tax collection agency to adopt a culture of  customer service and to help taxpayers file taxes, retrieve  information, resolve issues, and make payments.   In addition to reforming the IRS, this bill also provides needed  certainty to businesses by making certain tax cuts permanent, and  extending others so that families and businesses know what to expect  from our Tax Code in the future.   While our economy is booming, businesses of every size I meet with in  my district in Kansas consistently say that the number one thing they  need from Washington is certainty. We owe it to job creators and  workers to provide that certainty so that they can provide for other  expansions and other decisionmaking.   To support workers and families, this bill makes it easier for  businesses to provide retirement plans for more employees who  previously did not have access to them, and allows families to save  more for retirement.   To support entrepreneurs and small businesses, this bill will allow  new companies to write off more of their initial startup cost and allow  startups to expand easier and faster without hitting limits on certain  tax benefits like that for research and development.   Finally, this legislation also helps victims impacted by the recent  wildfires, hurricanes, and other natural disasters by allowing victims  to access retirement accounts without penalty  [[Page H10476]]  to assist in their recovery. Our fellow Americans in need should have  every tool available to help them rebuild.   As I said in a recent op-ed for FOX News, the Retirement, Savings,  and Other Tax Relief Act of 2018 is the right bill at the right time  for America's families and economy. Passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  started an economic turnaround our country has not experienced in  decades. Instead of stopping that momentum in its tracks, we need to  build upon that success with these commonsense reforms.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Brady and the Ways and Means  Committee for continuing to fund solutions to grow our economy and help  families.
