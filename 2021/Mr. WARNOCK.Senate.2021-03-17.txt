 Mr. President, before I begin my formal remarks, I want  to pause to condemn the hatred and violence that took eight precious  lives last night in Metropolitan Atlanta.   I agree with Georgians, with Americans, with people of love all  across the world. This unspeakable violence visited largely upon the  Asian community is one that causes all of us to recommit ourselves to  the way of peace, an active peace that prevents these kinds of  tragedies from happening in the first place.   We pray for these families.   Mr. President, I rise here today, as a proud American and as one of  the newest Members of the Senate, in awe of the journey that has  brought me to these hallowed Halls and with an abiding sense of  reverence and gratitude for the faith and sacrifices of ancestors who  paved the way.   I am a proud son of the great State of Georgia, born and raised in  Savannah, a coastal city known for its cobblestone streets and verdant  town squares. Towering oak trees, centuries old and covered in gray  Spanish moss, stretched from one side of the street to the other, bend  and beckon the lover of history and horticulture to this city by the  sea.   I was educated at Morehouse College, and I still serve in the pulpit  of the Ebenezer Baptist Church, both in Atlanta, the cradle of the  civil rights movement. And so like those oak trees in Savannah, my  roots go down deep, and they stretch wide in the soil of Waycross, GA,  and Burke County, and Screven County. In a word, I am Georgia, a living  example and embodiment of its history and its hope, of its pain and  promise, the brutality and possibility.   At the time of my birth, Georgia's two Senators were Richard B.  Russell and Herman E. Talmadge, both arch segregationists and unabashed  adversaries of the civil rights movement.   After the Supreme Court's landmark Brown v. Board ruling outlawing  school segregation, Talmadge warned that ``blood will run in the  streets of Atlanta.''   Senator Talmadge's father, Eugene Talmadge, former Governor of our  State, had famously declared: ``The South loves the Negro in his place,  but his place is at the back door.''   When once asked how he and his supporters might keep Black people  away from the polls, he picked up a scrap of paper and wrote a single  word on it: ``Pistols.''   Yet there is something in the American covenant, in its charter  documents and its Jeffersonian ideals, that bends toward freedom. And  led by a preacher and a patriot named King, Americans of all races  stood up. History vindicated the movement that sought to bring us  closer to our ideals, to lengthen and strengthen the cords of our  democracy, and I now hold the seat--the Senate seat--where Herman E.  Talmadge sat.   That is why I love America. I love America because we always have a  path to make it better, to build a more perfect Union. It is the place  where a kid like me, who grew up in public housing, the first college  graduate in my family, can now stand as a United States Senator.    I had an older father. He was born in 1917. Serving in the Army  during World War II, he was once asked to give up his seat to a young  teenager while wearing his soldier's uniform, as they said, ``making  the world safe for democracy.'' But he was never bitter. By the time I  came along, he had already seen the arc of change in our country. He  maintained his faith in God and in his family and in the American  promise, and he passed that faith on to his children.   My mother grew up in Waycross, GA. Do you know where that is? It is  way 'cross Georgia. Like a lot of Black teenagers in the 1950s, she  spent her summers picking somebody else's tobacco and somebody else's  cotton. But because this is America, the 82-year-old hands that used to  pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls in January and picked her  youngest son to be a United States Senator. Ours is a land where  possibility is born of democracy: a vote, a voice, a chance to help  determine the direction of the country and one's own destiny within  it--possibility born of democracy.   That is why this past November and January, my mom and other citizens  of Georgia grabbed hold of that possibility and turned out in record  numbers, 5 million in November, 4.5 million in January--far more than  ever in our State's history. Turnout for a typical runoff doubled, and  the people of Georgia sent their first African-American Senator and  first Jewish Senator, my brother Jon Ossoff, to these hallowed Halls.   But then, what happened? Some politicians did not approve of the  choice made by the majority of voters in a hard-fought election in  which each side got the chance to make its case to the voters. And  rather than adjusting their agenda, rather than changing their message,  they are busy trying to change the rules. We are witnessing right now a  massive and unabashed assault on voting rights, unlike anything we have  ever seen since the Jim Crow era. This is Jim Crow with new clothes.   Since the January election, some 250 voter suppression bills have  been introduced by State legislatures all across the country, from  Georgia to Arizona, from New Hampshire to Florida, using the big lie of  voter fraud as a pretext for voter suppression--the same big lie that  led to a violent insurrection on this very Capitol the day after my  election. Within 24 hours, we elected Georgia's first African-American  and Jewish Senators, and hours later the Capitol was assaulted. You see  in just a few precious hours the tension very much alive in the soul of  America. The question before all of us at every moment is, What will we  do to push us in the right direction?   So politicians, driven by that big lie, aim to severely limit and in  some cases eliminate automatic and same-day voter registration, mail-in  and absentee voting, and early voting and weekend voting. They want to  make it easier to purge voters from the voting roll altogether. As a  voting rights activist, I have seen up close just how draconian these  measures can be. I hail from a State that purged 200,000 voters from  the rolls one Saturday night in the middle of the night. We know what  is happening here. Some people don't want some people to vote.   I was honored on a few occasions to stand with our hero and my  parishioner, John Lewis. I was his pastor, but I am clear: He was my  mentor. On more than one occasion, we boarded buses together after  Sunday church services as part of our Souls to the Polls program,  encouraging the Ebenezer Church family and other communities of faith  to participate in the democratic process. Now, just a few months after  Congressman Lewis's death, there are those in the Georgia legislature-- some who even dared to praise his name--that are now trying to get rid  of Sunday Souls to the Polls, making it a crime for people who pray  together to get on a bus together in order to vote together. I think  that is wrong. As a matter of fact, I think that a vote is a kind of  prayer for the kind of world we desire for ourselves and for our  children, and our prayers are stronger when we pray together.   To be sure, we have seen these kinds of voter suppression tactics  before. They are part of a long and shameful history in Georgia and  throughout our Nation. But refusing to be denied, Georgia citizens and  citizens across our country braved the heat and the cold and the rain,  some standing in line for 5 hours, 6 hours, 10 hours just to exercise  their constitutional right to vote--young people, old people, sick  people, working people already underpaid and forced to lose wages to  pay a kind of  [[Page S1584]]  poll tax while standing in line to vote. And how do some politicians  respond? Well, they are trying to make it a crime to give people water  and a snack as they wait in lines that are obviously being made longer  by their draconian actions   Think about that. Think about that. They are the ones making the  lines longer through these draconian actions. And then they want to  make it a crime to bring grandma some water while she is waiting in a  line that they are making longer. Make no mistake, this is democracy in  reverse. Rather than voters being able to pick the politicians, the  politicians are trying to cherry-pick their voters. I say this cannot  stand.   And so I rise, Mr. President, because that sacred and noble idea--one  person, one vote--is being threatened right now. Politicians in my home  State and all across America, in their craven lust for power, have  launched a full-fledged assault on voting rights. They are focused on  winning at any cost, even the cost of democracy itself. I submit that  it is the job of each citizen to stand up for the voting rights of  every citizen. And it is the job of this body to do all that it can to  defend the viability of our democracy.   That is why I am a proud cosponsor of the For the People Act, which  we introduced today. The For the People Act is a major step in the  march toward our Democratic ideals, making it easier, not harder, for  eligible Americans to vote by instituting commonsense, pro-democracy  reforms, like establishing national automatic voter registration for  every eligible citizen and allowing all Americans to register to vote  online and on election day; requiring States to offer at least 2 weeks  of early voting, including weekends, in Federal elections, keeping  Souls to the Polls programs alive; prohibiting States from restricting  a person's ability to vote absentee or by mail; and preventing States  from purging the voting rolls based solely on unreliable evidence like  someone's voting history, something we have seen in Georgia and other  States in recent years. And it would end the dominance of Big Money in  our politics and ensure our public servants are there serving the  public.   Amidst these voter suppression laws and tactics, including partisan  and racial gerrymandering, and in a system awash in dark money and the  dominance of corporate interests and politicians who do their bidding,  the voices of the American people have been increasingly drowned out  and crowded out and squeezed out of their own democracy. We must pass  For the People so that the people might have a voice. Your vote is your  voice, and your voice is your human dignity. But not only that, we must  pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   You know, voting rights used to be a bipartisan issue. The last time  the voting rights bill was reauthorized was 2006. George W. Bush was  President, and it passed this Chamber 98 to 0. But then, in its 2013  decision, the Supreme Court rejected the successful formula for  supervision and preclearance contained in the 1965 Voting Rights Act.  They asked Congress to fix it. That was nearly 8 years ago, and the  American people are still waiting. Stripped of protections, voters in  States with a long history of voter discrimination and voters in many  other States have been thrown to the winds.   We Americans have noisy and spirited debates about many things, and  we should. That is what it means to live in a free country. But access  to the ballot ought to be nonpartisan. I submit that there should be  100 votes in this Chamber for policies that will make it easier for  Americans to make their voices heard in our democracy. Surely, there  ought to be at least 60 in this Chamber who believe, as I do, that the  four most powerful words uttered in a democracy are ``the people have  spoken''; therefore, we must ensure that all of the people can speak.   But if not, we must still pass voting rights. The right to vote is  preservative of all other rights. It is not just another issue  alongside other issues. It is foundational. It is the reason why any of  us have the privilege of standing here in the first place. It is about  the covenant we have with one another as an American people: ``e  pluribus unum,'' out of many, one. It, above all else, must be  protected.   So let's be clear. I am not here today to spiral into the procedural  argument regarding whether the filibuster in general has merits or has  outlived its usefulness. I am here to say that this issue is bigger  than the filibuster. I stand before you saying that this issue--access  to voting and preempting politicians' efforts to restrict voting--is so  fundamental to our democracy that it is too important to be held  hostage by a Senate rule, especially one historically used to restrict  the expansion of voting rights. It is a contradiction to say we must  protect minority rights in the Senate while refusing to protect  minority rights in the society. Colleagues, no Senate rule should  overrule the integrity of our democracy, and we must find a way to pass  voting rights, whether we get rid of the filibuster or not.    So as I close--and nobody believes a preacher when he says ``as I  close''--let me say that I, as a man of faith, believe that democracy  is the political enactment of a spiritual idea, the sacred worth of all  human beings, the notion that we all have within us a spark of the  divine, and a right to participate in the shaping of our destiny.  Reinhold Niebuhr was right:         [Humanity's] capacity for justice makes democracy possible;       but [humanity's] inclination to injustice makes democracy       necessary.    John Lewis understood that and was beaten on a bridge defending it.  Amelia Boynton, like so many women not mentioned nearly enough, was  gassed on that same bridge. A White woman named Viola Liuzzo was  killed. Medgar Evers was murdered in his own driveway. Schwerner,  Chaney, and Goodman, two Jews and an African American, standing up for  that sacred idea of democracy, also paid the ultimate price. And we in  this body would be stopped and stymied by bipartisan politics? Short- term political gain? Senate procedure? I say let's get this done, no  matter what.   I urge my colleagues to pass these two bills, strengthen and lengthen  the course of our democracy, secure our credibility as the premier  voice for freedom-loving people and democratic movements all over the  world, and win the future for all of our children.   I yield the floor.   (Applause.)
