 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to recognize a  true American, David Alexander Hogue. David is the son of Grady and  Dovie Hogue, born in 1946 in Blacksburg, South Carolina. He attended  Blacksburg public schools and was elected president of his high school  senior class.   He then enrolled at the University of South Carolina School of  Pharmacy, where he graduated in 1970. After working in a drugstore in  York, South Carolina, and Cherokee drug store in Gaffney, South  Carolina, he returned to Blacksburg, where he became the owner of Iron  City Pharmacy, which was a 75-year-old business.   Among his many accomplishments, he formed the Iron City Band where he  played piano and toured the entire Southeast with his band. As a member  of the Blacksburg First Baptist Church, he was a member of the choir;  he was a deacon; he was a trustee; and he was chairman of his Sunday  school class.   In 1989, David entered the political arena, where he was elected to  the Blacksburg City Council, where he was appointed mayor pro tempore.  He was then appointed mayor by then-Governor Carroll Campbell after his  predecessor was removed from office, and he won a special election for  mayor in June of 1990, where he has served honorably for the last 28  years.   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize, in the 115th session of  Congress, a true American, David Alexander Hogue.                            ____________________
