 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  legislation that will benefit all Americans by addressing the nuisance  of robocalls.   Unwanted and annoying robocalls are increasing at an alarming rate.  Some estimate that U.S. consumers received nearly 4 billion robocalls  per month in 2018. This needs to end.   This legislation would require service providers to adopt call  authentication technologies and would establish additional protections  for consumers receiving unwarranted and sometimes fraudulent robocalls.  It would also require the FCC to work with other Federal agencies on  improving deterrence and criminal prosecution of robocall scams.   I am also pleased that the legislation includes legislation that I  sponsored with my colleague, Representative Butterfield, which requires  the FCC to publish an annual report on the private-led efforts to trace  the origin of unlawful robocalls, an important step in stopping these  bad actors from reaching consumers.   It is time for Congress to act and prevent these illegal and unwanted  robocalls, and I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.
