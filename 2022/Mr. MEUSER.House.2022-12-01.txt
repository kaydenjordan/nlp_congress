 Madam Speaker, it is universally understood that our  border is an unforgivable, unmitigated disaster.   Since President Biden took office there have been: 4 million illegal  crossings; over 1 million gotaways; 98 individuals on the terror watch  list apprehended, and God knows how many we didn't catch; over 800 have  died crossing the border; one in three women are sexually assaulted on  the journey; and over 14,000 pounds of deadly fentanyl seized, a  single-year record.   Illegal drugs have contributed to the deaths of over 107,000 mostly  young Americans in the last year. Sadly, 14 of our CBP agents have  committed suicide this year, as well.   Despite all of this horrifying data, President Biden and Secretary  Mayorkas tell us that this border is secure--unforgivable rhetoric that  is insulting to the American people.   The Biden administration, Madam Speaker, has no plan for the massive  additional influx which will occur in just a few weeks when title 42  ends, a complete dereliction of duty.                            ____________________
