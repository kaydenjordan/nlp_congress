 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the efforts  of the city of Keller in becoming the most family-friendly city in the  State of Texas.   This community of over 45,000 residents sits in the heart of the  Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex and prides itself on pairing big city  comforts with small town charm.   Its history is rooted in the perseverance of frontier settlers in the  golden age of railroads. That spirit lives on today in a community of  incredible entrepreneurs and small business owners, beautiful parks and  trails, excellent schools, and award-winning city facilities and  programs.   Often listed among the safest and best places to live in America,  this city strives to serve its citizens at every stage of life, from  young families buying their first homes to empty nesters who could not  imagine living anywhere else.   In that effort, Keller City Council recognizes the importance of  fighting on behalf of taxpayers, attracting exceptional economic  development, prioritizing the community's roads and sidewalks, and  ensuring public safety by supporting its unparalleled first responders.    Madam Speaker, I congratulate the city of Keller and their shared  vision of becoming Texas' most family-friendly city. I look forward to  seeing the incredible progress that this community will see working  together.                            ____________________
