 Madam Speaker, I am pleased and proud to stand here in  support of H.R. 1, but I am especially proud that H.R. 1 contains the  Redistricting Reform Act, legislation that was introduced by  Representatives Lofgren, Brownley, and myself.   This legislation would require States to create independent  redistricting commissions to draw congressional seats, removing  politicians and partisan gerrymandering from the process.   I have worked for decades on this cause. I helped to lead in the  California Legislature on redistricting efforts, which ultimately led  to the creation of the California independent redistricting commission,  which is now recognized as one of the best practices in redistricting.   Let's follow this example across the country. Let's have Members here  who represent fair and equitable districts and who are elected to  represent their districts and not just to protect incumbency.
