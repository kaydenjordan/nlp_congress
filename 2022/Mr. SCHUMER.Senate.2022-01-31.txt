 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Madam President, last Thursday, Associate Justice  Stephen Breyer announced that after 27 years of service, he will retire  from the Supreme Court at the conclusion of this term.   Shortly after his nomination was first announced in 1994, then-Judge  Breyer mused publicly about what he expected his time on the High Court  would bring. He told reporters it was his hope to ``make the average  person's ordinary life better.'' Nearly three decades later, we can  safely say that Justice Breyer has met that mark and then some.   Throughout American history, only 115 individuals have sat on the  Nation's High Court, and few have served as long and as effectively as  Justice Breyer. From his opinions on voting rights, environmental  protections, women's reproductive freedom, and protecting access to  affordable healthcare, Justice Breyer's impact upon our Nation will  last for generations. America is a more perfect Union today because of  Justice Stephen Breyer.   Of course, Justice Breyer's legacy of service extends beyond even his  remarkable time on the Supreme Court. For 13 years, he also sat on the  U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Before that, he served for  8 years as a member of the Army Reserves. And, of course, Members of  this Chamber cannot forget that he was once a part of the Senate  itself, serving as an aide on the Judiciary Committee in the seventies,  where he worked closely with our dear friend, the late Senator Ted  Kennedy. At every step of the way, he remained his essential self-- decent, brilliant, and dedicated to our democracy.   Now, with this new vacancy on the Court, President Biden will have an  opportunity to make history by nominating the first ever Black woman to  serve on the Supreme Court. I am confident that the President will  select an outstanding individual to fill Justice Breyer's seat, and we  intend to move quickly on our constitutional duty to act on his nominee  when announced. I can assure all Senators that the Senate will have a  fair process that moves quickly so we can confirm President Biden's  nominee to fill Justice Breyer's seat as soon as possible.   Today, Members of this Chamber say thank you to Justice Breyer for  his lifetime of public service.                         America COMPETES Act of 2022    Now, Madam President, as our country continues to recover from the  darkest days of the COVID-19 pandemic, last week, we received a  remarkable bit of news: The U.S. economy grew 5.7 percent--5.7 percent  in 2021.   Let me say it again. Last year, the U.S. economy grew by 5.7  percent--the largest single-year growth rate in about 40 years.   Last year's economic growth did not happen on its own. Faced with a  historic crisis, Democrats took unprecedented steps in 2021 to give  American families and businesses the support they needed to make ends  meet and stay healthy. Although we have more work to do to lower costs  and expand opportunity, we are undeniably better off today than we were  a year ago when we first took office as a majority Senate.   It is frightening to merely remember how bad things were at the start  of 2021. We were entering the very worst of the pandemic. The economy  had its worst year since World War II, and 11 million people were out  of work. More than 3,000 Americans were dying each day from COVID-19.   But Democrats responded by passing the American Rescue Plan 2 months  into the President's term. We later passed a historic infrastructure  package that is putting people to work fixing our roads and our bridges  and our highways. Thanks to the heroism of health workers, the  leadership of the Biden administration, and action taken by  congressional Democrats, over 200 million Americans have now been  vaccinated.   Because of these steps that Democrats took last year, unemployment  has plummeted faster than many forecasts predicted a year ago, to below  4 percent. The economy added the largest number of manufacturing jobs  in three decades. As wages keep climbing, layoffs are near record lows.   Make no mistake, this economy is in the midst of a historic  turnaround, thanks in large part to swift action by Democrats in the  Congress and in the White House, but, of course, the work is far from  over. We must keep working to lower costs for American families. We  need to help businesses struggling with strained supply chains,  particularly the chip shortage affecting everything from auto  manufacturing to household appliances. Workers need protections to  ensure they share in our continued economic recovery.  [[Page S397]]    That is why Congress must keep working on legislation like the United  States Innovation and Competition Act, which the Senate passed last  year with strong bipartisan support. This week, the House will hold a  vote to pass their counterpart to this bill, the America COMPETES Act.  I am glad the House is taking this important step in the right  direction. When the America COMPETES Act passes, the House and Senate  can begin the bicameral process of resolving the differences in each  bill and send a final product to the President's desk.   With historic investments in science, technology, and American  manufacturing, the policies of USICA represent the boldest steps in  decades to secure America's economic future.   By bringing manufacturing back to the United States from overseas, it  would strengthen domestic supply chains and help address our country's  dangerous semiconductor shortage that has driven up prices in  everything from cars to microwaves.   All this would not only relieve rising costs by making us less  reliant on foreign manufacturing; it would also advance our national  security.   This legislation would help fix our country's dangerous semiconductor  shortage that has driven prices up in everything from cars to  microwaves by strengthening domestic supply chains and by increasing  production. It would not only relieve rising costs; it would also  advance our national security.   For months--months--I have spoken with both my Republican and  Democratic colleagues about finding a way to get this bill to the  President's desk.   Now I am glad that the House will take action later this week on  their version of this legislation, and I look forward to working  through this bill so that President Biden can finally sign this  landmark manufacturing and innovation bill into law.
