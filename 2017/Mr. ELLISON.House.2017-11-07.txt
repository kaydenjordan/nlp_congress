 Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote ``no'' on the  Republican effort to roll back the joint-employer rule that the Obama  administration promulgated. This joint-employer rule is an attack on  workers, and it is an attack on franchisee businesses.   For people watching, Mr. Speaker, understand that when a franchisor,  the big headquarters, tells a franchisee, ``You have got to do every  single thing we tell you. You basically work for us. We are going to  tell you the size of the sandwich. We are going to tell you the kind of  oil to use. We are going to tell you how to schedule your workers. We  are going to, basically, control your enterprise, though you are  supposed to be an independent business,'' the Obama administration  said, ``We are going to treat you as if you are joint employers.'' So  if there is wage theft or there is unfairness on the job or some  problem that comes up with workers, then the big company, the  headquarters, will also be held responsible for solving the problem.    What the Republicans do today, Mr. Speaker, is say: ``No, we might  impose all these conditions on you per the franchisee agreement, but,  if there are problems, it is going to be your problem, franchisee.''   This is absolutely unfair. As workers are going all over this country  trying to get higher wages, this is a whole movement for them to get  livable wage for people who work every single day at our fast-food  chains. They are going to their local franchisee owners to ask for  those wages.   But if the franchisor says: ``You can't pay any more than this. We  are going to restrict you in multiple number of ways. We are going to  make you sell food items at a cost that you can't even sustain, like  the dollar menu''--those things cost more than a dollar, folks. But if  the big headquarters says you have got to charge a dollar as a  promotion, then the franchisee has to eat that.   But when workers need more money, the big company makes that  impossible, and then workers are left holding the bag along with the  franchisee.   The joint-employer rule, holding both sides responsible for those  wage thefts to pay for hours, these things make a more fair process and  require the big headquarters to take responsibility as well.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this. This is an antiworker bill. This is an  anti-small business bill, which is somewhat surprising to me, given  that my friends on the other side of the aisle say they are for small  business, but, really, they are just for big business. If you have any  doubts about that, all you have got to do is look at this tax bill they  are putting out there.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this letter from  United Steelworkers urging a ``no'' vote on the joint employer bill.                                            United Steelworkers,                                   Pittsburgh, PA, November 1, 2017.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 850,000 members of       the United Steelworkers (USW), I strongly urge you to oppose       H.R. 3441, the ludicrously named ``Save Local Business Act''.       The bill has virtually nothing to do with small businesses       but will greatly restrict the definition of employer under       the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).        Targeting a National Labor Relations Board decision,       Browning-Ferris Industries, H.R. 3441 is not only drafted to       repeal a decision where the employer tried to avoid       collective bargaining responsibilities through       subcontracting, but radically changes the Fair Labor       Standards Act. Currently, under the FLSA, employers cannot       hide behind labor contractors or franchisees when they set       conditions of employment. H.R. 3441 strips nearly a century       of workforce protections to give large employers almost       unfettered ability to hide from long established employer       responsibilities.        The rise in temporary or precarious work in the United       States is fast becoming an unfortunate norm in the economy. A       recent study on the rise of temporary employment found the       proportion of American workers engaged in ``alternative       work'' jumped from 10.7% to 15.8% in the last decade. When in       the last decade 94% of net job growth is in the alternative       work category, workers continuously find themselves unable to       seek remedy for their grievances or an ability to       collectively hold their ultimate employer accountable. H.R.       3441 will accelerate the growth of job-instability as       employers will be able to manipulate the system to avoid       collective bargaining by hiring temporary employees or       contractor employees.        Congress' responsibility to American workers in this time       of rising income inequality and precarious work must be to       improve access to collective bargaining and stop employer       circumvention of U.S. labor laws, not to weaken them. H.R.       3441 strips workers of another tool to hold their employers       accountable. A vote for this legislation is a vote against       working people and the right to democratic representation in       the workplace. I urge you to vote no on H.R. 3441.            Sincerely,                                                     Leo W. Gerard,                                           International President.
