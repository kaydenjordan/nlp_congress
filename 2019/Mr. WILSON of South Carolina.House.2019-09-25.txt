 Mr. Speaker, each August, I participate  in a bus tour of South Carolina's Second Congressional District with my  wife, Roxanne, and dedicated staff from the Washington and district  offices.   This year, the tour took us to the Clemson University Sandhill  Research and Education Center in Columbia. The Sandhill Research and  Education Center plays a vital role in the growth of statewide  agribusiness.   We were welcomed by long-time friend, Director Kathy Coleman.   During the visit, we heard updates from faculty members Cory Heaton,  Adam Kantrovich, and Nathan Smith on their research in agribusiness  programming, which promotes President Donald Trump's policies of farm  exports.   We learned from farm manager Cody Bishop of the incubator program,  which provides small plots for startup farmers to begin growing their  business.   The visit was jointly hosted with the South Carolina Farm Bureau. We  were welcomed by David Wilson, Gary Spires, and Charles Wingard.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
