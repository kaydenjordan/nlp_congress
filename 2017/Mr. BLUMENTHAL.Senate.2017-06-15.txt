 Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about  healthcare, but I wanted to be here on this occasion to join my  distinguished colleague from Texas in supporting this measure because  it is so vital to protecting children.   Like the distinguished Senator from Texas, I, too, was attorney  general, and we in Connecticut have been at the forefront of fighting  this internet and cyber threat to the welfare of our children.   So I want to express my thanks to him for working in a very  bipartisan way. At a time when the public, many commentators, and media  question whether we work together across the aisle, this bill is a very  apt example of how we can and we must work together to protect our  children, to advance our national interests, and to make sure that  criminal justice is effectively enforced in this country.   I look forward to working with my colleague in making sure this  measure becomes law.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
