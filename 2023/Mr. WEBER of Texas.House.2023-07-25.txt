 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1338 promotes U.S. leadership in the commercial  satellite communications industry by creating a regulatory environment  that encourages innovation and investment in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I will tell you something. The Energy and Commerce  Committee is all about encouraging innovation and investment in the  United States.   This bill helps us to beat China. China is actively working to  undermine U.S. leadership in the satellite communications marketplace  and provide service to other allies so that they can gather  intelligence.   This bill streamlines the process for modifications to existing  satellite communications systems. The bill would ensure that  modifications to existing satellite communications are not held up  unnecessarily by new applications that may be more complex.   The bill also creates a regulatory fast lane for minor modifications  that do not change the spectrum interference landscape in a meaningful  way.   It incentivizes satellite communications systems to be good stewards  of spectrum. By establishing a quantifiable level of protection that  defines how each satellite communications system licensed by the FCC  may use spectrum, the bill ensures a balance between competition and  innovation.   It enhances FCC transparency and efficiency of processing NGSO  satellite applications, for example, SpaceX.   The bill would provide direction to the FCC on how their satellite  communications licensing rules should be designed.   By creating objective, measurable, and technology-neutral performance  objectives, satellite operators will have flexibility to design their  systems without government overregulation.   Mr. Speaker, we need H.R. 1338.
