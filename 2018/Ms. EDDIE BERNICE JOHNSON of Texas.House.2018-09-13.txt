 Madam Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6227, the National Quantum  Initiative Act.   I want to take a moment to thank Chairman Smith for introducing this  good legislation, of which I am a proud original cosponsor. I also want  to express my appreciation for the deliberative, bipartisan process by  which this bill was developed over the past year.   H.R. 6227 is the product of engagement with key stakeholders in  industry, academia, and the Federal Government.   The Science, Space, and Technology Committee held a hearing on  quantum technology last October. At that hearing, we heard from agency,  university, and industry representatives about the recent breakthroughs  in quantum sensing, quantum communication, and quantum computing. We  also heard about the priorities for Federal investment in quantum  research and the need for a strategic and coordinated approach going  forward.   In addition to the hearing, committee staff held numerous bipartisan  meetings and roundtables to inform the development of this bill.   Quantum information science and technology promises to revolutionize  the way we solve problems. Many believe that quantum computing  technology has the potential to accelerate progress on some of the most  pressing challenges, including how to address climate change and  understand complex diseases like cancer.   While it is difficult to predict how far-ranging the societal and  economic impacts of quantum computing will be, recent breakthroughs  demonstrate that we are rapidly clearing the necessary engineering  hurdles. It is truly an exciting time for this bill and for the wide  range of innovators who are planning to take advantage of these new  breakthrough capabilities.   The race is on to build the world's first quantum computer capable of  solving problems that have long eluded conventional computers. Not  unlike the space race in the 1960s, the stakes in today's quantum race  are high. Global leadership in quantum computing brings with it a  military and intelligence edge, as well as a competitive advantage in  what many expect to be a massive industry in decades to come.   At this time, when China, Europe, and Russia are investing heavily in  quantum research and technology development, it is imperative that we  do everything we can to maintain our global standing as the leader in  this area. We must invest more in research. We need to ensure that we  are educating and training the next generation of top quantum  scientists and engineers. And we should do more to encourage  partnerships between academia, industry, and government.   The National Quantum Initiative Act will set us on the right path.  H.R. 6227 directs the President to establish a 10-year National Quantum  Initiative Program, with the National Institute of Standards and  Technology, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of  Energy playing lead roles. Through the establishment of a national  coordination office, an outside advisory committee, and an interagency  working group, the program will take an integrated government approach  to accelerating progress in quantum research and development.   I want to express my appreciation for the deliberative, bipartisan  process by which we developed this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Lipinski).  [[Page H8233]]         Mr. Speaker, I have no further  requests for time, so I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further  requests for time.   I urge support of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  support the final passage of H.R. 589, the Department of Energy  Research and Innovation Act, for which I am pleased to be a cosponsor.   The bill before us today is a result of constructive negotiations  with our majority and with our colleagues in the Senate over the last 2  years. I am also pleased to note that many of the provisions in this  bill actually were proposed first in the version of the America  COMPETES Reauthorization Act, and that was sponsored by every  Democratic member of the committee last Congress.   This bill includes what would be the first comprehensive  authorization of the DOE Office of Science, which is the largest  supporter of physical sciences research in the country. This is a $6.6  billion office that manages 10 of our national laboratories, often  called the crown jewels of our national research infrastructure.   Yet, thus far, unlike NSF, NASA, and nearly every other major  scientific research agency stewarded by the Federal Government, the  Office of Science has not received the statutory guidance and support  that its capabilities and mission warrant. So passing this portion of  the bill into law alone would be a big step in the right direction.    The bill also includes a number of important technology transfer  provisions that previously passed the House as part of a bipartisan  bill that I and many of my colleagues on the committee cosponsored.   In addition, it would provide the first authorization of the  promising Innovation Hub model for energy research, and it would enable  greater private sector management of ARPA-E.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Smith and his staff for  working closely with us and our Senate counterparts to find common  ground in each of these areas, as I believe they will be critical to  ensuring our Nation's competitiveness and our clean energy future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further  requests for time. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further  requests for time. I support passage, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support S. 97, the Nuclear Energy  Innovation Capabilities Act.   It is the Senate companion to H.R. 431, which I am very pleased to  cosponsor. Today, nuclear power plays a vital role in providing our  country with clean, reliable energy. I happen to be one of those who  live in an area where we have nuclear energy.   Looking toward the future, one of my top priorities is preventing and  mitigating the potentially devastating impacts of climate change. I  believe that this clean energy resource can and should play a key role  in our efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of our electricity  sector. But there currently are technical, economic, and policy  challenges that prevent nuclear energy from playing a larger role in  enabling our clean energy future.   The Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act takes several positive  steps to address these challenges. Implementing the provisions of this  bill will help accelerate the development of advanced nuclear energy  technologies that are safer, less expensive, more efficient, and  produce less waste than the current generation of nuclear reactors.   I hope it will also help ensure a brighter future for the U.S.  nuclear energy industry. I would like to express my appreciation for  the process we followed to put this bill together. Majority and  minority staff in both the House and Senate worked closely together,  from engaging stakeholders, through crafting and incorporating  suggested changes to the bill language.   This is a great example of what we can achieve when we leave politics  at the door and look for common ground to address challenges facing our  Nation's research enterprise.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge passage, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
