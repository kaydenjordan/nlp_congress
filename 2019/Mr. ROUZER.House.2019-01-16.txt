 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my good colleague and  friend, Austin Scott, for his leadership on this, as well as,  certainly, the chairman, Chairman Bishop from Georgia, whom, by the  way, I have heard lots about for many, many years from many mutual  friends that he and I both have. I look forward to working with him not  only on this, but on many other matters as they come before us.   There is absolutely no question: agriculture all across the Southeast  has been significantly damaged, devastated in many, many parts.   In North Carolina, we are still reeling from the hurricane in 2016,  Hurricane Matthew. And then, of course, Hurricane Florence came and hit  not only the same areas that Hurricane Matthew hit, but hit a much  broader area of North Carolina. In fact, why don't we just say it  really devastated and inflicted a lot of harm all across eastern North  Carolina, this on top of a 5-year decline in farm income not only in  North Carolina, but across the country.   So you have had a significant shortfall in income for all these farm  families all over the country, North Carolina included.   Then comes Hurricane Matthew in 2016, floods all those out who are in  its path. And when I say ``floods,'' I mean a real flood, flooding that  you have not seen in many, many years.   And then Hurricane Florence comes in 2018. It is not only the same  areas that Hurricane Matthew hit in 2016, but hits a much broader  geographical region in North Carolina and elsewhere.    So over the last 5 years, you have not only had a huge decrease in  farm income, you have had all kinds of natural disasters--not just in  North Carolina, but elsewhere. As a result, all these farm families  have lost all their equity. They have no equity left.   Without the disaster recovery package that Congress has previously  passed and what we hope to pass eventually here, that is contained in  this body of work today, will be a start to rebuild, to enable these  folks to cash-flow, to enable them just to get the financing that they  need to put in the ground a new crop for the year 2019.   So I commend both of my colleagues for their help and their support  on this, and I encourage the rest of the body to join with us and adopt  this amendment.    Madam Speaker, Columbus County and many throughout North  Carolina and beyond are mourning the passing of Mr. James C. High,  known to his many friends and colleagues as Jim.   As the publisher of The News Reporter, a family-owned newspaper in  Whiteville for 61 years, Mr. High was a strong advocate for a free  press and was highly recognized in the industry for making The News  Reporter a leading community newspaper.   He has been long admired in the community for his years of dedicated  leadership, service to others, and distinguished contributions to  Columbus County.   Mr. High's impact went beyond just the newspaper. He helped lead the  effort to create the Committee of 100 to bring industry and jobs to  Columbus County.   He was influential in many different capital campaigns, including  those for the Carolyn T. High Memorial Library, the Whiteville High  School gymnasium, the Angel House Hospice Care Center, and many others  too numerous to list.   Jim High was a vital part of Columbus County, and he will be greatly  missed. His was a life lived well, and he leaves a great legacy of  enrichment that will continue to benefit many.                            ____________________
