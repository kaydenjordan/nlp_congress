 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I feel very strongly about this bill. It is one that  came out of a research project that we had on contracting, where we  found a major consulting firm was working for the FDA and the  manufacturer at the same time. They didn't even have different people.  It was the same people working for the FDA on regulation and for the  manufacturer, which wanted easy regulations on the product they were  putting out--in this case, opioids, which have killed more Americans  than any other drug, probably, in history.   I thank my colleagues in the Senate for introducing it and the staff  of the  [[Page H9839]]  Oversight and Reform Committee for introducing it here in the House.   It is absolutely outrageous. I think it should be a crime, actually,  that a contractor would be allowed to advise government regulators and  not tell them that, at the same time, they are advising the industry  that is benefiting from weaker regulation.   If we do not take steps to prevent conflicts of interest and thereby  safeguard the integrity of government decisionmaking and operations,  then we risk potentially serious breaches in the public trust.   I think it is even more serious. You risk having unsafe drugs going  into the marketplace, which has happened before.   Most government contractors take this responsibility to disclose  conflicts of interest seriously, but many do not. It is even the  business model of some consulting firms to go after both the regulator  and the manufacturer at the same time, and they have repeatedly done  it.   These contractors would benefit from uniformity in rules. Right now,  they are patchwork. We need uniform rules. We need clear rules, and the  clear rules should be that a consulting firm can only work for a  regulator but cannot work for the manufacturer, or they can work for  the manufacturer but not the regulator. Too often, they are working for  the same positions with the same person, believe it or not.   I think that this bill will save lives. It will make our industries  fair and safer. It should be bipartisan, as it is in the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to strongly support the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1915     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time to close.   Mr. Speaker, I would say it is a very necessary bill because it is  happening. If it is against the law, then the Department of Justice  should come in and prosecute people. But they have not, and they are  busy prosecuting a lot of other things.   So it is life and death when it comes to healthcare.   We know that the FDA originally wrote rules about the opioids saying  they were not addictive. They wrote it right into the regulations: not  addictive. They are one of the most addictive drugs of all times. They  have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, and we are spending  billions of dollars in treatment trying to save the lives of people who  have become addicted when the inscription used to be that it was safe.  It was safe.   So there are times when laws are abused. This is not about an  individual drug company or an individual contractor or an individual  consulting firm. It is about a uniformity of rules. We are looking at  legislation. We want to stop that abuse.   In a lot of our investigations the Department of Justice has come in  and taken action. Maybe they should in this case, too. But if it is  illegal, then it is not being enforced; and it is, I would say,  dangerous if we don't make it clear--and ironclad clear--that you  cannot work for the regulator and the manufacturer at the same time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
