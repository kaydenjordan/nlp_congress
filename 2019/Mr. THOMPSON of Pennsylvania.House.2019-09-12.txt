 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  the 150th anniversary of the Jefferson County Courthouse in  Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District.   Since its opening in 1869, the Jefferson County Courthouse has  undergone serious renovations and changes, but its impact on the  community remains steadfast. County Commissioner Jack Matson said:  ``You really can't be a resident of Jefferson County and not have the  courthouse affect your daily lives.''   Tomorrow, the Jefferson County community will come together to  celebrate this milestone on the courthouse grounds in Brookville. The  programming will include tours of the courthouse, a performance by the  Punxsutawney Area High School marching band, a reenactment of the trial  of abolitionist Judge Elijah Heath, and the dedication of a World War  II monument. The evening will conclude with the lighting of the bell  tower and a special rig designed by students at the Jefferson County- Dubois Area Vocational-Technical School.    Jefferson County Commissioner Jeff Pisarcik said it best when he  said: ``It's not our building; it's everybody's building that lives in  Jefferson County.''                            ____________________
