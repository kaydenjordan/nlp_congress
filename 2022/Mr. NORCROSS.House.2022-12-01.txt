 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on behalf of those  struggling with the disease of addiction. Over the last few years, it  has been brutal on Americans suffering from opioid use disorder-- 100,000 dead within 12 months. These overdoses are horrible.   This relentless disease has left heartbroken families across this  country asking why there isn't more support for our loved ones in the  grip of addiction.   In today's paper, Leigh Ann Caldwell of The Washington Post reported  that a cartel of clinics is trying to block legislation that would help  address the opioid epidemic. Her article quotes a special interest  leader saying he doesn't trust doctors.   Seventy-seven million people lack easy access to a clinic, but he  doesn't want his patients to be treated by doctors he doesn't trust.  Maybe he wants to protect the monopoly of these for-profit clinics.   It is time for us to decide that what is more important is ending the  opioid epidemic. These cartels must stop.                            ____________________
