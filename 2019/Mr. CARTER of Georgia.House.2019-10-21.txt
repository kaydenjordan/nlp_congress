 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize this  past September 29 as Gold Star Mother's Day. Originally dedicated in  1936, the last Sunday in September each year honors mothers who have  lost a son or daughter while serving in the United States Armed Forces.   Service and sacrifice for our Nation is not only a personal  commitment, but one that involves the sacrifice of entire families and  even whole communities. In Gold Star Mothers we can see one of the most  important reminders of this sacrifice.   Thank you to the Gold Star Mothers for your own service to our  Nation. I understand that a day of recognition will not bring back the  lives of your children, but you continue to be an inspiration to us  all. With national conventions, fundraising events, and Federal  advocacy, you continue to move forward and make our world a better  place to live.
