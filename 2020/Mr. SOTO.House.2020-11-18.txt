 Madam Speaker, coronavirus cases are rising again in  Florida. Today, Florida reported 7,925 new cases.   Coronavirus cases are rising nationally. Yesterday, there were over  155,000 Americans who contracted the coronavirus and another 1,707  Americans dead. That is the highest daily death toll since May 14.   American families need our help: testing, tracing, treatment, and a  vaccine; keeping our first responders on the job; small business  relief; jobless benefits; and food and housing assistance.   And what is Congress doing about it?   The House majority has voted twice for the Heroes Act, including a  compromise. President-elect Joe Biden has said right now Congress  should come together and pass COVID relief packages like the Heroes  Act.   Where is President Trump? Where is the Senate Republican majority?  Millions of Americans would like to know.   America is in crisis. We must come together as a Congress, and the  time for action is now.                            ____________________
