 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 391) to authorize a comprehensive, strategic approach for United  States foreign assistance to developing countries to strengthen global  health security, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 391         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Global Health Security Act       of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) In December 2009, President Obama released the National       Strategy for Countering Biological Threats, which listed as       one of seven objectives ``Promote global health security:       Increase the availability of and access to knowledge and       products of the life sciences that can help reduce the impact       from outbreaks of infectious disease whether of natural,       accidental, or deliberate origin''.        (2) In February 2014, the United States and nearly 30 other       nations launched the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) to       address several high-priority, global infectious disease       threats. The GHSA is a multi-faceted, multi-country       initiative intended to accelerate partner countries'       measurable capabilities to achieve specific targets to       prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats,       whether naturally occurring, deliberate, or accidental.        (3) In 2015, the United Nations adopted the Sustainable       Development Goals (SDGs), which include specific reference to       the importance of global health security as part of SDG 3       ``ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all       ages'' as follows: ``strengthen the capacity of all       countries, in particular developing countries, for early       warning, risk reduction and management of national and global       health risks''.        (4) On November 4, 2016, President Obama signed Executive       Order No. 13747, ``Advancing the Global Health Security       Agenda to Achieve a World Safe and Secure from Infectious       Disease Threats''.        (5) In October 2017 at the GHSA Ministerial Meeting in       Uganda, the United States and more than 40 GHSA member       countries supported the ``Kampala Declaration'' to extend the       GHSA for an additional 5 years to 2024.        (6) In December 2017, President Trump released the National       Security Strategy, which includes the priority action:       ``Detect and contain bio-threats at their source: We will       work with other countries to detect and mitigate outbreaks       early to prevent the spread of disease. We will encourage       other countries to invest in basic health care systems and to       strengthen global health security across the intersection of       human and animal health to prevent infectious disease       outbreaks''.        (7) In September 2018, President Trump released the       National Biodefense Strategy, which includes objectives to       ``strengthen global health security capacities to prevent       local bioincidents from becoming epidemics'', and       ``strengthen international preparedness to support       international response and recovery capabilities''.        (8) In January 2021, President Biden issued Executive Order       13987 (86 Fed. Reg. 7019; relating to Organizing and       Mobilizing the United States Government to Provide a Unified       and Effective Response to Combat COVID-19 and to Provide       United States Leadership on Global Health and Security), as       well as National Security Memorandum on United States Global       Leadership to Strengthen the International COVID-19 Response       and to Advance Global Health Security and Biological       Preparedness, which include objectives to strengthen and       reform the World Health Organization, increase United States       leadership in the global response to COVID-19, and to finance       and advance global health security and pandemic preparedness.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to--        (1) promote and invest in global health security and       pandemic preparedness as a core national security interest;        (2) advance the aims of the Global Health Security Agenda;        (3) collaborate with other countries to detect and mitigate       outbreaks early to prevent the spread of disease;        (4) encourage and support other countries to advance       pandemic preparedness by investing in basic resilient and       sustainable health care systems; and        (5) strengthen global health security across the       intersection of human and animal health to prepare for and       prevent infectious disease outbreaks and combat the growing       threat of antimicrobial resistance.

SEC. 14. COMPLIANCE WITH THE FOREIGN AID TRANSPARENCY AND                     ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2016.         Section 2(3) of the Foreign Aid Transparency and       Accountability Act of 2016 (Public Law 114-191; 22 U.S.C.       2394c note) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in subparagraph (D), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; and''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(E) the Global Health Security Act of 2021.''.       SEC. 15. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       ``appropriate congressional Committees'' means--        (A) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       Appropriations of the House of Representatives; and        (B) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Appropriations of the Senate.        (2) Global health security.--The term ``global health       security'' means activities supporting epidemic and pandemic       preparedness and capabilities at the country and global       levels in order to minimize vulnerability to acute public       health events that can endanger the health of populations       across geographical regions and international boundaries.       SEC. 16. SUNSET.         This Act, and the amendments made by this Act shall cease       to be effective 5 fiscal years after the enactment of this       Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 391, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 391, the Global Health  Security Act of 2021.   As the saying goes: ``An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of  cure,'' and that is undoubtedly true in global health. Pandemics don't  respect borders and they don't care about nationalities, and we are  seeing that play out on the front pages of the news these days as the  coronavirus pandemic continues to cause severe disruptions around the  world.   Over the past few years, global health security has become  increasingly tied to U.S. national security, as evidenced by not only  our experience with COVID-19, but also previous pandemics, such as  Ebola and Zika, both overseas and at home.   Having a coordinated, whole-of-government approach to prepare for and  respond to these threats is critical. We must build on the lessons  learned from the COVID-19 pandemic.   The Global Health Security Agenda, which the United States has  committed to, helps countries invest in preparedness and strengthens  systems that prevent, detect, and respond to disease outbreaks.   H.R. 391, a bipartisan bill by Representative Connolly and  Representative Chabot, would institutionalize the best practices the  United States has learned in global health security. This bill  establishes an interagency review council to not only advance global  health security, but also mandates a U.S. Global Health Security  Coordinator to manage the U.S. response in these emergencies and allow  the interagency review council to speak with one voice.   I believe this person should be at the National Security Council as  the natural nexus between diplomacy, development, and defense. This  person would help build capacity, apply lessons learned, and prepare  for the future.   While I am heartened to see that the Biden administration has  recently appointed such a person to tackle the pandemic that we are  facing, this legislation would create a permanent position focused on  U.S. global health security.   Furthermore, this bill would require the U.S. Global Health Security  Coordinator to develop a strategy and regularly report to Congress on  the progress the United States is making toward making global health  security a core national security interest.   Finally, this bill outlines a framework to leverage assistance to  increase contributions from other donors, along the lines of the Global  Fund, to support global health security activities around the world.   This bill passed the House multiple times in the past, and is more  timely than ever as we continue to address COVID-19 and seek to prepare  ourselves for the next outbreak.   So I would like to thank Representative Connolly and Representative  Chabot for their work on this legislation over the past several years  and for recognizing the vital importance of global health security as  part of America's national security.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), the president of the NATO Parliamentary  Assembly and a valued member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for his partnership  in working together to bring this bipartisan legislation to the floor,  because as we all have found, COVID-19, which has caused global  disruption unlike any other in recent memory, is not a Democratic  issue; it is not a Republican issue; it is all of our issue. It is an  issue for all of us, not just here in the United States, but around the  world.   Coming together on the committee, as we generally do, is extremely  important, working together to get this done.   As we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel of this  pandemic, the United States must seize the opportunity and learn the  lessons and best practices from the crisis so that we can be better  prepared to respond to any future and similar threats to the U.S.  national and global security. COVID-19 caught America off guard, but  the Global Health and Security Act will ensure that this never happens  again.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Connolly and Mr. Chabot for their work on  this legislation and for recognizing the vital importance of global  health security as part of America's national security.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 567) to establish an interagency program to assist countries in  North and West Africa to improve immediate and long-term capabilities  to counter terrorist threats, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 567         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Trans-Sahara       Counterterrorism Partnership Program Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) terrorist and violent extremist organizations, such as       Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Boko Haram, the Islamic       State of West Africa, and other affiliated groups, have       killed tens of thousands of innocent civilians, displaced       populations, destabilized local and national governments, and       caused mass human suffering in the affected communities;        (2) poor governance, political and economic       marginalization, and lack of accountability for human rights       abuses by security forces are drivers of extremism;        (3) it is in the national security interest of the United       States to combat the spread of terrorism and violent       extremism and build the capacity of partner countries to       combat these threats in Africa;        (4) terrorist and violent extremist organizations exploit       vulnerable and marginalized communities suffering from       poverty, lack of economic opportunity (particularly among       youth populations), corruption, and weak governance; and        (5) a comprehensive, coordinated interagency approach is       needed to develop an effective strategy to address the       security challenges in the Sahel-Maghreb, appropriately       allocate resources, de-conflict programs, and maximize the       effectiveness of United States defense, diplomatic, and       development capabilities.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to assist countries       in North and West Africa, and other allies and partners       active in those regions, in combating terrorism and violent       extremism through a coordinated interagency approach with a       consistent strategy that appropriately balances security       activities with diplomatic and development efforts to address       the political, socioeconomic, governance, and development       challenges in North and West Africa that contribute to       terrorism and violent extremism.       SEC. 4. TRANS-SAHARA COUNTERTERRORISM PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM.         (a) Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership Program.--        (1) Establishment.--The Secretary of State, in consultation       with the Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of the       United States Agency for International Development, shall       establish a partnership program, to be known as the ``Trans-      Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP) Program'' to       coordinate all programs, projects, and activities of the       United States Government in countries in North and West       Africa that are conducted for any of the following purposes:        (A) To improve governance and the capacities of countries       in North and West Africa to deliver basic services,       particularly with at-risk communities, as a means of       countering terrorism and violent extremism by enhancing state       legitimacy and authority and countering corruption.        (B) To address the factors that make people and communities       vulnerable to recruitment by terrorist and violent extremist       organizations, including economic vulnerability and mistrust       of government and government security forces, through       activities such as--        (i) supporting strategies that increase youth employment       opportunities;        (ii) promoting girls' education and women's political       participation;        (iii) strengthening local governance and civil society       capacity;        (iv) improving government transparency and accountability;        (v) fighting corruption;        (vi) improving access to economic opportunities; and        (vii) other development activities necessary to support       community resilience.        (C) To strengthen the rule of law in such countries,       including by enhancing the capability of the judicial       institutions to independently, transparently, and credibly       deter,  [[Page H3172]]       investigate, and prosecute acts of terrorism and violent       extremism.        (D) To improve the ability of military and law enforcement       entities in partner countries to detect, disrupt, respond to,       and prosecute violent extremist and terrorist activity while       respecting human rights, and to cooperate with the United       States and other partner countries on counterterrorism and       counter-extremism efforts.        (E) To enhance the border security capacity of partner       countries, including the ability to monitor, detain, and       interdict terrorists.        (F) To identify, monitor, disrupt, and counter the human       capital and financing pipelines of terrorism.        (G) To support the free expression and operations of       independent, local-language media, particularly in rural       areas, while countering the media operations and recruitment       propaganda of terrorist and violent extremist organizations.        (2) Assistance framework.--Activities carried out under the       TSCTP Program shall--        (A) be carried out in countries where the Secretary of       State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the       Administrator of the United States Agency for International       Development, determines that there is an adequate level of       partner country commitment, and has considered partner       country needs, absorptive capacity, sustainment capacity, and       efforts of other donors in the sector;        (B) have clearly defined outcomes;        (C) be closely coordinated among United States diplomatic       and development missions, United States Africa Command, and       relevant participating departments and agencies;        (D) have specific plans with robust indicators to regularly       monitor and evaluate outcomes and impact;        (E) complement and enhance efforts to promote democratic       governance, the rule of law, human rights, and economic       growth;        (F) in the case of train and equip programs, complement       longer-term security sector institution-building; and        (G) have mechanisms in place to track resources and       routinely monitor and evaluate the efficacy of relevant       programs.        (3) Consultation.--In coordinating activities through the       TSCTP Program, the Secretary of State shall also establish a       coordination mechanism that ensures periodic consultation       with, as appropriate, the Director of National Intelligence,       the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, the       Chief Executive Officer of the United States Agency for       Global Media (formerly known as the Broadcasting Board of       Governors), and the heads of other relevant Federal       departments and agencies, as determined by the President.

(b) International Coordination.--Efforts carried out under       this section shall take into account partner country       counterterrorism, counter-extremism, and development       strategies and, to the extent practicable, shall be aligned       with such strategies. Such efforts shall be coordinated with       counterterrorism and counter-extremism activities and       programs in the areas of defense, diplomacy, and development       carried out by other like-minded donors and international       organizations in the relevant country.        (c) Strategies.--Not later than 270 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in       consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the       Administrator of the United States Agency for International       Development and other relevant Federal Government agencies,       shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees the       following strategies:        (1) A comprehensive five-year strategy for the sahel-      maghreb.--A comprehensive five-year strategy for the Sahel-      Maghreb, including details related to whole-of-government       efforts in the areas of defense, diplomacy, and development       to advance the national security, economic, and humanitarian       interests of the United States, including--        (A) efforts to ensure coordination with multilateral and       bilateral partners, such as the Joint Force of the Group of       Five of the Sahel, and with other relevant assistance       frameworks;        (B) a public diplomacy strategy and actions to ensure that       populations in the Sahel-Maghreb are aware of the development       activities of the United States Government, especially in       countries with a significant Department of Defense presence       or engagement through train and equip programs;        (C) activities aimed at supporting democratic institutions       and countering violent extremism with measurable goals and       transparent benchmarks;        (D) plans to help each partner country address humanitarian       and development needs and to help prevent, respond to, and       mitigate intercommunal violence;        (E) a comprehensive plan to support security sector reform       in each partner country that includes a detailed section on       programs and activities being undertaken by relevant       stakeholders and other international actors operating in the       sector and that incorporates as appropriate any lessons       learned from previous initiatives to improve security sector       governance; and        (F) a specific strategy for Mali that includes plans for       sustained, high-level diplomatic engagement with       stakeholders, including countries in Europe and the Middle       East with interests in the Sahel-Maghreb, regional       governments, relevant multilateral organizations, signatory       groups of the 2015 Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in       Mali, and civil society actors.        (2) A comprehensive five-year strategy for tsctp program       counterterrorism efforts.--A comprehensive five-year strategy       for the TSCTP Program that includes--        (A) a clear statement of the objectives of United States       counterterrorism efforts in North and West Africa with       respect to the use of all forms of United States assistance       to combat terrorism and counter violent extremism, including       efforts to build military and civilian law enforcement       capacity, strengthen the rule of law, promote responsive and       accountable governance, and address the root causes of       terrorism and violent extremism;        (B) a plan for coordinating programs through the TSCTP       Program pursuant to subsection (a)(1), including an       identification of which agency or bureau of the Department of       State, as applicable, will be responsible for leading,       coordinating, and conducting monitoring and evaluation for       each such program, and the process for enabling the leading       agency or bureau to establish standards, compel partners to       adhere to those standards, and report results;        (C) a plan to monitor, evaluate, and share data and       learning about the TSCTP Program that includes quantifiable       baselines, targets, and results in accordance with monitoring       and evaluation provisions of sections 3 and 4 of the Foreign       Aid Transparency and Accountability Act of 2016 (Public Law       114-191); and        (D) a plan for ensuring coordination and compliance with       related requirements in United States law, including the       Global Fragility Act of 2019 (title V of division J of the       Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (Public Law       116-94)).        (3) Consultation.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Department of State shall       consult with appropriate congressional committees on progress       made towards developing the strategies required in paragraphs       (1) and (2).        (d) Supporting Material in Annual Budget Request.--The       Secretary of State shall include in the budget materials       submitted to Congress in support of the President's annual       budget request (submitted to Congress pursuant to section       1105 of title 31, United States Code) for each fiscal year       beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act, and       annually thereafter for five years, a description of the       requirements, activities, and planned allocation of amounts       requested by the TSCTP Program. This requirement does not       apply to activities of the Department of Defense conducted       pursuant to authorities under title 10, United States Code.        (e) Monitoring and Evaluation of Programs and Activities.--      Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of       this Act, and annually thereafter for five years, the       Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of       Defense and the Administrator of the United States Agency for       International Development, shall submit to the appropriate       congressional committees a report that describes--        (1) the progress made in meeting the objectives of the       strategies required under paragraphs (1) and (2) of       subsection (c), including any lessons learned in carrying out       TSCTP Program activities and any recommendations for       improving such programs and activities;        (2) the efforts taken to coordinate, de-conflict, and       streamline TSCTP Program activities to maximize resource       effectiveness;        (3) the extent to which each partner country has       demonstrated the ability to absorb the equipment or training       provided in the previous year under the TSCTP Program, and       where applicable, the ability to maintain and appropriately       utilize such equipment;        (4) the extent to which each partner country is investing       its own resources to advance the goals described in       subsection (a)(1) or is demonstrating a commitment and       willingness to cooperate with the United States to advance       such goals;        (5) the actions taken by the government of each partner       country receiving assistance under the TSCTP Program to       combat corruption, improve transparency and accountability,       and promote other forms of democratic governance;        (6) the assistance provided in each of the three preceding       fiscal years under this program, broken down by partner       country, to  [[Page H3173]]       include the type, statutory authorization, and purpose of all       United States security assistance provided to the country       pursuant to authorities under title 10, United States Code,       the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.),       or any other ``train and equip'' authorities of the       Department of Defense; and        (7) any changes or updates to the Comprehensive Five-Year       Strategy for the TSCTP Program required under paragraph (2)       of subsection (c) necessitated by the findings in this annual       report.        (f) Reporting Requirement Related to Audit of Bureau of       African Affairs Monitoring and Coordination of the Trans-      Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership Program.--Not later than       90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, and       every 120 days thereafter until all 13 recommendations in the       September 2020 Department of State Office of Inspector       General audit entitled ``Audit of the Department of State       Bureau of African Affairs Monitoring and Coordination of the       Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership Program'' (AUD-      MERO-20-42) are closed or until the date that is three years       after the date of the enactment of this Act, whichever is       earlier, the Secretary of State shall submit to the       appropriate congressional committees a report that       identifies--        (1) which of the 13 recommendations in AUD-MERO-20-42 have       not been closed;        (2) a description of progress made since the last report       toward closing each recommendation identified under paragraph       (1);        (3) additional resources needed, including assessment of       staffing capacity, if any, to complete action required to       close each recommendation identified under paragraph (1); and        (4) the anticipated timeline for completion of action       required to close each recommendation identified under       paragraph (1), including application of all recommendations       into all existing security assistance programs managed by the       Department of State under the TSCTP Program.        (g) Program Administration.--Not later than 120 days after       the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State       shall report to Congress plans for conducting a written       review of a representative sample of each of the security       assistance programs administered by the Bureau of African       Affairs to identify potential waste, fraud, abuse,       inefficiencies, or deficiencies. The review shall include an       analysis of staff capacity, including human resource needs,       available resources, procedural guidance, and monitoring and       evaluation processes to ensure the Bureau of African Affairs       is managing programs efficiently and effectively.        (h) Form.--The strategies required under paragraphs (1) and       (2) of subsection (c) and the reports required under       subsections (e), (f), and (g) shall be submitted in       unclassified form but may include a classified annex.        (i) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on       Armed Services, the Committee on Appropriations, and the       Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate; and        (2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on       Armed Services, the Committee on Appropriations, and the       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of       Representatives.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 567, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 567, the Trans- Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership Program Act of 2021, from my good  friend and colleague, the ranking member, Mr. McCaul. I thank Mr.  McCaul for working in the spirit of bipartisanship and making sure that  we get this bill to the floor. This bill authorizes and supports the  continuation of a viable counterterrorism program with our allies and  partners.   First launched in 2005, the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership  Program is a valuable initiative through which the State Department  works with partner countries in North Africa and the Sahel to build  more responsive and resilient counterterrorism strategies to better  counter threats facing the region and our allies.   Those nations include Algeria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Libya,  Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Tunisia.   As the nature of the terrorist threat in North Africa evolves and  permeates across borders in remote geographies, close coordination and  a regional approach is critical. One of the United States' strongest  tools in its arsenal is its ability to galvanize collective action,  employing U.S.-led multilateral initiatives for counterterrorism  purposes. The Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership Program is a  strong example of that multilateral capacity. We cannot prevent or  respond to terrorism by being American alone or America only. It must  be America forward, leading partners to action that safeguards our  security interests.   This bill authorizes the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership  Program and supports its continuation while requiring a clear,  multiyear strategy. It also requires a plan for the thorough monitoring  and evaluation of programming to ensure funds are spent wisely,  progress is assessed, and programmatic actions are results-oriented. By  doing so, we can ensure an effective, regional approach to  counterterrorism in North Africa and the Sahel.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank my friend and colleague, Ranking Member  McCaul, and I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, effective counterterrorism strategies across North  Africa and the Sahel are critical to U.S. security. Terrorist attacks  orchestrated by ISIS- and al-Qaida-affiliated groups require a  coordinated multilateral response, led by the United States in close  partnership with nations in the region. A more responsive and resilient  counterterrorism strategy in North Africa and the Sahel is critical and  crucial to addressing the threats that we face today, and this bill  ensures that this program is the most effective it can be in addressing  such threats.   I thank Representative McCaul and Representative Keating for bringing  this bill forward, I urge the Senate to get it done also, and I urge  all of my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3261) to repeal the Authorization for the Use of Military Force  Against Iraq Resolution.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3261         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REPEAL OF AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE                     AGAINST IRAQ RESOLUTION.         The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq       Resolution (Public Law 102-1; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) is hereby       repealed.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 3261.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3261, to repeal the  Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution,  authored by Representative Spanberger.   Less than two weeks ago, this body voted for a bill to repeal the  2002 AUMF, nearly two decades after it was originally passed. By not  repealing an AUMF and allowing it to remain long after it has served  its purpose, we open the door for future administrations of either  party to abuse that authority and stretch the authorization far beyond  its original purpose.                                time  1530    By failing to remove outdated authorities, Congress cedes its Article  I authority to the executive branch. This is contrary to the design of  our Constitution, Mr. Speaker, which gives Congress the power to make  decisions on matters of war and peace.   Today, we debate a bill that would repeal an Authorization for Use of  Military Force older than the 2002 AUMF. H.R. 3261 repeals the 1991  AUMF that authorized the use of the United States Armed Forces pursuant  to the United Nations Security Council resolution, which was issued in  the wake of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. Yet, the 1991 AUMF  remains in statute, in the United States Code, even though our military  liberated Kuwait and completed its limited mission there three decades  ago.   By voting this legislation out of the House, we continue to  demonstrate our commitment to reclaiming our authority over war powers.  One of the hardest decisions any of us can make as Members of Congress  is whether to send the brave men and women of our armed services into  conflict. While it is a difficult decision, it does not relinquish us  of that responsibility.   I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Spanberger) for authoring  this important legislation.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Spanberger), a valued member of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McCaul for working together in regard to  this 1991 AUMF reform that was put forth by Ms. Spanberger. I want to  tell the gentleman that, of course, we will work together, as I  indicated at the last debate that we had on the floor to repeal and  replace the 2001 AUMF so that we can deal with those items that make  sure that we are secure and are modernizing and updating what we need  to do to make sure that we are updated and strong moving forward,  utilizing what the Constitution has given us, the Article I authority  in war powers. I think that is absolutely key and essential.   It is difficult for all of us who sit here as Members of Congress,  but it is our duty and our responsibility that we can't dodge. I think  we understand that in a bipartisan way, that we are going to take up  the responsibilities that we have.   Passing the repeal of the 2002 AUMF was the beginning of our work of  reclaiming our authority over matters of war and peace, and today's  repeal of the 1991 AUMF continues that effort.   Again, Representative Spanberger's bill before this Chamber today  will remove an outdated AUMF and lessen the risk that the executive can  circumvent Congress in utilizing military force.   I thank Representative Spanberger for authoring this bill, as well as  the support of so many here in Congress on both sides of the aisle for  defending Congress' Article I authority. We are doing this  collectively, our responsibility that we are not dodging and not giving  to the executive branch.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 3283) to repeal the joint resolution entitled, ``A joint  resolution to promote peace and stability in the Middle East'', as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3283         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. REPEAL OF JOINT RESOLUTION TO PROMOTE PEACE AND                     STABILITY IN THE MIDDLE EAST.         Effective on the date that is 90 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the joint resolution entitled ``A       joint resolution to promote peace and stability in the Middle       East'' (Public Law 85-7; 22 U.S.C. 1961 et seq.) is hereby       repealed.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 3283, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3283 to repeal  the joint resolution entitled ``A joint resolution to promote peace and  stability in the Middle East,'' offered by Representative Meijer.   Earlier, I made the case for continuing this Chamber's hard work of  reclaiming congressional war powers, started less than 2 weeks ago by  our vote to repeal the 2002 AUMF and continued by our debate today to  repeal the 1991 AUMF and the 1957 AUMF.                                time  1545    I will keep my remarks short so as not to belabor the points I made  earlier, as the case for repealing the 1941 AUMF similarly applies to  the 1957 AUMF, if not more so.   Going way back, I was barely a toddler when this authorization was  passed, and I have been here for a while. The fact that this  authorization still exists as good law today indicates the vital need  for Congress to take seriously its responsibility over war and peace  and repeal AUMFs once their purpose has been served or expired.   Good legislative housekeeping requires us not to just authorize force  when needed to protect and defend this Nation, but to recall and repeal  authorities when their usefulness has passed.   The Soviet Union this authorization was meant to counter no longer  exists. There is no Soviet Union now. The 1957 AUMF is a relic of the  Cold War. It is outdated and obsolete.   We, as Members of Congress, have been granted the responsibility to  make decisions on matters of war and peace by the Constitution, a  responsibility none of us takes lightly. However, for far too long we  have failed to make those decisions at all. Instead, we have ceded our  Article I authority to administrations that have reinterpreted old  AUMFs. The threat of that abuse continues so long as we allow these  authorizations to remain in the U.S. Code.   I thank again the ranking member for working with us to bring this  bill forward. I thank Representative Meijer for authoring this  legislation. And I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Spanberger), a very valued member of our committee on the  House Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank Mr. Meijer for this piece of legislation. Again, I thank Mr.  McCaul for working together, and I have no come back; yes, I was just a  toddler, you weren't here yet.   There seems to be a theme, and if you think there is a theme that is  going on today, there is a theme. The theme is that we in the United  States Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, are acting to reclaim  our Congressional war powers. First, we voted to repeal the 2002 AUMF,  then the 1991 AUMF, and now the 1957 AUMF. These authorizations serve  no current national security purpose and only risk to strip Congress of  its Article I authority to decide matters of war and peace. That is the  theme here today.   The work is not over. We still have to work, as I have said, and I  pledge to work with Mr. McCaul to repeal and replace the 2001 AUMF. But  it is our solemn responsibility to decide when, where, and how we  deploy members of our armed services and not take a back seat on such  decisions to the executive branch.  [[Page H3178]]                                     time  1600    Mr. Speaker, working together, we will indeed do what Article I tells  us to do: To determine when, where, and how we go to war.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this very important  piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 186) calling for the immediate release of Trevor  Reed, a United States citizen who was unjustly found guilty and  sentenced to nine years in a Russian prison.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 186         Whereas United States citizen Trevor Reed is a resident of       Granbury, Texas, and a United States Marine Corps veteran;        Whereas Trevor Reed traveled to Moscow to visit his       girlfriend in May 2019;        Whereas Moscow's Police Service detained Trevor Reed in       August 2019;        Whereas Trevor Reed was accused of grabbing the arm of the       police officer driving the vehicle and elbowing another       officer while en route to the police station, causing the       vehicle to swerve and therefore endangering the lives of the       police officers;        Whereas the United States Embassy in Moscow has filed       numerous diplomatic notes with the Russian Foreign Ministry       regarding Trevor Reed being denied consular access,       communications, medical treatment, family visitations, and       other violations of the Vienna Convention on Consular       Relations;        Whereas Trevor Reed was not given food or water until       approximately 72 hours after his initial arrest;        Whereas Trevor Reed was not given a medical evaluation of       his injuries until 10 days following his arrest;        Whereas Trevor Reed's defense team presented video evidence       to the courts that disproves the police officers' statements       of supposed endangerment and wrongdoing;        Whereas Trevor Reed's defense team was denied access to       additional video evidence from inside the police vehicle and       police station that had the potential to prove his innocence,       the requests for all video recordings are documented, and the       existence of the other videos was confirmed by police       officials and investigators;        Whereas the police officers claimed emotional and physical       damages, but did not sustain any visible injury, or claim any       time missed from work, and the law considers the police       officers victims;        Whereas the Constitutional Supreme Court of the Russian       Federation and the Second Court of Cassation of General       Jurisdiction concurred that Russian procedural law was       violated in the way that Trevor Reed's bail was revoked;        Whereas the United States Embassy in Moscow has filed       complaints with the Russian Foreign Ministry regarding denial       of communications with Trevor Reed;        Whereas during the trial, the defense counsel presented 59       minutes of traffic camera video from four traffic cameras,       and senior Russian Government officials analyzed the video       recordings and confirmed that the videos showed the police       car--        (1) did not change direction or leave its lane;        (2) did not swerve; and        (3) did not stop or slow down;        Whereas witnesses following directly behind the police car       in a private vehicle never witnessed any dangerous movement       of the police car;        Whereas the two police officers changed their testimonies       in writing, in their interviews, and at least three times       during defense questioning, with final answers to the judge       being ``I don't remember.'', causing court attendees and the       judge to laugh;        Whereas the Investigative Bureau and Golovinsky District       Court Judge Arnout denied Trevor Reed's requests to       investigate how his injuries occurred;        Whereas, on July 30, 2020, Golovinsky District Court Judge       Arnout read a verdict that dismissed all defense evidence,       witnesses, and government experts and only considered pieces       of the police officers' statements;        Whereas the judge sentenced Trevor Reed to 9 years in       prison camp and was ordered to pay 100,000 rubles to each       police officer for moral and physical injuries;        Whereas Trevor Reed had already been detained in Russia for       one year at the time of the judge's verdict;        Whereas a Consul representing the United States Embassy in       Moscow attended all of Trevor Reed's trial hearings;        Whereas the United States Ambassador to Russia, John       Sullivan, upon Trevor's sentencing, stated that the       prosecution's case and the evidence presented against Mr.       Reed were ``so preposterous that they provoked laughter in       the courtroom'', the conviction and sentence were       ``ridiculous'', and ``justice was not even considered'';        Whereas, upon appeal to the Moscow City Court, the       Golovinsky District Court failed to provide Trevor Reed with       translated copies of the court's decision and trial       transcripts per law; and        Whereas the appeal court returned the case to the       Golovinsky District Court to review omissions and incorrect       statements in the trial transcripts, and the official court       audio recordings were reviewed by the defense and the       corrections were certified by a third-party notarization       firm, with the result being Judge Arnout refusing to include       any corrections to the corrupted transcripts: Now, therefore,       be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to       immediately release Trevor Reed and all other prisoners       arrested for political motivations;        (2) condemns the practice of politically motivated       imprisonment in the Russian Federation, which violates the       commitments of the Russian Federation to international       obligations with respect to human rights and the rule of law;        (3) urges the United States Government, in all its       interactions with the Government of the Russian Federation,       to raise the case of Trevor Reed and to press for his       release;        (4) expresses support for Trevor Reed, Paul Whelan, and all       prisoners unjustly imprisoned in the Russian Federation;        (5) urges the Government of the Russian Federation to       provide unrestricted consular access to Trevor Reed while he       remains in detention;        (6) until Trevor Reed's release, calls on the Government of       the Russian Federation--        (A) to provide Trevor Reed any necessary medical treatment       and personal protective equipment;        (B) to notify the United States Ambassador to Russia of any       medical problems or complaints that arise during his       detention; and        (C) to provide the United States Embassy in Moscow with       full access to all of Trevor Reed's medical records;        (7) urges the Government of the Russian Federation to       respect Trevor Reed's universally recognized human rights;       and        (8) expresses support to the family of Trevor Reed and       commitment to bringing Trevor Reed home.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 186.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H. Res. 186,  introduced by Mr. Pfluger of Texas, calling for the release of Trevor  Reed.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bipartisan measure that we  have now, regrettably, had to move through the committee and the House  for two Congresses.   This is a good resolution that calls for the release of Trevor Reed  and condemns the deplorable treatment inflicted upon him throughout his  ordeal.   It is shameful that the Kremlin continues to make a mockery of the  principles of an independent judiciary, the rule of law, and due  process, holding innocent American hostages for nefarious political  purposes. Not even the judge on Trevor Reed's case could keep a  straight face when presented with the absurd case that the Russian  prosecutors brought to the table, yet the courts sentenced him to 9  years in prison anyway.   On top of the unimaginable suffering Trevor has already endured as a  result of his terrible conditions and refusal of the Russian  authorities to attend to his medical needs, Mr. Reed has been now  diagnosed with COVID-19.  [[Page H3179]]    Other Americans are also suffering these same injustices inflicted by  the Russian Government.   Paul Whelan, first arrested on baseless charges in December 2018,  remains unjustly imprisoned and is serving a 16-year sentence.   The imprisonment of American citizens in Russia for political  purposes, likely in an attempt to force the United States to release  convicted Russian criminals and Putin cronies in the United States, is  a despicable practice and an affront to human rights and the rule of  law everywhere.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that President Biden, in his meeting with  Vladimir Putin in Geneva, specifically demanded the release of Trevor  Reed and Paul Whelan; and I am pleased that we, in Congress, are  continuing to do the same with the consideration of this resolution.   The Kremlin must release Trevor Reed, Paul Whelan, and all others  wrongfully detained in Russia so that they may finally return to their  families. This is an important bill resolution. I support it, and I  urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the American families of those wrongfully detained by  Russia are waiting for decisive action. Congress needs to stand united  in support of Trevor Reed, Paul Whelan, and all those who have had to  suffer terrible conditions and treatment by the Kremlin.   This resolution introduced by Mr. Pfluger makes clear our resolute  condemnation of their imprisonment, demanding the release of the  American prisoners who are being used as pawns in the Kremlin's  political game. It is past time for Russia to release these political  prisoners and return them to their families.   Again, I thank Mr. Pfluger for introducing this legislation, and I  thank Ranking Member McCaul for working with us. I urge my colleagues  to vote in support of this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2471) to measure the progress of post-disaster recovery and  efforts to address corruption, governance, rule of law, and media  freedoms in Haiti, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:  [[Page H3180]]                                      H.R. 2471         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Haiti Development,       Accountability, and Institutional Transparency Initiative       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) On January 12, 2010, a massive earthquake struck near       the Haitian capital city of Port-au-Prince, leaving at least       220,000 people dead, including 103 United States citizens,       101 United Nations personnel, and nearly 18 percent of       Haiti's civil service, as well as 300,000 injured, 115,000       homes destroyed, and 1,500,000 Haitians displaced.        (2) The international community, led by the United States       and the United Nations, mounted an unprecedented humanitarian       response to the earthquake in Haiti. Through 2018, more than       8,000,000,000 has been disbursed by donors. Since the 2010       earthquake, the United States Government has disbursed more       than 4,000,000,000 in recovery and development funding.        (3) On October 4, 2016, Hurricane Matthew struck       southwestern Haiti on the Tiburon Peninsula, causing       widespread damage and flooding and leaving 1.4 million people       in need of immediate assistance. Recovery efforts continue       more than four years later.        (4) Prior to both the 2010 earthquake and 2016 hurricane,       Haiti registered among the lowest in socioeconomic indicators       and had the second highest rate of income disparity in the       world--conditions that have further complicated disaster       recovery and resilience efforts. As of November 2020,       4,400,000 people were in need of humanitarian assistance in       Haiti.        (5) Since 2018, tens of thousands of Haitians have       participated in popular demonstrations demanding       accountability over government manage-merit of Petrocaribe       resources. In early 2019, the Haitian superior court of       auditors released a series of reports implicating high-level       government officials in the misappropriation of funds.        (6) The United Nations Human Rights Office of the High       Commissioner and the Human Rights Service jointly found a 333       percent increase in human rights violations and abuses       against the rights of life and security in Haiti from July       2018 through December 2019. There were 131 violations in 2018       and 567 violations in 2019, including the shooting of at       least five Haitian journalists covering the protests.        (7) Leading members of civil society have faced attacks,       including Monferrier Dorval, a constitutional law expert and       president of the Port-au-Prince bar who was killed on August       28, 2020.        (8) On November 13, 2018, according to the Haitian National       Human Rights Defense Network, at least 71 people were killed       and 18 people were raped in the Port-au-Prince neighborhood       of La Saline.        (9) On December 10, 2020, the Department of the Treasury's       Office of Foreign Assets Control designated former Haitian       National Police officer Jimmy Cherizier, former Director       General of the Ministry of the Interior Fednel Monchery, and       former Departmental Delegate Joseph Pierre Richard Duplan       pursuant to the Global Magnitsky Executive Order for being       foreign persons responsible for or complicit in, or having       directly or indirectly engaged in, serious human rights abuse       for their connection to the La Saline massacre.        (10) Following the La Saline massacre, similar attacks have       occurred in Port-au-Prince neighborhoods, including the       November 2019 and August 2020 attacks on Bel Air, in which 24       people were killed and hundreds of families were displaced.        (11) Parliamentary elections scheduled for October 2019 did       not take place, and since January 13, 2020, President Jovenel       Moise has ruled by decree. The United States and       international community have urged President Moise to limit       the use of executive decrees during this period and have ex-      pressed concern over several decrees issued, including those       creating the National Intelligence Agency and appointing       three new judges to the Supreme Court outside of       constitutional procedures. Haitian civil society       organizations have denounced the president's use of decrees       as an attempt to consolidate power.        (12) Due to institutional weakness and other challenges       exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, Haiti's economy       contracted by an estimated 4 percent in 2020 and inflation       neared 20 percent. Although there has been no parliament in       place since January 2020, the Haitian Government approved a       budget on September 30, 2020. However, the delay prevented       the International Monetary Fund and other multilaterals from       disbursing millions in international assistance.        (13) In September 2020, President Moise bypassed the       Supreme Court to appoint a Provisional Electoral Council       (CEP) by executive decree Several civil society groups that       traditionally participate in Haiti's electoral councils       criticized the decision and have declined to be represented       in the CEP.        (14) The Moise administration lacks the credibility to       oversee a proposed constitutional referendum scheduled for       June 2021, which legal experts consider unconstitutional.        (15) There are concerns that, given the lack of democratic       checks and balances, the dispute over the credibility of the       electoral council, and the deteriorating security situation,       elections scheduled for September 2021 will not be free or       fair. Additionally, the security situation remains volatile       and on February 7, 2021, President Moise alleged that a coup       had been attempted against him leading to 23 arrests and the       forced retirement of three Supreme Court judges.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to support the       sustainable rebuilding and development of Haiti in a manner       that--        (1) recognizes Haitian independence, self-reliance,       sovereignty, democratic governance, and efficiency;        (2) promotes efforts that are led by and support the people       and Government of Haiti at all levels so that Haitians lead       the course of reconstruction and development of Haiti;        (3) builds the long-term capacity of the Government of       Haiti, civil society in Haiti, and the private sector to       foster economic opportunities in Haiti;        (4) fosters collaboration between the Haitian di-aspora in       the United States, including dual citizens of Haiti and the       United States, with the Haitian Government and the business       community in Haiti;        (5) supports anti-corruption efforts, promotes press       freedom, and addresses human rights concerns, including       through the enforcement of sanctions imposed in accordance       with the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act on       individuals implicated in human rights violations;        (6) respects and helps restore Haiti's natural resources,       as well as strengthens community-level resilience to       environmental and weather-related impacts;        (7) promotes the holding of free, fair, and timely       elections in accordance with democratic principles and the       Haitian Constitution;        (8) provides timely and comprehensive reporting on Haiti       and the United States Government's goals and progress, as       well as transparent post program evaluations and contracting       data;        (9) promotes the participation of Haitian women and youth       in governmental and nongovernmental institutions and in       economic development and governance assistance programs       funded by the United States; and        (10) does not provide support to facilitate the proposed       June 2021 constitutional referendum, including through       multilateral organizations.

DEFINITIONS.         In this Act the term ``appropriate congressional       committees'' means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       Appropriations of the House of Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Appropriations of the Senate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2471, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2471, the Haiti  Development, Accountability, and Institutional Transparency Initiative  Act.   I thank my friend, Mr. Jeffries, for authoring this bipartisan bill.  Mr. Jeffries has been a strong advocate for the Haitian people, and I  thank him for his friendship and leadership on this very important  issue.   On January 12, 2010, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti with an  epicenter just a few miles west of Port-au-Prince. This devastating  natural disaster killed more than 200,000 people, displaced 1.5 million  Haitians, and caused billions of dollars in damages.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today with the same message my colleagues  and I delivered to the Haitian people 11 years ago: The United States  remains steadfast in our commitment to help Haiti however we can.   Over the last decade, Congress has worked closely with the Haitian- American diaspora, the Haitian people, the Haitian Government to  support rebuilding and development efforts on the island.   Unfortunately, after Hurricane Matthew devastated Haiti in 2016, the  country faced another humanitarian crisis, and additional rebuilding  and development plans were needed.                                time  1615    Sadly, Haiti still has a long way to go. The Haiti Development,  Accountability, and Institutional Transparency Initiative Act evaluates  the effectiveness of U.S. recovery and development efforts in Haiti  over the past 10 years and devises strategies to promote the rule of  law, encourage freedom of the press, combat government corruption,  address the root causes of poverty, and improve development efforts.   Helping to pave the pathway to a reconstructed, prosperous Haiti, of  course, is a two-way street. We must learn from our mistakes over the  past 10 years and devise innovative solutions for any roadblocks that  lie ahead.   At the same time, it is imperative that the Haitian Government  address the growing and legitimate concerns about the country's  deteriorating human rights situation, spiraling gang violence, and  often-seen impunity for corrupt officials.  [[Page H3182]]    It is the duty of all of us here in Congress to stand with the  Haitian people as they demand a safe, prosperous, and democratic Haiti.  I urge the Haitian Government to do all they can to engage with their  citizens and truly listen to their concerns.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House Foreign Affairs Committee  passed this bipartisan bill unanimously, and I urge my colleagues to  join me in supporting its passage on the House floor today.   Again, I thank my real friend, Mr. Jeffries, for being such a great  champion for Haiti. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Jacobs), a valued member of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is true that Haiti continues to face significant  challenges. Yet, I remain optimistic that we can partner with the  Haitian people and play a constructive role in the coming critical  years of Haiti's recovery. And while we must continue our unwavering  support for Haiti, we also must be open to making adjustments moving  forward.   By increasing cooperation and being open to new ideas, I am confident  that we can support the Haitian people as they seek peace, stability,  an end to poverty, and a fully functioning democracy.   We know this is not going to be easy, but we have to stand by the  Haitian people and make sure that they have an opportunity to have a  better tomorrow, for surely, they deserve it.    Mr. Speaker, let me finally thank, again, Representative Jeffries for  authoring this piece of legislation. It is very important, and I know  that he has a large portion of the Haitian diaspora in his district, as  it is in New York in mine and Representative Clarke's and, of course,  in Florida.   We will stand by the Haitian people, not giving up hope, not giving  up trust, imploring the Government of Haiti to do the right thing for  the people of Haiti by having elections that are free and fair.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1500) to direct the Administrator of the United States Agency for  International Development to submit to Congress a report on the impact  of the COVID-19 pandemic on global basic education programs, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1500         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Global Learning Loss       Assessment Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Before the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (commonly referred       to as ``COVID-19'') pandemic began, 258,000,000 children were       out of school globally, including 130,000,000 girls.        (2) Students already at a disadvantage before COVID-19 will       experience greater learning loss, thereby worsening inequity       and inequality.        (3) Approximately 90 percent of the world's student       population--over 1,600,000,000 children and youth--have had       their education disrupted by school closure due to COVID-19.        (4) School closures lead to interrupted learning, poor       nutrition, gaps in childcare, increased dropout rates,       exposure to violence, and social isolation.        (5) Up to 24,000,000 children are at risk of dropping out       of school permanently due to rising levels of child poverty       associated with the pandemic.        (6) School closure and remote learning is especially       burdensome on girls, who are frequently expected to shoulder       more household chores and responsibilities and are more       vulnerable to gender-based violence.        (7) During the Ebola epidemic, nationwide school closures       in Sierra Leone in 2014 led to increased instances of sexual-       and gender-based violence, teenage pregnancy, school dropout,       and child labor for girls.        (8) More than 60 percent of national distance learning       alternatives rely exclusively on online platforms but two-      thirds of the world's school aged children, or 1,300,000,000       children aged 3 through 17, do not have internet connection       in their homes, and schools and local learning centers also       frequently have inadequate internet connectivity. Eighty       percent of students in sub-Saharan Africa lack such access,       with an even higher rate for girls.        (9) Children and youth with disabilities are particularly       vulnerable to the health, education, and socioeconomic       consequences of the pandemic. As a further challenge,       distance learning tools are not always accessible to learners       with disabilities or those with complex learning needs,       especially in poorer and rural households.        (10) Before the COVID-19 pandemic, refugee children were       twice as likely to be out of school as other youth, and       school closures and a lack of access to distance learning       tools threaten to make the education gap among refugee       children even more severe.        (11) The economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic       could lead to an education financing gap of $77,000,000,000       in low- and middle-income countries over the next 2 years.        (12) The economic cost of school closures could be up to       $1,337 per student, which on a global scale equates to       approximately $10,000,000,000,000 in lost economic output       over the coming generation.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States that United States-      funded basic education programs operating in low- and middle-      income countries should seek to--        (1) provide inclusive learning opportunities for students       and teachers, especially for the most marginalized, including       girls, children with disabilities, and previously out of       school children;        (2) build local capacity and help countries strengthen       their education systems, including opportunities for early       childhood development;        (3) improve the availability, delivery, and quality of       education services from early childhood through secondary       education;        (4) improve equity and safety in education services; and        (5) support the return of children to school who have       experienced interruptions in their education due to the       COVID-19 pandemic and work to enroll previously out-of-school       children and youth, particularly the most marginalized.       SEC. 4. REPORT.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the United       States Agency for International Development, acting through       the Senior Coordinator for International Basic Education       Assistance and in consultation with the Senior Coordinator       for Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment, shall submit to       the appropriate congressional committees a report on the       impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on United States Agency for       International Development basic education programs.        (b) Matters to Be Included.--The report required under       subsection (a) shall include, at a minimum, the following       elements:        (1) An assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on such basic       education programs, including the magnitude of learning loss       that will result from protracted school closures and the       specific effects of school and learning space closures on       marginalized children and youth, including girls, minority       populations, displaced children, and those with disabilities.        (2) An assessment comparing academic outcomes of       beneficiaries of United States Agency for International       Development basic education programs, as practical and       appropriate, between those that attend schools that remain       closed or continue to operate remotely since the start of the       COVID-19 pandemic and schools that have resumed in-person       instruction.        (3) A description of the effectiveness, cost,       accessibility, and reach of the most commonly used forms of       distance learning in low- and middle-income countries and       low-resource contexts.        (4) A description of efforts to pivot and adapt such basic       education programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, including an       overview of existing data on funding and programmatic focus       disaggregated by gender, country, education level, and       disability.        (5) An identification and description of any gaps in, or       barriers to, reaching and educating marginalized populations,       such as girls, children with disabilities, displaced       children, or other children adversely affected by the COVID-      19 pandemic with distance learning interventions.        (6) A description of the United States Agency for       International Development's plan and needed authorities and       resources to prevent degradation of such basic education       programs and to support, as necessary and appropriate,       continued distance learning interventions, safe school       reopenings, assessments of student learning levels, remedial       and accelerated learning, re-enrollment campaigns for out-of-      school children and youth, and education system strengthening       and resilience-building efforts.        (7) An analysis of the coordination between the United       States Agency for International Development and other actors       in global basic education policy and programming to provide       education during the COVID-19 pandemic, including partner       organizations, faith based-organizations, donors, and       multilateral organizations.        (8) A description of opportunities to partner and support       efforts to expand access to digital infrastructure, internet       connectivity, and learning resources in areas that lack       access to digital and remote learning infrastructure and       resources, including rural and remote communities.        (c) Public Availability.--The report required by subsection       (a) shall be made available to the public.        (d) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       Appropriations of the House of Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Appropriations of the Senate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1500, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1500, the Global  Learning Loss Assessment Act of 2021.   I thank Representative Houlahan for authoring this bipartisan bill  and for her leadership and strong advocacy for children and education  around the world.   Over the past year and a half, we have seen everyday lives disrupted  in unimaginable ways due to COVID-19. One of the biggest disruptions  has been in the realm of education. From primary school to graduate  school, students around the world have seen their education  interrupted, challenged, adapted, and forever changed by this pandemic.   The United States has long supported basic education efforts around  the world, with its most recent champion, former Congresswoman Nita  Lowey, being an invaluable advocate. It is therefore crucial that the  United States understand the effects of COVID-19 on international basic  education programs and use that data to respond to current crises and  better prepare for future pandemics.   Research has already shown that every day and every year in school  counts. Women earn up to 12 percent more for every additional year they  stay in school. However, UNESCO estimates that as many as 11 million--I  repeat, 11 million--girls won't return to school after COVID, which  increased their risk of forced labor, early marriage, and limiting  their professional and economic opportunities.   This bill requires the United States Agency for International  Development to submit a report to Congress on the impacts of COVID-19  on USAID's basic education programs and global learning loss, including  the magnitude of global learning loss that will result from protracted  school closures, descriptions of forms of distance learning in low  resource contexts, analysis of how school closures affected  marginalized children, data on Agency programs being carried out to  support continued learning during the pandemic, and a description of  what is needed to help mitigate learning loss and help students get  back on the right track.   Again, I thank Representative Houlahan for her work on this bill and  her commitment to ensuring that we are fully aware of how COVID-19 has  placed development gains at risk and to finding the best path forward  to prevent further backsliding.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan), a valued member of the House Foreign  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Education is recognized as the surest path to economic mobility.  However, over the past year and a half, the COVID-19 pandemic has  rattled educational systems across the world, presented challenges  unlike anything we have seen in the last 100 years since we had the  last global pandemic, and it jeopardizes access to education for  students around the world.   While some students and educators quickly adapted and overcame these  challenges, the widespread disruptions caused by the pandemic will  invariably have lasting impacts on communities at home and abroad. The  Global Learning Loss Assessment Act of 2021 will allow us to better  understand the effect the pandemic has had on global learning, and also  find ways to help get students back on the path to continued learning  and future success.   I know from my home city that the lack of availability of educational  school buildings and lack of dialogue and conversations with other  students in the classroom has hurt them. We need to evaluate and make  sure what needs to be done so they can make up that time and continue  the path to success because our Nation here in the United States and in  the countries around the world are dependent upon it so that we can  have a better tomorrow.   That is why I thank Ms. Houlahan for her bill, along with Mr.  Fitzpatrick, working with the minority, Ranking Member McCaul, coming  together because we understand the significance and importance of  education. I hope all of my colleagues will join in supporting this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  resolution (H. Res. 402) urging the Administration to facilitate  assistance in response to the devastating impact of COVID-19 in India,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 402         Whereas in March 2021, a second wave of Coronavirus Disease       2019 (commonly referred to as ``COVID-19'') infectious began       to surge in India, overwhelming health care workers,       hospitals, and crematoriums throughout the country;        Whereas testing results indicate India is seeing more than       340,000 new daily infections and upward of 4,000 deaths a       day, though public health experts believe case rates are       higher;        Whereas cases have surged in neighboring countries such as       Nepal and other countries in the area remain highly       vulnerable to renewed spikes in cases;        Whereas the deadly COVID-19 outbreak in India is a global       problem that requires a coordinated global response;        Whereas in the spring of 2020, when the United States was       in the midst of a devastating spike in COVID-19 cases, India       lifted its export ban on certain therapeutics in response to       a request by the United States Government;        Whereas India's pharmaceutical industry is a vital part of       the global solution to the pandemic, especially for much of       Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and is the world's biggest       producer of COVID vaccines having exported 66.36 million       doses to 93 countries, including to United Nations personnel       and, accounting for over half of global vaccine       manufacturing;        Whereas due to India's critical importance in global       vaccine supply chains, an increase in domestic vaccine demand       as a result of the surge of COVID-19 cases within India is of       global concern;        Whereas in response to the crisis in India, the Biden       administration took quick action to deliver urgently needed       supplies to India, including oxygen support, oxygen       concentrators, personal protective equipment (PPE), raw       materials for vaccine, rapid diagnostic tests, and       therapeutics, and is a testament to the historic record of       United States-India health cooperation dating more than seven       decades;        Whereas the United States private sector has worked to       generously support relief efforts in India including by       working to deliver 1,000 ventilators and 25,000 oxygen       concentrators to health care facilities across India;        Whereas many countries around the world have also sent       medical assistance to India to help the country defeat this       devastating wave of the COVID-19 pandemic;        Whereas as the United States vaccine supply for the       American people is secured, it is important for the United       States to continue to ramp up its efforts, working with the       private sector and all possible partners, to expand vaccine       manufacturing and distribution worldwide; and        Whereas United States support for India to help beat back       this latest coronavirus wave is in the United States national       interest as the pandemic will not end anywhere until it ends       everywhere: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) urges the Administration to facilitate private, in-kind       medical supply donations to India and deliver additional,       urgently needed medical supplies, including oxygen generator       plants and a cryogenic oxygen tanker and containers;        (2) urges the Administration to facilitate assistance as       needed to neighboring countries, including Nepal, that are       facing the spread of COVID-19 and working with partners       around the world to address the virus; and        (3) calls on the United States private sector and the       Indian-American community to continue their unprecedented and       generous efforts at procuring medical supplies for the Indian       response during this time of need, building upon       contributions to date, standing with the people of India as       they collectively work to stem the spread of COVID-19.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 402, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 402, urging the  administration to facilitate assistance in response to the devastating  impact of COVID-19 in India.   This resolution, introduced by my good friend Representative Sherman,  is an excellent measure that solidifies this body's already strong,  bipartisan support for the people of India as they recover from this  most recent wave of COVID-19 infections.   It urges the administration to continue facilitating much-needed  assistance. We are all saddened by the devastating impact COVID-19 has  had on the Indian people. Beginning in March 2021, India started to  experience a surge of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Indians from all  backgrounds, young and old, urban and rural have been touched by this  pandemic.   With infections rising at an alarming rate, the healthcare system  struggled to provide care to all of those infected, and medical supply  shortages were reported across the country.   Harrowing images depicted the devastation that COVID-19 caused, from  family members looking for hospital beds and medical supplies, to  funeral pyres burning nonstop, 24 hours a day, to ensure the last rites  of the many people who have passed.   I am pleased with the Biden administration's swift response, sending  much-  [[Page H3186]]  needed medical supplies to India. It was not just the American  Government that contributed. We witnessed many in the Indian-American  community and the United States private sector rally support to get  critical supplies to India.   We now see COVID-19 cases starting to come down, but we cannot let  our guard down. We must do more to prepare for a potential new wave of  infections. It is important to recognize that none of us will be safe  until all of us are safe.   The pandemic continues to highlight the important role of India in  combating this disease globally. Its role in the global medical  manufacturing supply chain is critical to defeating this pandemic. The  global community relies on Indian pharmaceutical and vaccine  manufacturing capability. What happens in India also has spillover  effects in neighboring countries like Nepal.   Again, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman) for  putting forth this resolution, and I ask my colleagues to vote in favor  of it and stand in solidarity with the people of India.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman), a very valued member of the  House Foreign Affairs Committee, my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again, I want to thank Mr. Sherman and Mr. Chabot for showing how  this committee has worked in a bipartisan manner for the benefit of our  friends and allies and, in this case, India.   By passing this good, bipartisan resolution, the House will send a  clear message that we stand with the people of India as they work to  contain the spread of COVID-19. We recognize that India will continue  to play an important role in containing the further global spread of  COVID-19, and support global efforts to end this pandemic.   We also urge the administration to continue working with the Indian  Government. Just yesterday, I was at the  [[Page H3187]]  Indian consulate in New York, where I had an opportunity to talk to the  consul general, who was very appreciative knowing that this bill would  be on the House floor today; who told me to extend thank-yous to both  Mr. Sherman and Mr. Chabot; that it further shows American leadership  and friendship with the people of India; and that we would only grow  closer together to benefit not just our respective countries, but the  rest of the world.   This moves and helps the people in India. So I would like to conclude  by just thanking everyone, once again, for working together in a  bipartisan way to do the right thing for our friends from the country  of India.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
