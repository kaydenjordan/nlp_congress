 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last Thursday, I spoke about the pain  and disruption this pandemic has caused this past year. I also  discussed the optimistic springtime that lies before us. The brighter  horizon is not a product of a partisan bill that was signed last week  or an administration that was sworn in less than 2 months ago; it was  built by the American people and supported by the five historic and  completely bipartisan bills that Congress passed just last year.   Later on Thursday, the Nation heard remarks from President Biden. The  President spoke in a heartfelt way about grief and loss, but his vision  for the days ahead was badly lacking. Along a number of crucial  dimensions, the Biden administration keeps trying to rewrite recent  history and overrule science.   Let's take vaccinations. The President's speech tried to reinforce  the myth that his administration inherited a shambles on vaccines, set  goals that nobody believed were achievable, and has met those goals  against all odds. This is just not true.   The President said:         I set a goal that many of you said was . . . way over the       top.    But the benchmark of 100 million vaccines in 100 days was not some  audacious goal that was met with great skepticism. A million shots per  day was just the pace that the Biden administration actually inherited.  We averaged more than 1 million shots per day the week of the  inauguration. We totaled more than 1.5 million the day the President  was sworn in.   The groundwork we laid last year is proving a historic success. Where  the  [[Page S1511]]  Biden administration is continuing to help streamline distribution,  they should, of course, get some credit, but their effort to sprint to  the front of this yearlong campaign should not fool anybody.   The President announced another supposedly audacious goal on  Thursday: that all adults in all 50 States should be eligible to  schedule vaccinations by May 1. Here is the problem: Dr. Fauci said a  month ago we would be there by April.         I would imagine by the time we get to April, that will be       what I would call . . . `'open season'' . . . namely,       virtually everybody and anybody in any category could start       to get vaccinated.    That was Dr. Fauci's prediction last month. So the President's  announcement of May 1 wasn't ambitious good news; it was actually a  walk-back.   Something tells me that if the last administration had contradicted  Dr. Fauci and pushed the vaccine milestone back a whole month, we might  have heard about it from the media.   Then there is the K-12 schooling. For months, science has confirmed  that schools are remarkably safe and do not surge transmission of the  virus. This administration's own experts amplified this before liberal  politics got in the way.   In early February, President Biden's CDC Director specifically said  vaccinating the grownups who work in schools should not be a  prerequisite for reopening them, but on Thursday, instead of calling  for schools to reopen right now, the President endorsed Big Labor's  moving goalposts. He said that because the Democrats passed their  spending plan and because he has tried to move teachers toward the  front of the line for vaccines, now--now--schools can move toward  reopening. This approach has put liberal interest group politics ahead  of vulnerable kids and their parents.   It was reported last week that the following message was posted in a  private online group for members of one public school union in  California.         Friendly reminder: If you are planning any trips for Spring       Break, please keep that off of social media. It is hard to       argue that it is unsafe for in-person instruction if parents       and the public see vacation photos and international travel.    Further reports from California suggest some local governments may  consider using some of the massive bailouts that Democrats sent them on  bonuses. Reportedly, one union argues that grownups should get bonuses  for things like ``an airplane trip to Hawaii when this is all over.'' A  lot of working-class families in the country are struggling through  untenable situations--in large part thanks to the liberal dogma that  schools have needed lots more cash to become safe--and now unions are  talking about trips to Hawaii?   Every day that the Biden administration does not urge schools to  reopen safely right now with simple precautions, it hurts kids who  cannot afford these moving goalposts.   President Biden also made news with the big proclamation that maybe-- maybe--if citizens behave themselves, we will be able to have small  outdoor gatherings by July 4. He made sure to stipulate that  politicians reserve the right to clamp down again, however, but that  carrot dangled before Americans was small outdoor gatherings about 4  months from now. This was bizarre and problematic on several levels.   No. 1, let's be clear: The Federal Government does not instruct free  citizens how they may gather in small groups with their own families. I  have advocated strongly for following science, wearing masks, and  taking all the precautions throughout this pandemic. The White House  confers a bully pulpit. It does not confer supreme authority over daily  life.   Let's not forget that about 10 months ago, many liberal politicians  applauded massive outdoor gatherings because they supported a political  cause. I am not sure how much capital these officials have to  micromanage backyard barbecues.   No. 2, this strange proclamation was out of step with science.  Current CDC guidelines say it is already safe right now--right now--for  fully vaccinated people to meet in small groups, not just outdoors but  indoors, and they can be joined by an unvaccinated household if they  are low risk. That is the CDC's advice, talking not about July 4 but  right now. Right now   So the President went on national TV to move the goalposts way beyond  what his own CDC is saying. Why? There is no science-based reason why a  few fully vaccinated people couldn't get together outdoors right now-- not July 4; today. And if a healthy young adult who is still waiting  for the vaccine wants to meet up with a few vaccinated relatives, that  is about a personal assessment of a very small risk, not a matter of  Presidential policy.   That brings me to point three. The President's proclamation was far  out of step with what is already happening across the country. It was  advice for an alternate universe. The President and his advisers may  need to get out more. Americans are already getting together in small  groups outdoors in blue States and red States, in small towns and big  cities. The country is not locked down waiting for July 4.   In my home State of Kentucky, the Governor has backed indoor  gatherings of up to eight people from up to two households. Here in the  District of Columbia, as of next week, outdoor gatherings of up to 50  people will be permitted--50 people here in the District.   Americans are getting vaccines. They have learned about this disease.  They have learned about the low risks of outdoor transmission. They are  making their own determinations as free people.   Look, I have been a consistent advocate for following the science,  wearing a mask, and taking precautions. I believe we should all keep  following the science. Nobody wants to fumble the ball on the 5-yard  line. But that doesn't mean just citizens; it means politicians too.  And science doesn't only run in the direction of more restrictions.   The American people were told 12 months ago that accepting major  disruptions for a limited time would flatten the curve and prevent a  healthcare collapse, and Americans rose to the occasion.   One year on, if the President and his administration want to continue  to give advice to free citizens, I suggest they exit the alternate  universe, stick to the actual science, and get acquainted with where  the American people actually are.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
