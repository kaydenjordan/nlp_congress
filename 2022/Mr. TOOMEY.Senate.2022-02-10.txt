 Mr. President, I just feel the need to just make a simple  point, although it should be obvious. But let me just state to be clear  that what we are witnessing in the Russian buildup at the Ukrainian  border has nothing to do with Russian security. There is no Russian  security interests at stake here. There is no threat to Russian  security. Ukrainians could not mount a credible attack on Russia if  they wanted to, and they don't want to. What this is all about entirely  is an authoritarian leader of Russia who wants to reestablish hegemony  over the states of the former Soviet Union. He wants to reestablish the  Russian Empire. It has nothing do with any legitimate concerns that  Russia has.   I strongly feel that if he makes the outrageous mistake of invading  Ukraine, that we will use the many very, very powerful tools at our  disposal to ensure that he regrets that decision.
