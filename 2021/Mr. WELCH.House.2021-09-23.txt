 Mr. Speaker, the question before this Congress will be  whether we do our duty and raise the debt ceiling. The question of the  debt ceiling is not about authorizing new spending. It is about paying  our bills, and it is no different than if a family decided it was sick  of paying the mortgage and stiffed the bank. Enormous collateral damage  occurs to our economy and to our reputation.   What is so dangerous about what is starting to happen in this  Congress is that one side is embracing tactics, shutting down  government, defaulting on our debt, that have the likelihood of  collateral damage to our reputation, our economy, to our jobs and our  prosperity. These tactics, shutting down government, defaulting on  paying our bills, much of which have been run up by the Trump  administration, must be renounced.   Raise the debt ceiling. Pay our bills. Do our duty.                            ____________________
