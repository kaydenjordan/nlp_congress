 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, tragically, beloved South  Carolinian, Stanley L. Myers, passed away last Wednesday. As a founding  partner of what is now Moore Bradley Myers, I especially appreciated  his service and his remarkable life. I also want to express sympathy to  his family and his senior law partner, Jake Moore, who correctly  recognized him as a son.   His obituary: Moore Bradley Myers partner, Stanley Myers, died at age  47. MBM managing partner Christian Spradley asked that the community  members turn their attention to praying for Stanley's wife, Tashia, and  their two young children.   As a Citadel alumnus and 4-year starting quarterback for the  Bulldogs, Myers was elected to the Citadel Board of Visitors. He also  served on the Lexington Medical Center Board of Directors and founded  the Swansea Mentoring Program.   Every Christmas, Stanley proudly hosted the town of Swansea's Bike  Bonanza. Myers opened Countryside BBQ restaurant in Swansea in 2022.  His service and spirit of giving back to the community was  unparalleled.   As an attorney, Myers was selected as a 2023 Leadership in Law  honoree by the South Carolina Lawyers Weekly. Myers deployed as a  captain with the 218th Infantry Brigade to Afghanistan in support of  Operation Enduring Freedom. He was a lieutenant colonel who served as  the Staff Judge Advocate for the 59th Troop Command at McEntire Joint  National Guard Base.   Stanley Myers passed away unexpectedly on September 27, 2023.   May God bless his memory.                            ____________________
