 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 4, the FAA  Reauthorization Act of 2018.   I am pleased to be here today with the chairman of the full  committee, Mr. Shuster; the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. LoBiondo;  and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen), the ranking member.   This bill also includes important provisions of the Disaster Recovery  Reform Act, something that previously passed the House and somehow  escaped the attention of the Senate. We are sending it to them again in  the hope they might notice if it is part of this package.   Last week was tragic: the first death on a U.S.-flagged passenger  aircraft since 2009, and that just followed an alarming news story by  ``60 Minutes'' a few days before about an FAA oversight of a low-cost  carrier.   As a result, Ranking Member Larsen and I have sent a letter to the  Secretary of Transportation demanding information on the oversight of  the industry. We want to make sure that the FAA is being the watchdog  that they need to be.   It was many years ago, after the horrible ValuJet tragedy, the  committee had already rejected my amendment to say to strip away the  promotional duty of the FAA. Then, after the horrible ValuJet crash,  when it turned out it was an incompetent subcontractor to a maintenance  station, a totally preventable accident, they suddenly decided to  change their mind and decided to include my amendment and remove the  promotional authority.   The FAA's principal duty is to protect the safety of the flying  public, so we have got to be sure they are doing everything needed to  do that.   There is an important provision in the bill, long overdue, to give  flight attendants a 10-hour minimum rest. Think of the schedule now--8  hours: Oh, well, the plane landed. You have got to get off the plane.  You have got to get out of the airport. You have got to get in a cab or  a van. You have got to go to the hotel. You get to return, reverse all  that around, and do that.   How much sleep are you going to get?   So, finally, we are going to get the 10-hour requirement--again, long  overdue. Flight attendants are critical safety personnel on the  airplane. They cannot be fatigued, just like a pilot can't be fatigued.   I have another concern that we are using computer simulations to meet  the FAA standard for evacuation of a plane mandated in 90 seconds. As  they jam more and more and more seats into these planes, I wonder if we  have reached a point where we can no longer meet that standard, and we  are going to have that. We are going to have the inspector general look  at that topic and see whether or not we need to revisit it.   You know, it is critical that we be able to get people off as quickly  as possible. The U.K. Civil Aviation Authority led this many years ago  after the Manchester accident, with the spacing for the over-wing exit,  something that took me 7 years to get done here. But they have also  dropped in more strictures on hand baggage and other things and made  that part of the briefing, which we don't get because we don't want to  scare people. Well, we need to be letting people know that they can't  take stuff with them if they have to evacuate quickly.   The FAA certification process, we have known for years, it needs  reform, and this bill answers that call. It mandates a top-to-bottom  reform of the process by which the FAA certifies new airplane engine  and component designs. This will help our manufacturers become much  more competitive in the world market and introduce their products more  quickly to stay ahead of the market, but they will still be certified  safe.   The bill also contains the text of the Flags of Convenience Don't Fly  Here Act. There are some who would turn the airline industry into the  cruise line industry, where planes would be crewed by the cheapest  labor you can find somewhere in the world. It is being done already  with contract crews out of Asia for a so-called European airline,  Norwegian Air, and they are circumventing the process that the EU is  bound to under our Open Skies Agreement.   The bill, unfortunately, lets stand something that Congress adopted  in 2012, over my objections, which is to  [[Page H3593]]  say we cannot have a higher standard than the International Civil  Aviation Authority on lithium batteries.   Lithium batteries are incredibly, incredibly dangerous on aircraft.  We have already lost two 747s, and I will discuss this more when we get  to my amendment.   It is time to remove the prohibition and let the FAA regulate as they  see fit regarding lithium batteries and not bind ourselves to an  international group that is captive of other special interests. Just  eight lithium batteries can take down an aircraft in a thermal runaway.  So that, we will discuss later.   This bill also, unfortunately, does not increase the cap on passenger  facility charge. I would observe, flying a lot, that there are more and  more and more tarmac delays because: I am sorry, your gate is occupied.  Oh, the alley to the gate is full of planes. Oh, this, that.   A lot of airports are bonded out. We haven't allowed them, since  2000, to increase the passenger facility charge, and so we are going to  continue to have those delays. Until they can build larger terminals  and they can build more gates, that is going to continue.   We are also putting in some new mandates on the airports, which I  support in this bill, having to do with pets and changing rooms and  those sorts of things; but, again, we are not allowing them to get any  increase in revenues to meet these new Federal mandates. I haven't  given that up, but, obviously, we are not going to get it in this bill.   You know, NextGen will be all for naught. NextGen is progressing  well, despite what some say, but if we don't have enough terminals and  gates at those terminals, as the former Administrator Randy Babbitt  said:         We can land them with closer spacing, we can do everything       in the world, but at the end of the day at La Guardia Airport       when it is a one-runway operation, you can still only land       them once every 54 seconds.    There are physical limits on the ground all around the country. Even  if we enhance air traffic movement, avoiding weather and all that, we  are going to be constrained at the airports unless the airports have  what they need to make these investments.   There are a number of amendments that will improve safety and  efficiency, and I look forward to discussing those here on the floor.                                time  1245    There is one amendment which is cropping up in this bill that relates  to trucking. The gentleman from California (Mr. Denham) will offer it.  It has been offered before in the House. It has never gone anywhere in  the Senate. I predict the same thing will happen here.   The bottom line is there is an issue from a court case that could be  solved with a rifle shot, so to speak, regarding interstate commerce.  Instead, despite what the proponents have told Representative Denham  and others, this language would preempt every single State wage and  hour law that pertains to trucking in the United States of America. The  only strictures would be the Federal hours of service and the Federal  minimum wage. The rest would be wiped out by this amendment because of  the unfortunate language. There is a real underlying problem, and it  could be solved much more discretely.   But beyond that, this is a great bill.   I again thank the chairmen of the full committee and subcommittee,  the ranking member, and other members of the committee.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.  [[Page H3598]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I certainly support the amendment offered  by the gentleman. He listed a number of provisions. I don't want to be  repetitive, but I think the call to action regarding uncontained  airliner engine failures is critical. That is actually the second  uncontained failure of that engine with Southwest Airlines in 18  months, which means that somewhere turbine blades are not a life- limited part. There is something amiss in the manufacturing process,  and we need to get to the bottom of that.   We also need to be sure that the proper testing is being done to  ensure their integrity as the planes continue to fly.   It also has some language regarding incidents of sexual misconduct on  flights I support, but I am preparing and will offer a broader stand- alone provision bill on that subject in the near future.   It modestly increases funding levels for aviation programs and  includes a $1 billion annual infusion from the general fund for certain  AIP projects, principally for small airports in rural communities.    This falls far short of meeting the needs of all airports and all the  gates and terminal work we need, as I mentioned earlier in discussing  the lack of a PFC in this bill.   Finally, it creates a newly named position in the FAA, that would be  chief technology officer. Currently, the department administrator acts  as the chief technology officer. So I am not quite certain what that  accomplishes, but I will certainly look forward to monitoring that  position and the progress and reports on NextGen that that person  produces in the near future.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Frankel), a member of the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I support the adoption of these amendments en bloc.  This grouping includes many Democratic and Republican amendments, and  each, as the chairman has said, has been approved by the majority and  the minority for consideration en bloc.   Among the amendments in this package is my comprehensive solution to  the ever-growing list of safety and security concerns that have  resulted from an unwise provision of law adopted in 2012.   That law prohibits the Federal Aviation Administration from  promulgating any rule or regulation relating to drones flown for hobby  or recreational purposes.   Let me repeat: any rule or regulation relating to drones flown for  hobby or recreational purposes.   This was put in at the behest of model aircraft folks, who have a  long  [[Page H3649]]  and very responsible history, know the rules of the road in the air,  but now there are millions of other people now operating relatively  inexpensive drones. Things have changed pretty dramatically in that  time period, and we sorely need some reasonable regulations.   There are very strong national security concerns expressed by  Homeland and Secret Service and others, and they are saying that  basically they are going to hold back any rules regarding drones until  they can be assured that the operators and the drone can be identified,  which the commercial people can easily do.                                time  1345    It would be an expense for the recreational manufacturers so there is  a competing amendment that is more conciliatory toward the Chinese  drone manufacturers, which is a concern I don't have.   Sooner or later, one of these little toy drones is going to take down  an aircraft and people are going to die. Plain and simple. They have  already conducted tests on the hull, and they have found that a small  quadcopter can cause fatal damage to aircraft controls. And they  haven't even done the ingestion test yet into a jet engine, a turbine  engine, where you will see more uncontained failures like the one we  saw last week.   So it is critical that we get a handle on this and the proliferation  of these with people with little or no experience or knowledge of  aviation rules. Countless stakeholders are supporting my version, which  would be the commercial drone industry, U.S. airlines and pilots, air  traffic controllers, aircraft manufacturers, State and local entities.   They have all been asking for modification or repeal of that  provision prohibiting the FAA from regulating recreational drone users.  Until this is done, our skies will be less safe and the true potential  of the commercial drone industry will never be unlocked because of the  security concerns that I already mentioned.   My amendment, among other things, grants the FAA the authority to  impose standards on recreational users as needed, ensure the safety of  our airspace system going forward, including requirements remotely  identifying and tracking drone operators. That first step is critical  to protecting sensitive facilities, assets, and addressing the concerns  of Homeland Security, Secret Service, and others.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of this amendment en bloc, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Lipinski), a member of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining on each side.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal).  [[Page H3650]]         Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Crist).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Kilmer), my neighbor to the north.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am in favor of it.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment.   I actually, recently, had a conversation with the Acting FAA  Administrator on this very subject. I think it is something that could  help mitigate. Since we have moved to performance-based navigation and  changed for more efficient approaches to safe fuel, the airlines are  benefiting tremendously, but it has concentrated the noise over a  narrow area.   I have also asked the FAA if it would be possible to vary the  approaches on performance-based so that you are not always, every day,  every hour, every minute, going over exactly the same position. I think  that is also something they should look at.   Mr. Chairman, I certainly support this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, although I rose in opposition, my  principal concern is this was a very, very long, difficult negotiation  as we adopted the FAST Act, and all parties agreed on these five pilot  projects.   We gave the task, as we normally do, to the Department of  Transportation to draw up a rule that will establish and implement the  pilot program, but DOT has not yet acted to establish those rules. So I  have concerns about putting strictures on the Department of  Transportation before they have had an opportunity to implement the  rule, which, hopefully, will be soon forthcoming. I assume it is not  one of these rules that the President has held up from being issued,  since it would be something beneficial, if properly done.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis.)    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. O'Halleran).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time.   We have already heard a lot today about noise complaints, and State 2  are very noisy aircraft. They were phased out of revenue service about  15 years ago. They are noisy. They consume more fuel. And I am not  quite certain what uses these five or so airports might have and what  this pilot program would look like. So I have a number of concerns  about the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 42.    Mr. Chairman, years ago, people used to refer to the  tombstone mentality at the FAA, with a lack of oversight where fatal  accidents happened, loss of rudder control and other things like that  that could have been prevented with proper maintenance. We have moved  beyond that point to a much more engaged and active FAA, except  Congress has imposed a tombstone mentality on the FAA.   At the behest of Chinese battery manufacturers and large firms in the  [[Page H3659]]  U.S. who utilize those batteries, an amendment was placed into a  previous bill that prohibits the FAA from exercising its judgment about  the safety of the carriage of lithium batteries on airplanes. Instead,  we are bound to an international convention, the ICAO, which is very  responsive to third-world countries and China and others in terms of  seeking lowest common denominator regulation of anything that they can.   Normally, we lead the world. Normally, we would say: No, get this  stuff off aircraft. We have lost two 747s--two 747s. They were cargo  aircraft. They went down because of lithium batteries. It only takes a  very few lithium batteries.   Do we have the lithium battery picture?   This is packaging of lithium batteries. This is what happens with  those lithium batteries if just one overheats and starts a spontaneous  reaction--again, catastrophic to the aircraft.   Now we are temporarily under an ICAO rule that says that they should  not be carried in passenger aircraft, but they are still being  regularly carried in the holds of cargo aircraft.   Now, we have oceans. We have freighters. They have containers. You  could plan ahead.   Let's say 2 months from now we are going to say these things don't go  in the air anymore because, okay, yeah, you are right; there are only a  couple of pilots who are going to lose their lives. It kind of concerns  me. Well, what happens if the 747 comes down in a populated area? Oops,  a lot more people lose their lives.   So you can say 2 months from now they are not going to be on aircraft  anymore and the industry can set up a new supply chain of putting these  things in containers and shipping them across the ocean in a way that  will not endanger people on the ground and, in all probability, will  not lead to fatalities if there were an uncontained spontaneous  ignition of these batteries.   Even worse, this administration has designated that the--did you ever  hear of this?--Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration,  PHMSA, which is a little tiny, pretty dysfunctional agency, will take  over the authority for the regulation and the negotiation of the  regulation of lithium batteries from the FAA.   What does PHMSA, Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety  Administration, know about aviation? Nothing. Zero. Nada. Nothing.   So I guess, again, we are seeing the clout of the manufacturers and  the Chinese battery manufacturers. Theoretically, they are safer now  because they can only be charged to 30 percent, but often the Chinese  just kind of forget to do it that way and put them on the planes  anyway.   So this is an accident waiting to happen. It is an imposition of a  tombstone mentality on the FAA by Congress. It says, until there is  another proven crash due to lithium batteries, we can't regulate.   Come on. Really? Another proven crash, we can't regulate?   Let's give the FAA the authority to regulate these batteries. They  could probably develop containers, maybe, that they could go in and  still be on aircraft, but there are other ways of moving these  batteries in world commerce.   So I would urge adoption of my amendment and the repeal of the  tombstone mentality mandate on the FAA.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, this doesn't tell the FAA nor mandate the FAA to  regulate lithium batteries. It would allow the status quo, which means  the FAA would have the authority to determine whether they represent an  inordinate risk and there should be strictures put upon their  transport, whether it is containers or other strictures, as opposed to  following the lowest common denominator international organization.   You know, airplane manufacturers see the risk. According to the  International Coordination Council for Aerospace Industries  Association, which includes Boeing and Airbus, they say: ``Existing  cargo compartment fire protection systems . . . are unable to suppress  or extinguish a fire involving significant quantities of lithium  batteries . . . . Therefore, continuing to allow the carriage of  lithium batteries within today's transport category aircraft cargo  compartments is an unacceptable risk to the air transport industry.''   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.  [[Page H3660]]     Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, even  though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment. This seems very  commonsense to me.   Earlier in the en bloc, my amendment was adopted, which would give  the FAA authority to begin regulation of the small drones, which  currently has been prohibited by a statute earlier adopted by Congress.   If this passes, that will allow the FAA, if my amendment stands in  conference, to adopt this commonsense rule. Should my amendment not be  adopted in conference with the Senate, and we pass this, the FAA would  not have the authority to prohibit arming of small drones since they  are prohibited from regulating them. Hopefully, both things will occur.   Mr. Chairman, I recommend adoption of this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the fact that the gentleman is  representing very well his constituents' concerns. We had an earlier  discussion on the floor about the aircraft noise. An amendment was  adopted to have the FAA study the speed of approach and take-off, which  can dramatically reduce the noise impact.   I have also asked the FAA to look at establishing alternate  performance-based navigation routes so they are not using the same  route every day over the same houses and the same neighborhoods.   When I first saw this amendment, it seemed to me innocuous since it  seems to follow the basic requirement in the  [[Page H3664]]  controller handbook, FAA Order 7110.65, section 561, which addresses  this issue. However, we have been contacted by the National Air Traffic  Controllers union, and they have expressed grave concerns that they  think it may have unintended consequences.   Unfortunately, they just contacted us, so we haven't been able to get  the details of their concerns. So in that case, I would have to oppose  the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this is a perpetual debate here on the  floor whenever it comes to the expenditure of Federal tax dollars on  projects that are covered by Davis-Bacon, as would be projects under  the Airport Improvement Program and other related activities by the  FAA.   The bottom line here is we can chase the lowest common denominator  around the United States, or around the world sometimes, in terms of  trade, and undermine the capability of Americans to make a decent  living, to have a home and have a family, and live the American Dream.   The savings are illusory at best. In many cases, they would go to  profits for nonunion shops and others, and we would return to the old  days of basically exploiting those who work in construction and related  activities.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Kildee).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, look around the country. There are many  States  [[Page H3665]]  that have not adopted a minimum wage that exceeds the Federal minimum  wage of $7.50 an hour. That is pretty pathetic.   My State is one of many that has chosen to far exceed that minimum  wage, but if we do away with--this says that federally funded contracts  must receive the local prevailing wage for their work. In Oregon, we  have recognized that with a higher minimum wage, so our prevailing  wages are going to be higher than some State that only follows the  Federal minimum wage of $7.50 an hour.                                time  1515    So what might some contractor do? Oh, I can go over here and hire  people who are used to earning $7.50 an hour. I am going to import them  into Oregon. Of course, you are going to still have a problem with our  minimum wage law, but this is what this is about is to find less  expensive labor and move it around the country, and that, I believe, is  a disservice to the working people of the United States.   I would urge Congress, as it has done every other time this amendment  has been offered, to reject it on a broad bipartisan basis.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   These amendments, en bloc, have been reviewed, both by the majority  and the minority, and there is consensus on their merit. I urge my  colleagues to support them.   Before I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett), I would say  first that I strongly support his amendment and tried to work with the  former FAA Administrator to rectify this issue that led to this  extraordinary and unnecessary loss of life.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Chair, I offered a narrow fix for this in what was true  interstate commerce because of the potential confusion between Federal  hours of service and State hours of service, and that was rejected.                                time  1600    This is an incredibly broad preemption. It is not as stated. For  instance, we just heard you have to pull over, no matter where you are.  No. If you don't take your rest break, you have to be paid, but you  don't have to stop and pull over.   Beyond that, this would preempt paid rest breaks, paid meal breaks,  paid sick leave, paid family leave, payment for time detained at a  loading dock, payment for anything other than a flat rate by the load.   This is an extraordinary preemption that we have here. The drivers  are already exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act. So they can't get  overtime. If we wipe out the State laws and there is no existing  Federal law, truck drivers are really getting it stuck to them here.   In fact, this amendment would expand Federal preemption over trucking  operations to include, for the first time, wages and working  conditions, something Congress never contemplated in 1994.   It is opposed by the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association,  the largest trucking organization; the Teamsters; American Association  for Justice; and numerous safety groups. This is not as it is being  presented. This is overly broad, and it should be opposed.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Napolitano).    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time remains  on each side?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. McEachin).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   If you simply pick up a load in the Port of Los Angeles and drive 10  miles, that is deemed interstate commerce.   The problem I was trying to solve with a narrow amendment version was  to say if someone is coming in from Nevada, crosses the State line,  there would be confusion. That is truly interstate commerce.   What would apply?   The Federal hours of service, State hours of service, et cetera.   There could be a narrow fix to this issue. This is a preemption. If  you read the law, basically, from working to the full extent permitted  or at such times as permitted under such section, or imposing any  additional obligations on motor carriers if such employees work to the  full extent or at such times as permitted under such section.  [[Page H3677]]    So this would be a preemption in all 50 States of whatever additional  conditions they have put in place.   Many truck drivers are horribly abused already. We have done away  with detention time, and we have put time limits on when they can  drive, for safety reasons. They are sitting at some warehouse facility  for hours, earning nothing, unless we can have States with additional  laws. If we aren't going to have Federal detention time, perhaps States  can help with these problems. We do not want abused, tired truck  drivers out on the road. We want them to be able to earn a living wage.   I have met with drivers out of the port numerous times who are in  these endless deals to theoretically buy their truck that they never  get to buy, and some of them are not even taking home $100 a week and  working many, many hours. We need to stop these abuses. This is only  going to make things worse.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
