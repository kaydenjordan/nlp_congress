 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  two exceptional students from Louisiana's Fourth Congressional  District, Zachary Cryer and Antavion Moore.   Zach, from Benton, was recently named Louisiana's Middle School  Student of the Year. Zach has maintained a 4.0 GPA throughout his time  at Benton Middle School, and he has already scored a 28 on the ACT as  an eighth grader.   Tay, from Ringgold, was named the Louisiana High School Student of  the Year, and he has already earned an associate's degree and a  certificate of general studies. He plans to major in biomedical  engineering in college and to become an orthopedic doctor.   By being recognized as Students of the Year, Tay and Zach show a  tremendous amount of dedication, excellent character, phenomenal  leadership skills. Clearly, the best is yet to come for these young  men.   Louisiana's Fourth Congressional District is home to some of the  brightest and most hardworking students in the Nation, just like Zach  and Antavion. I am so proud to represent them here in Congress.   Once again, congratulations, guys. The best is yet to come.                            ____________________
