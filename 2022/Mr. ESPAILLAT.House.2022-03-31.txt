 Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege of representing two  historic and iconic districts in the 13th Congressional District.   Harlem is the center, the mecca, of the African-American diaspora. It  is the center of culture, of music, of literature for the Black  community with the Apollo, the Schomburg, and other great historical  institutions.   The other neighborhood that I represent, Mr. Speaker, is East Harlem,  El Barrio, which is the launching pad for the Latino experience in New  York City. It was the home, the cradle, for the Puerto Rican community  that opened its doors to Dominicans, Ecuadorians, Colombians, Central  and South Americans.  [[Page H4016]]    They really are two historic districts within the 13th Congressional  District. Today, we mark a new day for those two communities with  regard to transit access.   This week, President Biden announced and submitted to Congress a  strong and visionary budget. It included $4.5 billion for the Capital  Investment Grant program, which includes $400 million for the  construction of the second phase of the Second Avenue subway extension.   The first phase was completed not too long ago, several years ago,  and it went from 96th Street south to 72nd Street, touching some of the  most affluent ZIP Codes in the country.   This phase, the second phase, will go north to 125th Street. Some  people have categorized it and called it Uptown Grand Central. It would  connect East Harlem, El Barrio, and Harlem at 125th Street to the rest  of the world.   These stops will connect a transportation desert where over 75  percent of its residents use public transportation to the Lexington  Avenue line, which is the most overcrowded subway line in the city, if  not the country.   East Harlem, as I said earlier, is currently a transportation desert,  and this second phase will change the lives of over 100,000 New Yorkers  who will use it on a daily basis.   This phase will extend train services to 96th Street and 125th  Street, a 2-mile stretch, and benefit thousands upon thousands of New  Yorkers. But it would also connect to Metro-North, a total of 124  stations in seven different counties in upstate New York, suburban New  York, as well as Connecticut. As such, it will also connect folks to  LaGuardia Airport via bus and future water transportation in the Hudson  River and Harlem River.   This is truly a regional project that will connect Harlem and East  Harlem, El Barrio, to the rest of the world.   I am happy and proud that President Biden included $400 million for  the second phase of the Second Avenue subway.   The first phase saw 160,000 people benefit on a regular basis, $842  million in wages, and $2.87 billion in economic activity in that  region.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to see this new initiative.   I thank President Biden for bringing the second phase of the Second  Avenue Subway to the 13th Congressional District.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6833, the  Affordable Insulin Now Act, to cap the out-of-pocket price for one  month's supply of insulin at $35.   Insulin was discovered nearly 100 years ago and costs less than $10 a  vial to manufacture.   Yet there are millions of American families with insurance that are  paying hundreds of dollars a vial.   No family in America should be forced to choose between buying  insulin for their child and putting food on the table.   It's past time that this Congress says no to big pharma lining their  pockets, at the expense of lives of the American people.
