 Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jackson  Lee for her leadership.   In order to understand where we stand in the present, we have to  understand where we have been and how we came to arrive at a society as  racially divided and as unequal as our own. For me, it is a scandal  that most Americans have never heard of Juneteenth and most Americans  have never heard of the Tulsa race massacre because these events are  rarely, if ever, taught in public education.   Juneteenth is not only not taught in our public schools, but there is  not even a national holiday celebrating an event that has profound  meaning to Black Americans, to all Americans. So I want to commend the  gentlewoman's leadership in advancing a bill that would establish  Juneteenth as a national holiday.   Frederick Douglass famously posed the question: What to a slave is  July Fourth?   Juneteenth is to Black America what July Fourth has exclusively been  to  [[Page H2733]]  White America: Independence Day. Juneteenth refers to the moment when  slaves in Texas came to discover their legal freedom under the  Emancipation Proclamation. Out of that discovery came a 156-year  tradition of Juneteenth celebration. It refers to the moment when Major  General Gordon Granger led a Union Army to Texas to enforce the  Emancipation Proclamation 2\1/2\ years after its issuance.   The announcement was known as General Order Number 3, and it read as  follows: ``The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a  proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are  free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights  of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection  heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and  hired labor.''   For me, Juneteenth contains a deeper lesson that we ignore at our own  peril. Law becomes real not when it is proclaimed but when it is  enforced.   The emancipation of enslaved people became real not when it was  proclaimed by Abraham Lincoln but when it was enforced by the Union  Army, most notably on Juneteenth.   The desegregation of our public schools became real not when it was  proclaimed by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education but when  it was enforced most notably by President Eisenhower, who sent the  National Guard to Little Rock, Arkansas.   Voting rights became real not when it was proclaimed by the 15th  Amendment but when it was enforced a century later by the Voting Rights  Act enforced by the process of preclearance, which has since been  gutted by the Supreme Court but which we are seeking to restore with  the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.   Reconstruction was doomed by a lack of Federal enforcement. In the  beginning, Reconstruction had early success. It saw the passage of the  13th Amendment, which abolished slavery; the 14th Amendment, which  provided for equal protection of the law and which prohibited  discrimination based on race; and the 15th Amendment, which provided  for voting rights and which prohibited disenfranchisement based on  race.   During Reconstruction, scores of African Americans began exercising  their fundamental right to vote, and some African Americans began  winning elective office. For a fleeting moment, there was an outburst  of Black political power in America. Then came a turning point in the  1876 Presidential election, whose outcome was decided by a  congressional commission.   Then-Presidential candidate Rutherford B. Hayes cut a deal with white  supremacists in the United States Congress. He agreed to withdraw the  Union Army from the former Confederate States in exchange for the  Presidency. When the Union Army withdrew from the South, it left behind  a vacuum that ultimately came to be filled by Jim Crow, a system of  racial discrimination, racial segregation, and racial terrorism.                                time  2030    What followed the failure of Reconstruction was the lost century.   Madam Speaker, for me, the lesson of Juneteenth is that an activist  Federal Government is an essential defender of human rights and civil  rights. It is an essential defender of equality and dignity and  humanity for all Americans. We must learn from the lessons of history,  and we must continue the work of Reconstruction that is long overdue.
