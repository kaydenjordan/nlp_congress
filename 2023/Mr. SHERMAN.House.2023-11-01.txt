 Mr. Speaker, the scenes from Gaza are horrendous, and  people want the fighting to end. Some call for a cease-fire. Hamas  needs to hear those calls and agree to free the hostages and turn over  its rockets, and then we can have that cease-fire.   There was a cease-fire on October 6. Hamas broke it and killed 1,400  Israelis.   What would happen if we had a cease-fire leaving the rockets and arms  in Hamas' hands?   Today, Ghazi Hamad, a high-ranking Hamas official, said exactly what  would happen. He said: We will repeat October 7 one, two, three, four,  five times, as many times as it takes, until Israel is annihilated.   We need a true cease-fire, and we can achieve it only if Hamas is  disarmed.   I have been a pro-Israel activist for 60 years and a member of the  Foreign Affairs Committee for nearly 30. Israel has one friend in the  world. Hamas knows that. America is divided and partisan. Hamas knows  that. The terrible scenes in Gaza show that Hamas is willing to die for  one thing, and that is to put those scenes on American television to  undercut support for Israel to make sure that that support is not  bipartisan.    Last week, we showed bipartisan support, with 97 percent of the  Democrats and 99 percent of the Republicans voting for a strong  resolution. Unfortunately, our Speaker has decided to undercut that  and, in doing so, help Hamas achieve its most important geopolitical  objective.   For 60 years, when an Israel resolution comes to this floor, it  passes overwhelmingly with support on both sides of the aisle.  Tomorrow, that changes because the Speaker is bringing a nakedly  partisan version of the support for Israel bill to this floor.   Mr. Speaker, you have only been in office for a week and already you  are achieving Hamas' geopolitical objectives. Why? Supposedly, to pay  for the cost of aiding Israel, they are going to slash the IRS budget.  CBO today just indicated that that will cost us over $26 billion in  revenue and will increase the cost of aiding Israel.   I am here to say, as the co-chair of the Bipartisan CPA Caucus, as  someone who has taught tax law at Harvard Law School, and as someone  who headed the second largest tax agency in this country, that that CBO  number is way too low. The long-term effects will be devastating on our  ability to collect taxes.   We need a bipartisan bill before this floor, not a bill that  supposedly is going to help Israel but actually is designed to hurt  Israel, help Hamas, and die in the Senate.   Now, the numbers coming from Gaza about casualties are something that  a CPA should look at. We know what happened at Al Ahli Arab hospital.  They dramatically overstated the casualties. Then, America said, with a  high degree of confidence from our intel community, that that was a  rocket fired by Hamas or Islamic jihad that failed to reach its target  and instead fell on a Palestinian hospital.   Even if you accept Hamas' statistics, our press goes further and  exaggerates their number.   First, Hamas will tell you that they include in their statistics dead  Palestinian combatants, and so our press reports the number as if that  somehow is Israel's fault.   Hamas will tell you that they include in those statistics those who  die from the one-third of Hamas rockets that crash into Gaza, yet our  press will report that statistic as if that is a number Israel is  responsible for.   As to those who die from Israeli ordnance, keep in mind that is  because of Hamas' use of human shields. They were in Israel and could  have stood and fought the Israeli Defense Forces. Instead, they quickly  retreated behind their human shields.   Finally, those who say that we have more deaths in Gaza than in other  terrible events happening in the world, this is clearly false. We have  had over 600,000 deaths in Ethiopia. The press didn't report it, but it  still matters.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an open letter dated November 1,  2023, from the Association of University Heads, Israel, to accompany my  speech on the floor today.         Dear Colleagues:        We, the leaders of Israeli universities and research       institutions, write to express deep concern over the       discourse emanating from academia following the devastating       Hamas attack on Israel on October 7 and the inadequate       response, in many cases, by academic leadership.        On that darkest of days, in a tragedy unprecedented in       Israel's 75-year history, the Hamas terrorists infiltrated       into the country and murdered more than 1,400 people,       including infants, children, students, and senior citizens--      Jewish, Muslim, and Christian alike. The attack also included       the abduction of 240 civilians of all ages into Gaza;       additional missing persons have not yet been identified and       accounted for. In the aftermath of these horrific events, we       find it disturbing that certain narratives from academic       institutions misrepresent the situation, or, in the worst       cases, actively target Israelis and Jews.  [[Page H5186]]         We find ourselves facing a war on two fronts: one against       the atrocities of Hamas, and another in the global arena of       public opinion. Regrettably, we have noticed an alarming       trend in which Israel, despite its right to self-defense, is       mischaracterized as an oppressor. This is a false equivalence       between the actions of a murderous terrorist organization and       a sovereign state's right to defend its citizens, which       unfortunately results in the loss of innocent Palestinian       lives. Any attempt to justify or equivocate Hamas's brutal       and grotesque actions is intellectually and morally       indefensible.        It's unsettling to note that many college campuses have       become breeding grounds for anti-Israel and anti-Semitic       sentiments, largely fueled by a naive and biased       understanding of the conflict. It is ironic that the very       halls of enlightenment in America and Europe, ostensibly the       bastions of intellectual and progressive thought that are       your campuses, have adopted Hamas as the cause celebre while       Israel is demonized. Universities, as hubs of enlightenment       and rational discourse, must take responsibility for the       views they perpetuate.        There is no moral equivalency here. Let's be clear: Hamas       shares no values with any Western academic institution. Hamas       is an organization that has repeatedly pledged to annihilate       Israel and its people.        Its ideology is antithetical to the values of human life       and the liberal values we hold dear. Hamas funnels       international aid into armament rather than to the welfare of       its citizens. While Israel uses its weapons to shield its       citizens, Hamas uses its citizens as shields for its       weapons--which it hides in hospitals, schools, and mosques.       It is crucial to distinguish between Hamas' terrorist       objectives and the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian       people for statehood. The conflation of the two only serves       to fuel hatred and ignorance.        Academic institutions stand as lighthouses in the       intellectual landscape, and we ask you to illuminate them.       Your roles as leaders of these institutions confer upon you       an extraordinary responsibility: to guide the moral and       ethical development of your students, to imbue them with the       ability to think critically and to discern the nuances that       separate right from wrong. Freedom of speech is a cornerstone       of academic freedom, but it should not be manipulated to       legitimize hate speech or to justify violence.        We urge you to delineate the boundaries between       constructive discourse and destructive propaganda, and       promote evidence-based, nuanced thinking that challenges       simplistic narratives. Expose the falsity of justifications       for acts of terror; expose and condemn disingenuous       statements; and reject hypocritical voices that justify       murder, rape, and destruction in the name of ``resistance''.        Moreover, we expect that Israeli and Jewish students and       faculty on university and college campuses will be accorded       the same respect and protections as any other minority. The       principles of inclusivity and campus safety must       unequivocally extend to include Israeli and Jewish members of       your academic communities. Just as it would be unthinkable       for an academic institution to extend free speech protections       to groups targeting other protected classes, so too should       demonstrations that call for our destruction and glorify       violence against Jews be explicitly prohibited and condemned.        What the world witnessed on October 7 were not methods to       help disadvantaged peoples build better futures for       themselves. The events of this terrible day should be taken       as a wake-up call to all of the dangers of nihilistic       organizations like Hamas and ISIS that represent the very       opposite of freedom and liberty.        As leaders of Israeli universities, we have been heartened       by clear statements of solidary and support for Israel, which       are, at their heart, statements in solidary with humanity,       enlightenment, and progress. At the same time, we are calling       for a sea change in clarity and truth in academia on the       matter of Israel's war against Hamas, so that light will       triumph over dark, now and always.        Signed,        Prof. Arie Zaban, President of Bar-Ilan University,       Chairperson of Association of University Heads--VERA;        Prof. Daniel A. Chamovitz, President of Ben-Gurion       University of the Negev;        Prof. Alon Chen, President of Weizmann Institute of       Science;        Prof. Asher Cohen, President of the Hebrew University of       Jerusalem;        Prof. Leo Corry, President of the Open University of       Israel;        Prof. Ehud Grossman, President of Ariel University;        Prof. Ariel Porat, President of Tel-Aviv University;        Prof. Ron Robin, President of University of Haifa;        Prof. Uri Sivan, President of the Technion-Israel Institute       of Technology.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I have been working on this bill for a long  time. I introduced it in the 116th Congress and the 117th Congress, and  both times it passed unanimously in the Foreign Affairs Committee. Now,  finally, in the 118th Congress, we have it to the floor. I thank Mr.  Mast from Florida for being the Republican lead on this bill and  speaking for it here on the floor. Now, as I said, this bill passed  unanimously three times through our committee, and I hope it passes  unanimously by voice vote here on the floor.   Let us reflect on what has happened recently in Israel. Our Secretary  of State, Tony Blinken, I think, summarized it well in his testimony  yesterday: Young people chased down and gunned down at a dance party.  Children executed in front of their parents. Parents executed in front  of their children. Families in final embrace burned alive. People  beheaded.   There was a family of four, a boy and a girl of 6 and 8 years old and  their parents, around the breakfast table. The father's eye was gouged  out in front of his children, the mother's breasts were cut off, the  girl's foot was amputated, and the boy's finger was cut off before they  were executed. Then the executioners sat down and had a meal.   We heard an intercepted telephone call where a terrorist called his  mother and said gleefully: ``I have killed 10 Jews with my own hands.  I'm using the dead Jewish woman's phone to call you now.''   How does such a horror occur? It occurs when generations are raised  to hate, to kill, to behead, to murder, and it is a product of the  schools that we have seen for decades on the West Bank and the Gaza  Strip.   I point to a particular fifth grade textbook which glorifies a  terrorist who in 1978 went forward and killed 38 Israeli civilians,  including 13 children, many of them pictured here. This is who is  glorified. This is who is held up to Palestinian children as the model  for them to follow.   We should not be surprised that there is, therefore, significant  support for the Hamas doctrine: ``From the river to the sea . . . ''  All Jews must be killed; that is their position. That is what holds  their organization together.   I know the scenes that come now from Gaza are horrific. People say:  ``Let's stop the fighting. Let's have a cease-fire.'' Well, what would  happen then? We don't have to wonder, because just today, Ghazi Hamad,  a high-ranking official of Hamas, said exactly what would happen. He  said: We will repeat October 7 one, two, three, four, five times, as  many times as it takes, until Israel is annihilated.    That is what happens if we have a cease-fire, unless we have the kind  of cease-fire that we should have, one in which Hamas releases all the  hostages and disarms. Then we can have a cease-fire.   In the years to come, after the actions being taken in Gaza, we will  again wonder: Is another generation being educated to repeat these  crimes in future years?   How are these students educated? They are educated in schools run by  UNRWA, the U.N. organization, and paid for in large part by the United  States. While we have responsibilities  [[Page H5201]]  around the world, the oil-rich Arab states contribute only a portion, a  small portion of what UNRWA spends. America contributes half and more  than half.   When we resumed funding for UNRWA in 2021, it was with the  understanding that the schools would change, and we reached the 2021  framework for cooperation. So far, not so good. It appears as if the  books continue.    Mr. Speaker, what this bill does is requires a formal  report to tell us what, unfortunately, we know informally, and that is  that education for terrorism has continued.   With this formal report on its way, UNRWA will understand that what  is happening in its schools will be exposed and that the American  Congress will not continue to fund them if they don't meet the  responsibilities.   Now, it is said that they have to rely on Palestinian Authority  textbooks. No, they simply have to change their policy.   I look forward to meeting the humanitarian and educational needs of  the Palestinian people in a way that builds toward peace, not in a way  that holds out to Palestinian fifth graders as an example someone who  would kill 38 civilians, including 13 children.
