 Mr. President, I also rise to speak about the budget. I  find many points of agreement with my colleague from Utah.   Just to sort of jump into it, normally we wouldn't be having this  budget discussion in the fall. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974  suggests that the President would give us a budget in February, that we  would pass a budget by April, and that budget would then set top-line  numbers that would be given to the committees, that would then write  their authorizing bills with those budgetary numbers. Then it would be  handed over, and the appropriators would ultimately fashion  appropriations bills that were responsive to the budget and the  authorizing bills. We are into a new fiscal year, and the many of the  authorizing committees have already done their jobs.   I am on the Armed Services Committee. Probably the biggest piece of  legislation we do every year is the NDAA. We have already written it  without having a budget. We didn't have a budget top-line number this  year. We have gone ahead and written the bill, and the appropriators  are already working.   I think what everybody on this floor understands is that this really  isn't a budget debate; it is an effort to set up a set of instructions  around which to do tax reform via budget reconciliation. In my view,  this budgetary document fails as a budget, and it also fails as a good- faith beginning to a tax reform discussion.   I want to talk about each of these: why this document fails as a  budget--I voted against it in committee, and I am going to vote against  it on the floor--and why it fails as an effort to initiate the  necessary process for reforming the Tax Code for the first time since  1986.   If you look at this document, the budget that is on the floor has a  whole set of priorities that are either wrong or completely  unrealistic. As an example, the budget proposes over $5 trillion in  spending cuts, $470-plus billion cut to Medicare, and an over $1  trillion cut to Medicaid. That would not only be a bad idea, but it is  completely unrealistic and unlikely to occur. These cuts are not going  to happen, and so it is just artificial.   Second, the budget does not address the primary budgetary reality--a  dangerous reality we are living under--of sequestration and budget  caps. It continues to gut domestic discretionary programs, to the tune  of over $600 billion over the decade.   Finally, just a particular item that I think is very important: The  budget proposes a fast track, a 50-vote process, to open up drilling in  the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. That is really not a budgetary  matter; it is shoehorned into the budget because we like to assume we  are going to get a big chunk of revenue by drilling in the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge. But this is a fundamental matter of  environmental policy that shouldn't be squirreled away in a tiny detail  on the budget.   I opposed drilling in the National Arctic Wildlife Refuge when it was  last on the floor in the mid-2000s. We were dealing with high oil  prices and overreliance on Middle Eastern oil. The energy situation has  completely changed.  [[Page S6441]]  We are moving to low- and no-carbon energy sources, and oil prices are  significantly lower. We are not relying on Middle Eastern oil. I would  also argue that the cost-benefit calculation now makes drilling in the  Arctic National Wildlife Refuge a particularly poor idea. I went to the  Refuge two summers ago and saw the environmental damage that would be  caused by drilling there, and I opposed it.   So the budget--from the unrealistic expense cuts to Medicaid and  Medicare that would really hurt people, to other cuts--is unrealistic.  The fact that it was being done after the authorizers and appropriators  were generally done with their work demonstrates that the budget isn't  that serious. What this is really about is coming up with an  instruction to begin the process of tax reform.   Tax reform done through the reconciliation process is a bad idea for  at least two reasons. First, it begins as completely partisan. If you  are going to do tax reform for the first time since 1986, you ought to  try to get the best ideas of both parties. But that is not what is done  with reconciliation. When you say ``We are going to do it through  reconciliation,'' you are saying ``We, the majority, have 52 votes. All  we need is 50 plus a tiebreaker. We are not going to listen to  Democrats. We are not going to meaningfully entertain the ideas you  have. We are going to do it on our own.''   I would venture to say that the same outcome as was achieved with the  effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act via reconciliation is going to  be the end result here. Trying to do something this important all on  your own, without meaningfully including the public and the minority,  almost destines it for failure.   The second reason it is a bad idea to do tax reform via  reconciliation is this: Matters in reconciliation are temporary, not  permanent.   I went to the Chamber of Commerce in Northern Virginia with Senator  Warner a couple of weeks back. We talked about tax reform. We talked  about the fact that it was needed to grow the economy, that it hadn't  been done for a long time. But what my business leaders want is tax  reform that is permanent. They don't want a tax reform bill where the  provisions expire, and because of the rules of reconciliation, that is  what happens. So to do tax reform via reconciliation is a mistake.   But let's go further and look at the tax reform ideas that have been  discussed by the administration and others that we will likely embark  upon if this budget passes. The budget sets up a mechanism for partisan  and temporary tax cuts that would increase the deficit by $1.5  trillion. The first page of the GOP's own budget talks about the  challenges of deficits:         ``Continual overspending and its resulting deficits will       expand the Federal debt. During the next 10 years, debt held       by the public is slated to rise from 77 percent of GDP ($15       trillion) to 91 percent of GDP ($26 trillion).''    Why would we propose to increase the debt by $1.5 trillion in a  partisan, temporary tax reconciliation bill? If folks--especially the  GOP--are so focused on the deficit and debt, and we should be, why are  we including a mechanism in this instruction to raise the debt by $1.5  trillion? I think, again, the answer is that this is not a serious  proposal, and it is only the vehicle for partisan and temporary tax  cuts.   The initial analyses I have seen of this tax proposal suggests a  couple of things. First, the tax benefits would overwhelmingly be for  folks at the top, the wealthiest, the folks who least need a break in  taxes. To give an example, the Republican proposal calls for the  elimination of the estate tax. That would cost more than $270 billion  over 10 years. The estate tax has high thresholds already. It affects  an extremely limited number of Virginians and a limited number of folks  in virtually every State. Giving up $270 billion to get rid of the  estate tax is enough to provide every child from a low- or moderate- income family with access to free preschool. That is about 7 million  kids. You would still have enough money left over to take every student  off Head Start waiting lists. Which would you rather do--cut the estate  tax $270 billion for a few families or provide access to free preschool  to every low- and moderate-income kid in this country and take every  child on a Head Start waiting list off the list?   Second, the proposal has some gimmicks and special quirks that I  think need to be brought to attention. I hope we will bring it to  attention on the floor. Here is an example: The budget that is before  us repeals a rule that is currently in place that requires the CBO to  issue scores on legislation coming out of reconciliation at least 28  hours in advance of a vote. Now, 28 hours isn't that long, but at least  it is enough time for a Senator and staff to read a bill and understand  the consequences of the bill before voting. This Republican budget  repeals the transparency rule that forces the CBO to issue a score. I  have an amendment to not repeal the rule but to restore it and make it  stronger. There should be a CBO score to let every Senator and  especially the public know what we are voting on with respect to these  matters.   I will conclude and say this: Tax reform is important. Let's not  sugarcoat this. We are not really debating a budget on the floor. If we  were really going to debate a budget, we would have done it last  spring. This is all about setting the stage for tax reform. We haven't  done it for a long time. It is important. We should promote tax reform  that makes the Tax Code simpler and fair and that focuses on middle- class working families and makes it easier to start businesses and grow  them. We shouldn't be doing tax reform that is partisan, that is  temporary, that increases the deficit, and that produces the  overwhelming benefit of a tax reform package to those at the top of the  income scale who don't need it.   It is my hope that we will have that debate in earnest on the floor  of the Senate. I would love to join my colleagues in a good-faith  effort to reform the Tax Code. Reconciliation and this particular  proposal is not the way to do that.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, this bill authorizes additions to two  existing wilderness areas within the George Washington National Forest  in Virginia; the Rich Hole and Rough Mountain Wilderness Areas. It's a  relatively simple bill, and it provides only a small window into the  volume of work done by Virginians to manage a vast swath of Federal  land in this region collaboratively and responsibly.   America's Federal lands are some of our most precious assets. We may  hike or bike them; derive energy, minerals, or goods from them; or  sometimes just leave them to nature. There is a long history of  conflict among stakeholders who disagree on which Federal lands are  best suited to which purposes.   Many years ago, forest users with different views and interests  formed the George Washington National Forest Stakeholder Collaborative.  Through hard work and consensus, the Collaborative agreed upon a number  of recommendations for forest management and protection. Everyone got  some of what they wanted and gave some ground. Preservation advocates  consented to timber harvest and other active forest restoration and  management in certain areas. The forest products industry consented to  wilderness and lightly-managed areas elsewhere. The U.S. Forest  Service's 2014 revised GW Forest Management Plan reflected many of  these agreements.   Subsequently, the Forest Service convened the Lower Cowpasture  Restoration and Management Project, bringing more stakeholders to the  table, earlier in the process, to negotiate out how to manage this  particular part of the Forest, located in the lower portion of the  Cowpasture River watershed, in ways that work for everyone. Within this  process, further compromises were made to achieve a mutually  satisfactory project that could gather broad support. All members of  the Stakeholder Collaborative now support the wilderness additions  identified in this bill.   I am proud to partner on this with my colleague Senator Mark Warner,  and we are following in the path blazed by Senator John Warner and  Representative Rick Boucher, who were instrumental in passing the  original Virginia Wilderness Act in 1984.   Taking care of our Nation's outdoor resources is good for our economy  and good for our environment. Land disputes may sometimes be difficult,  but the example of the GW Forest Stakeholder Collaborative proves they  don't have to be. When everyone comes to the table and invests the  necessary time, we can find common ground. I hope this will be a lesson  for us in other tough policy challenges, and I encourage the Senate to  support this bill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this bill authorizes additions to two  existing wilderness areas within the George Washington National Forest  in Virginia; the Rich Hole and Rough Mountain Wilderness Areas.
