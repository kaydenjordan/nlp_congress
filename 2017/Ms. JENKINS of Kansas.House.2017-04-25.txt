 Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to  congratulate my good friend and our new House colleague, Ron Estes.   I have known Ron and his wife, Susan, for many years. I can tell you,  he is truly one of the nicest guys you will ever want to know.   Ron and I share a common bond, having served as State treasurers in  Kansas, and I have watched him serve in that role well.   With a nation $20 trillion in debt, it is always nice to add a fellow  conservative to Congress to help fix the debt and get our economy on  the right fiscal track, which I know Ron is committed to doing.   He has dedicated his entire life to bold innovations and efficiency,  reform, and problem solving in both the public and the private sector.  Kansans in the Fourth District can be proud of their new Congressman,  and I look forward to working with Congressman Ron Estes on behalf of  Kansans.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes), our  newest colleague.
