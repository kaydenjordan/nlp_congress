 Mr. President, I was prepared this afternoon to speak  about the business the Senate must address, and I will do that, but,  first, I must respond to the recent announcement by the junior Senator  of Missouri that he intends to contest the certified votes of the  electrical college when Congress meets to count those votes next week.  The process for electing American Presidents is provided in our  Constitution and laws.   The process has been followed fully, fairly. The results have been  duly certified by the Governors of the States, and they have been  reviewed and confirmed by the courts many times over. The result is  that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won the election by overwhelming  margins in both the popular vote and the electoral vote.   The Biden-Harris ticket received more than 81 million votes, more  than any ticket in American history. That was over 7 million more votes  than Trump-Pence. The Biden-Harris ticket won the electoral college 306  to 232, the very same total that President Trump called a landslide for  himself then just 4 years ago.   Since the election process, President Trump and his acolytes have  lost more than 50 lawsuits, falsely claiming fraud or other  irregularities in the conduct of the 2020 election, including the  unanimous decision by the Supreme Court to dismiss a lawsuit brought by  the attorney general of Texas and more than half the Republican Members  of the House.   Today, we heard from the junior Senator from Missouri that he intends  to object to the election results, particularly in Pennsylvania--a  State where  [[Page S7973]]  the Trump campaign and its allies have brought no fewer than 13  lawsuits and lost every single one, many with Republican judges ruling.  There have been only three individuals--three--charged with voter fraud  in Pennsylvania, and in each case, the person voted for Trump.   The effort by the sitting President of the United States to overturn  the results is patently undemocratic. The effort by others to amplify  and burnish his ludicrous claims of fraud is equally revolting. This is  America. We have elections. We have results. We make arguments based on  fact and reason, not conspiracy and fantasy.   On January 6, Congress will meet to formally recognize the electoral  college result. There is a very clear process to handle and dispense  with the objections of Members of Congress to the counting of the  result, and that is just what we will do--dispense with them. On  January 6, Congress will ratify the electoral college's decision that  Joe Biden will be President and Kamala Harris will be Vice President.  Make no mistake about it--Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be sworn in  as President and Vice President on January 20.                      National Defense Authorization Act     Mr. President, now let me return to the matters at hand.   Today, the Senate will begin the process of overriding the  President's veto on the annual Defense bill. The House has already  overridden the veto by a comfortable margin. I expect the Senate to  follow suit and enact the NDAA into law over President Trump's evolving  and ridiculous objections. Congress has passed the annual Defense bill  for 59 years in a row. It is an important opportunity to ensure our  defense and security policies reflect the evolving challenges of our  world and provide our servicemembers and their families, as well as  Defense Department civilians, the support, resources, and training they  need. The particular legislation includes a pay raise for troops and  provisions that will allow the executive branch to be better postured  to identify and deter breaches to America's cyber security. In the wake  of the SolarWinds hack, that might be a good policy to enact.   Nonetheless, President Trump vetoed this legislation because it  provides for renaming military installations that honor Confederate  military leaders or, maybe, because it doesn't address an unrelated  social media issue. Think about it for a moment. The President vetoed a  pay raise to living American soldiers in order to defend the honor of  dead Confederate traitors. Well, the Senate will soon have an  opportunity to override the President's objection and do right by those  brave Americans who wear the uniform.   As I said yesterday, there are two major issues before the Senate  right now--the annual Defense bill and the vital and important effort  to send $2,000 stimulus checks to American families. There are only a  few days left in this session, and the Senate should consider both  issues before adjourning.   There is a very simple solution to this dilemma: Leader McConnell  should bring both measures up for a vote and let the chips fall where  they may. I believe both measures--the defense override and the $2,000  checks to American families--will pass, but at the very least, the  Senate deserves the opportunity for an up-or-down vote on increasing  the individual payments to the American people.   At the end of my remarks, I will ask the Senate to set a time tonight  for a vote on the House bill to provide $2,000 checks. The Republican  leader objected to a similar request I made yesterday, and it appears  he may be considering a different bill that packages stimulus checks  with other unrelated and partisan policies.   I want to be very clear about one thing: There is no other game in  town besides the House bill. The only way to get the American people  the $2,000 checks they deserve and need is to pass the House bill and  pass it now. The House has recessed for the year. Any modification or  addition to the House bill cannot become law before the end of this  Congress. It is a way to kill the bill. Make no mistake about it:  Either the Senate takes up and passes the House bill or struggling  American families will not get $2,000 checks during the worst economic  crisis in 75 years.   Over the past few days, the idea of increasing direct payments to the  American people has united folks from all points of the political  spectrum. I salute the Senator from Vermont for the good job he has  done in bringing this forward to the American people's attention. An  overwhelming bipartisan majority in the House supports the $2,000  checks. Senate Democrats strongly support these $2,000 checks, and our  unlikely ally, President Trump, this morning, tweeted: ``$2000 ASAP!''  For once, the Democrats agree with something on President Trump's  Twitter feed. Let's send $2,000 ASAP to working Americans who are  facing the hardest and darkest days of the pandemic.   After all of the insanity that the Senate Republicans have tolerated  from President Trump--his attacks on the rule of law, an independent  judiciary, the conduct that led to his impeachment--is this where the  Senate Republicans are going to draw the line--with $2,000 checks to  the American people? That is a bridge too far? Please.   For the awareness of my colleagues, we can have this vote tonight and  send the bill directly to the President's desk for his signature. We  can vote on the NDAA bill tonight and finish the Senate's business  before the end of the year. All it takes is our Republican colleagues  to consent to a simple vote on the House bill to provide $2,000 checks  to the American people. Yes or no, up or down, do you support sending  $2,000 to the American people or not? Let's have the vote                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 9051    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of H.R. 9051, a bill received from the House, to increase  recovery rebate amounts to $2,000 for individuals; that the bill be  read a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.
