 Mr. President. I would like recognize a critical member  of my staff, Mike Anderson, who left my office in August to pursue a  legal career his hometown of Anchorage, AK, something he has aspired to  do since a young age.   Communications director was a more than appropriate title for Mike.  He directed so much of our communication, both internally and  externally. You would often find Mike going from staff member to staff  member, asking them questions, relaying information from one team to  the next. In our office, if you had a question about what anybody was  up to, you would ask Mike. That is a special quality. We miss it very  much.   Mike is no stranger to Alaska political offices. Fresh out of college  at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, he took a job with Congressman    Don Young, and then worked for Senator Lisa Murkowski. In 2014, I was  looking for someone to help with communications on my campaign. It was  the first time I had run for office, and I was running against an  incumbent with big name recognition. Mike came on board. He took a  chance on me--it is something I will never forget.   He had been taking law classes at night at the Catholic University of  America for the past few years working in my office. He balanced it  all, was on the clock around the clock, and did it with grace and  humor. He was our office communicator, but he was also the office  friend--the person you would go to for advice on things big and small,  the person you would call on for an assist if you needed to move. It  helped that he is a short 6'8". Mike always showed up. Working  together--as one team, one fight--we got big things done for our State.   Mike is going to make a great lawyer in Alaska. As a State, we have  so much potential: the biggest fisheries in the country, the largest  energy fields, an array of military complexes, and fascinating Alaska  Native legal issues. More than anything, Alaska needs good leaders with  integrity--hard-working people like Mike, who love their State and give  it their all. We haven't seen the last of Mike. He will always be a  part of our team. And I am sure that we will always work together to  make sure Alaska thrives.   So good luck to you, Mike. You left a mark and a hole. Best wishes on  a bright future ahead.                            ____________________
