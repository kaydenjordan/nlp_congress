 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a  dedicated public servant and member of my senior staff, Cory Fritz. The  Foreign Affairs Committee has benefited greatly from his sound  judgment, skill, and passion for the values, including a free press,  that have made America strong.   Cory got his start on the Hill writing speeches, advocating stronger  U.S. relations with the former captive nations in Europe, for the late  Senator Voinovich of Ohio. He later joined the congressional office of  then-Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio. Working for John throughout  his speakership, Cory played an important role on a number of foreign  policy issues, including efforts to force the administration to step up  the fight against ISIS.   Upon John's retirement, it was only fitting that Cory move to the  Foreign Affairs Committee. As deputy staff director, Cory has elevated  the committee's communications operations and played a key role in  shaping strategy and policy.   Cory is one of my most trusted advisers. His counsel helped pave the  way for a number of important accomplishments, including the landmark  Russia, Iran, and North Korea sanctions enacted in 2017.   Also, I am proud to have inspired him to take special interest in  conservation policy, which has long been a priority of mine. With  Cory's assistance, I have advanced legislation to combat wildlife  trafficking and poaching. We have also advanced legislation to preserve  southern Africa's vital Okavango River Basin.   As I leave the House, I thank Cory for his 11 years of service to his  home State of Ohio, to this Republic, and also to the Congress. I wish  him and his wife, Sarah, all the best as they prepare to welcome their  first child in the spring.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1091) calling on the Government of  Burma to release Burmese journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo sentenced  to seven years imprisonment after investigating attacks against  civilians by Burma's military and security forces, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 1091         Whereas in recent decades the Rohingya people have lost,       through systematic discrimination by Burmese national, state,       and local authorities, a range of civil and political rights,       including citizenship, and face barriers today such that they       have been rendered stateless;        Whereas the Burmese military and security forces have       committed numerous crimes against civilians over many years       in Burma's Rakhine, Shan, Kachin, and Karen States;        Whereas beginning August 25, 2017, the Burmese military and       security forces, as well as civilian mobs, carried out       widespread attacks, rapes, killings, and the burning of       villages throughout Rakhine State resulting in approximately       730,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh and bringing the total       Rohingya refugee population in Cox's Bazar to over 900,000;        Whereas on November 14, 2018, Vice President Mike Pence       said, ``This is a tragedy that has touched the hearts of       millions of Americans. The violence and persecution by       military and vigilantes that resulted in driving 700,000       Rohingya to Bangladesh is without excuse.'';        Whereas to date, though the refugee crisis is not of their       making, the Government of Bangladesh has generously       accommodated the rapid and massive influx of Rohingya       refugees into Cox's Bazar;  [[Page H10062]]         Whereas the Government of Bangladesh continues to express       concern about the lack of accountability for the perpetrators       of these crimes and the need to find durable solutions;        Whereas in June 2018, it was announced that the United       Nations and the Government of Burma had reached an agreement       for the ``voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable'' return       of Rohinyga to Burma;        Whereas that agreement was contingent upon the provision of       unimpeded access to northern Rakhine by United Nations High       Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) and United Nations Development       Program (UNDP) in order to verify the necessary conditions on       the ground for such voluntary, safe, dignified, and       sustainable returns;        Whereas Burma's civilian government, led by State       Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint, has not       yet taken the necessary steps to address the violence       directed against the Rohingya and has failed to create the       necessary conditions for returns, including by actively       impeding access to northern Rakhine by UNHCR, UNDP,       humanitarian organizations, and journalists;        Whereas on August 24, 2018, the United Nations       International Fact Finding Mission on Myanmar released a       preliminary report stating that, ``The Mission concluded . .       . that there is sufficient information to warrant the       investigation and prosecution of senior officials in the       Tatmadaw chain of command, so that a competent court can       determine their liability for genocide in relation to the       situation in Rakhine State.'';        Whereas on August 25, 2018, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo       said ``A year ago, following deadly militant attacks,       security forces responded by launching abhorrent ethnic       cleansing of ethnic Rohingya in Burma'', and continued ``The       U.S. will continue to hold those responsible accountable. The       military must respect human rights for Burma's democracy to       succeed.'';        Whereas the Department of the Treasury announced sanctions       on five Tatmadaw officers and two Tatmadaw units for human       rights abuses in Rakhine, Kachin, and Shan States;        Whereas on September 24, 2018, the Department of State       released a report entitled ``Documentation of Atrocities in       Northern Rakhine State'' that stated the military ``targeted       civilians indiscriminately and often with extreme brutality''       and that the violence in northern Rakhine State was       ``extreme, large-scale, widespread and seemingly geared       toward both terrorizing the population and driving gout the       Rohingya residents'' and that the ``scope and scale of the       military's operations indicate that they were well-planned       and coordinated'':        Whereas Reuters, a highly respected worldwide news       organization, discovered evidence of mass murder in the       village of Inn Din as part of its ongoing reporting on the       Burmese military's campaign against the Rohingya, and       deployed journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo to fact-check       and interview eyewitnesses to these and other events;        Whereas on December 12, 2017, Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo were       arrested by Burmese security forces in a suburb of Yangon and       remain in custody to date;        Whereas on April 20, 2018, a key witness for the       prosecution, Police Captain Moe Yan Naing, testified that he       was ordered by his superiors to ``trap'' Wa Lone;        Whereas on September 3, 2018, Yangon Northern District       Judge Ye Lwin ruled that Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo breached the       colonial-era Official Secrets Act during their investigation       into the massacre in Inn Din and subsequently sentenced them       each to 7 years in prison with hard labor, despite admissions       by the police under oath in court that the documents in       question were planted with the journalists as a front for       their arrest;        Whereas United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met       with Burma's Foreign Minister, Kyaw Tin, at the ASEAN Foreign       Ministers' Meeting in August 2018 and called for the       immediate release of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo;        Whereas on September 4, 2018, Vice President Mike Pence       stated, ``Wa Lone & Kyaw Soe Oo should be commended--not       imprisoned--for their work exposing human rights violations       [and] mass killings. Freedom of religion [and] freedom of the       press are essential to a strong democracy.'';        Whereas Members of Congress, professional journalist       organizations, human rights groups, and other distinguished       leaders from around the world have called on the Burmese       authorities to release Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo from their       unjust imprisonment; and        Whereas the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and       Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, signed at Paris December       9, 1948 declares that ``means any of the following acts       committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a       national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such: (a)       Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or       mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately       inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to       bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; (d)       Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the       group; (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to       another group'' and ``The following acts shall be punishable:       (a) Genocide; (b) Conspiracy to commit genocide; (c) Direct       and public incitement to commit genocide; (d) Attempt to       commit genocide; (e) Complicity in genocide.'': Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of       Representatives that--        (1) the atrocities committed against the Rohingya by the       Burmese military and security forces since August 2017       constitute crimes against humanity and genocide;        (2) the Secretary of State should--        (A) determine, based on available evidence, whether the       actions by the Burmese military in northern Rakhine State in       2017 constitute crimes against humanity, genocide, or other       crimes under international law; and        (B) fully support efforts to collect, preserve, and make       available evidence related to the commission of these crimes;        (3) all those responsible for these crimes against humanity       and genocide should be tracked, sanctioned, arrested,       prosecuted, and punished under applicable international       criminal statutes and conventions;        (4) every Government and multinational body should call       such atrocities by their rightful names of ``crimes against       humanity'', ``war crimes'', and ``genocide'';        (5) the Governments of Bangladesh, the United States, and       China, as well as the UNHCR and other actors, should only       support repatriations to Burma when the conditions for safe,       voluntary and dignified returns are achieved, including that       of removing any impunity for Burma's military, security       forces, and vigilantes with respect to their actions       contributing to the systemic deprivation of the human rights,       such as physical safety, citizenship, freedom of movement,       and livelihoods, of the Rohingya;        (6) the President should impose additional sanctions on       senior members of the Burmese military and security forces       who are responsible for genocide and human rights abuses,       including Tatmadaw Commander-In-Chief Min Aung Hliang;        (7) independent and professional journalism play a central       role in strengthening democratic governance, upholding the       rule of law, mitigating conflict, and informing public       opinion around the world; and        (8) the Burmese military and Government should--        (A) provide immediate, unimpeded access to northern Rakhine       by UNHCR, UNDP, other humanitarian actors, and journalists,       in order to verify that the necessary conditions exist for       voluntary, safe, dignified, and sustainable returns by       displaced Rohingya in a manner consistent with       internationally recognized human rights and principles for       refugee protection;        (B) change the laws and policies that have contributed to       insecurity in the Rakhine State; and        (C) rescind any laws that obstruct the freedom of the       press; and        (9) State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win       Myint should pardon and immediately release from prison Wa       Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, as well as all other journalists and       political prisoners.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, with this resolution, the House will take the important  step of naming the atrocities committed against the Rohingya people in  Burma for what they are. The word for that is ``genocide.''   The Rohingya people, predominantly of Burma's Rakhine State, are  often called the world's most persecuted minority. The Rohingya are  essentially stateless people, as the Burmese Government refuses to  recognize them as citizens, despite the fact that the Rohingya people  have lived in Burma for generations. Further, institutional  restrictions on the Rohingya have impacted their rights to study, work,  travel, access healthcare services, practice religion, and even to  marry.   The most recent wave of persecution began in August 2017, when  Burmese security forces and civilian mobs began a horrific wave of  attacks. Mass murder, rape, and destruction of villages throughout  Rakhine State has been well documented. We have talked to the  survivors.   These atrocities have driven 700,000 Rohingya from their homes to  Bangladesh, bringing the total Rohingya refugee population in that  country to nearly 1 million. Bangladesh has been very generous in  accepting all these refugees in the face of such dire circumstances.   A year and a half later, the evidence is overwhelming. As I said at  our hearing on the subject this past September,  [[Page H10063]]  it is time that we take the next step in declaring that these crimes  amount to genocide.   In September, the State Department released a report on the stomach- turning, systematic, and widespread acts of violence against the  Rohingya in northern Rakhine State, but failed to label these  atrocities genocide.   The State Department's investigation revealed countless heart- wrenching pieces of evidence, like the account of one woman who hid in  bushes as she watched Burmese soldiers throw infants and toddlers into  a river to drown and shot the mothers of these infants who tried to  save them.   The United States has a moral obligation to call these crimes  genocide. Failing to do so gives the perpetrators cover and hinders  efforts to bring those accountable to justice. With this resolution,  the House fulfills its part of that duty.   The measure also accomplishes a number of other important goals. It  provides a thorough accounting of the crisis, calls out the complicit  Burmese Government, urges the Secretary of State to join us in formally  declaring genocide, and promotes multilateral agreement on that  declaration.   Importantly, the resolution also calls for the immediate pardon and  release of two journalists who were framed and jailed by Burmese  authorities for shining a light on some of the atrocities by government  forces.   Congress has a proud legacy of declaring genocide when warranted,  just as we did over 2 years ago when the House voted unanimously to  declare ISIS' atrocities against religious minorities in Iraq and in  Syria genocide. It is time to take this sober step again.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure and  fulfilling our responsibility to reinforce the universal values we hold  dear.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the chairwoman emeritus of  the Committee on Foreign Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), a senior member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee. He is the author of this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank my colleagues on the  committee for actually, again, speaking with one voice on this issue,  especially the author, Representative Chabot, but also Representatives  Engel, Schiff, Yoho, Sherman, Comstock, and Crowley for joining as  original cosponsors.   Mr. Speaker, this past September our committee convened another  hearing to examine the desperate living conditions of Rohingya refugees  in Bangladesh, and again we heard the story of survivors, all  describing the same methodical, unthinkable acts of terror perpetrated  by the Burmese military and by the security forces. Witnesses had no  doubt that, based on all the evidence, genocide had occurred.   It is time Congress, the administration, and the rest of the world  called these atrocities by their rightful name, and that is genocide.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1149) recognizing that the United  States-Republic of Korea alliance serves as a linchpin of regional  stability and bilateral security, and exemplifies the broad and deep  military, diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties shared between the  United States and the Republic of Korea.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows                                H. Res. 1149         Whereas the United States Armed Forces and South Korean       troops fought together to defend the Korean peninsula from       Communist aggression before the Korean Armistice Agreement       was signed in 1953, and the United States of America and the       Republic of Korea have continued this camaraderie since       signing the Mutual Defense Treaty Between the United States       and the Republic of Korea that same year;        Whereas the Republic of Korea is a model for alliance       burden-sharing, currently hosting 28,500 American active-duty       military personnel, funding fifty percent of the total non-      personnel costs of the U.S. troop presence on the Korean       peninsula, fielding the world's seventh-largest military, and       spending over 2.5 percent of its gross domestic product on       defense;        Whereas the Republic of Korea is among the closest allies       of the United States, having contributed troops in support of       United States operations during the Vietnam war, Gulf war,       and operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while also supporting       numerous United Nations peacekeeping missions throughout the       world;        Whereas United States forces on the Korean Peninsula are       critical not only to the security of the Republic of Korea       but also to protect against adversaries that threaten       regional stability and the United States homeland;        Whereas the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces Command is the most       integrated and effective combined military command in the       world and, taken together with the United Nations Command,       has formed a structure that has provided effective defense       and deterrence on the Korean Peninsula for decades;        Whereas North Korea has the world's fourth-largest       military, in addition to potentially as many as 60 nuclear       weapons and between 2,500 and 5,000 metric tons of chemical       weapons;        Whereas the United States supports the Republic of Korea's       efforts at peace and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula       and recognizes the critical importance of close policy       coordination between Washington and Seoul;        Whereas in February 2017, a United Nations investigatory       body confirmed that North Korea attempted to sell key       materials for constructing miniaturized nuclear warheads, and       found that ballistic missile cooperation between Iran and       North Korea was ``significant and meaningful'';        Whereas the United States and South Korea share a       commitment to democracy, human rights, and free market       principles, as laid out in the 2009 U.S.-ROK Joint Vision       Statement as the foundation for a 21st century ``strategic       alliance'' based on shared values;        Whereas the Republic of Korea actively contributes to       peacekeeping, cybersecurity, non-proliferation, overseas       development assistance, climate change mitigation,       counterterrorism, and post-conflict stabilization;        Whereas the Republic of Korea suffered economic retaliation       from China for installing the United States Theater High       Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) ballistic missile defense       system, a measure necessitated by North Korea's nuclear and       ballistic missile belligerence;        Whereas Korea is the world's eleventh-largest economy and       the sixth-largest goods trading partner of the United States,       and  [[Page H10066]]       creates bilateral trade and investment which supports 400,000       American jobs;        Whereas the United States is the largest foreign direct       investor in the Republic of Korea, and Korean investment in       the United States is increasing;        Whereas the Republic of Korea evolved from authoritarian       governance to a vibrant, model democracy that embraces human       rights and the rule of law in a region increasingly       challenged by authoritarianism, which stands in stark       contrast to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which       commits human rights violations ``that do not have any       parallel in the contemporary world'' according to a 2014       United Nations report;        Whereas the Republic of Korea has become a key stakeholder       and an active and constructive participant in various       international organizations, including the United Nations, G-      20, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,       Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, Association of       Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum, International       Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization;        Whereas Korean American Day commemorates the first arrival       of Koreans to the United States in 1903 and honors the great       contributions of Korean Americans across all aspects of       society, which will only continue to grow as this population       now numbers nearly two million citizens and as Korean       students constitute the third-largest source of foreign       students in the United States; and        Whereas the Korean-American community remains one of the       most important bridges between the Republic of Korea and the       United States and has helped foster deeper ties between the       two nations: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) recognizes that the United States-Republic of Korea       alliance serves as a linchpin of regional stability and       bilateral security, and exemplifies the broad and deep       military, diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties shared       between the United States and the Republic of Korea;        (2) reiterates that the Republic of Korea and the United       States share an interest in the continued strength of the       bilateral alliance, and in further deepening the bilateral       relationship;        (3) emphasizes that the United States-Republic of Korea       alliance remains not only a bulwark for peace and stability       in Northeast Asia, but also an exemplar of democratic values,       free market principles, commitment to universal human rights,       and the rule of law throughout the Indo-Pacific and globally;        (4) reaffirms the need for the United States and the       Republic of Korea to stand shoulder-to-shoulder in continuing       to apply the economic and financial pressure necessary to       help peacefully end the Democratic People's Republic of       Korea's dangerous nuclear and missile programs; and        (5) emphasizes that, regardless of the outcome of attempted       negotiations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea,       the United States-Republic of Korea alliance will continue to       deter, defend against, and defeat any outside aggressors,       uphold the peace, and guard the prosperity built by our two       nations.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, strengthening U.S.-Korea ties has been one of my top  priorities in Congress. As a southern Californian, I have seen  firsthand how Korean Americans serve as pillars not only for their  communities in the U.S., but also for the friendship between the U.S.  and South Korea.   It was an honor to see my former staff member, Young Kim, represent  my Orange County neighbors and myself in the California State Assembly.  She served ably and energetically. Her story is the same as so many  South Koreans who have come to this country and thrived.   The United States has no better partner in the Asia Pacific than the  Republic of Korea. We signed the KORUS Free Trade Agreement, which went  into effect in 2012. Since enactment of the KORUS Free Trade Agreement  in 2012, trade has flourished, creating jobs in America and South  Korea. In fact, South Korea is now our sixth largest trading partner,  and, today, this partnership remains as important as ever as we look at  the growing challenges across Asia.   We stood by Seoul as it was wrongfully punished by China for  installing the THAAD ballistic missile defense system. And we continue  to lead in helping to address the grave and immediate threats North  Korea poses to Seoul and poses to the United States and our neighboring  partners.   Despite recent diplomatic efforts, it was recently reported that  North Korea has expanded a missile base along the Chinese border. A  nearby second facility was also uncovered, while numerous undeclared  missile bases have now been identified. And last month, North Korea's  official news media reported that it successfully tested a new ``state- of-the-art weapon that has been long developed . . . significantly  improving the combat power of our people's army.'' That is their quote.   These provocations and developments should underscore the threat we  face from North Korea. That is why it is so important that we continue  to press forward together with a campaign of maximum financial and  diplomatic pressure. We must remain clear-eyed that the third  generation of the Kim regime poses just as significant of a threat to  us, our partners, and, most acutely, the North Korean people as ever.   Again, the U.S. has no better friend in Asia or anywhere else in the  world than South Korea. We must continue to strengthen this  partnership, particularly in the face of the threats we continue to  face.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Asia an the Pacific.     Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I again recognize and thank Eliot Engel  for his work on all of these measures, and I also recognize the  importance of the U.S.-South Korean partnership. I have discussed the  importance of that defense relationship as we stood shoulder to  shoulder during the Korean war and how our economic partnership,  bolstered by the enactment of the KORUS FTA, supports 400,000 American  jobs.                                time  1500    While we discuss the importance of this partnership, I want to  recognize that there is no greater bridge between our countries than  the Korean American community. Since first arriving in the United  States in 1903, they have worked tirelessly to form closer bonds  between the United States and South Korea. And looking forward, the  U.S. will remain committed to this important relationship.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1157) reaffirming the strong  commitment of the United States to the countries and territories of the  Pacific Islands region.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows                                H. Res. 1157         Whereas the Pacific Islands countries and territories are       home to more than 10 million culturally diverse people and       are rooted in a unique culture and history spanning thousands       of years;        Whereas the South Pacific region, of which the Pacific       Islands countries and territories are an integral part, is       endowed with a resource-rich ocean stretching over 20 million       square miles;        Whereas the United States partnership with the countries of       the Pacific Islands region dates back to the battles of World       War II on the shores of Tarawa, Pelelieu, and Guadalcanal,       where Pacific Islanders and Americans alike sacrificed for       our collective security;        Whereas the United States territories of American Samoa,       Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands       are located in the South Pacific region and some of these       relationships date back to the Spanish-American War;        Whereas the United States is committed to the future       security and prosperity of the Pacific Islands countries and       territories and is responsible for security and defense       matters in and relating to Palau, the Federated States of       Micronesia, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands under       their respective Compacts of Free Association;        Whereas the Compacts of Free Association arrangements with       the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the       Marshall Islands were renewed in 2003 for a period of 20       years and negotiations regarding the subsequent renewal of       these agreements should be concluded in advance of their       expiration in 2023;        Whereas the South Pacific region is critical to United       States national security and defense, and there are several       United States military bases and testing sites in the region,       including the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test       Site on the Marshall Islands;        Whereas the United States cooperates closely with Pacific       Islands countries and territories as a partner committed to a       common future that advances national security, regional       cooperation, and trust and collaborating on a wide range of       important issues such as addressing environmental and public       health threats, distributing humanitarian assistance and       disaster relief, and promoting peace and prosperity in the       region;        Whereas in the Boe Declaration of 2018, leaders of Pacific       Islands countries and territories reaffirmed that the threat       of climate change imperils the livelihoods, security, and       well-being of the peoples of such countries and territories;        Whereas a major priority of Pacific Islands countries and       territories is addressing environmental and sustainability       challenges, including responding to national disasters, and       implementing environmental programs to address mitigating       their unique vulnerabilities to the effects of rising sea       levels, combatting ocean acidification, and protecting       natural resources, and extreme weather events remains a       priority for and point of collaboration between the United       States and Pacific Islands countries;        Whereas the United States works closely with Australia and       New Zealand and other like-minded partners in the South       Pacific region, and there is opportunity for enhancing such       cooperation as all three countries look for opportunities to       increase their focus on this important region;        Whereas China's increased influence in the South Pacific       region and the possibility of a future Chinese military       presence in this region could expand its monitoring and       surveillance capabilities, threatening the United States       military presence in the region;        Whereas media reports revealed that Chinese scientists       placed acoustic sensors in the Mariana Trench near Guam and       near the island of Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia,       which could be used to monitor United States submarine       activity in the region;        Whereas planned casino resort developments by Chinese       investors on the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands       could complicate Department of Defense plans on the islands       for extensive training and exercises resulting from the       relocation of Marines from Okinawa, Japan;        Whereas a bilateral agreement between the United States and       Japan will relocate approximately 4,100 United States Marines       from Okinawa, Japan to Guam, significantly bolstering United       States national security in the region;        Whereas official Chinese Government statements and policy       documents indicate that the Pacific Islands are a component       of the Belt and Road Initiative, which according to the       Department of Defense aims ``to develop strong economic ties       with other countries, shape their interests to align with       China's, and deter confrontation or criticism of China's       approach to sensitive issues'';        Whereas the Lowy Institute found that China has pledged       $5.88 billion worth of aid to the region since 2011, yet       despite these large commitments, China has only spent $1.26       billion so far and concerns remain over the types of loans       extended and whether the commitments will be kept;        Whereas recent debt sustainability analysis by the World       Bank shows that nine Pacific Islands countries and       territories are currently classified as either at high or       moderate risk of debt distress;        Whereas China continues to shrink the number of Taiwan's       international partners around the globe by inducing countries       to switch recognition through financial incentives and six of       Taiwan's remaining diplomatic allies in the Pacific Islands       region advocate on Taiwan's behalf at the United Nations and       other international fora;        Whereas the United States plays an active role in regional       fisheries management through its involvement in the Western       and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission and in maintaining       programs to help Pacific Island countries combat illegal       fishing, including bilateral ``shiprider'' agreements that       allow law enforcement officers of host partner countries       onboard United States Coast Guard ships and aircraft to       patrol national exclusive economic zones;        Whereas the United States, through more than 17 departments       and agencies, committed more than $350 million in fiscal year       2017 to engagement with Pacific Islands countries;        Whereas the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal       Year 2018 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018       authorized and appropriated $123.8 million in funding through       2024 for the 2010 Palau Compact Review Agreement;        Whereas every two years, the United States Navy's Pacific       Fleet hosts the world's largest international maritime       exercise, known as the ``Rim of the Pacific'', for which this       past year Tongan Marines traveled to Hawaii with Australia's       Navy to participate and Fiji has been invited to join the       exercise in 2020; and        Whereas in September 2018 at the 30th Pacific Islands Forum       in Nauru, Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke stated the       United States ``see[s] all of the Pacific Islands as an       essential part of our free and open Indo-Pacific policy'':       Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) reaffirms its strong commitment to United States       engagement with all countries and territories of the South       Pacific region, including the Cook Islands, the Federated       States of Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Kiribati,       Nauru, New Caledonia, Niue, the Republic of Palau, Papua New       Guinea, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Samoa, the       Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu;        (2) reaffirms its strong support to the United States       Pacific Island territories of Guam, the Commonwealth of the       Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa, home to nearly       300,000 United States citizens;        (3) supports continued efforts to deepen cooperation with       countries and territories of the Pacific Islands in areas of       mutual interest, such as addressing the negative impacts of       climate change, promoting sustainable economic development,       and supporting regional organizations and stability;        (4) calls for the United States to increase the frequency       of high-level bilateral and multilateral visits with leaders       of Pacific Islands;        (5) promotes and supports efforts by Australia, New       Zealand, France, and other like-minded partners to strengthen       Pacific Islands countries' sovereignty and development       through economic and security assistance; and        (6) encourages continued support for the Compacts of Free       Association which enhance the strategic posture of the United       States in the Western Pacific, reinforce United States       regional commitment, preempt potential adversaries from       establishing positional advantage, and further self-      governance, economic development, and self-sufficiency of the       Freely Associated States.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material in the record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize Representative Bordallo for  introducing this measure on an important but often overlooked part of  the world, and that is the South Pacific.   Mr. Speaker, the Pacific Islands are an essential part of the South  Pacific region. Today we express our commitment to these countries' and  territories' security and to their prosperity.   Our country has a long history with the Pacific Islands and  territories. Today we have 300,000 United States citizens that reside  in the territories of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana  Islands and in American Samoa.   The U.S. is engaged in this important region through a variety of  programs which promote national security and also regional cooperation.  They address conservation and public health threats. They distribute  humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and they promote peace and  prosperity.   The United States has supported these endeavors under the Compacts of  Free Association with Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and  the Republic of the Marshall Islands. These important arrangements have  allowed the U.S. to project a presence in the region for 30 years, but  these compacts expire in 2023.   The United States must continue to reassure the Pacific Island  countries of our enduring commitment to having a continuing presence in  the region and negotiate compact renewals before they expire.   Our relationship with this region is unfolding against the backdrop  of a shifting strategic environment where Beijing and others seek to  wield a greater influence in the South Pacific.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this  measure which reaffirms the importance of continuing to engage and  cooperate with the Pacific Island countries and territories.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, with the shifting strategic environment of the South  Pacific, it is really more important than ever that we engage Pacific  Island nations and the Pacific Islands Forum to solve regional problems  and to promote prosperity.   We must maintain support for the Compacts of Free Association which  enhance the strategic posture of the U.S. and the Western Pacific,  which also reinforce our regional commitment and preempt potential  adversaries from establishing positional advantage there.   This resolution signals our resolve to maintain and deepen our  collaboration with our friends and allies in the Pacific Islands and  territories. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to join me in support of  this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1165) condemning the Assad regime and  its backers for their continued support of war crimes and crimes  against humanity in Syria.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 1165         Whereas Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, with the support       of Iran and the Russian Federation, has committed widespread       atrocities against the people of Syria, leading to one of the       worst humanitarian crises in over 70 years, including the       deaths of more than 500,000 people, the destruction of more       than 50 percent of Syria's critical infrastructure, and the       forced displacement of more than 14 million people;        Whereas the Assad regime, with the support of Iran and the       Russian Federation, has conducted violent attacks against       humanitarian aid workers, supplies, facilities, transports,       and assets, and impeded the access and secure movement of       humanitarian personnel, and has used chemical weapons against       the Syrian people on numerous occasions;        Whereas since the introduction of Russian forces into Syria       in September 2015, Russia has deployed over 68,000 Russian       personnel to help sustain the Assad regime, and has       reportedly transferred the S-300 surface-to-air missile       system to Syria, giving Russia, Iran, Hezbollah, and other       Iranian-backed militias additional cover for their activities       in Syria;        Whereas Iran is estimated to have deployed over 3,000       Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and regular Iranian       military advisers to Syria and approximately 20,000 militia       fighters, including 'Asaib ahl al-Haqq, Harakat Hezbollah al-      Nujaba, Fatimeyoun, and Zainabiyoun, which continue to expand       their presence in Syria;        Whereas Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats has       stated ``it's unlikely Russia has the will or capability to       fully implement and counter Iranian decision and influence''       in Syria;        Whereas Iran's positions in Syria, which Iran has used to       launch rockets and drones toward Israel, are critical to       Iran's efforts to create a ``land bridge'' from Iran through       Iraq and Syria to Lebanon so that it can arm Hezbollah in       Lebanon with rockets and missiles, and increase the accuracy       of Hezbollah's munitions;        Whereas Iranian-backed militias have demolished civilian       areas, implemented sieges, and evicted civilian residents       throughout Syria in a campaign of forced displacement, where       Iranian-funded reconstruction plans to sell housing       developments to foreign militias risk establishing a       permanent Iranian presence and obstacle for return of       thousands of Syrian families who fled Syria; and        Whereas the Syrian Government has reportedly signed       agreements with Iran and IRGC controlled companies with       respect to military cooperation: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) supports a political solution to the conflict which       will result in the air space of Syria no longer being       utilized by the Assad regime or Russia to target civilians,       an end to the sieges carried out by Assad, Russia, Iran,       Hezbollah, and other Iranian-backed militias, and the release       of all political prisoners;        (2) opposes international reconstruction funds from       supporting projects in Syria in areas controlled by the Assad       regime as long as the Assad regime remains in power;        (3) condemns the Assad regime, the Government of the       Russian Federation, the Government of Iran, and Hezbollah and       other Iranian-backed militias for their continued support of       war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria, including       the widespread use of torture, summary executions, prolonged       sieges, forced relocations, and indiscriminate targeting of       civilians and humanitarian actors;        (4) recognizes that as long as the Assad regime remains in       power, it will continue to oppress the Syrian people, the       Russian Federation will continue to expand its influence in       the Middle East, and Iran will remain entrenched in Syria;        (5) calls upon the President and Secretary of State to work       towards a sustainable political transition in Syria that       results in a government in Syria that is not a danger to its       own people, abandons its chemical weapons program, allows for       the safe, dignified, and voluntary return of displaced       persons, and does not provide Iran with a platform to       threaten Syria's neighbors;        (6) urges the President and the Secretary of State develop       a strategy to prevent a permanent Iranian presence in Syria,       understanding that the Russia Federation has not proven to be       a viable partner to help in this effort;        (7) urges the Secretary of State to investigate and       determine whether the forced displacement of Syrian civilians       from their homes through brutal sieges, starvation, and       indiscriminate targeting of civilians, and repopulation with       foreign fighters constitutes sectarian or ethnic cleansing;       and        (8) calls on the President and Secretary of State to       determine whether militias operating in Syria under the       command of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),       including Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, Fatemiyoun,       Zainabioun, and 'Asaib ahl al-Haq are terrorist organizations       and meet the criteria for sanctions pursuant to Executive       Order 13460 or 13582.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution represents a broad bipartisan agreement  that there will be no peace in Syria as long as the Assad regime  remains in power and as long as Russia and Iran continue their  entrenchment in that country.   For 7 years, the world has watched the brutal dictator, Bashar al- Assad, inflict untold suffering on the Syrian people. Since the  beginning of the conflict, half a million people have been killed and  13 million, largely women and children, remain in dire need of basic  humanitarian assistance in Syria.   The brutal Assad regime continues its onslaught on the civilian  population in Syria, aided by the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard  Corps on the ground and the Russian Air Force in the sky.   Rather than working to eject Iran from Syria, Russia has been  directly coordinating with Hezbollah, with the IRGC, and with other  Iranian-backed militias that have expanded significantly throughout  Syria.                                time  1515    Russia has even now reportedly transferred the S-300 surface-to-air  missile system to Syria, giving these militias additional cover for  their activities in Syria.   Despite signing a deescalation agreement with President Trump last  year  [[Page H10071]]  promising a cease-fire in southern Syria, Russia directly assisted  Iranian-backed militias in their takeover of southern Syria, moving  these militias right up to the border with Israel.   This resolution makes clear that it is unrealistic to believe that  Russia will ever be a reliable partner to counter the Iranian presence  in Syria.   As Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats has stated so clearly:         It's unlikely Russia has the will or capability to fully       implement and counter Iranian decision and influence in       Syria.    This resolution also states that Iranian-backed militias should be  investigated for the war crime of sectarian cleansing for their forced  displacement of civilians in the Damascus suburbs, which has included  demolishing civilian areas, implementing brutal sieges, and selling  housing developments and then turning them over, once they have been  occupied by these militias, to Iranian-backed militias, including  Hezbollah.   Finally, this resolution calls for the administration to act quickly  to develop a strategy towards a political transition in Syria where the  Assad regime leaves power and all Iranian and Russian forces leave the  country.   The Assad regime's atrocities, which include the use of chemical  weapons, barrel bombs, and brutal sieges, helped create the conditions  whereby ISIS emerged in the first place.   The regime's continued survival, along with the Iranian influence in  Syria, will only perpetuate the cycle of violence, once again creating  the conditions for the reemergence of ISIS or al-Qaida and other  radical Islamist groups.   After 7 years of horror, U.S. policy in Syria should be guided by  this key reality: there is no solution to the conflict in Syria as long  as the brutal Assad regime remains in power.   Efforts to legitimatize the regime through so-called constitutional  reform negotiations or in allowing Assad to run in elections are  unrealistic and are doomed to fail.   Mr. Speaker, lastly, I want to thank my colleague and friend, the  ranking member of this committee, Mr. Engel, for his efforts over the  years in order to try to focus our attention.   From the beginning, when this process of people protesting in  Damascus began with people walking through the street saying,  ``Peaceful, peaceful,'' and we watched on CNN as the automatic weapons  of Assad's forces opened up on those peaceful protesters, from that day  on, Mr. Engel worked to try to get engagement and to head off some of  this crisis, the magnitude of which we deal with today as a result of  the Iranian militias.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), who chairs the Foreign  Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mast), a member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee and the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume   In closing, I thank my colleagues, the ranking member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee, Mr. Engel; Major Brian Mast of Florida; as well as  the leadership on both sides of the aisle, for their bipartisan work on  this resolution.   The Syrian people deserve a government that respects basic human  rights and a government that is free of Iranian-backed militias. As  long as the Assad regime remains in power, this will not be the case.   The administration needs to develop a strategy toward a sustainable  political transition in Syria and to prevent Iranian entrenchment,  recognizing that Russia has not been a reliable partner in either  effort.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to back this resolution to once  again condemn the Assad regime, Russia, and Iran for their unspeakable  crimes against the Syrian people, and I yield back the balance of my  time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1035) expressing opposition to the  completion of Nord Stream II, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 1035         Whereas Nord Stream II is an underwater gas pipeline that,       if completed, will transport natural gas from the Russian       Federation through the Baltic Sea to Germany;        Whereas Russia controls the supply of nearly 40 percent of       Europe's gas and 11 European countries rely on Russian gas       for 75 percent or more for their annual needs;        Whereas Nord Stream II will increase Russian control over       the European energy market;        Whereas Donald Tusk, the President of the European Council,       stated that Nord Stream II would ``not help diversification,       nor would it reduce [European] dependency'' on Russian gas;        Whereas it has been longstanding United States policy to       support European energy security through diversification of       supplies, such as the Southern Gas Corridor which will       deliver Caspian Sea energy resources to Southern and Central       Europe;        Whereas the existing Ukrainian gas transit system currently       has 55 billion cubic meters of spare capacity which is equal       to Nord Stream II's planned capacity;        Whereas Ukraine has been a stable and reliable transit hub       for energy flowing to European destinations;        Whereas Russia's geopolitical interest in Nord Stream II is       not to increase European energy security, but rather to drive       a wedge between countries in Europe and drastically diminish       Ukraine's political leverage regarding Russia and the       significant income Ukraine derives from transit fees;        Whereas according to Deputy Assistant Secretary of State       for Energy Diplomacy, Sandra Oudkirk, ``because [Nord Stream       II] has such a potentially large impact on the national       security of some of our largest partners in the world, it has       an impact on our national security''; and        Whereas Members of Congress on a bipartisan basis have       expressed strong opposition to Nord Stream II through       statements and legislation: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) finds that Nord Stream II is a drastic step backwards       for European energy security and United States interests;        (2) calls upon European governments to reject the Nord       Stream II project;        (3) urges the President to use all available means to       support European energy security through a policy of reducing       reliance on the Russia Federation; and        (4) supports the imposition of sanctions with respect to       Nord Stream II under section 232 of the Countering America's       Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (22 U.S.C. 9526).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, for many years, Russia has conducted a campaign of armed  aggression and intimidation against many neighboring countries, but  especially Ukraine and Georgia. That threat now includes massive  Russian military exercises along the border of our NATO allies and  repeated intrusions into the air and sea space of these and other  countries in Europe.   But Vladimir Putin is also employing more subtle weapons of  influence. This includes leveraging energy exports, especially oil and  natural gas. Many European countries, including key NATO allies, are  dependent on Russian energy and, thus, are vulnerable to Moscow's  pressure.   But even as the United States, its NATO allies, and other partners  are seeking to impose economic costs on Russia to force it to end its  aggression, a massive new pipeline known as Nord Stream II is being  built. It will increase the flow of Russian gas directly to Germany and  on to other countries in the heart of Europe.   Moscow's strategy is to undermine the energy security of our NATO  allies, because the more dependent they are on Russian energy, the  greater Moscow's influence over them will be.   Nord Stream II has another purpose, which is to strike at Ukraine. It  will end Moscow's reliance on Ukraine's natural gas pipelines, thereby  cutting off an important source of revenue and eliminating one of  Ukraine's few means of leverage against Russian aggression.   H.R. 3364, the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions  Act, which I introduced and was passed overwhelmingly by Congress,  authorizes the President to impose sanctions on persons assisting the  construction of this and other pipelines.   This resolution recognizes the danger that Nord Stream II represents  to the Atlantic alliance and urges the President to use the authority  Congress has given him to prevent this pipeline from being constructed.   If Nord Stream II is completed, it will undermine U.S. interests in  Europe by rendering key NATO allies more vulnerable to Russian  blackmail and convincing Moscow that its policy of aggression is, in  fact, succeeding.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time, and I ask unanimous  consent that the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) control  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, last month's Russian attack on  Ukrainian vessels attempting to pass through the Kerch Strait is a  dramatic reminder of Vladimir Putin's continued aggression. This was  not an isolated incident. Russia has opened a new front in the Sea of  Azov, where it is attempting to choke off Ukrainian imports and exports  and greatly undermine Ukraine's economy.   This is a dangerous escalation. In the past, Moscow has attempted to  disguise its armed intervention in Ukraine by claiming that its troops  and weapons in the eastern regions belong to the separatist entities  there.   Now let me share with you, Mr. Speaker, the reality that, in the  east, there is Russian armor. Eliot Engel and I traveled to  Dnipropetrovsk in the east, in the Russian-speaking east of Ukraine,  with a delegation of four Republicans and four Democrats. We traveled  in order to talk to those who were trying to deal with the fact that  Russian military was rolling over provinces in Ukraine. But now Russia  is openly using its own military against Ukraine in the territory of  Crimea that it has illegally occupied and annexed. They are using the  fleet.   The United States and its allies and partners must hold Russia  accountable. Failure to do so may be interpreted by Moscow as a green  light to go even further, a miscalculation that could result in a  dangerous military escalation.   This resolution sends two messages. The first is to the Ukrainian  people, to demonstrate that we remain committed in assisting them in  their fight for freedom. The second, of course, is to Moscow, to make  clear that the U.S. will oppose Russian aggression whenever it occurs.   I urge the President to ensure, by his words and actions, that Moscow  understands the potential consequences of its actions and the  commitment of the United States to the freedom, sovereignty, and  independence of Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take  from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 1918) to oppose loans at  international financial institutions for the Government of Nicaragua  unless the Government of Nicaragua is taking effective steps to hold  free, fair, and transparent elections, and for other purposes, with the  Senate amendment thereto, and concur in the Senate amendment.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take  from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 3342) to impose sanctions on  foreign persons that are responsible for gross violations of  internationally recognized human rights by reason of the use by  Hizballah of civilians as human shields, and for other purposes, with  the Senate amendments thereto, and concur in the Senate amendments.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  the Committee on Foreign Affairs be discharged from further  consideration of H. Res. 931, and ask for its immediate consideration  in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    I have an amendment to this text at the  desk.
