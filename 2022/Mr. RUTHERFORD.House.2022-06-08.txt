 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R.  7910 because this bill does nothing to stop human violence, which is  the real problem at hand here.   Straw purchases are already illegal. You can't buy a gun for someone  else to get around the background check. Bump stocks are already  regulated like automatic weapons, thanks to the Trump administration.   Infringing on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans is  not the answer. In fact, the bill before us will even make criminals  out of legal gun owners.   This bill would put the Federal Government in charge of law-abiding  citizens and how they store their firearms  [[Page H5383]]  inside their own homes. This bill puts firearms storage over and above  self-defense.   Instead, let's work together to address human violence problems by  bolstering our mental health system, identifying individuals before  they become active shooters and mass murderers, and improving our  school safety through crime prevention through environmental design,  CPTED. It can be done.                                time  1645
