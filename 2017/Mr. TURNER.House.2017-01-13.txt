 Mr. Speaker, the United States and our allies currently  face some of the most complex security challenges in our recent  history. ISIS continues to sweep across much of the Middle East. An  expansionist China continues to develop its military prowess in order  to counter the United States and its allies in the region. We continue  to face a nuclear threat posed by countries such as North Korea and  Iran; and an increasingly hostile Russia seeks to destabilize much of  Europe.   It is imperative that the Department of Defense not lose continuity  in leadership, administration, and governance. General Mattis must be  confirmed expeditiously. Such a lapse would create vulnerabilities in  our national security strategy and would be detrimental to the safety  and security of our Armed Forces.   Civilian control of military is undoubtedly crucial to the success  and health of our Defense Department. This candidate's military  experience alone should not bar him from serving in a civilian role as  the Secretary of Defense. It actually enhances the capabilities he  brings to the job. This is a unique exception for a candidate whose  exemplary leadership and experience would come at a crucial time for  our country and for our men and women in uniform.   I understand that many of our colleagues across the aisle are  choosing to vote against a waiver for General Mattis, despite the fact  that they support General Mattis himself as an eminently qualified  nominee for the Secretary of Defense. That is a mistake. To do so is  self-defeating.   Under these circumstances, a vote against the process by which  General Mattis is nominated is, in fact, a vote against General Mattis  himself from becoming our next Secretary of Defense.   I thank Chairman Thornberry for his leadership throughout these  important deliberations and for his work for obtaining this waiver for  General Mattis and for the future of the service of General Mattis to  our country.   I urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support S. 84.
