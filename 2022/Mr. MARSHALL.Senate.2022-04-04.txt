 Madam President, I rise today to honor and  recognize Leo Khayet of Overland Park, KS. Leo has raised more than  $200,000 in an effort to help Ukrainian people in Odessa evacuate the  country as Russia continues its attacks.   These invasions hit close to home for Leo. When Leo was younger, his  family had to make the hard decision to relocate from Belarus for a  better life. He lived in refugee camps in Austria and Italy for five  months prior to arriving in Kansas City in 1989. Leo is now an  entrepreneur in Overland Park, which gave him connections to multiple  different businesses in the Kansas City area. When Russia invaded in  late February, Leo gathered his resources from these leaders  andorganizations making his efforts to help possible.   Thus far, Leo has been successful in helping 2,000 Ukrainians flee to  safety in Moldova. In an effort to continue helping victims of the war  in Ukraine, Leo is planning on hosting another Zoom call and inviting  more prominent business leaders in the area to gather and keep  providing this humanitarian aid. It is truly honorable what he is doing  to help the people of Ukraine. Leo said it best: ``In this case, this  has really brought out the best of the community here in Kansas.  They're ready to save people who they have no clue who they are, that  live thousands of miles away, they don't even share a common language  with them, besides the fact that we're human beings and I think that is  amazing.'' It truly is amazing to see what one man's ambition and  determination can do to bring a community together and help those in  need. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the noble act of  Leo Khayet and thank him for his dedication to help Ukraine.                            ____________________
