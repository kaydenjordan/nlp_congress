 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the  legendary University of Arkansas football coach, Frank Broyles, who  passed away August 14 at the age of 92. He spent his life in service to  the university, its student athletes, and our great State.   I was fortunate to have been recruited by and played for Coach  Broyles as an offensive tackle in the early 1970s. For a kid from  Arkansas, this was a dream come true. Outside of family, the people who  have had the greatest influences on my life were my coaches, teachers,  pastors, friends, and certainly Coach Broyles is right at the top. He  was an icon in Arkansas and a legend in collegiate athletics.   As head coach of the Razorback football team from 1958 to 1976, he  turned the school's program into a national powerhouse. During his  tenure, Coach Broyles led the Razorbacks to seven Southwest Conference  titles, and a Football Association of America national championship.  Coach Broyles had tremendous charisma and had a remarkable ability to  attract and develop talent--both players and coaches. He wasn't afraid  to seek out talent to support him, and he had an innate ability to see  the strengths in people. He would turn them loose to use those  strengths to help the team and those individuals succeed. His recipe  was to get great people around him to help the program win while  helping those individuals get to where they wanted to be in their own  professional careers.   The roster of assistants under Coach Broyles reads like a Who's Who  in NFL and college football: great coaches such as Jimmy Johnson, Barry  Switzer, Johnny Majors, Joe Gibbs, Raymond Berry, and Hayden Fry--and  the list goes on and on. They were once Coach Broyles' assistants. His  legacy of producing great assistant coaches is recognized in an award  named in his honor to recognize college football assistant coaches for  the work they do. Since 1996, the Broyles Award has been given annually  to the top assistant coach in college football.   Frank Broyles' impact on the University of Arkansas went well beyond  the football field. He implemented his vision for Arkansas athletics as  the athletic director for more than three decades, helping the  university's men's program win 43 national championships during his  tenure. When he retired from the position in 2007, he continued his  devotion to the University of Arkansas working as a fundraiser at the  Razorback Foundation.   Coach Broyles used his notoriety for his most important mission,  which he undertook in his later years. He became a passionate advocate  for finding a cure for Alzheimer's and educating Americans on caring  for loved ones suffering from this disease when his wife Barbara lost  her battle with Alzheimer's in 2004. He shared the experience of his  family as caregivers to his beloved Barbara across Arkansas and brought  his story to Capitol Hill, where he encouraged lawmakers to be  passionate about Alzheimer's so we can find a cure. He told Members  they need to turn that compassion into passion to make a difference.   Coach Broyles spent his final years showing his passion for fighting  Alzheimer's and helping other families touched by the disease. When his  family was learning the best way to care for Barbara, they found there  were limited resources available to caregivers looking for assistance.  That is one of the reasons they created the Broyles Foundation and were  inspired to share what they had learned in caring for Barbara to help  other caregivers. The culmination of that effort was a book, ``Coach  Broyles' Playbook for Alzheimer's Caregivers,'' which has been  translated into 11 languages and distributed across the country.   After years of advocacy on behalf of those suffering from Alzheimer's  and their families, the disease he fought so passionately to find a  cure for ultimately took his life as well. One of the best ways we can  honor Coach Broyles' legacy is by continuing to fund research in search  of a cure for this devastating disease.   Coach Broyles brought the same energy to fighting Alzheimer's that he  brought to college football and his work on behalf of the University of  Arkansas on and off the field. He made a tremendous mark on the lives  of so many student athletes during his years as a coach, athletic  director, and all-around ambassador for the University of Arkansas and  for our State.   I was one of the many who learned from the example Coach Broyles set.  His leadership, faith, and ability to attract talent and utilize it to  make our State a better place has been a tremendous influence on me  through the years. I will be forever proud to be a Razorback and to  have had the opportunity to play for Coach Broyles.   Coach Broyles was fond of saying there are two types of people in the  world: givers and takers. Live your life as a giver, not a taker. We  lost a giver, but we are so much better for what he gave us.                        Honoring Deputy Timothy Braden    Mr. President, I would also like to pay respect to a law enforcement  officer in my home State of Arkansas who lost his life in the line of  duty, Thursday, August 24, 2017.   Drew County Sheriff's Deputy Timothy Braden gave his life while  serving and protecting the citizens of Arkansas. Deputy Braden was a  selfless servant who made a career out of helping others. He joined the  Drew County sheriff's office in February after serving 3 years at the  McGehee Police Department.   He is remembered as a kind and hard-working officer who performed his  job with a positive attitude. He had an appreciation for law  enforcement and had aspirations of serving as an Arkansas State Police  trooper. I am grateful for Deputy Braden's commitment to the community.  He represents the selfless service of our men and women who turn toward  danger to protect communities and bring criminals to justice.   He showed his dedication to the community in many ways, including  being a former member of the Arkansas National Guard and a former Eagle  Scout of the Year in his hometown, Star City. Deputy Braden's ultimate  sacrifice reminds us all of the risks members of the law enforcement  community face on a daily basis.   My thoughts and prayers go out to Deputy Braden's family, including  his wife and four young children, his friends, and the law enforcement  community. I pray they will find comfort during such a difficult time  as this.   I join all Arkansans as we express our gratitude for Deputy Braden's  service and sacrifice.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
