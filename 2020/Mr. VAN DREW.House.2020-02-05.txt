 Mr. Speaker, I would like to honor Chief Daniel Spiegel  on his retirement from the Wildwood Fire Department.   Daniel spent 28 faithful years with the fire department, where he had  served as chief since 2016. Daniel has the distinct honor of holding  every rank in the fire department. Daniel's father also served as fire  chief in Wildwood, the second-ever father-son chief in the department's  history.   Daniel served in the New Jersey Task Force 1 Urban Research and  Rescue and responded to the September 11 terrorist attacks, searching  for survivors. He was the team leader for the Cape May County Regional  Urban Search and Rescue Team, which serves all of Cape May County.   Danny was always focused on training. He trained thousands of  firefighters in our entire region.   He is planning to spend more time with his wife, daughter, and two  stepsons in retirement.   I thank Daniel for his service; his community thanks him for his  service; and his country thanks him for his service.   Daniel, may God bless you. You are truly one of our heroes.                            ____________________
