 Madam Speaker, this is in response to the  attorney general's claim that the President has constitutional immunity  from prosecution. Mr. Mueller writes: ``We were not persuaded by the  argument that the President has blanket constitutional immunity to  engage in acts that would corruptly obstruct justice through the  exercise of otherwise valid Article II powers.''   He goes on at some length to talk about what that standard is, but I  want to read the footnote in that section.   ``A possible remedy through impeachment for abuses of power would not  substitute for potential criminal liability after a President leaves  office. Impeachment would remove a President from office, but would not  address the underlying culpability of the conduct or serve the usual  purposes of the criminal law. . . .   ``Impeachment is also a drastic and rarely invoked remedy, and  Congress is not restricted to relying only on impeachment, rather than  making criminal law applicable to a former President . . . ''   That is from Volume II, page 178.
