 Speaker   Mike Johnson, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi,  Whip Clark, Chairman Aguilar, all of my colleagues, and government on  both sides of the aisle, it is an honor and a privilege to once again  stand before you as House Democratic leader.   From the very beginning of this Congress, House Democrats have made  clear that we will find bipartisan common ground with our Republican  colleagues whenever and wherever possible for the good of the American  people, and House Democrats have repeatedly done just that.   It was House Democrats who provided a majority of the votes necessary  to avoid a catastrophic default on our debt that would have crashed the  U.S. economy and triggered a job-killing recession.   It was House Democrats who provided a majority of the votes necessary  to avoid a government shutdown that would have hurt everyday Americans.   It was House Democrats who provided a majority of the votes necessary  to secure $16 billion in disaster assistance for Americans whose lives  have been devastated by extreme weather events.   From the very beginning of this Congress, House Democrats have been  governing for the people. We continue to look forward to finding  bipartisan common ground whenever and wherever possible.   House Democrats will continue to partner with President Biden and  Senate Democrats to put people over politics.   House Democrats will continue to fight for lower costs, better-paying  jobs, safer communities, and to build an economy from the middle out  and the bottom up and not the top down.   House Democrats will continue to push back against extremism in this  Chamber and throughout the country.   House Democrats will continue to protect Social Security, protect  Medicare, protect Medicaid, protect our children, protect our climate,  protect low-income families, protect working families, protect the  middle class, protect organized labor, protect the LGBTQ community,  protect our veterans, protect older Americans, protect the Affordable  Care Act, protect the right to vote, protect the peaceful transfer of  power, protect our democracy, and protect a woman's freedom to make her  own reproductive healthcare decisions.   These are blue lines in the sand, and we will work hard to make sure  that they are never crossed.   We must also continue to stand by President Biden as he works to  bring American hostages and Israeli hostages and international hostages  held by Hamas back home.                                time  1415    We must also stand by our friends on the international stage. We have  no better friend in the Middle East than the State of Israel. Israel  has a right to exist as a Jewish and democratic State. The special  relationship between the United States and Israel is unbreakable. Our  commitment to Israel's security is ironclad. Israel has a right to  defend itself under the international rules of war against the brutal  terror unleashed on its citizens by Hamas.   Our ironclad commitment to Israel's security and the effort to defeat  Hamas is not inconsistent with the goal of achieving a lasting and just  peace between Israel and the Palestinian people. In many ways, it is a  necessary ingredient because Hamas is not good for Israel. Hamas is not  is good for America. Hamas is not good for the free world. Hamas is not  good for the democratic aspirations of the Palestinian people.   We must also support Ukraine in its courageous effort to defeat  Russian aggression. There are only two paths in front of us: We can  either stand up for Ukraine or bow down to Vladimir Putin. That is not  a difficult choice.   We must stand up for America's national security. We must stand up  for democracy. We must stand up for freedom. We must stand up for  truth. We must stand up for the Ukrainian people until victory is won.   It is my expectation that in the next week or so the Senate will send  over for consideration a bipartisan national security funding package  for Israel, Ukraine, and our other allies throughout the free world  that also includes humanitarian assistance for Palestinian civilians  and others who may be in harm's way.   The House of Representatives should take up these national security  and humanitarian relief packages immediately in totality and without  delay. The time for gamesmanship is over. The time for brinksmanship is  over. The time for partisanship is over. It is time to get back to  doing the business of the American people.   Let me conclude with an observation about the state of our democracy.  Joe Biden won the 2020 Presidential election. He is doing a great job  under difficult circumstances, and no amount of election denialism will  ever change that reality. Not now, not ever.   Throughout the years, Presidents, from Ronald Reagan to Barack Obama  and Dwight Eisenhower to Lyndon Baines Johnson, have spoken to this  Chamber and urged us to put aside partisan politics for the good of the  American people.   President Lincoln spoke to this Congress on December 1, 1862, in the  middle of the Civil War, and noted that we in this institution had the  power and bore the responsibility to save the Union. The stakes were  high. As articulated by President Lincoln, we could either nobly save  or meanly lose America as we know it; the last best hope on Earth.   This is a turbulent time in the American journey, and we have but one  charge to keep during this moment of great fragility. Our Union must be  sustained. Our Union must be strengthened. Our Union must succeed.   There are many throughout this country who are understandably alarmed  at the turbulence of the moment, at the chaos, the dysfunction, and the  extremism that has been unleashed in this Chamber from the very  beginning of this Congress, but this too shall pass.   Our country has often confronted adversity. The good news is we  always find a way to make it to the other side. We faced adversity in  the 1860s in the middle of the Civil War when the country was literally  tearing itself apart. We faced adversity in October of 1929 when the  stock market collapsed, plunging us into the Great Depression. We faced  adversity in December of 1941 when a foreign power unexpectedly struck,  plunging us into a world war with an evil empire of Nazi Germany.   We faced adversity in the Deep South in the 1950s and 1960s when the  country was struggling to reconcile the inherent contradictions between  Jim Crow segregation and the glorious promises of the Constitution.   We faced adversity on September 11, 2001, when the towers and the  Pentagon were unexpectedly struck, killing thousands of lives in an  instant.   We faced adversity right here in the House of Representatives when,  on January 6, 2021, a violent mob of insurrectionists, incited by some  in this Chamber, overran the House floor as part of an effort to halt  the peaceful transfer of power.   Every time we faced adversity, the good news here in America is that  we always overcome. That is the power of American exceptionalism. That  is why America is the land of the free and the home of the brave. That  is why I remain optimistic about the future of  [[Page H5051]]  this country. That is why America is the last best hope on Earth.   God bless you. God bless the House of Representatives. God bless the  United States of America.   It is now my solemn honor and responsibility to hand over the  people's gavel here in the United States House of Representatives to a  family man, a hardworking man, a Baptist man, a southern man, a son of  a firefighter's household, the gentleman from the great State of  Louisiana and the 56th Speaker of the United States House of  Representatives, the Honorable   Mike Johnson.
