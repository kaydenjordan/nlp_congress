 Mr. President, I wish to honor our former colleague  Senator Richard Lugar, who passed away recently and whose memorial  service was this week. As the longest serving Senator from his beloved  Indiana, Richard Lugar dedicated 36 years of service to his State, the  Senate, and our Nation. He was a dear friend and mentor who already had  22 years of Senate service when I joined the Senate.   What I remember most fondly about Senator Lugar is that he combined  an extraordinary intellect with good humor. He knew so much about  foreign policy and was also so approachable that new Senators like  myself never hesitated to seek his guidance.   Senator Lugar's commitment to bipartisanship guided his engagement on  issues from international affairs to agriculture. He sought compromises  to achieve results, regardless of the political calculus. He eschewed  polarization and cautioned colleagues that, ``whatever is won today  through division is usually lost tomorrow.'' Instead he sought to  foster good will to bring together opposing sides. He continued this  effort after his service in the Senate with the Lugar Center, a  nonprofit public policy institution that seeks to improve the quality  of debate and bridge ideological divides on important issues.   It is this approach that led to great success in international  affairs from South Africa to the Philippines.   Senator Lugar viewed support for democracy and development as a  stabilizing force to counter international threats. Around the world,  partners trusted his foreign policy expertise and judgment. Perhaps his  greatest achievement was his bipartisan work with Senator Sam Nunn in  developing the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to dismantle  weapons of mass destruction in the former states of the Soviet Union,  eliminating nuclear arms in Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. His work  to limit weapons of mass destruction led to the deactivation and  destruction of thousands of nuclear warheads and ballistic missiles.  Due to Senator Lugar' s vision, leadership, and bipartisan approach, we  live in a safer world.   Through his contributions to international security, Senator Lugar  serves as a reminder of what we can achieve if we work together to face  the challenges that pose dangers to world peace and stability and, of  course, to the interests of the United States and our international  partners. As we reflect on his life and his lessons, I hope my  colleagues will honor his legacy by building bipartisan bridges to  resolve the pressing problems of today.                            ____________________
