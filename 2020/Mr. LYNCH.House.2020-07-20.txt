 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of en bloc Amendment No. 2  which includes three of my amendments, all of which are based on bills  I have introduced in the House of Representatives.   The first of these, Amendment No. 237, reauthorizes the Commission on  Wartime Contracting. This Commission has a proven track record of  helping us reduce waste and fraud in our overseas operations  contracting. We are continuing to spend billions of taxpayer dollars in  reconstruction and other support contracts overseas and we must do all  we can to ensure that those funds are being spent wisely.   This en bloc also includes amendment No. 238 which will require the  declassification of previously public information on the performance  and readiness of Afghan forces, as well as maps of Afghan Government- held areas. This data is vital to ensuring mission success and it is a  disgrace that the Administration is withholding this information from  the American people.   My final amendment No. 239, would authorize the Department of the  Treasury to establish a Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Rewards Program to  pay rewards that help identify and recover stolen assets linked to  foreign government corruption.   Inclusion of these three amendments will strengthen Congressional  oversight and government transparency, as well as provide vital tools  with which to combat fraud, waste, and corruption.   I would like to thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Thornberry  for including these amendments in this en bloc amendment.
