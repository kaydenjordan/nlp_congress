 Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic has devastated our  country for 9 months now. More than 15 million Americans have been  infected. Nearly 300,000 are dead. Our economy is on the ropes. Folks  are struggling just to get by, and Democrats have been trying to pass a  relief package for months.   Last week, Republicans finally met us at the table to negotiate a  solution. We need to get this deal done. It must address the urgent  needs of the American people by providing direct cash payments for  working families; stronger unemployment payments; relief for cities and  towns; new resources for the frontline workers who are keeping our  communities safe; and funding for testing, vaccines, hospitals, and  community health centers so we can end this pandemic and get back to  our lives.   The American people sent us here to work for them. They have waited  for far too long for Congress to pass a new relief package. Let's get  this done on their behalf and let's not leave Washington until we do.                            ____________________
