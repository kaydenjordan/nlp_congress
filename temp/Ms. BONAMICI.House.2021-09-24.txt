 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Women's  Health Protection Act because the right to abortion, a right grounded  in privacy, is under attack.   When people have the freedom to make their own personal decisions  about whether and when to become a parent, they are more likely to  attain their educational goals, maintain job mobility, achieve economic  security. But unfortunately, politicians in many States, and in this  very body, want to invade privacy and deny autonomy.   We cannot take the right to choose for granted. I urge passage of  this vital legislation because we refuse to be dragged back to the  dangerous days before Roe v. Wade. I urge everyone to support the  Women's Health Protection Act.                            ____________________
