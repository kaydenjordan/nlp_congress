 Madam Speaker, unfortunately, the Democrats continue to  investigate the President in secret back rooms of the Capitol in the  Intelligence Committee.   If the Speaker believes that the Members of Congress can ultimately  vote and impeach the President based on bogus evidence that has never  seen the light of day, then she is badly mistaken.   In the past 50 years, this body has held impeachment proceedings for  only two Presidents: One was a Democrat; one was a Republican. Those  were serious times when both parties came together to conduct solemn  business required under the Constitution, a document that we as Members  of Congress are sworn to uphold.   Conducting this impeachment process in the shadows is a mockery of  the  [[Page H8376]]  democratic process. It actually belittles our duty, and it belittles  the votes of people who duly elected this President.   Madam Speaker, in closing, I call on Speaker Pelosi to sit down with  the Republican leadership to establish an open and transparent process  based on precedent.                            ____________________
