 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Kayla Barron of  Richland, Washington, who was recently selected for NASA's 2017  Astronaut Candidate Class. Kayla was chosen 1 of 12 from over 18,000  applicants to join just 338 people who have held the prestigious title  of American astronaut.   Before applying to the NASA program, Ms. Barron attended the U.S.  Naval Academy, where she received several medals and unit commendations  while earning a bachelor's degree in systems engineering. She went on  to earn a master's degree in nuclear engineering from the University of  Cambridge. She was a member of the first class of women commissioned  into the submarine community as a submarine warfare officer.   Kayla is an exemplary role model for students interested in science  and technology. I commend her for her hard work, and I wish her luck in  her training and her future exploration endeavors.                            ____________________
