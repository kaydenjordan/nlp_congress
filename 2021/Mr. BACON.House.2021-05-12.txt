 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Director Don Burman  for his nearly 10 years of service in the United States Air Force, and  8 years of service within the Department of Veterans Affairs, 6 of  which was in Nebraska's Second District at the Nebraska-Western Iowa  Health Care System. Don is retiring from Federal service.   Don is a Vietnam-era veteran. He served as a telecommunications  center specialist, supporting the mission in Arkansas, Hawaii, also  Fort Belvoir Army installation, and the Defense Nuclear Agency in  Virginia. Don's healthcare career spans nearly 33 years, 25 of which  were in private healthcare.   In Nebraska's Second District, Don has served since March of 2015 as  the director of the Nebraska-Western Iowa Health Care System. During  his tenure, he was instrumental in proposing a partnership between the  Department of Veterans Affairs and members of the private philanthropic  community. His vision began a collaboration that produced the  groundbreaking public law known as the CHIP IN for Vets Act of 2016.  This law authorized the VA to carry out a pilot program under which it  may accept donations from non-Federal entities.   The Nebraska philanthropic community provided a gift of $30 million  to be used to construct a new 157,000-square-foot ambulatory care  clinic located on the grounds of the Omaha VA Medical Center. Through  Don's leadership, tenacity, and innovation, a second public-private  partnership recently began. CHI Health and Nebraska-Western Iowa Health  Care System opened a new 35-bed Community Living Center for veterans in  a non-VA medical facility at the CHI Health Midlands healthcare  facility.   Additionally, a new mental health pavilion and a new physical therapy  and prosthetics building have started construction. Omaha's new 500- stall parking ramp opens in November, and all seven of the current  community-based outpatient centers located around Nebraska and western  Iowa have been rebuilt and/or refreshed in order to provide the most  up-to-date healthcare facilities to veterans.   In August of 2020, Forbes named America's best employers by State,  and the Veterans Administration was cited as the best employer. Among  the 17 States mentioned, the Nebraska VA was identified. Bringing Don's  private experience and innovation to the Veterans Administration has  served our veterans well in Nebraska and western Iowa.   Don continues to use his personal and professional experience to aid  him in understanding the needs of our veterans while solving complex  issues associated with running a leading healthcare system for Nebraska  and western Iowa.   Never forgetting the mission of service to our veterans, I want to  offer my sincere appreciation to Don, who is my great friend, for his  years of dedicated service to our great Nation and to Nebraska's Second  Congressional District. Don's accomplishments in his military service,  civil service, and his private career are credits to his dedication to  the provision of world-class healthcare no matter the venue.   Don's retirement is well earned and deserved. I wish Don all the best  in his future endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge defeat of the previous  question so that we can immediately consider my bill to ensure that  those who risk their lives to protect all of us are afforded greater  protections as well.   I introduced the Back the Blue Act of 2021 with Senator Cornyn in the  Senate and my two original cosponsors in the House, Representatives  Stivers and Johnson, during Police Week because this bill is needed now  more than ever.   There have been more officers shot and killed in the last 4\1/2\  months of 2021 than all of 2020 and all of 2019. In 4\1/2\ months, we  have had more fatalities, more murders of policemen than in the whole  year of 2020 and the whole year of 2019. It is clear that we need to  enforce greater protections for those who protect us, and that is why  my colleagues and I introduced the Back the Blue Act.   The numbers are alarming. In 2018, 83 police officers were shot and  26 were killed. In 2019, 86 were shot and 18 were killed. And 2020, 89  were shot and 18 killed. This year, in 2021, as of April 30th, there  have been 91 officers shot so far, and 19 of them killed by gunfire.   Our police are being targeted. We need to defend our law enforcement  and public safety officers, and our bill does just that.   Specifically, the Back the Blue Act creates new criminal provisions  to Federal law enforcement officers; U.S. judges; and federally funded  public safety officers, such as firefighters, chaplains, and members of  a rescue squad or ambulance crew.   The Back the Blue Act creates a new Federal crime for killing,  attempting to kill, or conspiring to kill a Federal judge, Federal law  enforcement officer or a federally funded public safety officer. The  offender would be subject to the death penalty and a mandatory minimum  sentence of 30 years if death results. The offender would otherwise  face a minimum sentence of 10 years.   The bill creates a new Federal crime for assaulting a federally  funded law enforcement officer with escalating penalties, including  mandatory minimums based on the extent of any injury and the use of a  dangerous weapon. However, no prosecution can be commenced absent  certification by the Attorney General that prosecution is appropriate.   Now, I want to respond to my friend, who I respect, from Colorado. I  condemned the behavior and the riot that occurred on January 6. Over  one hundred of our policemen were injured. This bill provides extra  protections for Capitol Hill law enforcement. Those who injured our  Capitol Police on January 6 would be under greater punishment or  penalties, if convicted.   Our bill also creates a new Federal crime for interstate flight from  justice to avoid prosecution for killing, attempting to kill or  conspiring to kill a Federal judge, Federal law enforcement officer or  federally funded public safety officer. The offender would be subject  to a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years for this offense.   Lastly, the Back the Blue Act creates a specific aggravating factor  for the Federal death penalty prosecutions. It expands self-defense and  Second Amendment rights for law enforcement officers. It opens up grant  funding to strengthen relationships between police and their  communities.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our law enforcement personally. I was a  victim of crime twice, and both times I was deployed when I was  assigned to the Air Force. My house was robbed once when I was a  captain deployed to Bahrain. Another time, someone assumed a false  identity when I was a lieutenant colonel during the invasion of Iraq  when I was flying combat operations. Thankfully, one of the times the  police captured one of the perpetrators and arrested him and he was  charged for a crime.   I deployed to go to the battle. Every day our police walk out their  front door, after kissing their spouse good-bye, wondering if they are  going to encounter a violent criminal. We cannot thank our police  officers enough.   During Police Week, I urge my colleagues to support our first  responders by immediately considering and supporting the Back the Blue  Act.
