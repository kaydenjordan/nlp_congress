 Madam Chair, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1, the  polluters over people act.   I am upset that the Republicans have brought forth this bill, which  sells out the health and well-being of the American people.   For decades, scientists have warned of the devastating impacts that  human-caused climate change will have and do have on our planet.  Consider even the first 3 months of this year.   In January, Alabama and Georgia were hit by severe storms, straight- line winds, and tornadoes that caused at least nine storm-related  deaths.   In January and March, my home State of California experienced severe  winter storms, flooding, and mudslides that ended in at least 27 storm- related deaths across the State combined.   Just last week in Mississippi, there was devastation by severe storms  and tornadoes that resulted in 26 people dying.   H.R. 1 fast-tracks offshore oil and gas developments, guts bedrock  environmental and public health laws, silences communities, and  reverses the significant progress that we made through the Inflation  Reduction Act.   These are your Republican Representatives bringing forth this bill.  They are selling out the American people for oil profits.   Last Congress, Republicans had the choice to join Democrats as we  worked to deliver a historic $369 billion in climate action and clean  energy investments through the Inflation Reduction Act. Instead, they  have chosen to advance bills like this that, if implemented, will  worsen the climate crisis and put our children and grandchildren on a  path to an unlivable future.    Madam Chair, this bill chooses to put polluters over people, and I  urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1.
