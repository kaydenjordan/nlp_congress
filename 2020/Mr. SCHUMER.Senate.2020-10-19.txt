 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last week, the Republican majority on  the Senate Judiciary Committee concluded what can only be described as  a farcical set of hearings for a Supreme Court nominee. In the midst of  a pandemic, when several members of the committee majority were exposed  to or tested positive for the coronavirus or themselves were sick with  COVID-19 in the days immediately beforehand, hearings and an in-person  markup were conducted with virtually no regard for the risks.   No uniform testing protocol was put in place to protect all of the  people who had to be in that room. Why? Because the Republican majority  wanted to jam this nomination through before the election.   The chairman of the committee ignored the committee's quorum rules so  that he could conduct business without the participation of the  minority. Why? Because the Republican majority has decided to ignore  the rules, norms, and standards--even its own rules, even its own  standards--to get this nominee onto the bench.   Four short years ago, every member of the Committee on the Judiciary  said that we shouldn't approve a Supreme Court nominee in a  Presidential election year. Many refused even to meet with Obama's  nominee.   ``Use my words against me,'' Chairman Graham said, in case a Supreme  Court vacancy opened up in the final year of his term. Lindsey Graham,  in talking about himself, said: ``Lindsey Graham says let's let the  next president [decide].''   But now the Republican majority's supposed principle that we  shouldn't approve Supreme Court nominees in election years has been  exposed as a farce. It is trying to confirm a Supreme Court nominee in  the middle of a national election. The Republican majority is running  the most hypocritical, most partisan, and least legitimate process in  the history of Supreme Court confirmations. Again, the Republican  majority is running the most hypocritical, most partisan, and least  legitimate process in the history--the long history--of Supreme Court  nominations.   And what of the nominee? She performed as nearly every Trump- nominated judge has performed when nominated to the Supreme Court.  Essentially, she answered nothing--nothing of substance. Throughout the  week, the Committee on the Judiciary and the American people were  treated to the same practiced evasions that have become a hallmark of  these hearings.   According to Judge Barrett, the judicial standard of ethics that a  nominee ``shouldn't comment on cases that might come before the Court''  is an excuse so large that it applies to any question she might not  want to answer--even questions of basic legal fact. It produced an  absurd and stunning set of exchanges.   Judge Barrett would not say whether voter intimidation is illegal. It  very much is. Judge Barrett would not say whether Congress is empowered  to protect the right to vote. We certainly have that power. Judge  Barrett would not say if the President of the United States can  unilaterally change the date of an election. He cannot. She wouldn't  say a President should commit to the peaceful transfer of power, if  absentee ballots were a proper way to vote, or if Medicare and Social  Security were constitutional. She wouldn't even say that.   On the final day of her confirmation hearings, Judge Barrett refused  to say if climate change were real, because her answer might be  ``politically controversial.'' Seriously? This nominee was unable to  confirm the existence of climate change? What is next--gravity? Is the  Earth round? To be fair, the Flat Earth Society might find that opinion  politically controversial.   These aren't matters of opinion. These are matters of law and matters  of fact. She is a sitting judge, and if the Republican majority gets  its way, she will be a Justice on the highest Court in the country,  but, apparently, the American people do not deserve to hear anything  about her views.   The principal thing we learned about Judge Barrett in her hearings  was she believes she doesn't have to answer any question that might  upset President Trump, but, of course, we do know that Judge Barrett  has a certain interpretation of our laws and the Constitution--one that  she wants to hide from the American people because it is so adverse to  what they believe.   President Trump swore that he would only nominate Justices to the  Supreme Court who would ``terminate'' the Affordable Care Act. Judge  Barrett herself harshly criticized Justice Roberts' decision to uphold  the law. Senator Hawley said, after his meeting with Judge Barrett, he  was satisfied she believes Roe v. Wade was not correctly decided. At  one moment in the hearings last week, Judge Barrett admitted she  considered Brown v. Board a superprecedent--outside the realm of legal  challenge--but that Roe v. Wade was not.   So, despite what the American people heard in the hearings last week,  Judge Barrett does have opinions; she does hold views. She has a track  record of criticizing the decisions that have upheld our healthcare  law. She has belonged to organizations and signed her name to  advertisements that have called for an end--an end--to a woman's right  to choose. Her judicial opinions express an extreme and rather bizarre  view of the Second Amendment. She believes that the government lacks  the power to forbid felons from owning guns--a view far to the right of  even Justice Scalia.   If Judge Barrett is confirmed, those views will matter a great deal  to Americans whose fundamental rights are on the line at the Supreme  Court--their right to affordable healthcare, to marry whom they love,  to join a union, to make private medical decisions with their doctors  and without government interference, to vote without first having to  jump through 15 hoops and do 20 somersaults.   The American people should make no mistake: If Judge Barrett becomes  Justice Barrett, every single one of their fundamental rights would be  at risk. Her views are so far away from what the average American  believes and would do so much damage to the fundamental structure and  comity of this country that I just hope and pray two Republicans will  see the light and realize that we should not nominate any nominee  before the election, which is 2 weeks and 1 day away                                 Coronavirus    Madam President, now, of course, instead of ramming through a Supreme  Court nominee in the most hypocritical of circumstances, the Republican  majority should be working with the Democrats on a real comprehensive  COVID relief bill.   Over the past few weeks, COVID-19 cases, unfortunately, have swelled  across the country. The United States reported 69,000 new cases last  Friday, with 10 States reporting their highest single-day totals ever.  Poverty is beginning to increase. Unemployment remains alarmingly high.  More than 6 million Americans missed their rent or mortgage payments in  September.   What we need right now is an emergency relief package with enough  resources to beat back this enormous crisis. Yet, Leader McConnell,  this week, will, once again, force a vote on a partisan, emaciated  COVID bill--so deficient and laden with poison pills that it is obvious  he designed it to fail. In the immortal words of Yogi Berra: ``It's  deja vu all over again.''  [[Page S6052]]    Leader McConnell tried the same stunt last month. It failed. Instead  of trying to work with the Democrats or increase the size of the relief  package to meet the needs--the desperate needs--of the American people,  Leader McConnell is back with the same sorry excuse for a bill. It  fails to include robust unemployment insurance, enough funding for  schools and universities, or funding for rental, housing, or nutrition  assistance. It does nothing for the census or our elections and  abandons State, local, and Tribal governments on the brink of  catastrophe. It doesn't include recent bipartisan legislation that  helps independent music and theater venues--the Save our Stages Act--or  bipartisan legislation to help our ailing restaurants. It is totally  inadequate when it comes to funding for testing and tracing, especially  given the new spike in cases and especially given the fact that a  second wave may be upon us. I hope and pray it isn't. It, once again,  includes the poison pill of all poison pills--a sweeping corporate  immunity provision that would shield corporations from accountability  if they put their workers in harm's way.   Let me be clear: The Republican proposal was unacceptable a month  ago, and it remains unacceptable now, even more so in that the crisis  has gotten even worse.   Remember, Leader McConnell has been clear that as many as 20  Republican Senators don't want to provide any more relief to the  American people. According to press reports, one Senator said: ``Not  another dime.'' Republican Senators gave their counterparts in the  White House an earful for even considering a bigger package of aid. So  this is not a serious attempt at pandemic relief. It seems to be  another attempt at giving the Republicans political cover before the  election.   Speaker Pelosi continues to negotiate with Secretary Mnuchin and the  White House in the hopes of finding a deal that would actually meet the  needs of the American people. Instead of repeating the same failed  partisan gambit, Leader McConnell should be working with the Democrats  and the administration on a proposal that actually has a chance of  making it through both Houses of Congress. The longer he waits, the  greater the cost to the American people.   Now, before I yield the floor, I want to be clear about one thing.  Because our Republican colleagues have made such a mockery of the  Supreme Court confirmation process, we are not going to have business  as usual here in the Senate. Tonight, I will move to bring up a vote  under the Congressional Review Act and force action on a resolution to  undo the Trump administration's gutting of the Community Reinvestment  Act. This is an important fight in its own right. We should be standing  up for critical civil rights laws, like the Community Reinvestment  Act--laws that help deliver opportunity and resources to communities of  color.   The Trump administration's rewrite of the rule not only undermines  core elements of the CRA, but it replaces past practices with  complicated requirements that would lead to less lending in communities  that need it most. I have fought too hard throughout my career to lift  up the protections of the CRA to stand idly by as the Trump  administration tries to tear them down.   The window to challenge this rule under the Congressional Review Act  closes today, so I will move to consider the resolution this evening.  Normally, we would work these votes out with the majority, but its  abuse of the Supreme Court process means we will not have business as  usual--not now, not until the Republicans stop their mad dash to  confirm a Supreme Court Justice mere days before a Presidential  election.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to H.J. Res. 90,  providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5,  United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency relating to ``Community Reinvestment Act  Regulations,'' which was received from the House.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote  on the motion to proceed to H.J. Res. 90 occur at 5:45 p.m. today, with  the time equally divided between the two leaders or their designees.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Would the Senator yield? I have brought an announcement  to the floor that will take a brief minute. I don't mean to interrupt.    I thank the Senator from Tennessee                               Notice of Intent     I just want to put the Members on notice. Later this  evening, I will make a motion to adjourn the Senate until after the  November election.   The Republican majority refused to consider the Supreme Court nominee  of a duly elected Democratic President because it was 8 months before  the election. Now they are trying to ram through a Justice in mere  days--days--before an election. It is the most rushed, the most  partisan, the least legitimate nomination process in Supreme Court  history, and it should not proceed.   So I want the Members to know that I will move to adjourn until after  the election with the ability to come back into session if there is a  bipartisan agreement on a COVID relief package.   I thank the Senator for letting me put Members on notice that we will  do this later this evening.    Mr. President, our Republican majority refused to  consider the Supreme Court nominee of the duly elected Democratic  President on the supposed principle that the American people should  have a voice in selecting their next Supreme Court Justice. Now they  are moving forward with a Supreme Court nomination while the  Presidential election is already under way.   This is the most rushed, most partisan, least legitimate Supreme  Court nomination process in our Nation's history--in our Nation's  entire history--and it should not proceed. Therefore, I will move to  adjourn the Senate until after the November 3 election with the ability  to come back into session if there is a bipartisan agreement on a COVID  relief package.   Therefore, I move to adjourn and then convene for pro forma sessions  only, with no business being conducted, at 12 noon on the following  dates, and that, following each pro forma session, the Senate adjourn  until the next pro forma session: Tuesday, October 20; Friday, October  23; Tuesday, October 27; Friday, October 30; Tuesday, November 3;  Friday, November 6; that when the Senate adjourns on Friday, November  6, it reconvene at 4:30 p.m., Monday, November 9, and that following  the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal  of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be  reserved for their use later in the day, and morning business be  closed.    I appeal the ruling of the Chair, and I move to table  the appeal.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I submit the following notice in writing:   In accordance with Rule V of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I  hereby give notice in writing that it is my intention to move to  suspend rule XIV, Paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, for the purpose of proposing  and considering S. 4800, the Heroes Act, including same day  consideration.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4800         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

section 432(b)(3)(B), is reasonably expected to be       adequate--        ``(i) to fund the normal cost for the plan year,        ``(ii) to amortize the plan's unfunded liabilities in level

made       under the prior transition contribution rate, and other       actuarial gains or losses), changes in actuarial assumptions,       changes to the legacy plan's benefits, or changes in

rates.--If different rates of contribution       are payable to the legacy plan by different employers or for       different classes of employees, the certification shall       specify a transition contribution rate for each such       employer.        ``(C) Rate applicable to employer.--        ``(i) In general.--Except as provided by clause (ii), the       transition contribution rate

     certifies that such adjusted rates in combination will       produce projected contribution income for the plan year       beginning on or after the date of certification that is not       less

rate requirements at least 30 days       before the beginning of the plan year for which the rate is       effective.        ``(H) Notice to composite plan sponsor.--Not later than 30       days after

TITLE VI--COVID-19 COMPASSION AND MARTHA WRIGHT PRISON PHONE JUSTICE       SEC. 601. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Prison, jails, and other confinement facilities in the       United States have unique telecommunications needs due to       safety and security concerns.        (2) Unjust and unreasonable charges for telephone and       advanced communications services in confinement facilities       negatively  [[Page S6223]]       impact the safety and security of communities in the United       States by damaging relationships between incarcerated persons       and their support systems, thereby exacerbating recidivism.        (3) The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly intensified these       concerns. Jails and prisons have become epicenters for the       spread of the virus, with incarcerated persons concentrated       in small, confined spaces and often without access to       adequate health care. At Cook County jail alone, hundreds of       incarcerated persons and jail staff have tested positive for       the virus since its outbreak.        (4) To prevent the spread of the virus, many jails and       prisons across the country suspended public visitation,       leaving confinement facility communications services as the       only way that incarcerated persons can stay in touch with       their families.        (5) All people in the United States, including anyone who       pays for confinement facility communications services, should       have access to communications services at charges that are       just and reasonable.        (6) Unemployment has risen sharply as a result of the       COVID-19 pandemic, straining the incomes of millions of       Americans and making it even more difficult for families of       incarcerated persons to pay the high costs of confinement       facility communications services.        (7) Certain markets for confinement facility communications       services are distorted due to reverse competition, in which       the financial interests of the entity making the buying       decision (the confinement facility) are aligned with the       seller (the provider of confinement facility communications       services) and not the consumer (the incarcerated person or a       member of his or her family). This reverse competition occurs       because site commission payments to the confinement facility       from the provider of confinement facility communications       services are the chief criterion many facilities use to       select their provider of confinement facility communications       services.        (8) Charges for confinement facility communications       services that have been shown to be unjust and unreasonable       are often a result of site commission payments that far       exceed the costs incurred by the confinement facility in       accommodating these services.        (9) Unjust and unreasonable charges have been assessed for       both audio and video services and for both intrastate and       interstate communications from confinement facilities.        (10) Though Congress enacted emergency legislation to allow       free communications in Federal prisons during the pandemic,       it does not cover communications to or from anyone       incarcerated in State and local prisons or jails.        (11) Mrs. Martha Wright-Reed led a campaign for just       communications rates for incarcerated people for over a       decade.        (12) Mrs. Wright-Reed was the lead plaintiff in Wright v.       Corrections Corporation of America, CA No. 00-293 (GK)       (D.D.C. 2001).        (13) That case ultimately led to the Wright Petition at the       Federal Communications Commission, CC Docket No. 96-128       (November 3, 2003).        (14) As a grandmother, Mrs. Wright-Reed was forced to       choose between purchasing medication and communicating with       her incarcerated grandson.        (15) Mrs. Wright-Reed passed away on January 18, 2015,       before fully realizing her dream of just communications rates       for all people.       SEC. 602.

TITLE VII--PROMOTING AND ADVANCING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THROUGH                             INCLUSIVE LENDING       SEC. 701. SHORT TITLE.         This title may be cited as the ``Promoting and Advancing       Communities of Color through Inclusive Lending Act''.       SEC. 702. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:        (1) The Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the       resulting recession have led to more than 4.8 million cases       and at least 157,000 deaths in the United States as of August       6, 2020; a 7.6 percent increase in the unemployment rate from       February to June, or approximately 12 million more persons       who have lost their job; and an estimated 36 percent of       renters and 4.1 million homeowners who are struggling to pay       their rent and mortgages.        (2) According to the Centers for Disease Control, ``long-      standing systemic health and social inequities have put some       members of racial and ethnic minority groups at increased       risk of getting COVID-19 or experiencing severe illness''.        (3) Minority-owned businesses are also facing more       difficult economic circumstances than others as a result of       the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, the Federal Reserve       Bank of New York reported that minority- and women-owned       businesses were not only more likely to show signs of limited       financial health, but also twice as likely to be classified       as ``at risk'' or ``distressed'' than their non-minority       counterparts.        (4) During the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,       community development financial  [[Page S6254]]       institutions (CDFIs) and minority depository institutions       (MDIs) have delivered needed capital and relief to       underserved communities, many of which have borne a       disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through       August 8, 2020, CDFIs and MDIs have provided more than $16.4       billion in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to small       businesses with a smaller median loan size of about $74,000       compared to the overall program median loan size of $101,000.        (5) In addition to establishing relief funds and services       for local businesses and individuals experiencing loss of       income, CDFIs and MDIs have provided mortgage forbearances,       loan deferments, and modifications to help address the needs       of their borrowers. CDFIs and MDIs are reaching underserved       communities and minority-owned businesses at a critical time.        (6) The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund       (CDFI Fund) is an agency of the U.S. Department of the       Treasury and was established by the Riegle Community       Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. The       mission of the CDFI Fund is ``to expand economic opportunity       for underserved people and communities by supporting the       growth and capacity of a national network of community       development lenders, investors, and financial service       providers''. As of September 15, 2020, there were 1,137       certified CDFIs in all 50 States, District of Columbia, Guam,       and Puerto Rico.        (7) Following the 2008 financial crisis and the       disproportionate impact the Great Recession had on minority       communities, the number of MDI banks fell more than 30       percent over the following decade, to 143 as of the second       quarter of 2020. Meanwhile, MDI credit unions have seen       similar declines, with more than one-third of such       institutions disappearing since 2013.        (b) Sense of Congress.--The following is the sense of the       Congress:        (1) The Department of the Treasury, Board of Governors of       the Federal Reserve System, Small Business Administration       (SBA), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal       Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union       Administration, and other Federal agencies should take steps       to support, engage with, and utilize minority depository       institutions and community development financial institutions       in the near term, especially as they carry out programs to       respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the long term.        (2) The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System       should, consistent with its mandates, work to increase       lending by minority depository institutions and community       development financial institutions to underserved       communities, and when appropriate, should work with the       Department of the Treasury to increase lending by minority       depository institutions and community development financial       institutions to underserved communities.        (3) The Department of the Treasury and prudential       regulators should establish a strategic plan identifying       concrete steps that they can take to support existing       minority depository institutions, as well as the formation of       new minority depository institutions consistent with the       goals established in the Financial Institutions Reform,       Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) to preserve       and promote minority depository institutions.        (4) Congress should increase funding and make other       enhancements, including those provided by this legislation,       to enhance the effectiveness of the CDFI Fund, especially       reforms to support minority-owned and minority led CDFIs in       times of crisis and beyond.        (5) Congress should conduct robust and ongoing oversight of       the Department of the Treasury, CDFI Fund, Federal prudential       regulators, SBA, and other Federal agencies to ensure they       fulfill their obligations under the law as well as implement       this title and other laws in a manner that supports and fully       utilizes minority depository institutions and community       development financial intuitions, as appropriate.        (6) The investments made by the Secretary of the Treasury       under this title and the amendments made by this title should       be designed to maximize the benefit to low- and moderate-      income and minority communities and contemplate losses to       capital of the Treasury.       SEC. 703. PURPOSE.         The purpose of this title is to--        (1) establish programs to revitalize and provide long-term       financial products and service availability for, and provide       investments in, low- and moderate-income and minority       communities;        (2) respond to the unprecedented loss of Black-owned       businesses and unemployment; and        (3) otherwise enhance the stability, safety and soundness       of community financial institutions that support low- and       moderate-income and minority communities.       SEC. 704. CONSIDERATIONS; REQUIREMENTS FOR CREDITORS.

(b) Requirement for Creditors.--Any creditor participating       in a program established under this title or the amendments       made by this title shall fully comply with all applicable       statutory and regulatory requirements relating to fair       lending.       SEC. 705. NEIGHBORHOOD CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROGRAM.

SEC. 707. ENSURING DIVERSITY IN COMMUNITY BANKING.         (a) Sense of Congress on Funding the Loan-loss Reserve Fund       for Small Dollar Loans.--The sense of Congress is the       following:        (1) The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund       (the ``CDFI Fund'') is an agency of the Department of the       Treasury, and was established by the Riegle Community       Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994. The       mission of the CDFI Fund is ``to expand economic opportunity       for underserved people and communities by supporting the       growth and capacity of a national network of community       development lenders, investors, and financial service       providers''. A community development financial institution (a       ``CDFI'') is a specialized financial institution serving low-      income communities and a Community Development Entity (a       ``CDE'') is a domestic corporation or partnership that is an       intermediary vehicle for the provision of loans, investments,       or financial counseling in low-income communities. The CDFI       Fund certifies CDFIs and CDEs. Becoming a certified CDFI or       CDE allows organizations to participate in various CDFI Fund       programs as follows:        (A) The Bank Enterprise Award Program, which provides FDIC-      insured depository institutions awards for a demonstrated       increase in lending and investments in distressed communities       and CDFIs.        (B) The CDFI Program, which provides Financial and       Technical Assistance awards to CDFIs to reinvest in the CDFI,       and to build the capacity of the CDFI, including financing       product development and loan loss reserves.        (C) The Native American CDFI Assistance Program, which       provides CDFIs and sponsoring entities Financial and       Technical Assistance awards to increase lending and grow the       number of CDFIs owned by Native Americans to help build       capacity of such CDFIs.        (D) The New Market Tax Credit Program, which provides tax       credits for making equity investments in CDEs that stimulate       capital investments in low-income communities.        (E) The Capital Magnet Fund, which provides awards to CDFIs       and nonprofit affordable housing organizations to finance       affordable housing solutions and related economic development       activities.        (F) The Bond Guarantee Program, a source of long-term,       patient capital for CDFIs to expand lending and investment       capacity for community and economic development purposes.        (2) The Department of the Treasury is authorized to create       multi-year grant programs designed to encourage low-to-      moderate income individuals to establish accounts at       federally insured banks, and to improve low-to-moderate       income individuals' access to such accounts on reasonable       terms.        (3) Under this authority, grants to participants in CDFI       Fund programs may be used for loan-loss reserves and to       establish small-dollar loan programs by subsidizing related       losses. These grants also allow for the providing recipients       with the financial counseling and education necessary to       conduct transactions and manage their accounts. These loans       provide low-cost alternatives to payday loans and other       nontraditional forms of financing that often impose excessive       interest rates and fees on borrowers, and lead millions of       Americans to fall into debt traps. Small-dollar loans can       only be made pursuant to terms, conditions, and practices       that are reasonable for the individual consumer obtaining the       loan.        (4) Program participation is restricted to eligible       institutions, which are limited to organizations listed in       section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and exempt       from tax under 501(a) of such Code, federally insured       depository institutions, community development financial       institutions and State, local, or Tribal government entities.        (5) Since its founding, the CDFI Fund has awarded over       $3,300,000,000 to CDFIs and CDEs, allocated $54,000,000,000       in tax credits, and $1,510,000,000 in bond guarantees.       According to the CDFI Fund, some programs attract as much as       $10 in private capital for every $1 invested by the CDFI       Fund. The Administration and the Congress should prioritize       appropriation of funds for the loan loss reserve fund and       technical assistance programs administered by the Community       Development Financial Institution Fund.        (b) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Community development financial institution.--The term       ``community development financial institution'' has the       meaning given under section 103 of the Riegle Community       Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 (12 U.S.C.       4702).

(4) Limitation on additional data requirements.--The       Federal banking agencies may only impose additional data       collection requirements on a depository institution under       this subsection if such data is--        (A) necessary to process an application submitted by the       depository institution to be designated an impact bank; or        (B) with respect to a depository institution that is       designated as an impact bank, necessary to ensure the       depository institution's ongoing qualifications to maintain       such designation.        (5) Removal of designation.--If the appropriate Federal       banking agency determines that a depository institution       designated as an impact bank no longer meets the criteria for       such designation, the appropriate Federal banking agency       shall rescind the designation and notify the depository       institution of such rescission.        (6) Reconsideration of designation; appeals.--Under such       procedures as the Federal banking agencies may establish, a       depository institution may--        (A) submit to the appropriate Federal banking agency a       request to reconsider a determination that such depository       institution no longer meets the criteria for the designation;       or        (B) file an appeal of such determination.        (7) Rulemaking.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Federal banking agencies shall       jointly issue rules to carry out the requirements of this       subsection, including by providing a definition of a low-      income borrower.        (8) Reports.--Each Federal banking agency shall submit an       annual report to the Congress containing a description of       actions taken to carry out this subsection.

TITLE II--GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY ACT OF 2020       SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.         This title may be cited as the ``Global Health Security Act       of 2020''.       SEC. 202. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) In December 2009, President Obama released the National       Strategy for Countering Biological Threats, which listed as       one of seven objectives ``Promote global health security:       Increase the availability of and access to knowledge and       products of the life sciences that can help reduce the impact       from outbreaks of infectious disease whether of natural,       accidental, or deliberate origin''.        (2) In February 2014, the United States and nearly 30 other       nations launched the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) to       address several high-priority, global infectious disease       threats. The GHSA is a multi-faceted, multi-country       initiative intended to accelerate partner countries'       measurable capabilities to achieve specific targets to       prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats,       whether naturally occurring, deliberate, or accidental.        (3) In 2015, the United Nations adopted the Sustainable       Development Goals (SDGs), which include specific reference to       the importance of global health security as part of SDG 3       ``ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all       ages'' as follows: ``strengthen the capacity of all       countries, in particular developing countries, for early       warning, risk reduction and management of national and global       health risks''.        (4) On November 4, 2016, President Obama signed Executive       Order 13747, ``Advancing the Global Health Security Agenda to       Achieve a World Safe and Secure from Infectious Disease       Threats''.        (5) In October 2017 at the GHSA Ministerial Meeting in       Uganda, the United States and  [[Page S6280]]       more than 40 GHSA member countries supported the ``Kampala       Declaration'' to extend the GHSA for an additional 5 years to       2024.        (6) In December 2017, President Trump released the National       Security Strategy, which includes the priority action:       ``Detect and contain biothreats at their source: We will work       with other countries to detect and mitigate outbreaks early       to prevent the spread of disease. We will encourage other       countries to invest in basic health care systems and to       strengthen global health security across the intersection of       human and animal health to prevent infectious disease       outbreaks''.        (7) In September 2018, President Trump released the       National Biodefense Strategy, which includes objectives to       ``strengthen global health security capacities to prevent       local bioincidents from becoming epidemics'', and       ``strengthen international preparedness to support       international response and recovery capabilities''.       SEC. 203. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States to--        (1) promote global health security as a core national       security interest;        (2) advance the aims of the Global Health Security Agenda;        (3) collaborate with other countries to detect and mitigate       outbreaks early to prevent the spread of disease;        (4) encourage other countries to invest in basic resilient       and sustainable health care systems; and        (5) strengthen global health security across the       intersection of human and animal health to prevent infectious       disease outbreaks and combat the growing threat of       antimicrobial resistance.

TITLE III--SECURING AMERICA FROM EPIDEMICS ACT       SEC. 301. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Due to increasing population and population density,       human mobility, and ecological change, emerging infectious       diseases pose a real and growing threat to global health       security.        (2) While vaccines can be the most effective tools to       protect against infectious disease, the absence of vaccines       for a new or emerging infectious disease with epidemic       potential is a major health security threat globally, posing       catastrophic potential human and economic costs.        (3) The 1918 influenza pandemic infected 500,000,000       people, or about one-third of the world's population at the       time, and killed 50,000,000 people--more than died in the       First World War.        (4) The economic cost of an outbreak can be devastating.       The estimated global cost today, should an outbreak of the       scale of the 1918 influenza pandemic strike, is 5 percent of       global gross domestic product.        (5) Even regional outbreaks can have enormous human costs       and substantially disrupt the global economy and cripple       regional economies. The 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa       killed more than 11,000 and cost $2,800,000,000 in losses in       the affected countries alone.        (6) The ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak reflects the       pressing need for quick and effective vaccine and       countermeasure development.        (7) While the need for vaccines to address emerging       epidemic threats is acute, markets to drive the necessary       development of vaccines to address them--a complex and       expensive undertaking--are very often critically absent. Also       absent are mechanisms to ensure access to those vaccines by       those who need them when they need them.        (8) To address this global vulnerability and the deficit of       political commitment, institutional capacity, and funding, in       2017, several countries and private partners launched the       Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).       CEPI's mission is to stimulate, finance, and coordinate       development of vaccines for high-priority, epidemic-potential       threats in cases where traditional markets do not exist or       cannot create sufficient demand.        (9) Through funding of partnerships, CEPI seeks to bring       priority vaccines candidates through the end of phase II       clinical trials, as well as support vaccine platforms that       can be rapidly deployed against emerging pathogens.        (10) CEPI has funded multiple partners to develop vaccine       candidates against the novel coronavirus, responding to this       urgent, global requirement.        (11) Support for and participation in CEPI is an important       part of the United States own health security and biodefense       and is in the national interest, complementing the work of       many Federal agencies and providing significant value through       global partnership and burden-sharing.

(B) Exception.--If the status, authorization, or period of       stay referred to in subparagraph (A) is based on a grant of       deferred action, or a grant of temporary protected status       under section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8       U.S.C. 1254a), the extension under such subparagraph shall be       for a period not less than the period for which deferred       action or temporary protected status originally was granted       by the Secretary of Homeland Security.        (b) Immigrant Visas.--        (1) Extension of visa expiration.--Notwithstanding the       limitations under section 221(c) of the Immigration and       Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1201(c)), in the case of any       immigrant visa issued to an alien that expires or expired       during the period described in subsection (d), the period of       validity of the visa is extended until the date that is 90       days after the end of such period.        (2) Rollover of unused visas.--        (A) In general.--For fiscal years 2021 and 2022, the       worldwide level of family-sponsored immigrants under       subsection (c) of section 201 of the Immigration and       Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1151), the worldwide level of       employment-based immigrants under subsection (d) of such       section, and the worldwide level of diversity immigrants       under subsection (e) of such section shall each be increased       by the number computed under subparagraph (B) with respect to       each of such worldwide levels.        (B) Computation of increase.--For each of the worldwide       levels described in subparagraph (A), the number computed       under this subparagraph is the difference (if any) between       the worldwide level established for the previous fiscal year       under the applicable subsection of section 201 of the       Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1151) and the       number of visas that were, during the previous fiscal year,       issued and used as the basis for an application for admission       into the United States as an immigrant described in the       applicable subsection.

(c) Public Availability.--The information described in       paragraphs (6) through (9) of subsection (a) shall also be       made available not later than 15 days after the end of each       fiscal quarter on a publicly available website.

TITLE II--PRISONS AND JAILS       SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.         This title may be cited as the ``Pandemic Justice Response       Act''.       SEC. 202. EMERGENCY COMMUNITY SUPERVISION ACT.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) As of the date of introduction of this Act, the novel       coronavirus has spread to all 50 States, the District of       Columbia, and at least 4 territories.        (2) As of September 27, 2020, more than 7,119,400 people in       the United States had been infected with the coronavirus and       at least 204,400 had died.  [[Page S6286]]         (3) Although the United States has less than 5 percent of       the world's population, the United States holds approximately       21 percent of the world's prisoners and leads the world in       the number of individuals incarcerated, with nearly 2,200,000       people incarcerated in State and Federal prisons and local       jails.        (4) Studies have shown that individuals age out of crime       starting around 25 years of age, and released individuals       over the age of 50 have a very low recidivism rate.        (5) According to public health experts, incarcerated       individuals are particularly vulnerable to being gravely       impacted by the novel corona virus pandemic because--        (A) they have higher rates of underlying health issues than       members of the general public, including higher rates of       respiratory disease, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, HIV/      AIDS, substance abuse, hepatitis, and other conditions that       suppress immune response; and        (B) the close conditions and lack of access to hygiene       products in prisons make these institutions unusually       susceptible to viral pandemics.        (6) The spread of communicable disease in the United States       generally constitutes a serious, heightened threat to the       safety of incarcerated individuals, and there is a serious       threat to the general public that prisons may become       incubators of community spread of communicable viral disease.        (b) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Covered health condition.--The term ``covered health       condition'' with respect to an individual, means the       individual--        (A) is pregnant;        (B) has chronic lung disease or asthma;        (C) has congestive heart failure or coronary artery       disease;        (D) has diabetes;        (E) has a neurological condition that weakens the ability       to cough or breathe;        (F) has HIV;        (G) has sickle cell anemia;        (H) has cancer; or        (I) has a weakened immune system.        (2) Covered individual.--The term ``covered individual''--        (A) means an individual who--        (i) is a juvenile (as defined in section 5031 of title 18,       United States Code);        (ii) is 50 years of age or older;        (iii) has a covered health condition; or        (iv) is within 12 months of release from incarceration; and        (B) includes an individual described in subparagraph (A)       who is serving a term of imprisonment for an offense       committed before November 1, 1987, or who is serving a term       of imprisonment in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons for a       sentence imposed pursuant to a conviction for a criminal       offense under the laws of the District of Columbia.        (3) National emergency relating to a communicable       disease.--The term ``national emergency relating to a       communicable disease'' means--        (A) an emergency involving Federal primary responsibility       determined to exist by the President under the section 501(b)       of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency       Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5191(b)) with respect to a       communicable disease; or        (B) a national emergency declared by the President under       the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) with       respect to a communicable disease.

(2) Exceptions.--        (A) Bureau of prisons.--In carrying out paragraph (1)(A),       the Director--        (i) may not place in community supervision any individual       determined, by clear and convincing evidence, taking into       account the individual's offense of conviction, to be likely       to pose a specific and substantial risk of causing bodily       injury to or using violent force against the person of       another;        (ii) shall place in the file of each individual described       in clause (i) documentation of such determination, including       the evidence used to make the determination; and        (iii) not later than 180 days after the date on which the       national emergency relating to a communicable disease       expires, shall provide a report to Congress documenting--         (I) the demographic data (including race, gender, age,       offense of conviction, and criminal history level) of the       individuals denied placement in community supervision under       clause (i); and        (II) the justification for the denials described in       subclause (I).         (B) District courts.--In carrying out paragraph (1)(B),       each district court of the United States--        (i) shall conduct an immediate and expedited review of the       detention orders of all covered individuals in the custody       and care of the United States Marshals Service, which may be       conducted sua sponte and ex parte, without--         (I) appearance by the defendant or any party; or        (II) requiring a petition, motion, or other similar       document to be filed;         (ii) may not place in community supervision any individual       if the court determines, after a hearing and the attorney for       the Government shows by clear and convincing evidence based       on individualized facts, that detention is necessary because       the individual's release will pose a specific and substantial       risk that the individual will cause bodily injury or use       violent force against the person of another and that no       conditions of release will reasonably mitigate that risk;        (iii) in carrying out clauses (i) and (ii), may--         (I) rely on evidence presented in prior court proceedings;       and        (II) if the court determines it necessary, request       additional information from the parties to make the       determination.         (3) Limitation on community supervision placement.--In       placing covered individuals into community supervision under       this section, the Director of the Bureau of Prisons and the       district court of the United States for each judicial       district shall take into account and prioritize placements       that enable adequate social distancing, which include home       confinement or other forms of low in-person-contact       supervised release.        (d) Limitation on Pre-trial Detention.--        (1) No bond conditions on release.--Notwithstanding section       3142 of title 18, United States Code, beginning on the date       on which a national emergency relating to a communicable       disease is declared and ending on the date that is 60 days       after such national emergency expires or is terminated, in       imposing conditions of release, the judicial officer may not       require payment of cash bail, proof of ability to pay an       unsecured bond, execution of a bail bond, a solvent surety to       co-sign a secured or unsecured bond, or posting of real       property.        (2) Limitation.--        (A) In general.--Beginning on the date on which a national       emergency relating to a communicable disease is declared and       ending on the date that is 60 days after such national       emergency expires or is terminated, at any initial appearance       hearing, detention hearing, hearing on a motion for pretrial       release, or any other hearing where the attorney for the       Government is seeking the detention or continued detention of       any individual, the judicial officer shall order the pretrial       release of the individual on personal recognizance or on a       condition or combination of conditions under section 3142(c)       of title 18, United States Code, unless the attorney for the       Government shows by clear and convincing evidence based on       individualized facts that detention is necessary because the       individual's release will pose a specific and substantial       risk that the individual will cause bodily injury or use       violent force against the person of another and that no       conditions of release will reasonably mitigate that risk.        (B) Required consideration of certain factors.--If the       judicial officer finds that the attorney for the Government       has made the requisite showing under subparagraph (A), the       judicial officer shall take into consideration, in       determining whether detention is necessary--        (i) whether the individual's age or medical condition       renders them especially vulnerable; and        (ii) whether detention will compromise the individual's       access to adequate medical treatment, access to medications,       or ability to privately consult with counsel and meaningfully       prepare a defense.        (C) Juveniles.--        (i) In general.--Beginning on the date on which a national       emergency relating to a communicable disease is declared and       ending on the date that is 60 days after such national       emergency expires or is terminated, notwithstanding sections       5031 through 5035 of title 18, United States Code, and except       as provided under clause (ii), in the case of a juvenile       alleged to have committed an act of juvenile delinquency, the       judicial officer shall release the juvenile to their parent,       guardian, custodian, or other responsible party (including       the director of a shelter-care facility) upon their promise       to bring such juvenile before the appropriate court when       requested by the judicial officer.        (ii) Exception.--A juvenile alleged to have committed an       act of juvenile delinquency may be detained pending trial       only if, at a hearing at which the juvenile is represented by       counsel, the attorney for the Government shows by clear and       convincing evidence based on individualized facts that       detention is necessary because the juvenile's release will       pose a specific and substantial risk that the juvenile will       use violent force against a reasonably identifiable person       and that no conditions of release will reasonably mitigate       that risk, except that in no case may a judicial officer       order the detention of a juvenile if it will compromise the       juvenile's access to adequate medical treatment, access to       medications, or ability to privately consult with counsel and       meaningfully prepare a defense.        (iii) Least restrictive detention.--In the case that the       judicial officer orders the detention of a juvenile under       clause (ii), the judicial officer shall order the detention       of the juvenile in the least restrictive and safest       environment possible, taking the national emergency relating       to a communicable disease into consideration.  [[Page S6287]]         (iv) Contents of detention order.--In the case that the       judicial officer orders the detention of a juvenile under       clause (ii), the judicial officer shall issue a written       detention order that includes--         (I) findings of fact;        (II) the reasons for the detention;        (III) a description of the risk identified under clause       (ii);        (IV) an explanation of why no conditions will reasonably       mitigate the risk identified under clause (ii);        (V) a statement that detention will not compromise the       juvenile's access to adequate medical treatment, access to       medications, or ability to privately consult with counsel and       meaningfully prepare a defense; and        (VI) a statement establishing that the detention       environment is the least restrictive and safest possible in       accordance with the requirement under clause (iii).         (e) Limitation on Supervised Release.--Beginning on the       date on which a national emergency relating to a communicable       disease is declared and ending on the date that is 60 days       after such national emergency expires, the Office of       Probation and Pretrial Services of the Administrative Office       of the United States Courts shall take measures to prevent       the spread of the communicable disease among individuals       under supervision by--        (1) suspending the requirement that individuals determined       to be a lower risk of reoffending, or any other individuals       determined to be appropriate by the supervising probation       officer, report in person to their probation or parole       officer;        (2) identifying individuals who have successfully completed       not less than 18 months of supervision and transferring such       individuals to administrative supervision or petitioning the       court to terminate supervision, as appropriate; and        (3) suspending the request for detention and imprisonment       as a sanction for violations of probation, supervised       release, or parole.        (f) Prohibition.--No individual who is granted placement in       community supervision, termination of supervision, placement       on administrative supervision, or pre-trial release shall be       re-incarcerated, placed on supervision or active supervision,       or ordered detained pre-trial only as a result of the       expiration of the national emergency relating to a       communicable disease.

(ii) In the case of a revoked term of supervised release,       the court shall continue the defendant on supervised release,       the duration of which shall be equal to the period of time       the defendant had remaining on supervised release when the       defendant was most recently placed in custody, unless the       court determines that decreasing the term of supervised       release is in the interest of justice.        (2) Resentencing in cases of parole.--        (A) In general.--Beginning on the date on which a national       emergency relating to a communicable disease is declared and       ending on the date that is 60 days after such national       emergency expires, the court shall order the resentencing of       a defendant who is serving a term of imprisonment resulting       from a technical violation of the defendant's parole.        (B) Resentencing.--The court shall resentence the defendant       to parole, the duration of which shall be equal to the period       of time remaining on the defendant's term of parole at the       time the defendant was most recently placed in custody,       unless the court determines that decreasing the length of the       term of parole is in the interest of justice.

TITLE IV--JABARA-HEYER NO HATE ACT       SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.         This title may be cited as the ``Jabara-Heyer National       Opposition to Hate, Assault, and Threats to Equality Act of       2020'' or the ``Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act''.       SEC. 402. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The incidence of violence known as hate crimes or       crimes motivated by bias poses a serious national problem.        (2) According to data obtained by the Federal Bureau of       Investigation, the incidence of such violence increased in       2017, the most recent year for which data is available.        (3) In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate Crime Statistics Act       (Public Law 101-275; 28 U.S.C. 534 note) to provide the       Federal Government, law enforcement agencies, and the public       with data regarding the incidence of hate crime. The Hate       Crimes Statistics Act and the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd,       Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act (division E of Public Law 111-      84; 123 Stat. 2835) have enabled Federal authorities to       understand and, where appropriate, investigate and prosecute       hate crimes.        (4) A more complete understanding of the national problem       posed by hate crime is in the public interest and supports       the Federal interest in eradicating bias-motivated violence       referenced in section 249(b)(1)(C) of title 18, United States       Code.        (5) However, a complete understanding of the national       problem posed by hate crimes is hindered by incomplete data       from Federal, State, and local jurisdictions through the       Uniform Crime Reports program authorized under section 534 of       title 28, United States Code, and administered by the Federal       Bureau of Investigation.        (6) Multiple factors contribute to the provision of       inaccurate and incomplete data regarding the incidence of       hate crime through the Uniform Crime Reports program. A       significant contributing factor is the quality and quantity       of training that State and local law enforcement agencies       receive on the identification and reporting of suspected       bias-motivated crimes.        (7) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is sufficiently       serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as to warrant       Federal financial assistance to States and local       jurisdictions.        (8) Federal financial assistance with regard to certain       violent crimes motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and       local authorities to work together as partners in the       investigation and prosecution of such crimes.

Section 42 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) in paragraph (1)--        (i) by inserting ``or any interstate transport between       States within the continental United States,'' after       ``shipment between the continental United States, the       District of Columbia, Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto       Rico, or any possession of the United States,''; and        (ii) by striking ``to be injurious to human beings, to the       interests of agriculture'' and inserting ``to be injurious to       or to transmit a pathogen that can cause disease in humans,       to be injurious to the interests of agriculture''; and        (B) by adding at the end the following:        ``(6) In the case of an emergency posing a significant risk       to the health of humans, the Secretary of the Interior may       designate a species by interim final rule.

SEC. 403. RESCISSION OF FUNDS.         Of the unobligated balances available under section 4027 of       division A of the CARES Act (Public Law 116-136),       $146,000,000,000 is hereby permanently rescinded.                                  ______                                         By Mr. REED (for himself and Mr. Whitehouse):   S. 4804. A bill to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation  and Management Act to add Rhode Island to the Mid-Atlantic Fishery  Management Council, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Commerce, Science, and Transportation.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, COVID-19 has changed just about every  aspect of American life--every aspect. The bottom line is very simple:  The way Americans work, the way we send our kids to school, and the way  we run our businesses have all changed. COVID has derailed the economy.   Millions of Americans have missed the rent, missed the mortgage,  applied for unemployment, been forced to skip meals. American poverty  is beginning to increase more dramatically. More than 8 million have  gotten sick. More than 220,000 have died.   The response here in Congress to a pandemic that affects our country  in a way we haven't seen in decades should be to comprehensively  provide relief. Our mission is not to pick out one or two industries  and say ``maybe later'' to the rest. We can't privilege a small issue  here or there and ask everyone else to wait. Our mission is to deliver  big for a country and a people who are suffering direly. Our mission is  to meet the needs of the country and leave no one--and leave no one-- behind.   But Leader McConnell and the Republican majority have failed to grasp  the gravity of this situation from the beginning. They put the Senate  on pause for more than 5 months, while cases went up and the death toll  mounted. When the time came for them to pull together in August, they  couldn't even get Republican Senators to agree on one. Eight months  into this long and brutal crisis, the Republican leader is filled with  stunts and playing the smallest of small ball, when so many are  hurting.   Today, the Republican majority will try to force a stunt--not even a  real vote on a bill--but it leaves almost the entire country out of the  picture. They are holding the vote over a backdrop of a dire increase  in cases. The majority of States are seeing spikes right now. Half of  all States have had their highest single day ever in total cases in the  last month.   Experts say we have hard months ahead of us. It is possible the worst  is yet to come--a second wave. We must act now to provide relief to the  whole country, and our Republican leader and the Republican Senate are  up to a stunt and not even negotiating or putting a bill on the floor,  and the American people know it. They know who is to blame. They blame  President Trump and the Republican majority. We know that.   We know, when it comes to COVID, that the blame correctly falls on  the shoulders of Leader McConnell and all his Republican Senators, who  are afraid to do anything, who are divided. Anytime Mr. Mnuchin gets on  the phone with them, they say: Don't do anything. We are too divided.   Everyone knows that.   We must provide real relief. That is what Democrats want to do. But  in the Republican proposal today, there is no funding--zero funding-- for testing or tracing, the best way to stop this COVID menace.   And in the Republican bill tomorrow, the funding for testing and the  plan for testing is so completely inadequate that it is laughable,  especially given the recent spike in cases.   In the Republican proposal today, there is nothing for American  families, schools, daycare, or food assistance. They are left behind-- all of them. Renters, homeowners, folks struggling to keep a roof over  their heads--they are left behind. Americans who have lost their job  through no fault of their own and need unemployment insurance--they are  left behind in these Republican proposals.   State and local governments that are being forced to slash critical  public service in the middle of a recession--they, too, are all left  behind.   Even on the issue of small business, the issue on which this bill is  focused, it lacks specific funding for restaurants, for independent  theaters and venues, for local newspapers, TV, radio stations,  critical-need hospitals, minority-owned businesses, and all of our  [[Page S6305]]  nonprofits. In each of those areas in which the Republican bill is  deficient, so many are left behind.   We have bipartisan support for programs that are not even being  considered here today. And why is that? Why is McConnell doing stunts?  The truth is, because the leader can't pass anything on the floor, he  is resorting to a series of political stunts. That is all. Everyone  knows it.   The Republican leader himself admitted that as many as 20 Republican  Senators don't want to vote for ``a dime more''--``a dime more,'' his  quote--of relief for the American people--so out of touch, so callous,  so cruel.   So what we have here is a series of show stunt votes designed to fail  because the Republicans want them to fail. It is not going to get the  job done for the American people. They can't even put a real bill on  the floor. The only bills that they can pass are filled with poison  pills that they know no Democrat will support in the House or Senate.   That was the only way they could get them to vote even for this  meager amount in tomorrow's bill--by telling the big corporations: No  liability for you if you egregiously hurt a worker who has COVID; by  telling wealthy parents: You can pay for private school education with  a complete tax break--free, free, but public schools get left out,  middle class people get left out, poor people get left out. Wealthy  people who send their kids to private schools--that is it--while they  refuse to give money to the public schools that need the money.   If Leader McConnell were serious, you know what he would be doing. He  would be negotiating. He wouldn't be saying: I can't negotiate; my  caucus is divided. He would be leading instead of following the 20  hard-right, cruel, callous thoughts of those who don't want to spend  any money because their wealthy paymasters don't want to pay taxes: Let  people suffer. I don't want to pay taxes. Let people suffer. I don't  want government to do anything--when we all know the only real hope  here is for a strong, active, and bold government-led program. The  private sector can't fight COVID alone. The private sector can't get us  out of this deep recession alone. We know that, but not the hard-right  Republicans. They are stuck in their narrow ideological prison.   So instead of stunts, Senators will actually have a chance today to  vote on a real comprehensive bill to address the current state of the  country. For months, Democrats have been pushing for the Heroes Act, a  second installment of the kind of comprehensive COVID relief we passed  in the first bill that brought so much to people, helped them stay in  their homes, brought pandemic unemployment insurance, helped our  hospitals, helped our local governments, helped do some testing-- testing money, by the way, and tracing money, which the Trump  administration hasn't even distributed to the States.   This bill passed the House over 3 months ago, and since then,  Democrats have modified the bill to move closer to our Republican  counterparts. Still, Leader McConnell refuses to even bring it up for a  vote in the Senate. So today Democrats will move to have the Senate  take a vote on the Heroes Act, a comprehensive bill that does so much,  that doesn't leave all the people behind that this proposal does. We  will see where every Republican Senator stands on real COVID relief-- not a stunt, a fake that leaves people out.   Unlike the partisan, emaciated Republican COVID relief bill, the  Heroes Act will not leave large portions of the country behind. It will  not include poison pills like sweeping corporate immunity provisions  that Leader McConnell has insisted on in every version of Republican  legislation. It will deliver actual relief to American workers,  American families, American States and localities and Tribes. It  provides assistance for food, rent, and housing; real funding for  testing and tracing; unemployment insurance and aid to small businesses  of all kinds, not just a few.   This morning, a poll conducted by the New York Times and Siena  Research showed that 72 percent of Americans, including a clear  majority of Independents and Republicans, support another $2 trillion  stimulus package. In other words, 72 percent support the Democratic  plan to provide COVID relief. Even President Trump has told our  Republican Senate colleagues to ``go big or go home.''   If my Republican colleagues were listening to the American people,  they would not be playing these partisan games around small-bore,  stunt-driven COVID bills. They would be working with Democrats on  something that absolutely meets people's needs. Instead, the Republican  leader is wasting the American people's time on a vote he knows will  fail, and he doesn't even seem to mind.    Mr. President, I want to take a moment to explain to the  American people what is happening here on the floor of the Senate.  After putting the Senate on pause for over 5 long months, while  businesses closed, millions lost their jobs, and hundreds of thousands  of Americans died, Leader McConnell is now using this week to hold show  votes on coronavirus relief. The vote we just had was not even a real  vote. Leader McConnell moved to table the bill, then voted against  tabling it. It was a stunt, plain and simple. It goes to show how  unserious the Republican process is here on the floor of the Senate.  Democrats, by their vote, called it for what it is.   The truth is Leader McConnell is doing these stunts on the floor  because there is a hard-right faction in the Republican caucus that  doesn't want to pass any bill--any other round of relief. The  Republican leader admitted that as many as 20 Republican Senators don't  want to vote for anything. One Republican Senator voted not to vote  [[Page S6319]]  for ``another dime.'' Every time the Republican White House asks the  Republican Senators about a larger and needed COVID relief package, the  Republican Senators say: Don't do anything. We are too divided.   As if we needed any more proof this week that the votes this week are  not serious, it was just reported in the Washington Post that Leader  McConnell warned the White House against making a deal on a COVID  relief bill before the election. Let me repeat that. According to a  report in the Washington Post, the Republican leader warned the White  House against making a deal on another stimulus bill before the  election.   Maybe it is because he knows his caucus wouldn't support it. Maybe it  is because he doesn't want anything to interfere with his true  priority--rushing a Supreme Court Justice onto the bench mere days  before a Presidential election. Maybe it is both. Whatever the reason,  it is abundantly clear that what the Republican leader is offering this  week is a stunt--designed to look real but designed to fail.   He told the White House he doesn't actually want a deal before the  election. Now, if my Republican colleagues--those of the mind to help  the American people, not those who believe we have spent too much  already--want to do something real, we are going to give them a chance  on the floor right now. I will be making a motion to move the Senate  into a posture by which we could all vote on the Heroes Act that passed  the House. If the Senate were to pass it, it would head right to the  President's desk. The Democrats have already modified the bill to make  it more palatable to our Republican colleagues by coming down over $1  trillion.   So, if you are a Republican who wants to adequately fund our schools,  our hospitals, and our medical centers, vote with the Democrats on the  next motion. If you are a Republican who wants to adequately fund  testing and tracing and devote the resources our country needs to  prevent a second wave of the virus, you should vote with the Democrats  on the next motion. If you are a Republican who wants to assist all  small businesses, including our hardest hit industries and underserved  communities, newspapers, restaurants, minority-owned businesses, and  independent music venues and theaters, you can vote with us on the next  motion. If you are a Republican who wants to employ a lifeline to the  unemployed, to feed the hungry, to assist renters and homeowners, and  to stave off drastic cuts to State and local services, you should vote  with us--with the Democrats--on the next motion.   The country is crying out for real, substantial, comprehensive  relief. The Heroes Act provides it. It includes all of the urgent and  necessary measures that the Republicans have left out of their  proposals. If my Republican colleagues are serious--really serious-- about providing relief to the American people, then, vote to allow the  Senate to consider the Heroes Act.                           Vote on Motion to Table    Mr. President, I move to table the McConnell motion to proceed to  Calendar No. 554, S. 4675, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, because of this illicit process, this  rush to judgment, and the worst nomination proceeding of the Supreme  Court in American history that has so defiled the Senate, I move to  adjourn and to then convene for pro forma sessions only, with no  business being conducted, at 12 noon on the following dates and that,  following each pro forma session, the Senate adjourn until the next pro  forma session: Friday, October 23; Tuesday, October 27; Friday, October  30; Tuesday, November 3; and Friday, November 6; further, that if there  is an agreement on legislation in relation to the COVID pandemic, the  Senate may convene under the authority of S. Res. 296 of the 108th  Congress; finally, that when the Senate adjourns on Friday, November 6,  it convene at 4:30 p.m., Monday, November 9, and that following the  prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of  proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be  reserved for their use later in the day, and morning business be  closed.    I appeal the ruling of the Chair, and I move to table  the appeal.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
