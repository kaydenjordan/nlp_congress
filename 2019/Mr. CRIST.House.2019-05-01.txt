 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Engel for yielding me the  time.   I rise in strong support of the Climate Action Now Act written by my  dear friend and the chairwoman of the Select Committee on the Climate  Crisis, Kathy Castor. We are both blessed to represent the Tampa Bay  region of Florida, which is the most economically vulnerable to climate  change in the world.   For the people back home, this isn't a partisan issue. It is real. It  is happening. It threatens our environment, our quality of life, and  our economy.   I know there are friends and colleagues on the other side of the  aisle struggling with this issue, and I want to offer encouragement: Do  not wait for the next 1,000-year flood to hit your district or the next  freak Category 5 hurricane that explodes over warming seas right before  landfall. Do not wait for the next drought-fueled firestorm to destroy  one of your towns or for rising sea levels to flood the streets when it  rains during high tide, as it does in parts of my district.   The time to act is yesterday. Please vote ``yes.''
