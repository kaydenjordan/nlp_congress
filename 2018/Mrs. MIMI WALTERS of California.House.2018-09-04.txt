 Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I ask  unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which  to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous materials on  the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, we gather here this  evening to demand the immediate release of Michael Nguyen, an American  citizen and Orange County resident, who has been detained by the  Vietnamese government for nearly 2 months without cause.   Michael, a loving husband and father of four, owns a small printing  business and is actively involved in his community and church. He is a  law-abiding citizen with no criminal record in the United States   Michael traveled to Vietnam on June 27, 2018, to visit family and  friends. When he did not return home on July 16 as planned, his family  grew worried and contacted my office.   They learned through social media Michael had been imprisoned by the  Vietnamese government. On July 31, the State Department was able to  confirm Michael's detainment.   We now know he has been imprisoned for allegedly violating Article  109 of the Vietnamese criminal code, activities against the government.   Article 109 is an arbitrary and vague charge the Vietnamese  government often uses to justify baseless arrests. Michael could be  held for months without formal charges as the Vietnamese government  investigates.   During this time, Michael will be denied access to an attorney or  direct communication with his family. State Department officials are  only allowed to visit Michael once a month.   The Vietnamese government has refused repeated requests to provide my  [[Page H7818]]  office with evidence to substantiate Michael's arrest. In a perversion  of justice, the Vietnamese legal system allows individuals like Michael  to be arrested and languish in prison before its government even begins  an investigation or collects evidence.   Michael's detainment is only the most recent example of Vietnam's  troubling human rights record and lack of a transparent legal system.   Earlier this year, the Vietnamese government unjustly detained  William Nguyen, an American citizen of no relation to Michael.   I am deeply concerned for Michael's safety and well-being and I  demand his immediate release.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the Nguyen family's strength  during this trying time. I am inspired by their love for Michael and  determination to bring him home.   Michael's wife, Helen, is a nurse, who works long hours with many  emergency on-call days. Michael's flexibility as a small business owner  allows him to be the primary caregiver for their four young daughters.   His absence is devastating the entire Nguyen family. This American  family should not have to spend one more day worrying and wondering  when Michael will return home.   Michael's story has touched many people. Several of my colleagues who  have heard of Michael's detainment have joined my fight to secure his  release. I am grateful for their support and their willingness to join  tonight's Special Order.   We will not stop until Michael is returned home safely, and will  continue to put ongoing, relentless pressure on the Vietnamese  government. I am committed to bringing Michael home so he may be  reunited with his family, and will stop at nothing to make this happen.   Mr. Speaker, now it is my privilege to yield to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Royce), a fellow Orange County resident and esteemed  chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I yield to Congressman  Royce, representing the 39th District of California.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I now introduce my friend from Orange County who serves  on both the Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security Committees. I yield  to the gentleman from California, Congressman Lou Correa, representing  California's 46th Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, I would now like to  welcome Congressman Alan Lowenthal, the co-chair of the Congressional  Caucus on Vietnam.   I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal) of  California's 47th Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, my next colleague is an  active member on the Natural Resources, Agriculture, and Transportation  and Infrastructure Committees.   I yield to the gentleman from California, Congressman Doug LaMalfa,  representing California's First Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, my next colleague  proudly represents Michael Nguyen's family members who live in the  Houston area.   I now yield to Congressman Al Green of Texas, who represents the  Ninth Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, when I told Michael's  family I would be hosting this Special Order, I asked if there was any  message they wanted me to share on their behalf. I would now like to  read a personal statement from the family.                                time  2100    Michael Phuong Nguyen has been unlawfully detained for over 60 days.  He longs for the comfort of his family profoundly and deserves  immediate attention to return to the United States.   Michael's wife and four children urgently and desperately appeal to  all Members of Congress, right now, to take actions to bring Michael  Nguyen back home to his family where he belongs. All four girls are  experiencing heartfelt anxiety, affecting their school and emotional  well-being. He plays a crucial role in his four daughter's livelihood  and needs to be where his heart belongs, with his family.   Our prayers are with Michael Nguyen's family, and we want them to  know we will do everything in our power to bring him home.   Again, I thank my colleagues for joining me this evening to support  my constituent Michael Nguyen. We will not stop working until Michael  is released and returned safely to his family.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
