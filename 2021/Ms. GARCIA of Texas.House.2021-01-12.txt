 Mr. Speaker, I stand before the House floor  today alarmed--alarmed that just days ago a sitting President stirred  up a deadly attack on our U.S. Capitol. I join my colleagues in calling  on Vice President Pence to activate Section 4 of the 25th Amendment.   It has become abundantly clear that this President has threatened our  democratic system, has interfered with the peaceful transition of  power, and has endangered an equal branch of government. The President  of the United States is unhinged, unfit, and unstable, or as we say in  my district, ``esta loco el hombre,'' to the point where he is willing  to tear our democracy down unless he prevails in his quest to overturn  the election that he clearly lost.   The actions taken by this President and those who enable him show  that he is unfit to uphold the duties of his office. For the sake of  our Nation's security, this President must be swiftly removed.  [[Page H140]]     Mr. Speaker, democracy is a gift that one  generation gives to the next.
