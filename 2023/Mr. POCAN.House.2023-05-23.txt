 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Rhode Island,    David Cicilline, for his great work in Congress. He has been an LGBTQ+  leader, he has been a progressive champion, he has been a Judiciary  Committee leader, and he has been a mentor to many of us in Congress,  including myself. I am going to really miss having him and his wisdom  in Congress.   I think a lot of people are going to miss him across the country. If  you care about gun violence, you are going  [[Page H2544]]  to miss   David Cicilline. He was the author of the assault weapon ban,  so important as we have shooting after shooting after shooting with an  AR-15. His bill would help address that in this country. He always goes  above and beyond. Every time in this Chamber when there is a moment of  silence and no moment of action around gun violence, it is so  disheartening for everyone around the country, but that day that has  been talked about when he was one of the organizers sitting down and  taking over this Chamber to have a moment of action is one of the few  times, in fact, the only time that I saw that in my 10\1/2\ years in  Congress.   If you care about progressive values, you are going to miss   David  Cicilline. He was a progressive caucus leader. As chair of the DPCC, he  led in articulating our values for Democrats, and he did an amazing job  in doing that.                                time  1830    If you care about democracy, you are going to miss   David Cicilline.  Being an impeachment manager is a huge undertaking. You have, trust me,  all kinds of people around the country who disagree with you saying all  sorts of interesting things. David did an amazing job in standing up  for this country and for everyone who cares about our democracy in that  role.   If you care about consumer issues, you are going to miss   David  Cicilline. As the chair of that subcommittee on the Judiciary Committee  dealing with antitrust and tech issues, he was fighting on behalf of  consumers so that we could have more affordable cost of goods, so you  didn't just have a few monopolies running everything.   If you care about equality and LGBTQI+ rights, I guarantee you are  going to miss   David Cicilline. He was the chair of our Equality  Caucus for a very long time, and he was the lead author of the equality  bill.   Most importantly, David has been a role model for LGBTQ youth across  the country. It is not easy still, even in 2023, to be out and gay,  especially in this body with people who still are attacking trans kids  as a last gasp against equality. David has been our leader and a senior  member of the Equality Caucus, and we so respect all of the work that  he has done.   I am going to miss his positive leadership style, I am going to miss  his commonsense vision, but, most importantly, I am going to miss his  friendship.     David Cicilline has been a great mentor to many of us. We know he  is going to do great back in Rhode Island, and I, too, am going to get  to Clementine's.
