 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his extraordinary support.   Madam Speaker, I rise today because I am pretty damn angry. You know  the Supreme Court's decision overturning the right to abortion care is  fundamentally wrong. The Supreme Court green-lit forced pregnancy,  taking away the right to bodily autonomy for women.   Abortion is still healthcare. People will still need to access it,  and that is why I am supporting the Women's Health Protection Act.   In the wake of the Dobbs decision, we have a State-by-State patchwork  that denies women equal protection under the law.   While abortion is still legal in my home State of North Carolina, the  State of Texas is suing the government to compel women to carry  pregnancies to term, even if it kills the mother.   The attorney general of Indiana wants to force rape victims--even 10- year-old girls--to carry pregnancies to term.   We have a responsibility to stop this draconian overreach by State  governments, and we have got to make reproductive freedom--reproductive  freedom--the law of the land.
