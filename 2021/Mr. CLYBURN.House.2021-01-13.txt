 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Article of Impeachment.   Last Wednesday, we gathered to follow the Constitution's simple  instruction: To count the electoral votes that have been tallied by the  States and submitted to us.   This President refused to accept those results. Instead, he sought to  overturn them by inciting a violent insurrection. But we were not  deterred from doing our constitutional duty. Today, we must do our  constitutional duty once again.   While the President failed in his attempt to upend our democracy,  last Wednesday's events declared that if we do not hold him accountable  and remove him from power, a future attempt could very well be  successful.   The survival of our democracy depends on defeated candidates  accepting their defeats, as has been the case in every President's  election since 1864.   Our January 6 joint session is a vital part of the transfer of power,  not the contest for power. Vice President Gore understood this,  accepting and certifying the 2000 election result in which he was  defeated. Vice President Biden understood this, accepting and  certifying this President's victory in the 2016 election.   This President's refusal to participate in the peaceful transfer of  power and his role in the incitement of last week's violence posed an  existential threat to our constitution of democracy.   This threat must be extinguished immediately. This President must be  impeached and convicted, and he must be prevented from ever attempting  to seize power again.                                time  1315
