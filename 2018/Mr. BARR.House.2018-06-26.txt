 Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  especially thank the gentleman for his cooperative, constructive, and  bipartisan approach to the legislation, and improving the legislation.   We are in agreement on this point, that such involvement could cover  activity, including membership on the board of directors and observer  rights. In addition, the gentleman makes note of board nominations. As  we have seen under current law, CFIUS looks at nominations and the  risks that may arise from them. The Broadcom deal was a case in point.  However, the language in this bill makes this jurisdiction clearer.   The gentleman is right to focus on risks that a board member may pose  who is acting on behalf of a foreign investor who nominates the member.  The whole point of such nominations could be to involve the foreign  investor in substantive decision-making in a way that results in  national security risks.   H.R. 5841 could cover such a scenario. I thank the gentleman for  yielding.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Foreign  Investment Risk Review Modernization Act.   I want to thank the House authors of this bill, particularly the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), for his outstanding  leadership on this effort; and my friend, the gentleman from Washington  (Mr. Heck); also the Senate authors, Senator Cornyn and Senator  Feinstein; and House Chairman Hensarling, Chairman Royce, Chairman  Nunes, Chairman Thornberry, and Chairman Walden; as well as House  leadership for their efforts in bringing this nonpartisan legislation  to the floor.   Just by that list, you understand how complex this issue is because  it involves not only a multiagency effort of this government, it  requires the concerted and cooperative efforts of many committees in  this House and in Congress generally because of the shared  jurisdiction.   In 2016, new foreign direct investment added $894 billion in value to  the U.S. economy. Today, 6.8 million American workers are employed by  international companies, including 20 percent of U.S. manufacturing  workers.   In my own district in Kentucky, Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky,  Inc. supports 8,500 jobs as a result of benign foreign direct  investment, a great example of this. These are typically higher paying  jobs. So it is critical that we preserve in the United States an open  investment climate, to the extent possible, consistent with national  security objectives.   But a comprehensive update to both the export control regime and the  Committee on Foreign Investment in the  [[Page H5695]]  United States, or CFIUS as is it commonly called, is needed due to the  massive surge in malign investments by the Chinese and other bad actors  in U.S. assets.   This legislation closes loopholes in CFIUS' jurisdiction and  modernizes our process for identifying critical technologies without  duplicating agency efforts like earlier drafts of this legislation  called for, all the while ensuring these transactions are thoroughly  vetted in a timely manner so that America continues to attract much- needed foreign investment that does not implicate national security.   This legislation also authorizes CFIUS to review sensitive,  noncontrolling investments in critical technology or infrastructure  made by persons affiliated with countries of special concern or  threatening actors.   These changes improve upon previous versions of the bill that failed  to focus CFIUS' limited resources on the most serious threats and bad  actors, including China.   Importantly, this legislation grants CFIUS the authority to review  the acquisition of real estate near U.S. military installations and  other important national security assets. The legislation uses a new  and strengthened interagency export control process to review joint  ventures and outbound activities. I want to thank Chairman Royce for  his leadership on that point.   These reforms strike the right balance between bolstering national  security and ensuring strong economic growth. I encourage my colleagues  to support the legislation.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, this effort has been a success because we are  balancing the imperatives of national security with maintaining an  important open investment climate in the United States. Why that  balance is so important is because preserving benign foreign direct  investment and capital so that research and development in the United  States can flourish is important not only to preserve our competitive  edge in the global economy, it is important for national security.   Our economic strength contributes to our national security. We are  striking  [[Page H5696]]  the right balance with this new FIRRMA legislation.
