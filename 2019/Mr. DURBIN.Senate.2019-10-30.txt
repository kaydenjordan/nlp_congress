 I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet),  the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker), the Senator from California  (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator  from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.     I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet),  the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker), the Senator from California  (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator  from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms.  Warren) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I listened carefully to the Senator from  Texas, my colleague--and we have worked together and will continue to.  For the record, there is something that I think needs to be mentioned.   It was a year ago, maybe even longer, that the attorney general from  his State of Texas initiated a lawsuit with more than a dozen  Republican attorneys general to eliminate the Affordable Care Act--all  of it, the protection when it came to preexisting conditions, lifetime  limits, allowing members of the family to keep their children on their  policy until they reach the age of 26.   These States attorneys general, starting with his State of Texas,  said: Get rid of all of it. Eliminate it. And then President Trump  said: We will join in the lawsuit. Let's eliminate it completely.   So when I hear these pleas on the floor that we are all for the  principles  [[Page S6273]]  in the Affordable Care Act, not a single Republican Senator voted for  it, and now there is an effort by the attorneys general and the Trump  administration to do away with it.   Is it because they have a better idea? No. I am sure you remember  that moment not long ago when our departed colleague, John McCain, came  to the well of the Senate and was the deciding vote to save the  Affordable Care Act. The point he made is still valid. The Republicans  have no alternative. I want to make sure the Affordable Care Act is  better. There are some parts of it that need to be improved, but to  eliminate it as this lawsuit would from the Trump administration? That  is a step backwards.   There are two other points that I would like to make. When it comes  to our current healthcare system, it has many positive things:  wonderful doctors and hospitals, amazing technology and medicine.   But there are also some built-in flaws in the system. Let me give an  example, one simple story. I met a woman the other day. Her sister is  an OB/GYN. She got married, pregnant, about to have twins, couldn't be  happier, but the babies came early. And so this doctor went to the  hospital to deliver her babies, her twins, and they needed to be put in  the neonatal intensive care unit of the hospital, which of course she  did.   Good news. Three or four weeks later, they were ready to come home.  They came home, and of course, everyone was happy to receive them. But  they weren't happy to receive the bill for hundreds of thousands of  dollars. What was it for? It turns out that, at the hospital, the  doctor was in network for the woman who was delivering the baby. The  hospital was in the network for delivering the baby. But the NICU was a  separate entity that even this doctor didn't know it wasn't in network.   Her babies went to this lifesaving intensive care unit in the  hospital, and she received a bill for hundreds of thousands of  dollars--a surprise bill. Is that right? Of course, it is not. And here  is a professional, a medical professional, who frankly could not ask  all the right questions, obviously, and became a victim of the system.   Let me tell you one other story, when we talk about the current state  of the cost of medicine. I go to Rockford, IL, and I meet a young  woman, and she introduces me to her mother. Her mother is a waitress, a  hard-working lady, never took a day off in her life. But she did have  some health insurance, and her health insurance covered her daughter  until her daughter reached the age of 26, and then her daughter was on  her own.   The problem was her daughter is diabetic, and her mother understood  that now the cost of insulin, which had been covered by the family  health insurance, was an individual personal burden for her daughter to  pay, and the cost of insulin had gone up dramatically during the girl's  young life.   In the last dozen years or so, the cost of insulin has gone from $39  for a vial--one of the most commonly used types of insulin called  Humalog made by Eli Lilly--from $39 a vial to $329. The mother was in a  panic. Her daughter was working part-time and just getting started,  still suffering from diabetes. Her mother was afraid she would not be  able to afford the insulin, so her mother, a waitress, was taking her  money and putting it aside to buy vials of insulin, so if her daughter  started to run short, she would be able to provide her with the  insulin.   What is the cost of that same product in Canada? $39--$329 in the  United States; $39 in Canada. What is the difference? It is the same  drug made by the same company in the United States. The difference is  the government of Canada stepped up and said: We are not going to let  you do this. We are not going to let you run the cost of insulin to the  high heavens at the expense of people who live in Canada. And Eli Lilly  said: We will play by your rules, if that is what the Canadian  Government says.    So when I hear Senators, like my friend from Texas, get up and talk  about this terrible invasion of government into our rights, that lady,  that mother in Rockford would certainly like to have her government-- our government--step up and give her a chance to have affordable  insulin so she could have peace of mind for her daughter. It is not too  much to ask.                                The RELIEF Act    Mr. President, the reason I came to the floor is because I wanted to  respond to my friend--because it is a critical topic--but the reason I  came to the floor is to discuss an issue which is not uniquely  American, but is truly American.   For 528 years now in this place called America, we have immigrants  coming to the shores of our Nation. Starting and following Christopher  Columbus--if you buy that side of the story, and I do--we have had  millions come to our shores and they have become part of America. With  the exception of Native Americans and indigenous people, they have come  from every corner of this earth to be part of what we call the United  States.   You would think, with that history, that we would have a pretty clear  idea of what our policy should be when it comes to immigration. Sadly,  you are wrong. We have the most broken immigration system imaginable. I  have studied it for years and continue to. It is almost impossible to  understand all of the twists and turns in our immigration system.   Seven years ago, there were eight of us--four Democrats and four  Republicans in the Senate--with the leadership of Senator McCain,  Senator Schumer, and many others, who came together and rewrote the  entire immigration code, the entire immigration body of law. It took us  months of meeting every single night, hammering out compromises,  agreeing to provisions. Then we went to the Judiciary Committee, and  hundreds of amendments were offered. Senator Sessions of Alabama, I  think he offered dozens by himself. He wasn't too happy with the bill.   But we went through that lengthy process, came to the floor of the  Senate, and faced even more amendments. At the end of the day, though,  it passed. I believe it was 68 votes on the floor of the Senate. We  passed comprehensive immigration reform, sent it to the House of  Representatives, and unfortunately, the Republican leadership would not  even consider it. They didn't even bring it up for a debate or for an  amendment.   So we are stuck today with a broken system, and we are also stuck  with a system that is rife with politics. I would say, and I think no  one would contradict us, no President before Donald Trump has really  made such an issue of immigration--no one.   It has been an issue in the past, but this President, from the  beginning of his campaign until the current time, has hammered away at  immigration constantly, calling those that came from Mexico murders and  rapists and so many other things that he has done--I can go through the  long litany of things that have happened. It is pretty clear that, when  it comes to the policy of immigration, that this administration has  fallen down and falls short when it comes to immigration.   Today, I want to address one aspect of this. I am the ranking  Democrat on the Immigration Subcommittee. Coincidentally, the chairman  of that Subcommittee in Judiciary is the gentleman from Texas, Mr.  Cornyn, who just left the floor.   So far this year, 10 months into this year, our Subcommittee on  Immigration, despite all the problems, all of the challenges, has had  one hearing--one hearing. It is a good thing that we are not paid for  the work that we do because, frankly, we have done little or nothing.   The Senate Judiciary Committee in the same period of time has only  voted on one immigration bill. The Republican majority limited debate  to only 1 hour and didn't allow a single amendment to be offered. It is  hardly an ambitious effort to make a body of law better.   It is time for the Immigration Subcommittee to go back to work.  Today, I sent a letter--joined by every Democrat on the Judiciary  Committee--asking the Republican Chairman of the Immigration  Subcommittee, the gentleman from Texas, to hold a hearing on one  serious problem in our immigration system: the green-card backlog.   In our broken immigration system, there are not nearly enough  immigrant visas--legal visas known as green cards--available each year.  As a result, many of the immigrants to this country are stuck in  crippling backlogs for years, sometimes decades.  [[Page S6274]]    Close to 5 million future Americans are in line waiting for green  cards. Many are living and working in the United States on temporary  visas, while many are waiting abroad, separated from their families who  are living in the United States.   Under current law, only 226,000 family green cards and 140,000  employment green cards are available each year. Children and spouses of  lawful permanent residents count against these caps, which further  limits the availability of green cards.   The backlogs are really hard on families who are caught in  immigration limbo. For example, children in many of these families  ``age out'' because they are no longer under the age of 21 by the time  the green cards are available.   That is why I have asked the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, to hold  a hearing on this issue to consider several pending bills dealing with  this green card backlog. I have asked him repeatedly. I have asked  Senator Graham, and I have asked Senator Lee, who is engaged in this  debate. This will help the Senate to understand the impact of each of  these proposals before us, to try to reach an agreement.   That is how the Senate, incidentally, is supposed to work, where the  committees gather, bring in witnesses, have an open debate, agree on a  bill, move it forward to the floor, open it to debate on the floor. In  2013, as I mentioned, I was part of a bipartisan group that showed it  can work. We need to show it again. Then, our bill went through  extensive hearings and debate.   Unfortunately, the senior Senator from Utah, my friend, Mr. Lee, has  tried to avoid regular order on this question. He does not want it to  go to committee. I hope he will reconsider. He has come to the floor  several times to attempt to pass his legislation, S. 386, without any  debate or chance to offer any amendments. Because he has chosen this  approach, I have come to the floor today to speak about his legislation  and mine.   My concern with Senator Lee's bill is simple. The solution to the  green-card backlog is obvious: Increase the number of green cards. But  S. 386, Senator Lee's bill, includes no additional green cards. In  fact, it has carve-outs for special interests--which are not in the  original version of the bill that passed by the House--and that will  cut the number of green cards that are available to reduce the backlog.  Without any additional green cards, S. 386 will not eliminate the  backlogs for the immigrants, particularly those from India--and there  is a large number, over half a million, the nationality with the most  people in the employment backlog. It will dramatically increase  backlogs for the rest of the world if we go by Senator Lee's bill.    Ira Kurzban is one of the Nation's experts on immigration law. He  took a look at Senator Lee's bill, and he said the backlogs will be  longer and larger because of it. In fact, over 165,000 Indian  immigrants currently in line for these visas will still be waiting 10  years from now.   Mr. Kurzban has also made it clear that the Lee bill puts some Indian  immigrants to the front of the line--because they have been waiting the  longest--at the expense of every other country.         From 2023 until well into 2030, there will be zero EB-22       visas for the rest of the world. None for China, South Korea,       Philippines, Britain, Canada, Mexico, every country in the EU       and all of Africa. Zero. It would choke off green cards for       every profession that isn't IT--healthcare, medical research,       basic science, all kinds of engineering; chemists,       physicists.    That is why dozens of national organizations representing many  immigrant communities oppose the bill introduced by Senator Lee. Groups  representing Arabs, Africans, Asians, Canadians, Chinese, Greeks, the  Irish, Italians, Koreans, South Asians, and many, many more have come  out in opposition to the Lee bill. More than 20 of these groups sent a  letter in opposition.   In light of this attempt to pass the Lee bill and the problems it has  run into, I am offering an alternative to this legislation. My  alternative is basic and straightforward. It would eliminate the green  card backlog and treat all immigrants fairly.   The RELIEF Act, which I introduced with Senator Pat Leahy and Senator  Mazie Hirono, will treat all immigrants fairly by eliminating  immigration visa backlogs. The RELIEF bill is based on the same  comprehensive immigration bill I described earlier. It would lift green  card country caps, but, unlike S. 386, the RELIEF Act would increase  the number of green cards to clear the backlogs for all immigrants  waiting in line for green cards within 5 years. Compare that to S. 386,  the Lee bill, where more than 165,000 Indian immigrants currently in  line will still be waiting 10 years from now.   The RELIEF Act will also keep American families together by treating  children and spouses of legal permanent residents as immediate  relatives, just as the children and spouses of citizens are, so they  won't count against the green card cap. My bill would protect aging-out  children who qualify for legal permanent resident status based on a  parent's immigration status.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2603    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee  be discharged of S. 2603, the RELIEF Act, and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration; further, that the bill be considered read a  third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the time with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I am sorry for this objection. I thank the  Senator from South Dakota for coming to the floor on behalf of the  Senator from Utah. I have been in communication with the Senator from  Utah. I hope he will join me in asking for a hearing. This is an issue  which literally affects hundreds of thousands of people living in this  country, many of whom have been here for years and decades. Practicing  physicians in my hometown of Springfield are affected by this debate.  They want to know what their future will be and the future of their  children.   I am trying to find a reasonable way to work out a compromise on  this, and I stand ready to do so. I hope Senator Lee will join me in  asking Senators Graham and Cornyn to have a hearing before the  Judiciary Committee. I want to extend this invitation to Senator Lee to  join the Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats who signed a letter with  me today requesting this hearing.   I am happy to sit down and discuss this issue with the senior Senator  from Utah or any other Senator. If we work together in good faith, I  believe we can reach a bipartisan agreement on legislation that can  pass both Chambers and be signed into law.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, Mount Sinai Hospital opened its doors in  1919 as a place where Jewish physicians could train and treat the  immigrant community of Chicago's West Side. Founded by Lithuanian  Jewish immigrant Morris Kurtzon, Mount Sinai kept its mission as a  community hospital even as it evolved into a regional medical trauma  center. This month, Sinai celebrates a century of helping everyone who  come through its doors.   In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, German and Eastern  European Jews immigrated to Chicago by the thousands, fleeing religious  persecution. Chicago lacked quality healthcare for these immigrants,  especially in Chicago's South and West Sides.   Maimonides Kosher Hospital of Chicago opened in 1912 to fill the  healthcare gap, particularly the lack of kosher hospitals, and to serve  this immigrant community. However, Maimonides struggled financially and  closed after only four years.   Morris Kurtzon, a board member of Maimonides, was determined to keep  the dream alive. Kurtzon was born in Lithuania in the 1870s and came to  Chicago as a child. Before the end of the century, he established the  Garden City Plating and Manufacturing Company. He was a pillar of the  community, and with his $50,000 contribution, Maimonides Kosher  Hospital reopened as Mount Sinai in 1919.   Within 5 years under Kurtzon's leadership, Mount Sinai had five  floors, a nursing school, and had grown from 60 to 220 beds.   Kurtzon retired in 1950, but the hospital continued its growth. Mount  Sinai established what is now the oldest home healthcare program in the  State of Illinois in 1953. It became a major community anchor as the  largest employer in Lawndale.   Mount Sinai established the Midwest's first in-vitro fertilization  clinic in 1983. The following year, the Midwest's first rehabilitation  hospital, Schwab Rehabilitation Hospital, became part of Mount Sinai.  Today, it is among the Nation's top programs for physical medicine and  rehabilitation.   In 2012, Mount Sinai found an unlikely partner in Holy Cross  Hospital. When Mount Sinai merged with Holy Cross, they found a way to  preserve their different faith traditions while committing to the same  goal of serving the community.   In 1990, Mount Sinai was designated as a Level 1 Trauma Center, the  highest level of surgical care for trauma patients. Today, Sinai is one  of the unsung heroes in treating and working to prevent the gun  violence epidemic plaguing Chicago. From supporting the Gun Violence  Research Collaborative and community engagement programs to providing  world-class emergency treatment and trauma care, Sinai is working  tirelessly to treat both the physical and emotional wounds that  violence causes, and survivors are putting their lives back together at  the Schwab Rehabilitation Hospital.   I am proud to work with Mount Sinai on the Chicago HEAL Initiative,  which is another example of Sinai's continued commitment to serving the  community. Under the HEAL Initiative, 10 major hospitals that are  normally competitors are collaborating to use their economic footprint  and community engagement to reduce violence and improve health in their  neighborhoods.   Mount Sinai has embodied the Jewish values of ``tikkun olam,''  meaning repairing the world, and ``hachnasat orchim,'' meaning the  welcoming and caring for a stranger, for a century now. The names and  the community have changed, but the values have never changed. Mount  Sinai is still repairing the world and caring for strangers every day.   Congratulations on a century of helping people, and here is to  another century.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
