 Madam Speaker, in days, we will lose more American lives  than we lost during the Vietnam war, 26 million Americans unemployed  from COVID, body bags piling up, and insufficient testing and PPE.    Democrats took a bad Republican proposal and we made it better, but  this is far from enough. CARES four has to meet the scale of this  crisis with a bold paycheck guarantee that stops mass unemployment, an  essential workers package, and State and local government funding.   Every minute, Madam Speaker, is a death, a family devastated, a  business shuttered. We must think and deliver better.
