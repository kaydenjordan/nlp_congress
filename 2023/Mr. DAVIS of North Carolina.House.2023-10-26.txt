 Mr. Speaker, I am so glad we have  reopened the House.   There is much work ahead of us. We are just days away from a  government shutdown that could disrupt the essential services that our  children, veterans, military families, and seniors rely on.   The American people are counting on us to deliver a bipartisan farm  bill that uplifts farmers, producers, and communities across our  Nation.   We must also address security at our southern border and our more  than $33 trillion national debt. Above all, we must remain committed to  the safety and security of the American people.   Our ally, Israel, is engaged in a war against Hamas fighters.  Meanwhile, we must stop Putin in his tracks. There is also Iran and  China. A threat to democracy anywhere in the world is a threat to  democracy here in the United States of America.                            ____________________
