 Mr. Speaker, an article from the Federalist by Joy  Pullman today points out: ``Contrary to corporate media narratives, up  to 95 percent of this summer's riots are linked to Black Lives Matter  activism, according to data collected by the Armed Conflict Location  and Event Data Project. . . . Of the 633 coded as riots, 88 percent are  recorded as involving Black Lives Matter activists.''   So all of these corporations that are donating money, it is very  clear: They are helping a Marxist organization whose ultimate goal will  be to relieve these corporations of all of their private property.   Way to go.   Early estimates from insurance agencies apparently say they have set  a record in destruction for what the media--the alt-left media or  mainstream, whichever you prefer--say is just mainly peaceful  uprisings. It is astounding what has been occurring.    This article from The Daily Signal points out, from yesterday, that  if you go to the website for Black Futures Lab, a venture of Black  Lives Matter founder Alicia Garza, and click on donate, ``it will ask  you to send your money to an obscure organization, the Chinese  Progressive Association, explaining that `Black Futures Lab is a  fiscally sponsored project of the Chinese Progressive Association.' ''   So there you go. You are not only helping destroy America and  eliminate private property that you own, you are also helping the  Chinese Communist Party.   Congratulations for all of those. You are not making Black lives  matter; you are helping the Chinese Communist Party.
