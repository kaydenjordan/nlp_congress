 Mr. Speaker, this first Republican bill should be known  as the protect Donald Trump and his tax cheating cronies act.   After years of obstructing access to Donald Trump's tax returns, we  learned how little he paid toward the cost of our national security and  how poorly the Trump Internal Revenue Service enforced our tax laws.   Each year the richest 1 percent in our country avoid paying an  incredible $160 billion of the taxes they owe. This crime wave of  Trump-style tax cheating is made possible by Republican insistence on  defunding the revenue police. Over the past decade, audit rates for  corporations are down by half and the ultrarich by three-fourths.   Republican claimed interest in law and order seems to vanish when it  comes to tax fraud by the wealthiest few. And their very first bill  adds $114 billion to our deficit. Yes, Trump may have been  indispensable last week, but this is outrageous. When those, like  Trump, don't pay what they owe, then the tax burden gets shifted to  small businesses and to families across the country.   Reject the Republican drive to defund.
