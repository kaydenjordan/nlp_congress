 Madam President, the formation, development, growth  and success of Good Shepherd Housing and Family Services, GSH is a  story that exemplifies the very best in people-to-people programs.  Started in 1974 as a ``helping hand'' volunteer-run organization by  members of the Mount Vernon community, including several churches and  local businesses, the founders of GSH established a volunteer board of  directors to steer the organization's efforts to help those  experiencing homelessness in the Greater Mount Vernon community.   Today, GSH is a vital affordable housing and services provider with a  10-person professional staff and a $2.7 million operating budget. GSH  remains true to its founding vision and mission. GSH works every day to  reduce homelessness and enable self-sufficiency by  [[Page S2806]]  providing permanent affordable rental housing, emergency financial  services, budget counseling, and case management to hundreds of working  families in Fairfax County. Then, as now, GSH helps struggling families  create and sustain a better way of life for themselves and their  neighbors.   In 1975, GSH acquired its first property on Holland Road, built and  furnished a home, and moved in a struggling refugee family of nine and  began providing them ongoing support services, starting them on the  path towards self-sufficiency and housing stability. Two months later,  several Laotian and Vietnamese refugee families received housing  assistance upon their arrival in the community. For the next several  years, GSH continued to serve families and individuals needing housing  and emergency financial assistance. Under the leadership of its board,  GSH functioned solely with the support of volunteers and individual  donations.   Today, with its affordable rental housing portfolio of 100-plus  leased and owned units, as many as 120 struggling families are housed  and supported every year in GSH housing. GSH's emergency financial  assistance program assists an additional 200 households a year by  preventing evictions or providing security deposits. GSH case managers  also provide service referrals to another 200-plus households each year  to receive community services to address their healthcare,  transportation, and food needs.   Additional support services and programs are offered to move resident  household to greater self-sufficiency. The Children's Resources Program  supports the 110-plus schoolchildren residing in GSH affordable housing  units and ensures their educational needs are met. Various financial  counseling programs help low-income female heads of household create a  healthy consciousness around money and empowers them to begin to  establish financial security.   A president/chief executive officer, vice president/chief operating  officer, financial manager, and development director lead the day-to- day operations of GSH. They are assisted by staff of six full- and  part-time employees. A 16-member board of directors oversees its work,  while a leadership council of 23 key community stakeholders in the  service area provides advice and guidance on the needs and human  services trends within the community and the impact of GSH programs in  meeting those needs.   The current service area lies within the Mount Vernon and Lee  Districts of South Fairfax County, mainly along Richmond Highway from  Alexandria to Lorton, where many low-income workers live. The deepest  pockets of poverty in Fairfax County are here. For example, according  to 2016 U.S. Census Bureau data, 66,618 people 5.9 percent or 1 in 17  Fairfax County live in poverty i.e., below the Federal poverty level of  $24,600 per year for a family of four. Based on census data  disaggregated at the ZIP code and neighborhood level, several of the  neighborhoods in the GSH service area report that 10 to 15 percent of  their households live in poverty.   For more than 45 years, Good Shepherd Housing and Family Services has  had one outcome in mind: to ensure that the households it serves reach  housing stability, build financial resources, and never face the  possibility or reality of homelessness. Every year, GSH programs  stretch and grow to make this outcome a reality for its residents.  Recently, several local Northern Virginia and Metropolitan Washington,  DC, agencies recognized the affordable housing contributions of GSH  through grant awards that help finance the programs. As the need for  its services unfortunately continues to grow at a staggering pace, GSH  will continue to step up, lend a helping hand, and empower its clients  to do the same.                            ____________________
