 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1605, the Fiscal  Year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act. I commend our chairman  and ranking member for negotiating a strong bipartisan bill, which  provides our troops with the resources they need to accomplish the  missions they are given.   I thank my partner and chairman on the Readiness Subcommittee, John  Garamendi, for his leadership and hard work in crafting legislation  that we can all support. I thank my committee staff, Ian Bennitt, Dave  Sienicki, Whitney Verett, and Kyle Noyes, and my Space Force Fellow-- first time in congressional history--Chris Brown, for all of their  exemplary professionalism.                                time  2045    This legislation could not come at a more opportune time. As we  speak, Russia is amassing troops on the border of Ukraine, and China  continues to rapidly modernize their strategic capabilities, including  hypersonic drive vehicles, with their eyes on Taiwan.   This legislation is not perfect, but what it does do is ramp up  procurement of vital weapons systems, support our combatant commands,  restore spending to essential readiness accounts, and continue  modernizing our strategic capabilities in the space and nuclear  domains.   Importantly, it also provides some protections, partly through my  amendment, for those troops who do not take the COVID-19 vaccine and  requires DOD to consider natural immunity as part of their exemption  policy. We also removed troubling red-flag language and the requirement  for women to register for Selective Service.  [[Page H7221]]    Madam Speaker, this is a good bill. I am happy to support this  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
