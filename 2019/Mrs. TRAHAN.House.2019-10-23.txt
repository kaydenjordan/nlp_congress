 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of millions of  Americans to call ``foul'' on Major League Baseball.   This week, Major League Baseball is discussing a proposal to cut the  number of minor league franchises by 25 percent. The Lowell Spinners, a  Red Sox affiliate, is among the 42 teams being forced out.   This plan is a betrayal of the fans and players as well as stadium  vendors and employees around the Nation. It is an affront to the people  of Lowell who swung for the fences in building LeLacheur Park, one of  the Nation's best minor league parks.   As the World Series gets underway, remember that the minor league  system produces the talent we see on the baseball diamond. MLB's plan  is way off base and will hurt so many communities across the country  that rely on minor league teams' presence.   Let's call it a balk and get back to rooting for the home team.                            ____________________
