 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chairwoman, my amendment is an important  one for American families who are grappling with healthcare costs.   My amendment is an important one for the over 130 million Americans  who have a preexisting health condition like cancer, diabetes, heart  disease, asthma, or Alzheimer's.   My amendment takes aim at a proposed rule by the Trump administration  that encourages insurance companies to issue junk insurance plans.   Everyone calls them junk insurance plans because they often don't  cover vital health services. They may not cover a trip to the hospital  or the emergency room. They may not cover prescription drugs. They may  not cover mental health services that you need.   They are often marketed as a good deal, but they don't show a person  the fine print that they may cap benefits. What they do is they allow  discrimination against our neighbors who have a preexisting health  condition.   This is not in question because in committee, I asked the HHS  Secretary Azar point blank, I said: ``These short-term, limited- duration plans known as junk plans, they allow insurance companies to  discriminate against you if you have a preexisting health condition;  right, Mr. Secretary?''   He said: ``Yes.''   The law of the land after we passed the Affordable Care Act says that  no longer are we going to allow insurance companies to discriminate  against our neighbors who have preexisting health conditions. So how  can the Trump administration be moving forward?   Well, they are moving forward with a proposed rule that would allow  these plans to operate for 1 year, 2 years, or 3 years. That is not a  short-term, limited-duration plan. These are junk.   Just over a month ago, Democrats here in the House stood up for our  neighbors back home and passed a bill, H.R. 1010, that would halt the  Trump administration's dangerous expansion of junk health plans that  weaken the protection for Americans who have a preexisting condition.                                time  2100    Today, we are building on H.R. 1010 by offering this amendment with  my colleagues, Representatives Underwood, Barragan, DeSaulnier,  Spanberger, Moore, and Slotkin, to prohibit any funds from being used  to implement, administer, or enforce the administration's expansion of  junk plans. We are going to safeguard families from Republican attempts  to push them into junk insurance plans that don't cover the essential  healthcare services that they need.   The mandate from our neighbors back home is clear. They value  affordable healthcare and the bedrock protection of the Affordable Care  Act that prohibits discrimination based upon a preexisting health  condition.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, instead of ripping affordable  coverage away, my Republican colleagues and the administration should  be working with the Democrats to lower healthcare costs for American  families and protect coverage for preexisting conditions. One way that  we can do that is by supporting this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), who is a healthcare champion.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.
