 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, before I begin my remarks on Judge  Gorsuch, I just want to take a minute to talk about the chemical attack  in Syria.   Words cannot describe these vicious attacks against civilians. We  have all seen the horrific footage of the victims, many of whom were  children. These are innocent men, women, and children who, through no  fault of their own, are caught in the middle of a bloody civil war,  stuck between a brutal regime, armed groups, and foreign powers. My  heart goes out to the victims and their families.   The world has come together and unequivocally condemned these acts  and their perpetrators. We must work together to find a path toward  peace and stability in Syria, and the United States must take a  leadership role in that effort.   Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of Judge Neil  Gorsuch to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court. After  meeting with the nominee, carefully reviewing his record, and  questioning him during his confirmation hearing, I have come to the  conclusion that elevating Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court's  bench would merely guarantee more of the same from the Roberts Court--a  sharply divided, already activist Court that routinely sides with  powerful corporate interests over the rights of average Americans.   I think it is important to start by acknowledging just exactly how it  is that Judge Gorsuch came to be before the Senate; namely, this body's  failure to fulfill one of its core functions. Immediately following the  death of Justice Scalia, in a move as cynical as it was irresponsible,  Senate Republicans announced that they would not move forward with  filling the vacancy until after the Presidential election. Before  President Obama had even named a nominee, the majority leader said:  ``The American people should have a voice in the selection of their  next Supreme Court Justice.'' The only problem with the majority  leader's reasoning was the American people did have a voice in the  decision; they had voted to make President Obama the President of the  United States. Nonetheless, Republican members of the Judiciary  Committee gathered behind closed doors and vowed to defy the eventual  nominee a hearing. Many Republicans refused to even meet with the  nominee. They said it didn't matter who the President nominated; they  said this was about principle.   But Senate Republicans had a difficult time justifying their  obstruction--that is, until they decided to mischaracterize a speech  delivered by former Judiciary Committee chairman Joe Biden in June of  1992. In that June of 1992 speech, then-Senator Biden discussed the  possibility of a Supreme Court Justice resigning in an election year in  order to ensure that a President of the same party could name a  replacement. Under those circumstances, he said, the President should  refrain from nominating a replacement and the Senate should not hold  confirmation hearings until after the election.   My Republican colleagues seized upon this small portion of Senator  Biden's speech and dubbed it the ``Biden rule.'' Chairman Grassley said  the Senate ought to abide by the Biden rule, which he said holds that  there are ``no presidential Supreme Court nominations in an election  year.''   The majority leader said: ``As Chairman Grassley and I declared . . .  the Senate will continue to observe the Biden Rule so that the American  people have a voice in this momentous position.'' So in order to  justify a truly unprecedented act of obstruction, my Republican  colleagues pointed to the so-called Biden rule and said they were  standing on principle. That was the principle. But my Republican  colleagues chose to overlook a few important details.   First of all, the scenario Senator Biden described in his 90-minute  speech was not the situation our country faced last year. No one  strategically resigned last year. A Justice died. No one dies to game  the system.   Second and most importantly, my Republican colleagues ignored the  actual point that Senator Biden made in that speech. If they had  bothered to read the entire speech--and I suspect they actually had-- they would have found that further down, Senator Biden said--and this  is important. This is what Senator Biden said in the speech used as the  justification not to take up Merrick Garland. Senator Biden said in  that speech, ``If the president [then George H. W. Bush] consults and  cooperates with the Senate or moderates his selections absent  consultation, then his nominee may enjoy my support, as did Justices  Kennedy and Souter.''   Allow me to dwell on that for a moment. Senator Biden said that if a  Supreme Court vacancy arose during an election year and the President  consulted with the Senate or, absent consultation, put forward a  moderate, consensus candidate, that candidate  [[Page S2374]]  should enjoy the support of the Judiciary Committee's chairman. That is  the Biden rule. That is the Biden rule.   If Senate Republicans had actually followed the Biden rule, we  wouldn't be here today. Merrick Garland would be sitting on the Supreme  Court bench.   Over the past few days, I have heard my Republican colleagues  denounce Democratic opposition to Judge Gorsuch by claiming that there  never has been a partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee. But if  the shameful and unprecedented obstruction that Republicans used to  effectively block President Obama from appointing a Supreme Court  Justice wasn't a partisan filibuster, then I don't know what is.   Perhaps my Republican colleagues were concerned that President Obama  would seek to replace Justice Scalia--a reliably conservative member of  the Court--with a jurist whose view would place him or her on the  opposite end of the ideological spectrum. That seems to be the concern  that my good friend Senator Hatch expressed when he said:         [T]he President told me several times he's going to name a       moderate, but I don't believe him. [President Obama] could       easily name Merrick Garland, who is a fine man. He probably       won't do that because this appointment is about the election.       So I'm pretty sure he'll name someone the [Democratic base]       wants.    But as it turns out, in recognition of the forthcoming election and  the Republican-controlled Senate, President Obama did exactly what  then-Senator Biden said a President should do: He named a moderate,  consensus candidate. He named Merrick Garland.   Judge Garland was supremely well qualified for the job. Here is a guy  who was his high school's valedictorian, who attended Harvard on a  scholarship, won clerkships with legal legends like Second Circuit  Judge Henry Friendly and Supreme Court Justice William Brennan, and  left a partnership at a prestigious law firm to become a Federal  prosecutor during the George H.W. Bush administration. He later joined  the Justice Department, where he prosecuted the men responsible for  bombing the Oklahoma City Federal Building in 1995, and Merrick Garland  kept in touch with the survivors' and the victims' families. That is  the reason why one of the very first of three Republicans agreed to  meet with Judge Garland--Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, a staunch  conservative--because people of Oklahoma had such regard for Merrick  Garland.   After Judge Garland was confirmed to the DC Circuit in 1997, he  earned a reputation for working with his colleagues from across the  ideological spectrum to identify areas of agreement and to craft strong  consensus opinions, often by deciding a case on the narrowest grounds  possible.   Judge Garland was the right choice at the right time. He wasn't a  partisan warrior or a partisan political animal; he was a judge's  judge, and everyone knew it. That is why my Republican colleagues had  to hide behind new and misleading so-called rules in order to deny him  a hearing and a vote.   Judge Gorsuch is no Merrick Garland. Judge Gorsuch is a creature of  politics. That is not what Judge Gorsuch told me when I met him earlier  this year. I asked Judge Gorsuch if he was bothered by the way the  Senate treated Merrick Garland. He responded by telling me that he  tries to stay away from politics. But documents that the Judiciary  Committee received from the Department of Justice, including emails  between Judge Gorsuch and Bush administration officials, show that  Judge Gorsuch was very heavily involved in politics. A resume he sent  to President Bush's political director in November 2004--back when  Judge Gorsuch was looking for a job--detailed his work on Republican  political campaigns dating back to 1976 and highlighted an award he  received from Senate Republicans for his work to advance President  Bush's judicial nominees. Ken Mehlman, the former chairman of the  Republican National Committee, later recommended Judge Gorsuch for a  post at the Justice Department and described him as a ``true  loyalist.''   Understand, being politically active or being a Republican is not a  disqualifying characteristic in a Supreme Court nominee, at least not  in my book, but Judge Gorsuch's resume is relevant here because,  contrary to what he told me, his resume establishes that he is not just  intimately familiar with politics; he knows the politics of the  judicial nominations process and he knows it well. Let me explain why I  think that is important.   During the campaign, then-Candidate Trump spoke openly about his  litmus test and what kind of a judge he would appoint to fill Justice  Scalia's seat on the Court. He said that he would ``appoint judges very  much in the mold of Justice Scalia.'' During the final debate, he said,  ``The justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life. They will  have a conservative bent.''   Part of the reason that then-Candidate Trump could say that with such  conviction is because he had already outsourced the job of coming up  with a list of potential nominees to the Federalist Society and the  Heritage Foundation, both rightwing organizations. The groups produced  a list of 21 conservative judges for then-Candidate Trump, a list that  included Judge Gorsuch. Presumably, the Federalist Society and the  Heritage Foundation knew something about the judicial philosophy of the  men and women who it had decided to include on that list, given Judge  Gorsuch's previous work to push judicial nominees through the Senate. I  am sure he knew a thing or two about the Heritage Foundation and the  Federalist Society, as well.    In fact, Judge Gorsuch first learned that he was under consideration  for the vacancy from the Federalist Society's vice president, who was  working with the transition team. Judge Gorsuch went on to interview  with a host of other members of the transition team, including now- White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Chief Strategist Stephen  Bannon. Weeks later, President Trump had officially nominated Judge  Gorsuch. Both Mr. Reince Priebus and Mr. Bannon appeared before  rightwing activists at CPAC and talked about his nomination. Mr.  Priebus told the crowd that Justice Gorsuch would bring about ``a  change of potentially 40 years of law.'' He said: ``Neil Gorsuch  represents . . . the type of judge that has the vision of Donald Trump,  and [his nomination] fulfills the promise that he made to all of you,''  gesturing to a crowd of conservative activists.   So whether Mr. Priebus was suggesting that, if confirmed, Judge  Gorsuch would unsettle 40 years of precedent--like Roe v. Wade or  Chevron--or whether he was suggesting that Judge Gorsuch would be a  reliably conservative vote for the next 40 years, it seems clear to me  that confirming Judge Gorsuch is central to President Trump's political  agenda.   Now, my Republican colleagues would have you believe that nothing  could be further from the truth. In their view, they say that judges  call balls and strikes--nothing more, nothing less. Earlier this week,  for example, Senator Cruz said: ``Conservatives understand that it is  the role of a judge, and especially the role of a Supreme Court  Justice, simply to follow the law.'' He said that Senate Republicans  ``are not confirming someone who will simply vote with our team on a  given issue.'' It is Democratic judges, according to Senator Cruz who,  ``by and large view the process as achieving the result they want and  view the process of adjudicating a case as a political process.''   Let me explain why I take issue with that. If my Republican  colleagues truly believe that a judge's proper role is to call balls  and strikes and to decide cases narrowly, they would have confirmed  Merrick Garland, a judge with a proven track record of crafting  consensus opinions built on narrow holdings. But a judge who calls  balls and strikes isn't really what my colleagues want. Contrary to  what Senator Cruz said, what my Republican colleagues want is a  results-oriented judge. Why else would they hold open a seat on the  Supreme Court bench? Why else would they turn to the Heritage  Foundation and the Federalist Society for candidates? Why else would  they trample on the traditions of the Senate? What my Republican  colleagues really want is a judge who will vote with their team, and  that is the judge they will get by confirming Neil Gorsuch. That is  what this is all about. That is what this is about.   Unlike Merrick Garland, Judge Gorsuch has little interest in reaching  consensus or in citing cases narrowly.  [[Page S2375]]  Now, Judge Gorsuch took great pains to paint himself as a mainstream  nominee. He pointed out that the Tenth Circuit ruled unanimously 97  percent of the time, and that he was in the majority 99 percent of the  time, but that is not unusual, and it doesn't provide any insight into  his approach to being a judge. After all, the Courts of Appeals are  required to follow Supreme Court precedent in all circuits around the  country, and the vast majority of their cases are decided unanimously.   So in order to really understand Judge Gorsuch's approach to deciding  cases--in order to really understand how he views the law--it is  critically important to look at the cases where he chose to write  separate concurrences or dissents. These concurring and dissenting  opinions offer the clearest window into how he really thinks. Judge  Gorsuch tends to write a lot of concurring and dissenting opinions.  Even when Judge Gorsuch agrees with the majority and joins their  decision, he frequently writes his own concurrence, setting out his own  views. Judge Gorsuch has done this 31 times, including writing two  concurrences to majority decisions that he, himself, had written. That  is not seeking out consensus. That is holding his nose to join a  consensus opinion, and then writing separately in order to point the  way to broader, more sweeping rulings that other courts might issue in  future cases--other courts like the Supreme Court, which doesn't have  to follow precedent, which he is now poised to join and where he will  not be restrained by precedent.    Judge Gorsuch is a results-oriented judge, and his record  demonstrates that he approaches cases with a very specific outcome in  mind. Contrary to what my Republican colleagues would have you believe,  he doesn't hide that judicial philosophy. Whether it is his concurrence  in Hobby Lobby or his dissent in TransAm Trucking, Judge Gorsuch wears  that philosophy on his sleeve. It only underscores a disturbing  pattern: siding with corporate interests over average Americans.   That philosophy was on full display in the dissent that Judge Gorsuch  wrote in TransAm Trucking. It seems clear to me that Judge Gorsuch  approached this case with a specific outcome in mind, which was siding  with a company over a worker. And in order to just justify that outcome  in his dissent, Judge Gorsuch twisted himself into a pretzel.   You may have heard this story, but I want to lay it out as  efficiently as possible because I think it reveals a great deal about  Judge Gorsuch's philosophy, and it helps to explain exactly why I am  voting against him. In this case, trucker Alphonse Maddin is driving a  rig on the interstate through Illinois. He is pulling a long trailer  that is fully loaded. He makes a stop. He takes a break. Then, at 11  p.m., he is about to pull back onto the interstate, but discovers that  the brakes on his trailer are locked. It is 14 below zero out. These  brakes are literally frozen. So he calls his dispatcher to ask for  repairs. And he waits.   While he is waiting, the heater in his cab stops working, and he  falls asleep and is awakened by a call from his cousin. When Maddin  sits up to answer the phone, he realizes that his torso is numb, and  that he can't feel his feet. He is having trouble breathing. His cousin  later says that Maddin's voice is slurred, and he wasn't tracking.  According to the Mayo Clinic, these are all symptoms of hyperthermia.  Maddin calls into the dispatcher again. He is told to hang on. He says:  I can't. His boss tells him he has two choices, wait there until the  repair truck comes, or he can take the whole rig on the road, including  the trailer with frozen brakes. Those are the two options he is given  by his boss. Maddin knows that if he waits, he may very well freeze to  death. That is his first option, or he can go out on the interstate at  2 o'clock in the morning, dragging a fully-loaded trailer with frozen  brakes at 10, maybe 15 miles per hour max, posing a safety hazard to  other drivers at the interstate. Remember, it is 2 o'clock in the  morning. It is dark. It is probably icy. Imagine a car going 80, 85  miles per hour--as people do at 2 o'clock in the morning on an  interstate--coming up over a hill behind that rig, and then coming down  and seeing this rig going 10 or 15 miles per hour, where you are going  80, 85. That would be like suddenly coming down on a stopped tractor  trailer while you are going 70 miles per hour. That is his second  option.   Instead, Maddin does what any of us would do. He unhitches the  trailer and drives down the interstate to find someplace warm, and he  does get warm. Then he returns to the trailer when the repair truck  finally shows up, and he is fired. He is fired for abandoning his  cargo. Now, there is a law to protect people in Maddin's situation. So  he files a case. When it gets to the Tenth Circuit, a three-judge panel  agrees with him, with Maddin. They find that the trucking company  shouldn't have fired Mr. Maddin, but one judge dissented--Judge Neil  Gorsuch.   So during my question, I asked Judge Gorsuch a very simple question:  What he would have done if he had been the truck driver; if he had been  driving that truck. I asked: Which would you have chosen? What would  you have done? And here is Judge Gorsuch's response: ``Oh, Senator, I  don't know what I would have done if I were in his shoes.''   Now, is there anyone here who would not have done what that driver  did? I don't think so. Of course, you would unhitch the trailer and  find someplace warm as quickly as possible--of course. But Judge  Gorsuch said he didn't know what he would have done? Is that possible?   I asked him if he had even thought about what he would have done if  he were Maddin. You know, he had heard the case. He did not answer. So  I asked him again. I asked him, given the choices of sitting there and  possibly freezing to death or going on the road with an unsafe vehicle,  or doing what Mr. Maddin did, and Judge Gorsuch responded: Senator, I  don't know. I was not in the man's shoes.   Judge Gorsuch said he decides cases based on the facts and the law  alone. ``I go to the law,'' he said. But so, in fact, did the majority.  Here is the operable law. Here is the law: ``A person may not discharge  an employee who refuses to operate a vehicle because the employee has  reasonable apprehension of serious injury to the employee or the public  because of the vehicle's hazardous safety or security condition.''   The majority ruled that the company could not fire the truckdriver  because he had refused to operate the rig, the entire rig, because it  was unsafe. But Judge Gorsuch said no. While operating the cab, he was  operating the vehicle. Therefore, he did not refuse to operate a  vehicle.   Judge Gorsuch said he made that decision by applying the plain  meaning rule. I pointed out that the plain meaning rule has an  exception: ``When using the plain meaning rule would create an absurd  result, courts should depart from the plain meaning.'' It is absurd to  say that this company was within its rights to fire him because he  refused to choose between possibly dying by freezing to death or  possibly killing other people by driving a semi on an interstate at 10  miles an hour at 2 in the morning. Frankly, the company is fortunate  that Mr. Maddin made the choice he made because otherwise they may very  well have faced a wrongful death claim.   Everyone who was in the hearing knows what Judge Gorsuch would have  done in Alphonse Maddin's situation. If Judge Gorsuch had answered  honestly, he would have said that he would have done exactly, exactly  what the driver did. Everyone would. Judge Gorsuch just did not want to  admit it. That is because there is no good answer.   If Judge Gorsuch said that he would do the very same thing that Mr.  Maddin did, that would make his dissent look pretty bad. But if he had  said ``I would have done what the company told me to do,'' that would  be an absurd answer. That would make you question the man's judgment.  No one would believe it. So, instead, Judge Gorsuch said: I don't know  what I would have done. But of course he did. He just was not being  honest. Judge Gorsuch approached Mr. Maddin's case with an outcome in  mind, siding with the corporation, and the dissent that he wrote makes  that perfectly clear.   When I joined the Senate back in 2009, I arrived here in June, a  little later than the rest of my class. Just a few days later, my fifth  day in office, Judge Sonia Sotomayor appeared before the Judiciary  Committee for her  [[Page S2376]]  first day of her confirmation hearings for the Supreme Court. I have  been thinking a lot about Justice Sotomayor's hearings because the  concern I expressed about the direction of the Court back then is just  as relevant as today. Back then, almost 8 years ago, I voiced concern  about it becoming more difficult for Americans seeking a level playing  field to defend their rights and get their day in court, from bringing  a discrimination claim to protecting their right to vote.   Back then, I said: ``I am wary of judicial activism and I believe in  judicial restraint. Yet looking at recent decisions on voting rights,  campaign finance reform, and . . . other topics, . . . there are  ominous signs that judicial activism is on the rise.''   That was my first opening statement, the first opening statement that  I ever delivered at the first confirmation hearing that I ever  attended. But in the years that followed, my concerns have proved to be  justified in one 5-to-4 decision after another. We have seen the  Roberts Court go out of the way to answer questions not before it, to  overturn precedents, to strike down laws enacted by Congress, and to do  all of this at great cost to consumers and to workers and to small  businesses and to middle-class Americans.   In decisions such as Shelby County, the Court gutted one of our  landmark civil rights laws, 5 to 4. During the oral argument, Justice  Scalia suggested that when the Voting Rights Act had last been passed  97 to 0 in the Senate, the Senate had done it because of the name of  the Voting Rights Act. How could you vote against the Voting Rights  Act? What a great name. He was showing contempt for this body. What is  more judicially active than overturning a law voted on unanimously in  the Senate because the Senate just liked the name?   Of course what that did was get rid of preclearance. What is  preclearance? Preclearance said that those States that had a history of  suppressing the votes of minorities had to preclear any new voting law  with the Justice Department.   These were States that had a history of suppressing the votes of  racial minorities. Well, that gets overturned. Boom. States like North  Carolina, Texas, start passing new laws--voter ID laws. The second  section of the Voting Rights Act still stayed, so you could appeal to a  Federal court. But it takes a while to work its way through.    So finally, in early 2016, a circuit court, the Fourth Circuit I  believe, ruled that North Carolina had targeted African Americans with  almost surgical precision to suppress their votes. That is why you have  preclearance. That is why you want preclearance. But in a 5-to-4 vote,  preclearance was struck down. That is one 5-to-4 case. Concepcion, a 5- to-4 decision, allows corporations to force consumers into mandatory  arbitration. There are a whole host of 5-to-4 decisions that make it  impossible for people to get into the courts.   But the most egregious of all 5-to-4 decisions was Citizens United-- another 5-to-4 decision that paved the way for individuals and outside  groups to spend unlimited sums of money in our elections.   In each one of those 5-to-4 decisions Justice Scalia sided with the  majority. So now this body considers replacing him with Judge Gorsuch.  I think it is important to understand the extent to which he shares  Justice Scalia's views. Judge Gorsuch's record demonstrates that he is,  in President Trump's words, a judge very much in the mold of Justice  Scalia.   During his time on the Tenth Circuit, Judge Gorsuch has consistently  ruled in favor of powerful interests. He has sided with corporations  over workers, corporations over consumers, and corporations over  women's health.   A study published in the Minnesota Law Review found that the Roberts  Court is the most pro-corporate Supreme Court since World War II. If  the Senate confirms him, Judge Gorsuch guarantees more of the same from  the Roberts Court, and I do not believe that is a Court that our  country can continue to afford.   So I oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination. I urge my colleagues to take  a close look at his record of siding with powerful corporate interests  over average Americans, to consider carefully how he stands to impact  the Court, and to reject his nomination.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). The clerk will call the roll.   The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
