 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the conference  report to H.R. 2, but also strong commendation toward our chairman, Mr.  Conaway, for having the many, many hearings about all aspects of the  farm bill and the condition of the ag economy in this country.                                time  1515    This does represent a strong compromise response to the needs of  rural America, where stability is needed; certainty to the farmers and  ranchers weathering a 50 percent drop in farm income in recent years. A  positive step for rural America and its ag economy where stability,  again, is greatly needed.   Much of these resources are to remote, rural towns to improve  broadband connectivity, which is critical for telehealth and further  rural development.   It acknowledges the challenges faced by many California farmers,  including prioritizing mechanization research to help address the  continued ag labor shortage.   It maintains an accessible food supply for families in need,  especially in rural, poor districts like mine, while also bringing an  increment of accountability to the food stamp SNAP program.   It strengthens our rural development title to boost jobs in rural  America, such as water conservation improvements and incentives as  well.   I wish we could have done more on forestry. The town of Paradise and  the surrounding area that suffered so much is a prime example of why we  need to have better forest management in that State, in this whole  country, but I think that continuing to have these conversations is  extremely important.   So with the worst fires in State history, I am really, really hoping  for that improvement.    Mr. Speaker, I commend Chairman Conaway for fighting for  policies that support American agriculture.   We are in tough times right now, with 5 years of lower incomes. And  the consistency and stability that farmers  [[Page H10146]]  need, all Americans need in the rural economy, this farm bill will make  a significant impact in helping on that.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Calvert, for  organizing this tonight. Indeed, it isn't pleasant, because we are  losing some great colleagues here.   The people have spoken, it is their will in the election, and we all  know that this is a fleeting time and opportunity to be here. It just  really is a reality check when you have plans and you are going along,  and an election happens, and all of a sudden those plans change for  some of your colleagues or even yourself. Who knows?   But indeed, it has been a great pleasure for me to serve several of  my years here overlapping with  David Valadao, Ed Royce, Dana  Rohrabacher, Darrell Issa, Steve Knight, Jeff Denham, and Mimi Walters.   It is a fleeting moment, but also one you will always remember. The  friendships are the most important things. I am not going to list bills  we have passed or this or that, because indeed what I take away are the  friendships.   Having come up in the legislature with Mimi, Jeff, Steve, and David,  we  [[Page H10163]]  came in together, we formed our early competitive political lives  together in that crucible in Sacramento. I think when I think back on  this, I am not going to remember a lot about the bills or a lot about  that, and I don't think any of us really will so much. It is the  friendships. It is the relationships. And I count Mimi, Jeff, and David  as my closest friends in this place.   So when you go around the hallways here and you see that the bronze  plaques have been ripped off the offices there, indeed it is like  having a part of it ripped off your heart, you know? But we soldier on,  because the people have spoken. It is the will of the voters.   I know I have been proud to always stand with them. Whether fighting  for water, for agriculture, for fiscal responsibility, for the right  direction for our Nation, I have always counted on these friends to  help keep all of us moving on the right track, thinking about the right  things.   So indeed in these relationships, the fun that comes along with it,  like with my friend ``Cowadao.'' And Jeffrey, who we always refer to  each other as our full formal first names. And M-I-M-I. We have had a  lot of fun in this. And I think we have all fought hard in the trenches  to advance not only our State at that level, but our country as well.   We are all better off for it. I am better off for having known them.  And it is not going to be as fun, it is not going to be as fulfilling  to be around here without friends like that, but, again, it is the will  of the voters. It is how things go.   We will see each other in many other capacities as we move through  this life together.
