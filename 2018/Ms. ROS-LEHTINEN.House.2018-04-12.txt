 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the ninth  annual Dream Makers' Gala hosted by Debbie's Dream Foundation.   On April 21, friends, family, healthcare advocates, and community  leaders from throughout our south Florida area will gather together to  raise awareness and mobilize efforts to fight stomach cancer.   This year's event is especially meaningful to all of the staff,  volunteers, and supporters of Debbie's Dream Foundation. Why? Because,  sadly, we recently lost Debbie Zelman. Nearly a decade ago, Debbie was  diagnosed with stage IV stomach cancer. But rather than give in, she  decided to take action. She started Debbie's Dream Foundation to fund  stomach cancer research and fight this dreadful disease.   In 2018, more than 26,000 people will be newly diagnosed with stomach  cancer in our great country. That is why this event and this  organization are so important to defeat stomach cancer once and for  all.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Debbie's wonderful parents who  carry on this fight, her family members, and all of the advocates for  their lifesaving efforts and tireless commitment to fulfilling Debbie's  dream.   Let us make this night a celebration of Debbie's determination,  perseverance, and, most importantly, Debbie's amazing life.                            ____________________
