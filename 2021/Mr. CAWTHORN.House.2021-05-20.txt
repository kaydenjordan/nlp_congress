 Mr. Speaker, the problems of today will rest squarely  on the shoulders of America's children. There is nothing more  foundational to the longevity of this Republic than investing in the  next generation.   During this COVID pandemic, educating our students and preparing them  to face the battles and turmoil of the future has never been harder. If  we have learned one thing through this pandemic, it is that in-person  teaching is foundational to future success.   I want to extend the thanks of a grateful district to the teachers of  Veritas Christian Academy, headmaster Dr. Robert M. Woods, and other  institutions who remained open throughout this pandemic and placed the  needs of our schoolchildren first.   Your valiant efforts are seen. Your dedication to America's youth in  the face of great challenges is recognized. And your great  determination to safeguard our future leaders is of high commendation.   Thank you for all that you do, and I look forward to being back in  the district to see you all soon.                            ____________________
