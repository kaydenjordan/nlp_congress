SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory  [[Page H7541]]       Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be determined by reference       to the latest statement titled ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO       Legislation'' for this Act, submitted for printing in the       Congressional Record by the Chairman of the House Budget       Committee, provided that such statement has been submitted       prior to the vote on passage.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1420.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friends and colleagues on the Energy and  Commerce Committee, Ms. Eshoo from the great State of California and  Mr. Kinzinger from my home State of Illinois, for working in a  bipartisan manner to bring H.R. 1420, the Energy Efficient Government  Technology Act, to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government is the largest single consumer of  energy in our Nation. As we continue to combat the climate crisis, Mr.  Speaker, we must use every tool at our disposal.   This bill will help modernize the Federal Government's IT and data  centers by requiring Federal agencies to employ the latest technologies  and energy management strategies. In doing so, Mr. Speaker, the bill  will reduce the government's energy use, thus saving taxpayers millions  of dollars.   Mr. Speaker, technological advances have allowed us to generate more  data today than many thought possible just several years ago. This  data, which often includes highly sensitive information, is stored in  Federal data centers that consume a significant amount of our Nation's  energy. The bipartisan legislation offered by my colleagues will reduce  the energy consumed by Federal data centers by requiring the Department  of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency to collaborate with  stakeholders on efficiency programs at data centers all across our  Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I commend my colleagues, Ms. Eshoo and Mr. Kinzinger,  for their work on this bill, and I encourage all my colleagues to  support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1768) to reauthorize subtitle G of title VII of the Energy Policy  Act of 2005, relating to diesel emissions reduction, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1768         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Diesel Emissions Reduction       Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION.         Section 797(a) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C.       16137(a)) is amended by striking ``2016'' and inserting       ``2024''.  [[Page H7542]]     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill, H.R. 1768.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Diesel Emissions  Reduction Act of 2019.   This legislation, introduced by my colleague on the Energy and  Commerce Committee, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Matsui), will  reduce harmful emissions and improve air quality in our Nation's  communities by incentivizing upgrades or replacements of millions of  diesel engines currently in use across our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, diesel engines play an important role in the American  economy, helping bring children to school and transport goods all  across our country, while supporting jobs across the Nation.   Retrofitting older diesel engines that emit significant amounts of  exhaust with cleaner, American-made technology is an easy initiative to  support.   The Diesel Emissions Reduction Act, also known as DERA, has enjoyed  overwhelming bipartisan support, and every State has received funding  through the program since it was created by Congress nearly 15 years  ago.                                time  1645    Since its inception, Mr. Speaker, DERA has been one of the most cost- effective Federal environmental programs, with up to $30 in return in  health and economic benefits for every $1 put into the program.   The program has also been responsible for the creation and retention  of local U.S. jobs that involve manufacturing, installation, and  servicing of emissions-related technologies.   At a time, Mr. Speaker, when our Nation is looking for ways to create  jobs, protect the health of our communities--especially those who are  most vulnerable--address climate change and protect the environment,  supporting this bill, DERA, stands out as a prime example of what  really works.   I thank the gentlewoman for her tireless work and for being such a  tireless advocate for the DERA program, and I strongly urge my  colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to associate myself with the remarks of  the gentleman from Michigan, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2114) to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to provide  Federal financial assistance to States to implement, review, and revise  State energy security plans, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2114         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(4) Table of sections.--The table of sections for part D of       title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act is       amended by adding at the end the following:  ``Sec. 367. State energy security plans.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2114.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2114, the Enhancing  State Energy Security Planning and Emergency Preparedness Act of 2019,  and I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2114 was introduced by myself and my good friend  and colleague from Michigan, the ranking member of the Energy  Subcommittee, Mr. Upton, and I want to thank my colleague for working  with me to bring this bill to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation would simply amend the Energy Policy  and Conservation Act by adding a new section authorizing States to  utilize Federal funding received through the State Energy Program to  implement, revise, and review a State energy security plan.   H.R. 2114 lays out eligibility requirements for the contents of a  State energy security plan to receive assistance and requires the  Governor of a State to submit a new plan, revisions to a plan, or to  certify that no revisions to the plan are necessary to the Secretary of  Energy every year.   These emergency plans have been vital to the States as they continue  to improve their ability to identify potential energy disruptions,  quantify the effects of disruptions, establish response plans, and  limit the risk of further disturbances, whether they be natural or man- made.   Mr. Speaker, now more than ever, it is critical that we provide the  resources for States to take even more of a prominent role in advancing  smart and sustainable energy policy.   Since their inception in the 1970s, State energy programs, bolstered  by Federal aid, have assisted States in developing much-needed energy  efficiency and energy conservation measures. Some of these federally  assisted initiatives that have been implemented by the States include,  but are not limited to, establishing new partnerships to finance  retrofit programs, managing loan programs, offering energy savings  performance contracts, expanding the use of alternative fuels, and  promoting distributed renewable energy.   Mr. Speaker, Federal funding and leadership have always been critical  in helping States and local stakeholders identify the roles and  responsibilities of the various agencies in times of emergencies, while  also supporting training and response exercises.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is a product of a thoughtful and bipartisan  negotiation process between Ranking Member Upton and myself to provide  Federal guidance and resources to the States that are most vulnerable  to critical energy infrastructure threats. Members on both sides of the  aisle support the State Energy Program, and this legislation will help  allocate additional resources to further develop and enhance State  energy security plans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  [[Page H7545]]  (H.R. 1760) to require the Secretary of Energy to establish and carry  out a program to support the availability of HA-LEU for domestic  commercial use, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1760         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Nuclear       Regulatory Commission.        (2) Department.--The term ``Department'' means Department       of Energy.        (3) HA-LEU.--The term ``HA-LEU'' means high-assay low-      enriched uranium.        (4) High-assay low-enriched uranium.--The term ``high-assay       low-enriched uranium'' means uranium having an assay greater       than 5.0 percent and less than 20.0 percent enrichment of the       uranium-235 isotope.        (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of Energy.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 1760.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1760, the Advanced  Nuclear Fuel Availability Act introduced by my colleagues on the Energy  and Commerce Committee, Mr. Flores from Texas and Mr. McNerney from  California.   This legislation, Mr. Speaker, will help facilitate the availability  of high-assay low-enriched uranium, the fuel required for most advanced  nuclear reactor design. Mr. Speaker, there is no existing commercial  market for this fuel.   In order to ensure that this fuel is available for advanced reactors  in the United States when they are fully licensed and ready to provide  consumers with electricity, the Federal Government will need to  coordinate efforts among agencies and within the commercial nuclear  sector to ensure that high-assay low-enriched uranium can be licensed  and transported safely.   Mr. Speaker, we must develop a domestic market for the fuel needed to  power these advanced nuclear reactor projects that are coming into the  market in the near future.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce  Committee, both Mr. Flores and Mr. McNerney, for developing this  thoughtful and much-needed proposal.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1760, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, again, associate myself with the remarks of  the gentleman from Michigan, and I yield back the balance of my time.
