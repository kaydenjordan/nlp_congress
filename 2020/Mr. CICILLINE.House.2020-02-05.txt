 Madam Speaker, I rise today to welcome Rabbi Seth  Frisch, who delivered today's opening prayer to the people's House.   Since his ordination in 1986, at the Jewish Theological Seminary of  America in New York, Rabbi Frisch has been a source of comfort and  counsel to Jews around the world. In his current posting as rabbi and  teacher of the New Shul of Philadelphia, Rabbi Frisch helps serve as a  guide for those who want to learn more about what it means to be Jewish  in a safe and supporting setting.   In a way, today's opening prayer was a homecoming for Rabbi Frisch,  who previously served as a legislative assistant to the chairman of the  United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.   I pray that we will all heed his words today, that out of many, we  are one Nation. Let us strive to put our divisions behind us and  realize our dream of a country indivisible with liberty and justice for  all.                            ____________________
