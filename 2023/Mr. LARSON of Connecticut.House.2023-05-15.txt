 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the  body on what has become a new term of art in politics called a  polycrisis.   A polycrisis is when extraordinary events are taking place around the  world, of which we are all too familiar with, including a global  pandemic that has set off global supply chain issues and that have set  off global inflation that impacts everybody around the globe. All of  which have been compounded by the war in Ukraine and all the disruption  that that has caused.   In the midst of this polycrisis, who has been impacted the most in  this country by both the pandemic and inflation?   People impacted the most by the pandemic are people over the age of  65. Of roughly the more than 1.2 million Americans who have succumbed  to the pandemic, over 850,000, Madam Speaker, are over the age of 65.   The people who are most impacted by inflation are people on a fixed  income, and they tend to be people over the age of 65 because they are  the people on Social Security, which means that some 66-plus million  Americans are impacted by both the pandemic and inflation, and Congress  needs to act.   What we need to do most of all is put the debt ceiling issue behind  us. To play chicken with people's lives with Social Security checks on  the line, to default on the American dollar, is criminal. These are  probably unintended by the other side of the aisle, but nonetheless,  the direct result of a gamble that makes no sense.   Who is looking in during this polycrisis but our competitors around  the world, most notably, China and Russia, who would love to see the  value of the dollar and the standing of the United States shaken.   Oddly and ironically enough, this is not happening by any of these  events abroad but happening right here in this Chamber by the failure  of Congress to lift the debt ceiling, something that was done three  times during the Trump administration. Yet, in the face of this pending  crisis, with our seniors, the most vulnerable amongst us, facing  excruciating circumstances, we continue to dither here.   Put the debt ceiling on the floor, vote on it, and lift it so we can  get on with sending relief to the American people.   Congress should be embarrassed by its negligence. It has been more  than 52 years since Congress has enhanced benefits for Social Security.   How can people go home and look at their friends, their neighbors,  their parents, their brothers and sisters in the eye and tell them that  we have done nothing for 52 years?   Do you think that things have changed since 1971, that prices might  have gone up?   Certainly, they have.   It is long overdue for Congress not simply to protect Social  Security, but to enhance it during this polycrisis, during this  epidemic, during this time of inflation, for the most vulnerable among  us.   Social Security is the number one antipoverty program for the  elderly. It is also the number one antipoverty program for children,  and it also happens to be the best economic development program for  every single congressional district.   An average of 145,000 people per congressional district depend on  Social Security and receive those checks. Where do they spend that  money? Right back in the district.   The time to act is now.                            ____________________
