 Mr. President, today, with a heavy heart, I  wish to pay tribute to Otto Delikat, a remarkable role model, survivor,  and family man. Mr. Delikat passed away on December 23, 2018 at the age  of 96.  [[Page S66]]    His life was similar to many of the Jewish faith during that era, an  ordinary man with extraordinary spirit and indefatigable will to  survive. He will be remembered for his outstanding commitment to his  communities and readiness to share his experiences in order to promote  freedom and democracy.   Mr. Delikat was born in Vienna, Austria, where he grew up with his  father, stepmother, brother, and two sisters. As a young man, he worked  on a farm in Germany, where his family's religion was not known. When  World War II began, he returned to Vienna. With his father already in a  labor camp, a 17-year-old Mr. Delikat volunteered to go to the same  camp. He and about a dozen others from the labor camp were sent to work  in a brick factory.   One of the men working with him in the labor camp escaped, which  resulted in the rest of their group getting locked up in prison for a  year. When the prison sentence ended, Mr. Delikat and the other Jewish  prisoners were handed over to the Gestapo and sent to concentration  camps.   Mr. Delikat spent just under a year in the Flossenburg concentration  camp. Then, in October 1942, he and the other 16 people left with him  were transported to Auschwitz. He was imprisoned there for around a  year, working some of this time as part of a labor squad tasked with  going through the luggage people took with them when they arrived on  transports. After the destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto, he and about  3,000 other prisoners went to clean up the wreckage. Despite falling  ill from the typhoid epidemic that killed over half of the inmates  during their first winter in Warsaw, Mr. Delikat survived.   Eventually, the SS evacuated the prisoners in 1944, not even half of  whom survived the several days' long march when their attempts to run  toward water led to machinegun fire. Those who made it to the cattle  cars, including Mr. Delikat, then went to Dachau. Mr. Delikat was soon  relocated to another concentration camp in southern Germany, where he  met a civilian who helped him pass letters to and from Vienna. Thanks  to the kindness of this civilian, he learned his father was still  alive.   After liberation, Mr. Delikat spent several months working for the  American counterintelligence corps tracking down members of the SS in  hiding in order to bring them to justice. During his time in the  displaced persons camp, he met and married his wife, and they had their  first child. The family moved to America, thanks to support from his  wife's aunt, where Mr. Delikat quickly found work and they welcomed  their second child.   When asked about how he survived, Mr. Delikat emphasized he ``always  looked for tomorrow.'' He did not think about the days that would  follow, but instead focused on the hope he would make it through the  current day and wake up the next. He also said his experiences  throughout the Holocaust led him to become active in Jewish  communities, including 50 years at the Oceanside Jewish Center. He  served as chairman of the temple's House committee, was named their man  of the year in 1994, joined the men's club, and served on the Holocaust  committee.   Mr. Delikat considered it of the utmost importance to share his  experiences with others. He recognized his story and the stories of  fellow survivors would be lost if not told. He liked to talk about what  he went through at every available opportunity, emphasizing the  positive ideals of our Nation by underlining the importance of living  in a free and equal society.   My wife Cynthia and I extend our deepest sympathies to Otto's family  during this difficult time, particularly to his two children, Janet and  Michael, four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. May their  many wonderful memories of Otto provide them solace and comfort in the  days ahead.                            ____________________
