 Mr. Speaker, last November, the American people spoke  loud and clear about wanting real change in Washington. The American  people want Washington to work for them--no more empty promises and no  more talk.   Mr. Speaker, the American people want their government to act, and  Congress' time to act is now. I come here today to offer a solution to  an issue that has been discussed, but not truly acted on, for decades.  Time and time again, from Congress to Congress, lawmakers come down to  this floor to talk about the need for tax reform.   As a current small business owner for all of my working life, I  understand what is killing small businesses firsthand. Since I came to  Congress, I have been outspoken on the need to reform our Tax Code, and  I have a proposal to make it happen. My tax reform plan will simplify  our Tax Code. It will give job creators the tools they need to succeed  and empower America's greatest asset--the American worker. My tax  reform plan will do exactly what its name says it will do--jump-start  America.   Today, the Internal Revenue Code is often called complicated,  uncompetitive, and unfair; and rightfully so. According to the Tax  Foundation, Federal tax laws and regulations have grown to more than 10  million words in length. Imagine how much easier tax season would be  for all of us if we shrank our individual income tax thresholds to two  brackets. What if our Tax Code actually put American taxpayers first,  in other words, treated us like a customer?   The United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the free  world. Sure, deductions, exclusions, and tax credits occasionally lower  that rate, but these add further to the Tax Code's complexity, and they  allow carve-outs for special interests.   To those who believe our corporate tax rate is okay the way it is, I  ask you to consider why American companies are moving their  headquarters overseas. In order to incentivize these companies to  return their investments in expansion and employment back home in  America, my plan will implement a permanent tax holiday to allow  repatriation of funds at 5 percent.   While the corporate tax rate is putting the United States at a  disadvantage in the global economy which we all live, the most unfair  tax facing many Americans is inheritance tax. The death tax, as it is  more commonly referred to, is a form of double taxation that can take a  generation's worth of sweat equity and hard work and destroy it if a  family business, for example, is passed down to a next of kin.   That is what nearly happened to me after the death of my parents.  Fortunately for me, I was able to gather the resources to keep my  father's business afloat. Many of my friends have not been so lucky.   We cannot force owners and operators to sell off parts of a business  just so the Federal Government can collect a few extra dollars equal to  less than 1 percent of Federal revenue. Especially considering our  government is running a huge deficit and a $20 trillion national debt,  I would argue that the private sector is a much better steward of  budgeting, investing, and creating return on investment than the  Federal Government. That is why Jump-Start America will repeal the  death tax once and for all.   These are a few of the notable reforms of Jump-Start America that I  talk about on the road in Texas and nationwide. Jump-Start America has  gained the support of Americans for Tax Reform and former Congressional  Budget Office Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin. It was called ``a good  plan'' by the Cato Institute.   As a small business owner, I can tell you my plan will put people  back to work, encourage business and individuals to spend money they  didn't have before, and grow the economy. It is a thing called the  American Dream. While Jump-Start America is a small business  perspective on tax reform, it will benefit every American individually  and our Nation as a whole.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues, especially the newer Members, to  familiarize themselves with my plan as we work to implement an  aggressive pro-  [[Page H56]]  growth agenda under new leadership on the other end of Pennsylvania  Avenue.   In God We Trust.                            ____________________
