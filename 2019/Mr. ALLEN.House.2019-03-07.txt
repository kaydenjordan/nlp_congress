 Madam Speaker, I am here today to speak out against H.R.  1.   When Republicans were in the majority, we reserved H.R. 1 for  legislation that actually benefited the American people by putting more  money in their pockets and growing the economy through the historic tax  reform bill passed last year. Now here we are, under a new majority,  planning to vote on a bill telling folks that their hard-earned  taxpayer dollars will be going to a political candidate that they would  never support.   This bill goes too far and is nothing more than a power grab from the  Democrats to try to ensure one-party rule. This socialist, top-down,  one-size-fits-all election system violates States' rights, fails to  criminalize fraudulent voter registration, and eliminates every  American's constitutional right to free speech under the First  Amendment.   We do not need the heavy, overreaching hand of the Federal Government  corrupting every single election across this great Nation.   Madam Speaker, I have said it before and I will say it again: This  legislation is not reform for the better, and it is not for the people.                            ____________________
