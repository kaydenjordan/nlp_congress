 Madam President, I call up my motion to instruct  conferees, which is at the desk.    Madam President, the Senator from Rhode Island and I  have offered a motion related to our bipartisan BLUE GLOBE Act. This is  legislation that focuses on our oceans. They are a key source of food  for us. They produce most of the oxygen we need to breathe. They help  us maintain our global climate. But we largely ignore them,  unfortunately.   We haven't done nearly enough to address overfishing, pollution, and  acidification. According to NOAA, we have actually mapped more of the  moon than we have our oceans. So BLUE GLOBE will help change that by  improving data collection, accelerating ocean-focused innovation, and  taking other important steps. It will help strengthen our economy,  protect against China's illegal fishing, and bolster our national  security along the coasts.   It received unanimous consent support from the Commerce Committee. It  is a perfect fit for a bill on competitiveness, so I would urge the  Senate to support this motion to instruct conferees to include BLUE  GLOBE in the final bill.                                Vote on Motion     Thank you, Madam President.
