 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the first time as a Member of  Congress to discuss an issue that is at the forefront of the American  conscience and is one that I care deeply about: protecting and  improving the Affordable Care Act.   Today, over 45,000 of my constituents have access to reliable,  affordable healthcare coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act. These  are seniors who would otherwise be unable to afford their prescription  drugs. These are working families who no longer have to worry about  being one illness away from bankruptcy. These are children who have  been born with birth defects who would have previously been denied  coverage for having a preexisting condition or reached their lifetime  limits before they even started school.   What concerns me most is this effort to repeal the Affordable Care  Act without putting forth any sort of replacement. This will have real  consequences for American families, and it is simply reckless  governance. We cannot play politics with 20 million American lives who  depend on the Affordable Care Act for access to quality, affordable  health care. This is not a game.                            ____________________
