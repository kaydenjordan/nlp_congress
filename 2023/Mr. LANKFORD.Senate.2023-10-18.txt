 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, earlier this year, I was with a  bipartisan delegation. I traveled around the Abraham Accords countries.  We were in Morocco, we were in Bahrain, we were in the UAE, and we were  in Israel, talking about future advancement for peace. There was great  optimism and engagement. There was economic activity, tourist activity.  There was a lot of interaction with development on healthcare, on cyber  protections, and cooperation together for energy and water.   Literally, there were families meeting each other, some of them for  the first time in generations, to be able to have a conversation about  a future in the Middle East based around peace. It was based off of an  agreement that started on September 15, 2020, with the signing of the  Abraham Accords, and it has continued to advance.   In fact, just as recently as a month ago, there was outspoken public  support from Saudi Arabia and from Israel about advancing a  normalization agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel--what people  thought would be unheard of just a few years ago.   There was an advance of conversation about how we could increase  peace. And then, on the 7th of October, 1 day after the 50th  anniversary of the start of the Yom Kippur War, a group of terrorists  from Gaza penetrated the wall separating Gaza and Israel, and  [[Page S5063]]  they slaughtered 1,400 Israelis, brutally, many in their bed--children,  elderly, disabled--it didn't matter. Whether they were college students  at a concert, whether they were people traveling down a highway, or  whether it was children, literally, on their playgrounds, they murdered  them where they stood. And then they took hostages and retreated back  into Gaza, for some reason assuming that Israel and the world would  just not notice their barbarism.   Well, the world certainly noticed, and, as Americans, we obviously  all lived in the shock and horror of the event with the Israelis and  the rest of the world. Thirty-one Americans died in that attack, and 13  are missing, presumed to be hostages inside Gaza. Many of those  individuals were killed simply because they were Jewish--period.   The pain of that has struck all of us over the course of the past  several weeks now, and we have watched Israel rightly respond to the  acts of terrorism, as we have as a nation, as well, when we were  attacked on 9/11. We mobilized our forces. We identified al-Qaida, and  we identified those who were harboring al-Qaida in Afghanistan and the  Taliban and determined that type of attack would not happen again. And  we, as a nation, determined we were not only going to stop the  capabilities of al-Qaida to be able to attack us, but we were going to  preemptively respond if we were attacked again. Our first goal, though,  was to be able to prevent that kind of attack from coming at us again.   Israel is entirely right when they have been attacked by a terrorist  organization to be able to say: That organization cannot do that to our  Nation again and to our people again.   The United States has responded by sending two carrier strike groups  to the Mediterranean, to literally park off the coast of Israel, to  give a clear signal to Lebanon, to Iran: Do not engage in this.   We understand fully, as most of the world does, that Hamas is funded  by Iran. And while many in the Muslim world, in the Arab countries  continue to be able to speak out on behalf of Palestinians, they also  understand that 70 percent of the funding for Hamas comes from Iran.   The weapons systems that Hamas has right now were fully funded by  Iran, and the weapons systems in Lebanon, by Hezbollah, where they have  been attacking Israel from the north, were fully funded and created  and, many times, shipped directly from Iran.   Iran is the destabilizing force in this entire region, and we, as  Americans, have made very, very clear that we understand that Iran is  the one who funded this, who supplied the weapons systems, who supplied  the training and the munitions. Iran is the one who continues to  destabilize that region.   As Americans, we clearly speak out for the protection of all  civilians in every nation around the world and in every conflict in the  world, but we were also very clear that Israel did not initiate this  battle in the last 2 weeks. Hamas did, and they pulled their hostages  back into Gaza, as they continue to be able to hide them among the  civilian population. It is a painful peace for us to be able to see  internationally. For us in Oklahoma, we are like many others that are  in this Chamber as well. It personally affects many families in  Oklahoma. Israel is a nation so small that there is no one that has not  experienced the pain of a friend or relative, someone whom they work  with, they know people who have been directly attacked. But in my State  of Oklahoma, we are in the same condition. Many people that I interact  with talk frequently about family, friends that live in Israel or that  travel back and forth.    Quite frankly, last weekend, I worshipped with a Jewish congregation  on Shabbat and heard the dialogue from many people about their travels  back and forth and family and friends and what they personally  experienced as a family based on this terrorist attack. Quite frankly,  my State of Oklahoma has a very close bond with Israel, as the United  States has a very close bond, close enough that we had many Oklahomans  that were currently in Israel during that time of the attacks, and our  office actively worked to be able to get many of those out, since many  flights have been canceled out of Tel Aviv.   So we have actively worked to be able to get many of those  individuals back home to Oklahoma, and they have quite a story to tell,  as you would assume.                            ____________________     Madam President, the pain of this, though, is also  something that we should pay attention to. We, as a nation, not only  remember 9/11 and our response, but we also remember 9/11 was  instituted by 20 people that were illegally present in the United  States. We should not fail to remember that fact as well.   Recent statistics coming across our southern border identified in the  last 2 years--just the last 2 years--we have had 70,000 individuals  that have been identified as what they call special interest aliens.  These are individuals that came between the ports of entry, that were  running through to try to evade being captured. They are identified as  special interest aliens because they have this designation: They  potentially possess a national security risk to the United States or  its interests. So they are identified as a special interest alien.   As I mentioned, we have had more than 70,000 of those that have  crossed between our ports of entry just in the last 2 years. These are  individuals from Syria, from Iran, from Iraq, from Pakistan, from west  Africa, from locations where terrorism is known to exist, and we don't  have any criminal history of those individuals.   If you are thinking, I am glad we picked them up between ports of  entry, well, let me finish the story for you. Most of those 70,000  special interest aliens were identified between the ports of entry and  then were released into the country under Biden's policy on how he  handles immigration currently. Those 70,000 individuals that were  identified as potentially possessing a national security risk to the  United States or its interests are in the United States right now.   Just in the past week, four individuals from Iran were picked up,  multiple Syrians were picked up between our ports of entry and then  released, awaiting a hearing in the future. And in current status right  now, that hearing will be 8 to 10 years in the future. They are  unmonitored. They are wandering around within our borders awaiting a  hearing 8 to 10 years from now in the future, after being identified as  a special interest alien.   We grieve for Israel, but for some reason, there are some in this  body and in the White House that will not pay attention to our own  national security issues and the obvious exposure that literally  everyone in the country can see.   I can raise this issue with 100 people on the street outside this  building, and all 100 would say, Oh, yeah, that is a risk. But for some  reason, we can't get serious in this body to be able to take on the  same thing, just to identify what are we going to do with individuals  that are considered special interest aliens. Are we really going to  just process them at the border and release them into the country? Or  are we going to enforce our own sovereignty as just about every other  nation does in the world? What are we planning to do on this?   I would just say, for the basic function of our national security, we  should enforce our borders, and we should not just release special  interest aliens out into the country, as has been done for now the last  2 years by the numbers of 70,000-plus.   So I would hope this body would get serious about dealing with issues  like asylum, parole, and all the different features that have been used  to release these individuals into the country, that we could fix that  before we have the next 9/11 in our country.                            ____________________     Madam President, one last comment just based on news  that is continuing to flow out.   All of us are absolutely heartbroken--absolutely heartbroken--at a  hospital that had a major explosion from a rocket in Gaza. The initial  reports came out just immediately: This must have been the Israelis  that attacked a hospital. And many countries around the world  immediately made  [[Page S5064]]  statements that the Israelis bombed a hospital.   Meetings were canceled with President Biden while he was in the  region because the Israelis had bombed a hospital--until the facts and  information actually came out. Now, less than 24 hours later, we have  overhead that can identify the movement of different rockets that we  are able to see. We have information that is now out in the public, and  the President has confirmed that was not an Israeli strike on that  hospital; that was a rocket that was launched from inside Gaza that  went errant and then landed in Gaza directly on the hospital, killing  almost 500 people.   It was literally a terrorist attack on Israel that, instead of  hitting innocent civilians in Israel, it hit innocent civilians in  Gaza.   It is still just as tragic for all of those families, but I would  call on all the nations that immediately condemned Israel for attacking  a hospital to immediately turn that to condemn Hamas for attacking  civilians and for launching rockets to kill civilians in Israel that  actually killed Palestinian civilians in Gaza, that for every nation  that falsely accused Israel of this horrible attack, that they would  see the evidence and they would instead turn and try to speak to Hamas  to stop their terrorist attacks.   That is something every nation can do, to stand up for the life and  the value of people and of civilians. I would call on them to be able  to do that even today.   With that, I yield the floor.
