 Mr. Speaker, many health insurance executives say they are  raising premiums and leaving exchanges because of uncertainty and the  threat of not paying the cost-sharing reductions and not funding them.   Brad Wilson, CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina told The  Washington Post in May: ``The failure of the administration and the  House to bring certainty and clarity by funding CSRs has caused our  company to file a 22.9 percent premium increase, rather than one that  is materially lower.''   We need a bipartisan solution to stabilize exchanges. We need to stop  threatening not to pay the CSRs.   I introduced the Marketplace Certainty Act, which provides stability  by permanently funding and expanding eligibility for these subsidies.  This is pragmatic, commonsense legislation to stop premiums from  skyrocketing, keep insurers in exchanges, and help people struggling to  afford healthcare.   I urge Republicans and Democrats to put people over partisanship and  solutions above ideology by working together, by sponsoring my bill,  and helping American families afford healthcare.                            ____________________
