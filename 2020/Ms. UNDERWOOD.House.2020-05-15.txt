 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise in support of the HEROES Act, which meets urgent needs we are  facing in northern Illinois. This legislation invests in the testing,  tracing, and treatment we need to safely reopen our communities. It  supports the essential workers whose sacrifices and dedication are  keeping us safe and provides direct funding that will make a critical  difference for smaller communities. I am so proud it also includes my  bill to eliminate out-of-pocket costs for veterans and to help  survivors of domestic violence.   This bill is not perfect. We have more work to do, such as ensuring  affordable healthcare coverage for the tens of millions of Americans  who find it too expensive. But the HEROES Act will provide relief to  all of our communities, and we must pass it today.
