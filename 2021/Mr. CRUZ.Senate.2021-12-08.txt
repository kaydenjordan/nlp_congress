 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to strongly oppose the  confirmation of Rachael Rollins to be U.S. attorney in Massachusetts.   Many Americans have probably never heard of Rachael Rollins, but they  are becoming very familiar with the kind of lawlessness and dangerous  crime that radical, leftwing district attorneys like her have  generated. Under  [[Page S9012]]  their watch, we have seen looting and larceny and violent crime rates  rise in cities all over the country the past couple of years.   Ms. Rollins is part of a web of leftwing district attorneys across  the country who see it as their job not to prosecute crime; rather, to  protect criminals. There is Ms. Rollins in Boston, Chesa Boudin in San  Francisco, Kim Gardner in St. Louis, Kim Foxx in Chicago, Larry Krasner  in Philadelphia, and John Chisholm in Milwaukee, among others.   What has happened with these prosecutors who refuse to prosecute  crime?   Well, all too predictably, crime rates have skyrocketed.   Last year, the murder rate went up nearly 30 percent overall, and it  went up 40 percent in cities with populations between 100,000 and  250,000.   We have seen horrific crimes and tragedies that could have been  prevented if these DAs had simply done their jobs.   Take John Chisholm, the DA in Milwaukee, who released Darrell Brooks,  a repeat and dangerous criminal, on $1,000 bail.   What was the crime he was charged with?   Using his vehicle--a red SUV--to run down a woman, the mother of his  child.   Released on $1,000 bail, what happened?   Brooks, as we all know, drove that same red SUV through a Christmas  parade, murdered six people, including an 8-year-old boy.   That man should not have been on the streets, should not have been  behind the wheel. The DA knew he was a violent criminal who used that  SUV as an instrument of violence and, for $1,000, the leftwing DA let  him go. Had Brooks not been out on such a low bail, this horrific  tragedy wouldn't have occurred; that 8-year-old boy would still be  alive.   Our communities don't need prosecutors who endanger the very  communities they are supposed to serve by refusing to prosecute or  detain criminals. They don't need leftwing prosecutors who let violent  criminals walk the streets.   The damage that these so-called prosecutors can do has, thankfully,  been somewhat limited by the fact that, when they choose not to  prosecute criminals, the Federal Government has the ability, in many  instances, to step in and charge criminals federally.   But Joe Biden and Senate Democrats are working to change that by  elevating one of these radical, leftist, soft-on-crime district  attorneys, Rachael Rollins, to be the U.S. attorney in Massachusetts-- the chief Federal prosecutor in the entire State of Massachusetts.   Let's talk a bit more about what exactly Rachael Rollins believes  prosecutors should do and what her record is.   Rachael Rollins has been vocal and aggressive against prosecuting  crime. She has been very clear that she came into the job of district  attorney as a crusader.   She has said--and these are her words:         If you want to change the criminal legal system, become a       prosecutor [because they have the] power to determine       charges, what crimes to decline to prosecute or divert, [and]       how to fashion bail hearings.    She has been quite open in what her intentions are. Ms. Rollins tells  us that what matters about a prosecutor is not taking bad guys off the  street; it is not seeking justice for the victims of crime. No. It is  the power to say: ``I won't prosecute these crimes.''   (Ms. ROSEN assumed the chair.)   And with Ms. Rollins, it is not hypothetical because she is a  district attorney. And as the Boston DA, she went so far as to write  down in ``The Rachael Rollins Policy Memo,'' a list of 15 crimes whose  prosecution should ``always be declined'' or ``dismissed without  conditions.''   Charges on this list of 15 crimes should be declined or dismissed  prearraignment without conditions. The presumption is that charges that  fall into this category should always be declined.   So you have a DA saying these are the crimes we don't prosecute,  ``always be declined,'' ``dismissed without conditions.''   So you may say: ``OK. Maybe this is like some sort of criminal  justice reform. Maybe this is low-level, nonviolent marijuana  possession. A teenager got caught with a joint; we are not going to  prosecute them.'' Reasonable people can actually disagree on that. We  can have an intelligent conversation back and forth about that.   But the beauty of it is that we don't have to speculate because she  put it in writing. These are the 15 crimes. They are upside down, as  are her policies. These are the 15 crimes where charges should be  dismissed prearraignment without conditions:   No. 1, trespass. Now, I want you to think about it. If you don't want  to see people trespassing on your property, well, under Rachael  Rollins, the Democrats' U.S. attorney, we don't prosecute trespass.   What else?   Shoplifting. Has anyone watched the videos of the people breaking  into stores and stealing and stealing and stealing and looting? Do you  know what? Joe Biden and Senate Democrats--they are bringing that to a  neighborhood near you.   Shoplifting, we don't prosecute. That is what she said. Shoplifting,  olly oxen free. If you see a TV you like, pick that damn thing up and  run out of the store because your friend, the fake prosecutor, is not  going to charge you.   Larceny. Really, larceny? Larceny, we don't prosecute.   Disorderly conduct. You are a single mom coming home at night. A  drunk vagrant is yelling, screaming, cursing at your kids. Do you know  what? Not a crime here. We don't prosecute that.   What else?   Receiving stolen property. OK. This is at least intellectually  consistent. If you are going to legalize shoplifting, rob the hell out  of the stores, at least the fence can be on the back end. You can steal  that TV and go straight to the fence. By the way, I guess you can do it  in a parking lot. Set up a van right there. ``We fence stolen  property.'' You run in and grab it, I will fence it right here. DA?  ``All good by us.''   Driving with a suspended license. Well, sometimes that might be OK.   What was it suspended for? Was it suspended for DWI? Was it suspended  because you are a drunk who has killed people? Were you suspended  because you are this homicidal maniac in Milwaukee who murdered six  people?   Do you know what? This DA says: ``Hey, driving with a suspended  license, no problem at all, no longer a crime.''   Breaking and entering into a vacant property without property damage.  So any property that is vacant, you can break in, and you are fine.  Locks don't matter. Burglar alarms don't matter. By the way, if a  burglar alarm goes off, what the hell do you do? You show up, ``Hey,  you don't prosecute it. I'm staying right here.''   You may say: ``Well, at least it is something reasonable, without  property damage, right?'' Well, now, except the problem is No. 8 on the  list: breaking and entering into a vacant property with property  damage.   So it doesn't matter. Break into the place, loot it, trash it,  destroy it. All is good in Joe Biden's criminal-friendly America.   No. 9, wanton or malicious destruction of property. By the way, don't  believe the Democratic talking point: ``This stuff isn't violent.''  Really, wanton or malicious destruction of property? Not a crime in Joe  Biden's America.   Threats, threats of violence. I want you to imagine right now you  have got an angry vagrant making threats of violence against your  children. You call the DA and say: ``My family is being threatened.  Protect our safety.'' And what does she say? ``Not a crime.''   Oh, well, stinks to be you. Threats are just A-OK.   Minor in possession of alcohol. Hey, great. Kids, drink up. Actually,  the beauty of it is, in Joe Biden's America, the kids can get drunk;  they can drive; they can have their license suspended; and apparently  they will get a gold star at the end of it. Minors in possession of  alcohol. We have got Senate pages here. Just go down to the U.S.  attorney's office. They are serving margaritas.   Marijuana possession. OK. As I said, we can debate marijuana  possession. Reasonable people can disagree on that. Now, it doesn't  specify the quantity. A teenager with a joint? You can say that that  may be a good candidate for diversion to something else. Drug dealer  with several kilos of pot in the  [[Page S9013]]  back, maybe you ought to be prosecuting that.   Oh, and, by the way, how do we know she doesn't just limit it to kids  with a joint? Well, what is No. 13 on the list? Possession with intent  to distribute.   So, drug dealers--in Joe Biden's America, drug dealers, it is legal.  You can sell booze to kids. You can sell drugs to kids. You can sell  stolen televisions to kids. She doesn't prosecute drug dealers.   But look, at least it is just pot and come on, we know--you know, in  States--in a lot of States pot is not that bad, right? It is just pot.   Uh-oh. No. 14, nonmarijuana drug possession. So for any Democrats  ready to go home, saying, ``Hey, we just like pot because we are  Democrats,'' nope. Heroin, cocaine, LSD, fentanyl drug dealers who are  poisoning our kids, in Joe Biden's America, we don't prosecute you.    And No. 15 is really the crowning jewel of this--resisting arrest. So  I want you to envision what this says. You can break and enter into a  vacant property and do damage. You can have a homeless person trespass  on your front lawn, set up a tent, threaten your children, sell them  drugs, and if a police officer shows up and tries to arrest them, they  can violently resist arrest. And what does the DA say? ``All good by  me. Not a crime.''   Madam President, this is, in a word, nuts. This is crazy.   And do you know what? This is what the Democrats support.   I will tell you why. The Democrats are counting on the news media  refusing to cover this. The Democrats are counting on ABC, NBC, and  CBS--this is not news. The Democrats are counting on CNN will not cover  this.   Every single Democrat in this body has voted for Rachael Rollins.  They had to bring Vice President Harris out to break the tie.   And, you know, Democrats, when they go home, they like to say: ``We  are not for abolishing the police.''   No. Do you know what? When you vote to confirm a lawless so-called  prosecutor who says ``I won't prosecute crime,'' you have abolished the  police. Cops can arrest them, but the DA will let them go. And what  does she say? ``Dismissed . . . prearraignment . . . without  conditions.''   This is radical and extreme, and I want to make a challenge to Senate  Democrat colleagues. Some of you are in purple States. A few of you are  in red States. Some of you are in bright blue States. I challenge any  of you in the bluest State of the Union to go home to your  constituents, get any gathering in a townhall, and put this chart in  front of them. Ask your constituents: Do the people of Nevada agree  that we shouldn't prosecute trespassing or shoplifting or drug dealing  or resisting arrest or violent threats? Do the people of Virginia agree  that these are not crimes and shouldn't be prosecuted?   And I promise you, in all 50 States, there is not a State too blue  where your constituents would agree on this. And so what our Democratic  colleagues are counting on is that people won't know.   You know, before the vote, I spoke with several Democrats. I tried to  tell several Democrats, this is a bad vote. This is a vote you are  going to regret. This is a vote your constituents are going to be mad  at you for. One of those Democrats said: ``Well, the majority leader  asked me to do it.''   You know, crack the whip, party unity, party discipline. The order  from the Democrats in the White House is this is the chief Federal law  enforcement officer in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. God help you  if you don't want violent criminals robbing your store. God help you if  you don't want drunken homeless people setting up tents in your front  yard. God help you if you don't want drug dealers selling drugs to your  children because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have said those are all A- OK. And if you don't believe me--because in this bizarre partisan world  nobody believes the other side--read the memo, ``The Rachael Rollins  Policy Memo.'' She wrote it. She put her name on it in writing. This is  what it says.   If we lived in a time of sanity--Senators on both sides--Democrats  listening to this would say: ``Hold on a second. That doesn't make any  sense at all. Let's tap the brakes.''   By the way, one Democrat could stop this nomination--one. Every  individual Democrat, you had the choice. It means every one of you is  also the deciding vote. So when you go back to your home State, you  singlehandedly decided this lawless, so-called prosecutor should be  confirmed.   I will tell you this, you can never again claim you oppose abolishing  the police because this vote is front and center: trespassing, not  prosecuted; shoplifting; larceny; disorderly conduct; receiving stolen  property; driving with a suspended license; breaking and entering with  property damage; loss and malicious destruction of property; threats;  minors in possession of alcohol; marijuana possession; possession with  intent to distribute; nonmarijuana drug possession.   I don't ever want to see a Democrat standing up here talking about  fentanyl: Fentanyl is terrible. I don't want to see another Democrat  talking about the opioid crisis, saying: ``People are dying in New  Hampshire. People are dying in my State.'' They are, and you are about  to vote for a prosecutor who won't prosecute the drug dealers selling  those opioids and poisoning our children and won't prosecute resisting  arrest. So, if a cop comes, take a swing.    To my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle, there is still  time for you to stop this nomination. I implore of you: Listen to your  constituents and do the right thing.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, reserving the right to object.   The eyes of history are on the Senate today. If the Nord Stream 2  Pipeline comes online, as it is on the verge of doing, the odds of  Russian tanks rolling into Ukraine increase dramatically. We have  imposed sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline with bipartisan unity.  We can do it again.   If Russian tanks roll into Kiev, who in this Chamber wants that on  their conscience?   We need to stop Russia from invading Ukraine, and the only way to do  it is by imposing sanctions on Nord Stream 2. We did that 2 years ago.  We overwhelmingly passed bipartisan sanctions that President Trump  signed into law.   It is worth explaining why these two are linked.   We are all reading in the newspaper--and my friend from Virginia  and I have sat in briefings, classified and public briefings--that over  100,000 Russian troops are massed on the Ukraine border. The  administration declassified its own projections that an invasion of  Ukraine is imminent and could come as soon as January or February of  next year. This disaster is the direct result of a political mistake  made by Joe Biden.    What does the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline have to do with Russia's  invading Ukraine?   Well, here is a little bit of ancient history. In the year 2014,  Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.   Why?   He did it because he has said that he considers the dissolution of  the Soviet Union to be the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 21st  century, and his grand ambition is to recreate the Soviet Union--by  force.   A reassembled Soviet Union would be a profound threat to the safety  of all Americans. We spent decades with a dangerous Soviet Union. In  2014, Putin invaded Ukraine--he invaded Crimea--but he stopped. He  didn't go through all of Ukraine.   Why did he stop?   He stopped because Russian natural gas, to get to Europe, goes  through Ukraine. The pipelines go through Ukraine.    Madam President, reserving the right to object.   There is nothing in regular order that limits my ability to explain  my view on this topic.   So, apparently, the Democrats don't want to talk about Joe Biden's  gift to Russia and Putin that has set up the tanks on the border of  Ukraine.    Is the Chair refusing to let me speak?    And, just a moment ago, the Chair granted unanimous consent  that that time be extended until this unanimous consent request was  concluded. That is the pending UC that was granted.   If Senator Kaine or the Chair wants to silence me because you don't  want to hear what is happening in Ukraine, you can try to do that.    Madam President, I object. And the Chair and the Democrats  are hiding from the truth.
