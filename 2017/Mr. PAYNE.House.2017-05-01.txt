 Mr. Speaker, add job creation and infrastructure to the  list of President Trump's broken promises. After 102 days in office,  the so-called ``greatest jobs President that God ever created'' has  failed to present a single job or infrastructure bill.   At the same time, his slash-and-burn budget would cut investments in  job growth and infrastructure, imposing a $2.4 billion cut on the U.S.  Department of Transportation. Included in those cuts are drastic  reductions of the Federal support for Amtrak and the outright  elimination of the TIGER grant program.   The President's budget proposal also phases out the New Starts grant  program, making critical infrastructure projects, including New Jersey  and New York's Gateway Program ineligible for Federal funding needed to  move forward.   As I speak, New Jersey rail commuters are probably facing massive  delays and disruptions to their already nightmarish commute. President  Trump's proposed cuts to vital Federal infrastructure programs will  only make the problem worse. It has been an ugly 102 days for President  Trump, and, unless he tackles jobs and infrastructure, as promised, it  is going to get uglier.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me first thank the gentleman from the  Commonwealth of Virginia (Mr. McEachin). It is the birthplace of my  mother: Dinwiddie County, Virginia. My grandfather was a small-time  tobacco farmer, and I learned to cut tobacco at 8 years old.   I am from Newark, New Jersey, the Garden State. We didn't raise much  tobacco there in the Garden State, but my friends used think I was  going on vacation when I would leave. I said I wasn't going on  vacation; I was going to work. That is what we did for the summer. It  was a great experience, and I always have great, great memories of the  Commonwealth of Virginia.                                time  2030    Mr. Speaker, last month, as part of a partnership with the National  Newspaper Publishers Association, I wrote an op-ed on environmental  justice issues. I will repeat what I wrote then, which is that  environmental justice should be a national priority, not a problem  confined to minority communities.   African-American communities are disproportionately burdened with  pollutants. Across the Nation, communities of color suffer from higher  rates of exposure to air pollution, higher rates of lead poisoning, and  higher rates of water pollution.   Every single day, children in my home city of Newark, New Jersey, are  exposed to harmful levels of pollution from the port and other sources  that rob them of their health, just because of where they live.   One in four Newark children has asthma. The hospitalization rate for  Newark children is 30 times the rate of  [[Page H2998]]  the national average. Asthma is the leading cause of absenteeism in  school-age children in the city of Newark, New Jersey.   Yet, too often, environmental justice is an afterthought, or often it  is missing entirely in the discussion of the challenges facing African  Americans.   The Trump administration threatens to make the problem even worse.  President Trump has prioritized rolling back environmental regulations,  from emissions rules for power plants to the mandate that Federal  decisionmaking must be taken into consideration on climate change  impacts.   President Trump proposed slashing the EPA's budget by 31 percent,  cutting enforcement of the Agency's clean air laws by $129 million.   With threats of excessive cuts to the EPA, air quality across the  Nation may even be worse than expected. In the American Lung  Association's ``State of the Air'' report, my district and many other  metropolitan areas ranked as having the most polluted air in the  country. However, only one-third of counties have ozone or particulate  pollution air monitors. We must fight to ensure that funding for air  monitors are for all our communities.   So what can we do to protect our communities from environmental  degradation?   The Newark City Council has been a leader in that area and has passed  a first-in-the-nation ordinance requiring developers to request  environmental permits to inform the city of any environmental impacts.  As a result, decisionmakers and the public will be able to make  informed decisions about sustainable development. Other municipalities  would be smart to follow Newark's lead.   Last November, I joined Amy Goldsmith and Kim Gaddy of the Clean  Water Action and the Coalition for Healthy Ports for an environmental  justice tour of the Port of New York and New Jersey. We were also  joined by Congressman Frank Pallone from New Jersey. Organizations like  theirs are doing excellent work in the fight against health-threatening  pollution. Expanding partnerships on the environmental justice  initiatives must be a central part of our strategy to secure  environmental protections.   To those listening at home: I encourage you to make it clear to your  elected officials that you will hold them accountable for any efforts  to dismantle environmental protections and any failures to fight for  environmental justice.   And to my colleague from Virginia, it is really noteworthy that you  have taken the lead on this issue. As I stated in my presentation,  Newark, New Jersey, is 30 times greater propensity for asthma in  children than the national average. I mean, that is almost criminal.   And we as a home, myself, not just have heard about it, but have  lived it. My middle son--I am the father of triplets. My middle son has  grown up with asthma; the days we had to keep him inside. He has been  fortunate to have not--knock on wood--have many instances throughout  his childhood of asthma attacks, but the one that I did see really  brought me to tears.   To know that there are numbers of children throughout this country  who don't have the opportunity to go to the doctor, who rush to the  hospital with asthma attacks, and who, God forbid, sometimes don't make  it to the doctor is just--to think that that could be my boy brings  tears to my heart.   So I am willing to make this fight not for just my son, but for the  hundreds of thousands of children throughout this country who suffer  from this disease, and make sure that the EPA stays intact to fight  these dreaded diseases, especially in minority communities, in our  young people, and throughout the country.   I will close with the drinking water issue in Flint. The  Congressional Black Caucus went out to Flint when the issue first came  up. Ms. Pelosi was there as well, and we talked to the people of Flint  and heard firsthand their heartbreak and not being able to think they  could trust anyone. Their government had let them down, had lied to  them, had given them poison to drink and said it is okay. It looked  like rusty water, but they told them that it was fine to use it for  baths or whatever.   So I am sitting there on that stage listening to all this and I am  thinking in the back of my head: I am from Newark, New Jersey, the  third oldest city in this country's history. So Flint, Michigan, can't  be that old because Lewis and Clark went West.   So the third oldest city, what were my pipes like? What was the  condition of my water system?   And I went back and I saw several mayors from my district, and I  said: I suggest you start looking at your water systems.   And that was on a Friday. That Tuesday we got a report from the  Newark school system. They found lead in the drinking water in 44  schools in Newark that next--not even a week.   So we know how important these issues are, and we will continue to  fight for what is right in our communities. I appreciate the  opportunity and your leadership on this issue.
