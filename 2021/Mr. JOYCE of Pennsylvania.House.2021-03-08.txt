 Madam Speaker, here in this Chamber, I  have pledged to support and defend the United States Constitution in  its entirety. The Second Amendment is a key tenet of the U.S.  Constitution and Americans' inalienable rights.   The right to keep and bear arms is a basic freedom that was enshrined  in law by the Framers of our Constitution, the leaders who overcame  tyranny to form a representative government of, by, and for the people.  More than two centuries later, their extraordinary vision for our  country still endures.   In Congress, it is our job to uphold the Constitution and to protect  Americans' fundamental rights. Yet, this week, the House will consider  radical legislation that would encroach on citizens' freedoms while  doing so little to prevent mass shootings or illicit violence. If  enacted, both H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446 would impose restrictive background  checks and unnecessarily burden law-abiding gun owners.   Thanks to the work of the previous administration and Republicans in  Congress, our Nation already has safeguards in place to prevent  wrongdoers from acquiring firearms. Rather than impose new  restrictions, we should work together to ensure that the current laws  on the books are enforced.   Instead of attempting to defund the police, we should equip our law  enforcement officers with the necessary resources and training that  they need to identify and respond to threats. Rather than make  criminals out of law-abiding citizens, we should increase penalties for  those who break the law. These are commonsense steps that would save  lives and protect constitutional rights of citizens in my home State of  Pennsylvania and across our country.   In recent months, I have heard from hundreds of Pennsylvanians who  are concerned by the mounting attacks on the Second Amendment. I share  these concerns, and I will continue to oppose any attempts to restrict  Americans' lawful gun rights. Unfortunately, the majority is set on  restricting Americans' personal freedoms and propelling an extreme  agenda. This playbook is not the answer.   Right now, Congress should be focused on crushing the pandemic,  getting Americans back to work, allowing our kids to safely return to  the classroom. Instead of attacking Americans' constitutional rights,  we could be making real progress on accelerating vaccine production,  rebuilding our economy, and restoring our American way of life.   As we consider H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446 this week, I urge all of my  colleagues to reject this challenge to our Constitution, to uphold  Americans' intrinsic freedoms, and return this body to good-faith  legislating that drives results for all of the American people.                            ____________________
