 Madam President, I come to the floor with the senior  Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Boozman, to celebrate a great anniversary.   Two hundred years ago this week, the very first newspaper in Arkansas  was published. It was called the Arkansas Gazette. We know it today as  the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. It is the oldest paper west of the  Mississippi, an institution in our State, and a credit to the many  outstanding journalists who have made it possible over two centuries.   From its first issue, the Arkansas Gazette was a pioneering  newspaper, published by a young man named William Woodruff who crossed  the mighty Mississippi into brandnew territory, dragging behind him a  wooden printing press and other tools of the trade.   The Gazette was first published out of a log cabin in the territorial  capital, Arkansas Post. It reflected the bold aspirations of American  settlers moving West to fulfill our manifest destiny on the continent,  and it reflected these landlocked settlers' keen awareness that events  far beyond out little plot of soil could shape their lives in dramatic  ways.   The first story in the very first edition reported on a Navy  expedition to open the Pacific Northwest for American traders. It  speculated with excitement about the prosperity that would flow to our  Nation as Americans followed Lewis and Clark west across the country.  ``The plan may appear visionary,'' the Gazette remarked, ``but that  which is now speculation will . . . shortly become a fact, and this  country will be enriched by the overflowings of its benefit.''   As the Arkansas Territory grew, Arkansas's newspaper grew with it.  Woodruff moved the paper from Arkansas Post to Little Rock in 1821,  where it would continue to be published for the next 198 years with few  exceptions, such as a devastating fire in the 1850s and military  occupation during the Civil War.   Just as Arkansas kept its rough-hewn, pioneer character, so too did  Arkansas's newspaper, whose staff were involved in not one but two gun  battles, including the last recorded duel in Arkansas history--between,  I am compelled to report, the owners of the Gazette and its upstart  competitor, the Democrat.   If William Woodruff was the founding father of the Democrat-Gazette,  John Netherland Heiskell was its Lincoln, bringing the paper  triumphantly into maturity. Heiskell became editor in 1902 and served  in that position for an incredible 70 years until his passing in 1972.  The one interruption in Heiskell's remarkable tenure came in 1913, when  the Governor selected him to serve as a U.S. Senator after the death of  a sitting Senator. He only served in this body for 23 days before a  successor was elected, and then he hurried back to Little Rock and to  the Gazette because the news waits for no man.   Over the next half-century, the Gazette established itself as a  world-class newspaper. It was during this period that the Gazette took  a bold stand for truth in the finest tradition of journalism by  declaring its support for desegregation well ahead of the pack in 1957.  The Gazette and its editorial writer, Harry Ashmore, covered the  turmoil surrounding Little Rock's integration with decency and  firmness, insisting that Arkansas fulfill its obligation to all our  citizens on an equal basis, without regard to race. This editorial  crusade lost more than a few subscriptions, but it won the Gazette two  Pulitzer Prizes ``for demonstrating,'' in the words of the Pulitzer  committee, ``the highest qualities of civic leadership, journalistic  responsibility, and moral courage.'' And so the Arkansas Gazette  entered the modern era as a famous and award-winning publication.   In 1991, after years known as ``the newspaper wars,'' the Gazette's  old rival, the Democrat, bought the paper and created what we now know  as the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Fortunately, I hasten to add, no  duels were needed this time around. Now, the Democrat-Gazette is again  changing with the times through the capable  [[Page S6731]]  leadership of Walter Hussman, his family, and David Bailey, the  managing editor. This time, the paper is transforming for the digital  era, moving from paper to screen, and it is even giving away free iPads  to subscribers to ease the transition. So if you are not already a  subscriber, consider supporting our local journalism in Arkansas. It  has a bright future ahead.   Today, unfortunately, many venerable newspaper have fallen on hard  times. Too many journalists can't be bothered to get the story right.  Too many local communities are losing parts of their identity, which is  all the more reason to celebrate newspapers like the Democrat-Gazette,  which do get the story right and have preserved their distinctive  character throughout the years.   Some things may change. The Democrat-Gazette of the future may be  heralded by the bright glow of the screen rather than the rustle of the  news page. But other, more important things stay the same, such as  integrity, impartiality, and credibility. The Democrat-Gazette holds  its reporters to the highest standards of accuracy and ethics.   Walter Hussman publishes these high standards that won the Gazette  two Pulitzer Prizes every day on page 2 of the newspaper in its  statement of core values. That statement reads:         Credibility is the greatest asset of any news medium and       impartiality is the greatest source of credibility.    The Democrat-Gazette practices what it preaches, and for that reason,  it continues to succeed 200 years on.   There is also its Arkansas focus. As ever, the Democrat-Gazette  earnestly pursues stories in Arkansas for the benefit of Arkansans. It  is this proud local focus which has made the Democrat-Gazette a beloved  institution in Arkansas and which will sustain it in the years ahead.  Finally, the pioneer spirit--from the Arkansas Territory to the  frontiers of digital journalism, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette will  travel confidently into the future.   Today, I join Senator Boozman in congratulating the Hussman family,  the Democrat-Gazette, and all of their many hard-working professionals  and journalists.   I yield the floor to my colleague, the senior Senator from Arkansas.
