 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  week of May 6 through May 12 as Goodwill Industries Week.   This week is about the people of Georgia who value hard work and  support the right of individuals to provide for themselves and their  families. Some members in our communities require additional education,  job preparation, skill training, and support services to reach the goal  of self-sufficiency.   Goodwill has a rich history of providing essential services for these  people to be productive members of our community since 1902. Since  1965, in southeast Georgia, Goodwill has provided community-based  services, including career counseling, GED preparation, financial  education, resume preparation, and more.   In this time of low unemployment, it is more important than ever for  us to reach out to the unemployed and give our businesses the workforce  they need to succeed.   Thank you to the employees of Goodwill Southeast Georgia for  everything you are doing to keep our national economy strong, and for  maximizing individuals' contributions to self, family, and community.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the topic of this  Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of a former mayor, of a former Georgia State senator, of a former  Governor of Georgia, and of a former United States Senator representing  the State of Georgia, Mr. Zell Miller.   Zell Miller passed away on March 23 at the age of 86. He was born on  February 24, 1932, in Young Harris, Georgia, in Towns County. He was  born to Birdie Bryan and Stephen Grady Miller.   When Zell was 17 days old, his father died. His widowed mother raised  her  [[Page H3876]]  son and daughter, Jane, alone in Young Harris. Located in the north  Georgia mountains, Miller's mother built a home for herself and her  children with rocks she had hauled from a nearby stream.   Mr. Speaker, I had the honor and privilege of attending Young Harris  College, and I am very familiar with this area and I was blessed to  hear about these stories.   I have always heard about the story of how Ms. Miller hauled these  rocks up from the stream to build her home. It was that experience,  that house, that became symbolic of Zell Miller's rugged independence.   After he graduated from Young Harris College, Zell Miller continued  his education at Emory University in Atlanta; but shortly after he  arrived there, he found that he wasn't really focusing on his studies.  In fact, in one of the many books that he wrote, ``Corps Values,'' he  writes about waking up in jail in Young Harris drunk as a skunk. He  tells that story in that book. I have read the book, and I remember  that story.   Well, shortly after that experience, he enlisted in the United States  Marine Corps, in 1953. Later, he attributed much of his success to both  the discipline he learned as a marine and the independence that he  learned from his mother.   He married Shirley Carver in 1954, and the couple had two sons.   In 1956, he enrolled at the University of Georgia, where he earned a  bachelor's and a master's degree in history.   In 1959, he took a teaching position at Young Harris College and  returned to his hometown as a professor of history and political  science.   Mr. Speaker, members of the Georgia delegation are here tonight, and  I am going to yield to them. I am going to pause. I am going to  continue on and tell you about the rest of this outstanding gentleman's  life, but at this point I am going to pause and I am going to yield to  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Ferguson), one of my fellow delegation  members from Georgia.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  comments.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman mentioned something about the HOPE  Scholarship. Zell Miller was known as Georgia's education Governor. He  was the founder of the HOPE Scholarship, and as the gentleman noted, it  resulted in a number of students who have been able to complete their  college degrees and their college careers as a result of the Zell  Miller Scholarship and the HOPE Scholarship.   Before I recognize the next speaker, I want to continue on what I was  sharing with you about Zell's early life and the fact that, after he  got out of the Marine Corps, he went to Young Harris College and he  was a professor of history and political science. But he was something  else. He was also a baseball coach. He coached baseball at Young Harris  College.    I had the privilege of talking to some of his former players. In  fact, we just had homecoming up at Young Harris a few weeks ago, and I  had the opportunity to talk to Don Harp, a retired Methodist minister  who has served for many years on the board of trustees at Young Harris  College. He was one of the best baseball players to ever come through  Young Harris.   He was telling me a story about how he was a catcher on the baseball  team. They had a lead in the game, and he was calling the signals. They  were ahead by one run, with two outs, in the top of the ninth inning.  They were about to wrap it up. He said he called for two sinkers in a  row. Sure enough, he got two strikes on the batter and had an 0-2  count. He said then he decided he would call for a fastball. So he  called for a fastball, and sure enough, the batter hit it right up the  middle, two runs scored, and they got behind by one run.   He said he went back to the bench after that inning. He said they  were behind by one run, and he went back to the bench, and he said Zell  Miller was coaching and he was sitting on the bench. He said he  motioned to him. He said: Come over here.   He said he came over there and he sat beside him, and he said Coach  Miller looked at him and he said: If you ever make another call like  that, you will be sitting here by me the rest of this game.   He said he understood right then exactly what he was to do.   I also remember talking to one of my colleagues that I served with in  the Georgia State Legislature in the Georgia House, Mickey Channell,  who played baseball for Zell at Young Harris College. Mickey was from  Greensboro, Georgia.   Mickey told me: I didn't get to play very much, but I remember this  one time that my dad traveled up to see me and traveled up to see me  play, and Zell knew he had come.   He said: Zell let me start that game because he knew my dad was  there.   I could tell how much that meant to Mickey, and he had always  remembered that.   That is just a glimpse of what we are talking about when we are  talking about this great man, this great Georgian, this great American.   In his early political career, as I mentioned, he was a mayor. He was  mayor of Young Harris. He held that position for 2 years, and then he  was elected as a State senator. He represented the areas up in north  Georgia--Towns County, Union County, Rabun County--as a State senator.   A few years after that, he took a leave from his teaching  responsibilities at Young Harris College, and he actually went and was  executive secretary for then-Governor Lester Maddox during the time  that Lester Maddox was Governor from 1968 to 1971.                                time  1800    During the 1970s, Zell Miller was twice named as a delegate to the  Democratic National Convention, once in 1972, and again in 1976.   In 1971, he was appointed as Executive Director of the Democratic  Party in Georgia, and he served in that capacity until 1973, when he  became a member of the State Board of Pardons and Paroles. He served on  that board until 1975.   Then in 1975, Zell Miller became Lieutenant Governor of the State of  Georgia, and he actually held that post longer than anyone has ever  held that post. He held it for 16 years.   In 1980, he ran for statewide office. He ran for the United States  Senate,  [[Page H3877]]  but he lost in the primary to then the incumbent, Senator Herman  Talmadge. Over the next 10 years, as Lieutenant Governor, he really  worked on his leadership skills. As Lieutenant Governor, he was the  Presiding Officer in the State Senate.   As I mentioned earlier, I had the honor and privilege of serving in  the Georgia State Legislature for 10 years; and the stories that we  heard, as Members, about Zell Miller as the Lieutenant Governor, and  the famous Tom Murphy, who served for so many years as Speaker of the  House of the State of Georgia, and the battles that those two would  have, Zell as the leader of the Senate and Tom Murphy as the leader of  the House. The stories are still told in the Georgia State Legislature  and the Georgia State Capital about the battles between these two  giants of Georgia politics.   In 1990, Zell ran for Governor of the State of Georgia. He was in a  tough race in the Democratic primary. He faced Andrew Young. He won  that primary, and then he was elected. He was elected as Governor of  the State of Georgia; actually defeated Johnny Isakson, who now serves  as our Senator here, our senior Senator in the United States Senate.   Mr. Speaker, before I go on and tell you about his Governorship, I  will pause again and yield to another one of my colleagues from  Georgia, Representative David Scott, and I will have a story to share  about his brother-in-law in just a minute and Zell Miller. I look  forward to hearing about him because I know he has got some great  stories about ``Give 'em hell Zell.''   I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for sharing  that. And I want to share one other thing before I call on the next  speaker.   I mentioned that Zell Miller was the baseball coach at Young Harris  College when he was a professor up there and on the faculty there.  Well, they discontinued the baseball program for a long time. And then,  when Zell was Governor, they actually restarted the baseball program,  and Zell had a big role in that. In fact, he--two stories I want to  tell you real quickly.   He invited us all to the Governor's mansion, those of us who were  supporting the baseball program and trying to get it started up. And to  kick it off, he had none other than Hank Aaron and Mickey Mantle at the  Governor's mansion as a benefit to getting the Young Harris  College baseball program started again.    Not only has that program started again, but it has been very, very  successful, producing players such as Nick Markakis, who plays for the  Atlanta Braves now, who played at Young Harris College; Charlie  Blackmon, playing for the Colorado Rockies; just a few of the many  players that went to Young Harris who are playing in the major leagues  right now.   I also want to share with you very quickly his love of baseball  because, again, when he was Governor, Phil Niekro, the great  knuckleball pitcher of the Atlanta Braves, was inducted into baseball's  Hall of Fame. Zell actually hosted a trip to the Hall of Fame in  Cooperstown during the time that he was being inducted, and my wife and  I and my two oldest sons were honored and able to go on that trip.   I can remember being at the Hall of Fame with Zell Miller, and I can  remember the emotions, and how proud he was of a Georgian, of Phil  Niekro, of an Atlanta Brave being inducted into the Baseball Hall of  Fame. Just another one of the great memories that I have of Zell  Miller.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen),  another member of our delegation, to share with us his remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  kind words.   Before I yield to our next speaker, I want to mention one of the  things that Zell was famous for, and that was that he wrote a number of  books. He was an author.   In fact, the first book he ever wrote in 1976 chronicled, really, him  growing up in the mountains. The name of the book was ``The Mountains  Within Me.''   That book had a very special meaning to me, personally. You see, he  talked about Young Harris College, and he equated Young Harris College  to being like a shoe factory because things are coming out of there in  pairs. That meant a lot to me, because that is where I met my wife. She  was my chemistry lab partner. We came out as a pair and we have been a  pair, and in September it will be 40 years.   He also wrote a number of other books. I mentioned earlier that he  wrote the book about his experience in the Marine Corps, ``Corps  Values: Everything You Need to Know I Learned in the Marines.'' He  wrote that in 1996. There are 12 chapters in that book, and each  chapter is devoted to a particular trait that he developed during his  years in the Marine Corps, for instance, courage, neatness, discipline,  and pride.   He also wrote another book, ``Great Georgians,'' that was published  in 1983.   Another one that he wrote was ``They Heard Georgia Singing,'' about  all the famous singers who came from the State of Georgia--a great  book. By the way, in that book he chronicles two musicians who came  from Young Harris College, Ronnie Milsap and Trisha Yearwood, both  Young Harris College alums.   As you can tell, I am very proud of Young Harris College. It is my  alma mater. It changed my life. Zell Miller changed my life.   I will go on later, but before I do, I want to take this time to  yield to another Georgian who is here with us to pay his respects,  Representative Hank Johnson.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Georgia for sharing his thoughts.   Before I yield to our next speaker, I want to speak just for a second  on a couple of things about the time that Zell spent as Governor of the  State of Georgia.   As you just heard Representative Johnson mention, and I think it is  important to understand, when he left office, he had an 85 percent  approval rating. Who in the world gets an 85 percent approval rating?  He was the most popular Governor in the Nation when he left office.   But I do want to share with you that that was not always the case. It  was tough because, after all, we are talking about ``Give `Em Hell  Zell.''   You have heard many of the speakers mention the HOPE Scholarship.  And, again, we are talking about Georgia's education Governor here, the  father of the HOPE Scholarship. But remember, the HOPE Scholarship came  about as a result of the Georgia State Lottery, which there were a lot  of people who were opposed to that.   Remember I told you about being at Young Harris College? Young Harris  College is a Methodist school. There were a lot of people who supported  Zell who were opposed to what some considered to be gambling. Zell  pressed on. He knew how important it was. That was his tenacity. That  was his ruggedness. He didn't let that get in the way, and thank  goodness he didn't.   In 1992, he was very important to Bill Clinton's campaign to secure  the Democratic U.S. Presidential nomination. He played an important  role in that.   In fact, he also spoke at the Democratic National Convention. That is  where they had the posters all throughout the convention that said,  ``Give `Em Hell Zell.'' They were distributed among the delegates, as  Miller gave a speech that was critical of U.S. President George H.W.  Bush's administration. Later that year, he also actively campaigned for  Clinton, and Clinton carried the State of Georgia.   Representative Johnson also mentioned something that is very  important to remember as well. Zell was not easily elected to his  second term. That is because he took it upon himself to do the right  thing and to try, although it was unsuccessful at that time, to change  the State flag of Georgia and to take the Confederate emblem off of  that State flag. Later it was done, many years later, and I can  remember Zell saying: Well, we might not get it passed. It might not be  attributed to me, but maybe I will get an asterisk.   Well, I don't know if he ever got an asterisk, but I am going to give  him an asterisk tonight. He deserves an asterisk for that effort.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield to another great Georgian, another  member of our delegation, Representative Sanford Bishop.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for sharing  with us his experiences and how special they were.   Before I yield to our final speaker, I want to go over very quickly  about the last part of the 46 years of political service that Zell  Miller had that he served.   In 1999, after he finished his last year as Governor, his second  term--and he was term limited--he went back to Young Harris College,  the University of Georgia, and Emory University as a teacher. The  following year, then-Governor Roy Barnes appointed Zell to the United  States Senate after Senator Paul Coverdell died. Four months later, he  ran for that remaining 4 years on that 6-year term, and he was elected  a Senator from the State of Georgia, and he served in that role.   He pledged at that time to carry on the conservative tradition of the  late Senator Coverdell, who was a Republican, of course, and he did  that. He cosponsored then-U.S. President George W. Bush's 2001 tax cuts  and was adamantly in support of President Bush on the issues of  homeland security and the deployment of troops to Iraq at the start of  the Iraqi war.   You will remember, also, that he wrote another book, ``A National  Party No More: The Conscience of a Conservative Democrat.'' It became a  national  [[Page H3881]]  best seller in the months before the Presidential election that year.  And, of course, in 2004, Democratic Senator from Georgia Zell Miller  did something that I am not sure anyone else has ever done. He spoke as  a keynote speaker at the 2004 Republican National Convention.   In January of 2005, he retired from the United States Senate and he  returned to Georgia. He resumed his teaching career and continued to  write. In fact, in 2005, he wrote, ``A Deficit of Decency.''   In 2008, Zell B. Miller Learning Center was established at the  University of Georgia and dedicated in his honor. In 2017, Miller's  family announced that he suffered from Parkinson's disease and he was  retiring from public life.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to pause now and yield to another member of  the Georgia delegation, one of my good friends. He and I served  together for 10 years in the Georgia General Assembly. He is truly one  of my best friends here in Washington, and I value our friendship. I  know that he has got a lot of experience with and a lot of stories  about Zell Miller as well.   I yield to my friend, Representative Barry Loudermilk.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that,  and I am thankful that the Georgia delegation was able to pay our  respects to a great Georgian, to a great American, Zell B. Miller.   Mr. Miller's knowledge and his broad experience in Georgia enabled  him to be one of the most popular and successful leaders ever for this  State. With the passing of Zell Miller, Georgia has truly lost one of  its most important servants.   Zell Miller was a personal mentor to me. Young Harris College changed  my life, as I mentioned earlier. Zell Miller changed my life, as he  changed the lives of so many Georgians, of so many Americans. I am so  grateful for the wisdom that he shared with all of us. His family  remains in my thoughts and prayers, but his policies, his ideals, and  his legacy will live on in the State of Georgia for years to come.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
