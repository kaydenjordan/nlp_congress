 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Florida Fish  and Wildlife Senior Investigator Kyle Patterson.   Just 5 days ago on June 9, Senior Investigator Patterson was involved  in a fatal crash while on duty.   Senior Investigator Patterson faithfully served the people of St.  Lucie County for more than 15 years. From his first assignment at the  age of 19 to time spent with the Agriculture Crimes Intelligence Unit  and Marine Intelligence Unit, he was dedicated. He was a public  servant, committed to the safety of our homes and our community.   Senior Investigator Patterson was passionate about baseball, steer,  his family, and God. He dedicated his time to numerous organizations,  including the St. Lucie County Farm Bureau and Christ Fellowship, the  church that we share.   His memory will absolutely live on with those who knew him and loved  him best: his wife, Alisha; his children, Kole and Kinsley; and his  parents and sisters.   Please honor the life of Special Investigator Patterson and salute  him because he gave a lifetime of service, and service did take his  life.                            ____________________
