 Madam Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring to  the majority the schedule for the week to come.   I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Aguilar), my friend and  colleague, the vice chair of the Democratic Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank the majority for those  remarks on the schedule.   I also want to take a minute to thank the leader, and others over  there, for helping pass H.R. 2877, the Behavioral Intervention  Guidelines Act. It is a really good bill that will go a long way in  supporting school safety. I know there were many questions about it,  and everybody worked to get it to a good spot. I would like to, again,  extend my appreciation for all of the help from my Democratic  colleagues.   Turning to the operations of the House, as the gentleman knows, the  CDC has now lifted all mask and social distancing requirements.  President Biden has lifted the mask requirements for the White House  staff. But, amazingly, here in the House of Representatives, we still  must wear the mask, stagger the vote times, have these long vote times.  We should be going back to a 5-minute and a 2-minute schedule so we can  do the work of the House.   When can we expect these restrictions to be lifted?   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California.    Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time.   We, as Americans, should all celebrate Operation Warp Speed and the  work done by the administration to be able to do that and to follow  through. We greatly appreciate the Biden administration's following up  on the really great work of Operation Warp Speed and the Trump  administration.    I yield to the gentleman.    Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time.   That is in direct contradiction to CDC guidelines.   And on top of that, will the gentleman explain how in the world you  are going to get that information that every member of this body has  been vaccinated without violating HIPAA laws?    Please. I would love an answer.    Reclaiming my time.   Of course, we would like all Americans to be vaccinated. But, again,  you will never be able to understand or know how many Members are  actually vaccinated unless you require them to give you that  information. If you require them to give you that information, then the  majority will be in violation of the HIPAA privacy laws.   How in the world can you violate the HIPAA privacy laws on this? What  does that mean for future pandemics and future diseases?   There are laws in place that say that Members do not have to disclose  their health information. And if the gentleman could please explain how  you force a Member of this body to disclose their personal health  information without violating HIPAA laws, I would love to hear that  answer.    I yield to the gentleman.    Reclaiming my time.   So the President, the leader of the Democratic socialist movement  right now here in America, has said that it is good enough for the  White House, yet you are going to defer to the House physician over the  President of the United States.    No.   My point is that there is so much inconsistency here. You will never,  ever get to the point, Madam Speaker, that you will ever be able to get  every Member to show some sort of vaccination card without violating  the HIPAA privacy protections.   Again, I am listening to the rhetoric. It is a simple question: How  do you compel Members of this body to disclose their private health  information without violating HIPAA laws?   Not strategy. Not theoretical. How are you going to do that?   What provision in the law, in the HIPAA protections of an American's  private information regarding their healthcare record, are you going to  waive to compel Members of the House to show that they have been  vaccinated?   I yield to my colleague from California.    Reclaiming my time.   I will wrap this topic up with a couple of observations.   Our colleagues across on the other side of the building are certainly  following different guidelines than we are here. I think it is  important to note that what the majority is doing here is that they are  undermining the vaccination program. They are committing public health  malpractice by saying, if you get the vaccine, it doesn't work.   What is the incentive to do this?   I am going to move on to the next topic. I believe we have beat this  dead horse enough and there is no answer.    Please.    Could the gentleman answer one question: Is President  Biden wrong? Or is Dr. Monahan wrong?   I yield to the gentleman from California.    I will say this before we move on to the next topic. It  does appear that many of us are governed by different rules along the  way.   So let's move on to one final thing.   As you know, this has been police reform week. I was happy to see  that President Biden set the deadline for May 25 to sign a police  reform bill. I was also extremely happy to see that Democrat leadership  has dropped its request to eliminate qualified immunity. I thought that  was a very strong statement and very positive.   As the majority whip said on May 9: I know what the perfect bill will  be. We have proposed that. And I want to see good legislation. I know  that sometimes you have to compromise. And if we don't get qualified  immunity now, we can come back and try to get it later. But I don't  want to see us throw out a good bill because we can't get a perfect  bill, good legislative action.   Now, in order to get this bill done by the May 25--that is a fairly  short timeline. I know that Representative Pete Stauber has a bill  ready to go--a really good bill--that addresses the things in a very  bipartisan way that I think we would like to see.   Based on the schedule that you laid out, do you anticipate that the  majority would take up Mr. Stauber's bill so that we can meet President  Biden's deadline of May 25?    I yield to the gentleman.    Reclaiming my time.   I implore the majority to put Mr. Stauber and Mr. Scott's bill onto  the floor as soon as possible so that we can reach a bipartisan vote  and consensus on this.   I just want to make one other observation here, knowing that it is  police week. We have got men and women around this country--you and I,  again, both as mayors, had the honor of being involved in that, seeing  the sacrifice that they make, whether it is local police officers or  deputies out patrolling our country roads in many parts of my district;  the men and women of the Customs and Border Patrol Agency who are down  there putting their lives on the line every single day to stop the  grossness of human trafficking and the horrors of narcotic trafficking;  or looking around this very building that we are in right now, looking  at the men and women who have been here, that will continue to be here  to serve us and protect us.   What I found very interesting about this week is that the silence  from the majority is deafening. Not bringing a resolution to honor our  men and women in law enforcement says an awful lot about how you feel.   And I will say this: I think the majority should come back in--and I  think we would all agree to do this next week--to put a resolution on  the floor to honor the men and women of law enforcement, because I  can't imagine which group is not worthy of that.   I yield to the gentleman.    But, again, I want to go back to it, with the morale of  the officers here in the Capitol as low as it is right now, the  tremendous stresses that they are under, the staffing problems that  they have, wondering whether or not this entire body at times has their  back.    No, not yet. I think it is important that this body  bring a resolution to the floor supporting the men and women in law  enforcement around the Nation, but particularly right here in this  Capitol. I will be the first one, along with the rest of my colleagues,  to support that resolution.   And, so again, it is very simple. A lot of words. And I do appreciate  the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings), for leading the Special  Order. She certainly knows, as a former law enforcement officer and  leader of a department, how tough that is. But, again, the silence here  is deafening.   With that, Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
