 Madam President, throughout the country and in the great  State of Illinois, a host of environmental issues are plaguing  Americans. From air pollution, to groundwater contamination, to the  increases in climate change-related harm that we are already facing,  there is no more crucial time to have strong national leadership on  environmental issues than right now. However, in the midst of all these  issues comes the nomination of Andrew Wheeler--a former lobbyist for  corporate polluters--to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.   If there is one major thing we have learned from the Clean Air Act,  it is that regulations save lives and money. Regulations that ensure  clean air mean fewer premature deaths and health issues, as well as  fewer asthma attacks in children and health-related missed work days.  However, the EPA under this administration that is now led by Acting  Administrator Wheeler, consistently works to roll back clean air and  water rules. This exposes the most vulnerable members of our society-- including children and the elderly--to toxic and deadly chemicals. The  people in Illinois are no exception. We are facing several  environmental issues in Illinois that require immediate action by the  EPA, and so far, I am not satisfied that EPA is doing everything it can  and should be doing under Mr. Wheeler's leadership.   The Sterigenics facility is causing is a public health threat in  Willowbrook, IL due to emissions from cancer-causing ethylene oxide.  The EPA's own risk assessment from 2016, showed that ethylene oxide  exposure increases the risk of cancer more than what was previously  thought. However, given this  [[Page S1566]]  information, the EPA has still not taken sufficient actions to protect  people of Willowbrook who are exposed to this gas. Concerns about  ethylene oxide exposure is not limited to the people of Willowbrook--it  is also of concern to the people of Gurnee and Waujkegan, IL who also  have plants that use ehtylene oxide in the middle of their towns. Every  time I have spoken with Acting Administrator Wheeler about this issue,  I have been disappointed by the lack of urgency to do anything more  than monitor and collect more data. When it comes to the facilities in  Gurnee and Waukegan, the EPA won't even commit to monitor and collect  data, even though I have joined my colleague Senator Duckworth in  requesting that monitoring begin immediately. The EPA is 4 years  overdue to begin the process to promulgate new standards for this gas,  even though they know the increased cancer risk. So I, along with my  colleague Senator Duckworth and my colleagues in the House, introduced  legislation to require the EPA to promulgate new rules for ethylene  oxide. However, the EPA's failure to act to limit toxic chemicals being  emitted into neighborhoods does not end with ethylene oxide. There is  manganese pollution on the Southeast side of Chicago. Manganese  exposure results in serious neurological effects, such as learning  difficulties, lower IQ scores in children, and manganese poisoning--a  condition that resembles Parkinson's disease. There are several  facilities on the Southeast side of Chicago that emit manganese, and  EPA is now monitoring these facilities after my colleague Senator  Duckworth and I pressed EPA to do so. These facilities contaminate both  the air that people breathe and the soil that children play on.   Although the EPA knows how dangerous this neurotoxin is and how high  the concentrations are, they will not commit to strengthening manganese  standards or take immediate action to clean up sites with soil  contamination. We need someone at the EPA that will be aggressive in  enforcing the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.   We also need an EPA Administrator who recognizes how urgent it is to  address climate change. The Trump administration's own Department of  Defense issued a report last month identifying national security  threats to defense missions, operations, and installations, due to  climate change. Yet Acting Administrator Wheeler continues to undermine  independent science for climate change by appointing members to the  EPA's Scientific Advisory Board who are biased by industry or actively  deny that climate change is a problem. How can we expect the EPA to  lead efforts to address climate change if its leadership doesn't  believe it requires immediate action?   I would also like to mention one more thing before I close. This  administration promised farmers, biorefineries, and fuels stations that  they would ensure stations could sell E15 fuels this summer. The EPA is  coming close to failing to fulfil that promise. I hope the EPA will  work with me to ensure stations are able to sell E15 fuels this summer.   We need someone leading the EPA who will put the health and well- being of the people of this country above the profits of corporate  polluters. We need someone who is willing to protect families and  communities from toxic chemicals in our air and water by fully  enforcing the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. And we need  someone who will lead the charge to address climate change. I am not  convinced that Acting Administrator Wheeler will do these things. As a  result, I cannot support his nomination. I hope he proves me wrong.    I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) is  necessarily absent.   The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 47, as follows:                         [Rollcall Vote No. 33 Ex.]                                  YEAS--52       Alexander      Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Burr      Capito      Cassidy      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Enzi      Ernst      Fischer      Gardner      Graham      Grassley      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Isakson      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      McConnell      McSally      Moran      Murkowski      Paul      Perdue      Portman      Risch      Roberts      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Wicker      Young                                  NAYS--47       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Harris      Hassan      Heinrich      Hirono      Jones      Kaine      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Smith      Stabenow      Tester      Udall      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden                               NOT VOTING--1               Sinema           The nomination was confirmed.
