 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  life of Ms. Bonnie Duvall, who passed away on January 18 at the age of  61 after a brave battle with cancer.   Ms. Duvall was known to many as the first lady of American  agriculture. She was married to Mr. Zippy Duvall, the president of the  American Farm Bureau, and enjoyed accompanying him to Farm Bureau  events across the country. She was also the loving mother of one of my  former staff members, Zellie, who was with me on my first day here at  the Capitol.   Throughout her life, her dedication to the farming community made a  lasting impact on agriculture in southeast Georgia, and there is no  doubt that she is leaving it in a better place than she found it.   On her own farm, she used her business expertise gained at the  University of Georgia to keep the books. She was named the 1982  National Young Farmer and Rancher of the Year, and she was a consistent  member of the Greene County Farm Bureau Women's Committee.   Most importantly, she was an overall inspiring and genuine person who  will always be remembered for her optimistic attitude. Ms. Duvall is  going to be deeply missed throughout the agriculture community.   Zellie, Zippy, and the entire Duvall family are in my thoughts and  prayers.                            ____________________
