 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong  opposition to this cruel, anti-immigrant bill. This bill is so bad,  they even want to destroy legal immigration to this country.   For decades, our immigration laws were discriminatory, favoring  Nordic and Western Europeans, restricting Italians and Jews, and  banning the Chinese completely. Finally, in 1965, during the civil  rights era, Senator Ted Kennedy ushered in a fair immigration system  based on family reunification.   Because this system brings families together, immigrant households  are less likely to rely on public benefits. And immigrants are also  buying homes and starting businesses at a faster rate.   But now, with this bill, Republicans are trying to undo that progress  and make America White again.   Worse, they are tearing families apart to do this. While Trump and  Republicans are ripping parents from children at the border, they are  trying to do the same through our immigration laws. This war on  families must stop.
