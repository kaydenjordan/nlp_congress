 Mr. Speaker, on September 3, first  responders were called to a fire at Tonawanda Coke in western New York.  As they approached the blaze, the company blocked them from entering  the plant.   This obstruction of firefighters from the blaze threatened the health  and safety of first responders, plant employees, and the surrounding  neighborhood.   Tonawanda Coke has a long history of this kind of erratic corporate  behavior and is in violation of Federal and State environmental laws,  including dozens of provisions of the Clean Air Act.   The Environmental Protection Agency and the New York State Department  of Environmental Conservation needs to put an end to Tonawanda Coke's  reckless actions.   Tonawanda Coke needs to be made to comply with the letter of any and  all environmental law, or they should be shut down.                            ____________________
