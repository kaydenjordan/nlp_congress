 Madam Speaker, I rise today in memory of  Sandra Deal, a woman whose legacy as a lifelong champion of education  will not soon be forgotten.   On August 23, Mrs. Deal passed away surrounded by family after a 4- year battle with cancer. Sandra was the daughter of two educators and  was raised in Gainesville, Georgia. After earning both a bachelor's  degree and a master's degree in elementary education, she went on to  teach language arts in public schools for over 15 years.   As Georgia's first lady, she made childhood literacy improvements her  top priority. Through this initiative,  [[Page H7790]]  she visited schools in every single one of Georgia's 159 counties,  spanning across 180 school districts. Across just 8 years, she read to  students in nearly 1,000 classrooms, touching tens of thousands of  lives. She donated copies of her memoir, ``Memories of the Mansion: The  Story of Georgia's Governor's Mansion,'' to every public library in the  State.   On top of these accomplishments, she was a devoted wife of 56 years,  a mother to four, and a grandmother to six. A shining example of the  qualities every person strives toward, Sandra Deal's impact will be  felt by many generations of Georgians.          Honoring Lieutenant General Donald E. ``Rosie'' Rosenblum     Madam Speaker, it is with a very heavy heart  that I rise today to recognize and honor the life and service of a true  American patriot in my district, Lieutenant General Donald E.  Rosenblum.   Rosie was born on June 3, 1929, in Flushing, New York, and was raised  during the Depression in Hell's Kitchen in New York.   In 1948, Rosie graduated high school and followed his older brother,  Bob, to the Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina. At the Citadel,  Rosie was a member of the varsity baseball team and sports editor of  the college paper. Upon graduation, Rosie was commissioned as a second  lieutenant in the U.S. Army and deployed to lead an infantry platoon in  the Korean war.   After Korea, Rosie was placed in command of an infantry company in  the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg and served as a staff officer  in Berlin, Germany, when the wall was built.   In between his tours in Vietnam, Rosie also managed to graduate from  the U.S. Army War College and later served as the executive officer to  the Army's director of operations at the Pentagon. It was there that he  received his first of three general officer stars, and he was then  transferred to Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield in Georgia.   Rosie became an institution in our community, serving on boards for  the YMCA of Coastal Georgia, the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial Savannah,  and the Citadel Foundation.   His legacy is one of patriotism, dedication, selflessness, and love  for his neighbors. My prayers reside with his family and friends during  this time of sadness.             Honoring the First Baptist Church in Port Wentworth     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the First  Baptist Church of Port Wentworth and its 100-year anniversary.   Under the leadership of Reverend L.R. Watkins, the First Baptist  Church in Port Wentworth has been a shining cornerstone of greater  Savannah since its founding in 1922.   In the early 1950s, the church decided to purchase and install chimes  within the church steeple so that all within the community could hear  the ``call to worship'' bells every Sunday morning. These bells became  popular within the Port Wentworth community.   During the 1960s and 1970s, the church experienced tremendous growth.  As the church grew larger, there was a need for an educational building  for the church's youth. In 1960, a new educational wing of the church  was dedicated. The 1970s also brought even more new changes to the  church. The church expanded its music program and decided to build a  new sanctuary. The sanctuary that was dedicated in 1973 is still being  used today.   Today, the First Baptist Church in Port Wentworth is under the  leadership of Reverend Paul Mongin. Reverend Mongin is continuing the  legacy of the congregation's storied history.   Congratulations Port Wentworth First Baptist Church on this wonderful  milestone.                                time  1030                     In Loving Memory of Terrell Coppage     Madam Speaker, I rise today in loving memory  of a devoted husband, a caring father, and my wonderful father-in-law,  Terrell Coppage.   On April 28, 1928, Terrell was born in Lowndes County, Georgia. His  family migrated to Adel, Georgia, and Terrell attended Sparks-Adel High  School.   Immediately after high school, Terrell joined the war effort, serving  as a member of the United States Navy during World War II.   On August 21, 1949, Terrell met Betty Jones, his future wife of 73  years.   As a member of his community, Terrell was among the best. He was  actively involved in his church, Trinity United Methodist Church,  leading Sunday school and the local Boy Scout Troop 306 for many years.  He spoke fondly of his trip with the Boy Scout troop to the National  Boy Scout Jamboree in Washington, D.C. in 1981.   Terrell was also a member of the Okefenokee Lions Club, and was  chosen as ``Lion of the Year,'' as well as serving as house captain for  many years during their ``Christmas in April'' event.   Keenager Choir, traveling to all 50 States, and daily walks with the  ``mall walkers'' that ended with McDonald's biscuits were just some of  the small joys that Terrell and Betty shared together.   Madam Speaker, I thank Terrell for all that he did to raise my wife,  Amy, and for being the best father-in-law and grandfather anyone could  ask for. We love you, and we will miss you.                            ____________________
