 Mr. President, an unusual event occurred yesterday in the  Environment and Public Works Committee--a major bill reauthorizing  America's transportation infrastructure for 5 years passed the  committee by a 21-to-0 vote. That is the way we should be able to  operate on a subject that I think enjoys universal support in the  Senate; that is, making sure the Federal partnership for infrastructure  is not only reauthorized but also increased because we know the  infrastructure needs of this country have only gotten more challenging.   I want to start by complimenting the leadership of the Environment  and Public Works Committee. Chairman Barrasso and Ranking Member Carper  worked very closely together on this bill, including the input of all  members of the committee as well as Members of the Senate.   The Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, chaired by  Senator Capito, and I am the ranking Democrat on the committee, also  worked very well in developing this Transportation Infrastructure  Reauthorization Act.   As I pointed out originally, the needs are urgent, and the leadership  of the committee recognized that. In every one of our States, we know  the unmet needs of infrastructure, maintaining our existing  infrastructure, and replacing our bridges that are falling down,  dealing with our transit systems, dealing with the needs to deal with  congestion.   We know there are so many issues out there, and it is important for  us to give a clear signal that we intend to have a long-term  reauthorization, 5 years, so there is predictability, so our States and  local governments know that these projects that require longer term  planning will have a Federal partner that is available and reliable.   It also increases the funding, the first year by 10 percent and  increases it by certain percentages thereafter, recognizing we need to  do more. There are several new initiatives building on existing  programs that I think are worthy of mentioning.   Let me just go over a few of the real highlights of this  infrastructure bill. First, it has a climate change title. This is the  first time we have done this--a separate title to deal with the  realities of climate change.   I need only remind my colleagues of what happened this month in  Maryland when we had 4 inches of rain that flooded Maryland roads. We  have to deal with the realities. We have to deal with resiliency and  adaptation in regard to what is happening with climate change. This  title deals with that.   Transportation is the leading source of greenhouse gas emissions. We  need infrastructure that deals with the realities of reducing carbon  emissions. This title provides for financial help for building an  infrastructure for electric and alternative fuel vehicles. That is a  reality of consumer desire as well as dealing with the realities of  climate change.   We give local discretion for funds to initiate emission reduction  strategies. That could include simple things like providing  alternatives for the use of our cars for people who want to walk and  bike rather than having to get into their cars. It is a major  commitment for which we are going to provide resources, in partnership  with local governments, to deal with the realities of our  responsibility in the transportation sector to reduce carbon emissions.   We also deal with the realities of congestion. I can tell the  Presiding Officer, as I told my colleagues on the Environment and  Public Works Committee, that I face it every day twice a day. I commute  from Baltimore here to work and have to deal with the realities of  congestion.   It has been estimated that the delays caused by congestion and the  excessive fuels that are used by congestion cost our economy over $300  billion every year. So there is not only a quality-of-life issue  involved in our taking on congestion, there is also an economic reason  to take on the issues of congestion.   Of course, it is also linked to our commitment to deal with the  climate change issues by reducing unnecessary fuel consumption, which  adds to carbon emissions.   The legislation provides funding for new initiatives so that we can  get solutions to deal with the problems of congestion, the multimobile  solutions that are available in many communities. We work and allow the  locals to give us ideas and help fund those to reduce congestion.   As I mentioned earlier, we have a real challenge on dealing with our  bridges. Many of our bridges are in need of replacement. Many are in  need of desperate repair. I can mention many in Maryland. In the  southern part of our State, we have the Nice Bridge and the Johnson  Bridge, both in need of replacement or repair. This legislation  provides additional resources to deal with bridges in our country.   There are certain highways that have been built that no longer really  serve the function--or may never serve the function--of moving people  from one area to another but instead are dividing communities. So the  legislation  [[Page S5212]]  has a unique section that allows us to identify those types of highways  that are no longer needed and that are dividing and isolating  communities so we can get those highways removed.   I am proud that this legislation builds on the Transportation  Alternative Program that I helped author on the reauthorization bill  with my partner Senator Wicker. I thank him for his help. It allows for  much more local discretion on how transportation funds are spent. It  allows local communities to have a source of Federal support to deal  with local safety issues, for developing trails for pedestrian and bike  paths so that the quality of life and safety of the local community are  taken into consideration on the use of Federal highway funds.   It provides flexibility to local government. In the first year, we  provide $1.2 billion for transportation alternative programs with a  steady growth in the ensuing 4 years.   I also want to acknowledge the section in the bill that deals with  freight traffic. It is a growing field. We expect it to continue to  grow. There are funds that are provided in here to deal with the  realities of moving freight through our highway surface transportation  system.   In that regard, I was pleased that this past week we were able to  announce an INFRA grant for Maryland of $125 million for the Howard  Street Tunnel. This is a tunnel that is 120 years old and runs through  Baltimore. The replacement of this tunnel will allow for double  stacking of rail freight, which is what you need to do today if you are  going to have efficiency and be economically competitive. This grant  will help us replace that tunnel and help create more jobs in  Baltimore, in Maryland, and in our entire region of the country and  will provide for more efficiencies on truck traffic.   I say that because, today, because of the inefficiencies of rail, we  have trucks that are stacked up in the Port of Baltimore, which is  inefficient for the truck operators and, again, adds to the climate  problems of excessive use of fuels.   There is a section in here that deals with safety, as we should. In  2017, 37,000 people died in our transportation areas. We need to  improve that. There are some important provisions in this legislation  that deal with safety issues.   The bill also deals with reauthorizing the Appalachian Regional  Commission. I particularly thank Senator Capito for her leadership on  this issue. Reauthorization is important for the entire region,  including the western part of the State of Maryland.   This is the first step--and I hope a successful step--for the  completion of the reauthorization of surface transportation by this  Congress before the end of this year. I hope we can get it moving. I  hope we can get it enacted, certainly, in time, so there is no lapse in  Federal partnerships dealing with transportation.   I know we have other committees that need to act on a comprehensive  transportation bill. Many of us serve on those other committees. If we  follow the example of the Environment and Public Works Committee--21 to  0--if we listen to each other, if we do that, we can succeed in passing  a strong reauthorization of surface transportation that will help  modernize America's transportation needs, which will be good for our  economy, good for our environment, and good for the quality of life of  all Americans.   I urge my colleagues to follow that example, and let's get this work  done.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to discuss the grave  situation in Cameroon, specifically the targeted attacks against the  English-speaking minority community there, the ongoing conflict between  armed separatist groups and Cameroonian security forces, and the  country's many political prisoners. In response to the escalation of  conflict in Cameroon's northwest and southwest regions, yesterday,  Senator Young and I introduced a resolution calling on the Government  of Cameroon and armed separatist groups to respect the human rights of  all Cameroonian citizens, to end all violence, and to pursue an  inclusive dialogue to resolve the conflict.   Since the outbreak of violence in 2016, Cameroon's security forces  have been credibly accused of grave human rights abuses, from  suppressing the basic freedoms of expression and assembly, and  arbitrarily detaining those who challenge the President's authority, to  torture and extrajudicial killings. The victims of these abuses include  Anglophone activists, some of whom were forcibly returned to Cameroon  after fleeing to Nigeria. Since 2016, entire villages have been burned  down, displacing hundreds of thousands of Cameroonians from their  communities.   Where did this all begin? The current conflict can be traced back to  Cameroon's colonial history, as a country formed through merging pieces  of a former French colony with parts of a former British colony. The  Francophone majority has held much of the land since 1961, when  Cameroon gained its independence. All the while, the Anglophone  minority held on to its language and distinct judicial and educational  systems as it continued to be governed largely by French speakers.   About 3 years ago, this all began to shift. The Francophone  government began implementing the French language and imposing its own  laws, judges, and teachers in Anglophone communities, and protestors  rose up in response. Anglophone Cameroonians rightly saw this as an  unjust imposition on their autonomy, as a tyranny of the majority  seeking to do away with their language and identity. The fact that  Anglophone Cameroonians are vastly underrepresented in the central  government only exacerbates their grievances in this matter. In  response to citizens' voicing their discontent, the government cracked  down, arresting hundreds of people--including peaceful activists who  were given terrorism charges--and deploying the military to Anglophone  areas.   Over the past 3 years, violence has claimed 2,000 lives in the  Anglophone region. Human Rights Watch has documented extensive burning  of villages by members of the security forces in the last 2 years in  both the northwest and southwest regions, as well as rampant killings  of civilians and sexual violence. According to a July 22 Human Rights  Watch report, Cameroonian security forces have killed at least four  civilians and raped one woman since mid June alone during their  security operations in the northwest region. Shockingly, those killed  included an elderly man with a physical disability and a young man with  a mental disability.   We cannot turn a blind eye to the circumstances there. My home State  of Maryland is home to a large, active population of Cameroonian  diasporans. Marylander Sylvie Bello and members of her advocacy  organization, the Cameroon American Council, have been a leading  diaspora voice calling for the United States to encourage the  Cameroonian Government and armed militias to stop the violence. Many in  the diaspora community across the United States are working with civil  society organizations in Cameroon to address the needs of internally  displaced persons, IDPs, in the northwest and southwest regions of the  country and refugees on the Nigerian side of the border.   This important community has made something very clear to me and my  team, and I would like to take this opportunity to remind my colleagues  in the U.S. Congress of it. The conflict in Cameroon greatly impacts  Americans here in the United States, whether it be Americans with loved  ones affected by the conflict, those who have traveled here to escape  the conflict, or simply those of us who understand that being silent on  issues of human rights is analogous to being complicit to their  [[Page S5244]]  occurrence. I encourage the Government of Cameroon to engage with  diaspora organizations, along with a broad spectrum of Cameroonian  civil society leader, in meaningful and constructive dialogue to  resolve the conflict.   Moving forward, as we look for ways to address the situation in  Cameroon, we must look to longtime President Paul Biya and his ongoing  attacks on the legitimacy of Cameroon's democracy. President Biya rose  to office in 1982 after serving as Prime Minister. In 2008,  Presidential term limits were removed from Cameroon's Constitution.  Protests ensued, but when the public wished to voice their disapproval  of this decision, security forces violently repressed their actions.   In October 2018, Biya claimed a seventh Presidential victory in an  election that many considered to be neither free nor fair. There were  numerous credible reports of fraud, voter intimidation, violence, and  low voter turnout in the Anglophone regions. The opposition party who  reportedly came in second place, the Cameroon Renaissance Movement,  claims that it had the support of the people. In January of this year,  protests and demonstrations against the October elections were  summarily suppressed by the Biya regime. Over 200 people were arrested,  including opposition leader Maurice Kamto and his close supporters.   The United Nations Secretary General, Amnesty International, and the  International Law Commission have called for Mr. Kamto's release, and  just last month, thousands of Cameroonians demonstrated in Yaounde with  the same demand. Biya's government forces responded as they usually do,  by arresting 73 of the demonstrators.   Even members of the President's own inner circle are not immune to  his thuggery. In 2012, Mr. Marafa Hamidou Yaya, the former Secretary  General of the Presidency, was arrested and sentenced to 25 years in  prison for complicity in an embezzlement scheme that many suspect  befell him not because of any actual involvement in embezzlement, but  as a way to prevent him from ever challenging Biya for the Presidency.  His arrest and imprisonment make clear that Biya will target anyone who  threatens grip on power.   President Biya has the broad authority to appoint and dismiss the  Prime Minister, Cabinet members, judges, generals, and governors. The  executive and judicial branches are clearly a product of the  President's preference, rather than a reflection of the will of the  people. Although several press outlets exist and multiple political  parties compete in elections, freedom of expression is greatly  constrained. Journalists have been jailed, and Reporters Without  Borders has described the circumstances for Cameroonian media as a  ``climate of fear.''   In addition to these democratic concerns, Cameroon currently faces  three major humanitarian challenges, which are exasperated by President  Biya's unchecked authority. About 275,000 refugees from the Central  African Republic reside in the eastern part of Cameroon. In the north,  Boko Haram threatens the communities near the Nigerian border. And in  the west, where most of Cameroon's Anglophone minority resides, a  conflict among government security forces and those seeking  independence from the rest of the country continues to escalate.   If that wasn't enough, reports indicate that U.S. military assistance  to Cameroon is being used to arm the same forces accused of committing  atrocities against English-speaking Cameroonians. For this reason,  Senator Durbin and I filed an amendment to the National Defense  Authorization Act that would freeze security assistance to Cameroon,  except for those funds that go towards combatting Boko Haram, until the  U.S. Departments of Defense and State can certify that Cameroon's  military and security forces have demonstrated progress in abiding by  international human rights standards, particularly in regards to their  actions in the Anglophone region.   Although Cameroon is an important partner in U.S. counterterrorism  efforts in the region, we cannot turn a blind eye to the extreme  violence the government and its security forces have inflicted on  innocent civilians. Human Rights Watch has documented extensive burning  of villages by members of the security forces in the last 2 years in  both the northwest and southwest regions, as well as rampant killings  of civilians and sexual violence.   This February, the U.S. withheld millions of dollars in security  assistance from Cameroon, on the condition that Biya and his forces  work to improve the humanitarian situation there. No county should be  able to receive U.S. military assistance while continuing to violently  repress the rights of its own population.   America's strength is in our values. We must call out instances of  human rights violations wherever they happen in the world. As a  Congress, we have a special responsibility to use our voices when it is  another government who is the perpetrator of these human rights abuses.  This is the case for the situation in Cameroon. The violence must end.  Innocent Cameroonians are caught in the crossfires of this political  battle.   Communities have become too dangerous to live in. Hundreds of  thousands of Cameroonians have been forced to flee their homes to  escape the violence inflicted upon them. In November 2018, the United  Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs stated that  at least 437,000 people were internally displaced in Cameroon from  areas affected by this Anglophone conflict.   There are also thousands of refugees who have left Cameroon  completely. As of late November 2018, the Office of the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees reported that it had registered more  than 32,000 Cameroonian refugees in Nigeria who came from the affected  Anglophone regions. The persecuted Cameroonians seeking refuge in  Nigeria include dozens of Anglophone activists, but in January 2018, 47  of those activists were forcibly returned to Cameroonian authorities.  Many of those returned had reportedly submitted asylum claims in  Nigeria, so it is especially troubling that they were made to return to  the country from which they fled. Ten of the 47 activists who were  forcibly returned from Nigeria now face charges before a military court  that would be punishable by the death penalty. The other 37 reportedly  remain in detention without charge.   Even non-Cameroonians have found themselves in the midst of this  turmoil. On October 30, 2018, U.S. missionary Charles Wesco was killed  near the town of Bamenda, Cameroon.   We must act in the face of these gross violations of human rights. We  must encourage all actors in the Cameroonian conflict to prioritize  respect for human life over the desire for political gain. This must be  done by first agreeing to an immediate ceasefire and allowing  humanitarian assistance to reach those in need. The Cameroonian  Government and Armed Forces must exercise restraint in their actions  and ensure that protests remain peaceful.   Leaders on both sides must be willing to engage in constructive  dialogue with civil society members to achieve to a political solution,  one that is based upon respect for fundamental human rights and  freedoms. Failure to do so will only prolong the conflict and lead to  an increase in violence and mass displacement of the Anglophone  minority.   In closing, I would like to again thank Maryland's vibrant  Cameroonian diaspora for their continued engagement with myself and my  office, and encourage my Senate colleagues to support my and Senator  Young's resolution which addresses many of these issues. Congress has a  responsibility to continue to shine a spotlight on ongoing human rights  abuses and the duty to advocate for upholding the rights of all  citizens in Cameroon, regardless of their religious and political  beliefs or the regions in which they reside.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am introducing the Unlocking  Opportunities in Emerging Markets Act, which establishes an Office of  Emerging Markets (OEM) within the Small Business Administration's (SBA)  Office of Capital Access to ensure that SBA's access to capital  initiatives address the specific needs of entrepreneurs in underserved  domestic emerging markets.   Capital is the lifeblood of small businesses, but for women,  minorities, veterans and other underserved entrepreneurs, access to  capital remains the key roadblock to owning and operating a successful  business.   The challenges that underserved entrepreneurs face are historic and  pervasive with minority and women entrepreneurs, for example, having  less wealth from which to fund new businesses.   Black families have $17,150 in wealth and Hispanic families have  $20,720 in wealth, while White families have $171,000 in wealth.  Similarly, women have $3 in wealth for every $10 men have.   These historical barriers are compounded by systemic inequality in  the capital markets. Minority-owned business are two to three times  more likely to be denied credit; more likely to avoid applying for  loans, based on the belief that they will be turned down; and more  likely to receive smaller loans and pay higher interest rates on the  loans that they do receive. Rural businesses owners often face an  uphill battle to secure funding for their startups. And women are  significantly  [[Page S5253]]  less likely than men to be approved for a business loan and are more  likely to experience funding gaps.   SBA was created to solve these very problems, but instead of being a  solution, lending patterns in the agency's largest loan programs mirror  these trends. During Fiscal Year 2018, only 4.5 percent of all loans  approved by SBA's highest volume loan program--7(a)--went to Black  entrepreneurs. Another 8.5 percent went to Hispanic entrepreneurs,  while 59 percent went to white borrowers.   Despite these challenges, SBA does not have the coordinated effort  required to address them. In multiple hearings in the Small Business  Committee, SBA has not been able to explain how they are addressing  these urgent issues. By creating OEM, and empowering a Senior Executive  Service level director to lead the office, we in Congress can ensure  that SBA is giving the problems that underserved entrepreneurs face the  attention and resources they deserve.   Eliminating disparities in the capital markets for underserved  business owners is not just the right thing to do, it will spur growth  in the American economy.   In the years since the Great Recession, minority-owned small  businesses have been driving the growth of small business formation in  spite of the significant headwinds they face. Just imagine what they  could do if SBA was laser focused on removing some of those headwinds.  SBA has helped level the playing field for underserved communities in  government contracting, and entrepreneurial development, but access to  capital is the only major area where there is no office specific to the  needs of underserved communities.   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this critical piece of  legislation, so SBA can begin making the concerted effort required to  help more underserved entrepreneurs overcome barriers, start successful  businesses, and create jobs.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CARDIN:   S. 2361. A bill to amend the Small Business Act to increase lending  to underserved borrowers through the largest loan program of the Small  Business Administration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship.    Mr. President, today I am introducing the Closing the  Credit Gap Act to make the Small Business Administration's (SBA)  Community Advantage program permanent.   SBA created Community Advantage in 2011 to provide capital and  support to small businesses that have been historically underserved by  SBA's highest volume loan program, 7(a).   Community Advantage allows nonprofit mission lenders like SBA  microlenders, Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) and  SBA 504 lenders to make 7(a) loans of up to $250,000 to small  businesses.   The program has shown year after year that it is more capable of  getting capital into the hands of minority, women and veteran  entrepreneurs than the 7(a)program. During Fiscal Year 2018, the most  recent year for which complete data is available, only 4.5 percent of  7(a) approvals went to Black business owners compared to 12 percent of  Community Advantage approvals; 9 percent of 7(a) approvals went to  Hispanic borrowers compared to 17 percent in the Community Advantage  program; women-owned businesses received only 18 percent of 7(a)  approvals while receiving 30 percent of all Community Advantage  approvals; and veterans, who only received 4 percent of 7(a) approvals,  received 10 percent of approvals in the Community Advantage program.   Capital is the lifeblood of small businesses, so for many women,  minority, veteran and other underserved entrepreneurs, Community  Advantage is a lifeline, because the program fills a gap in traditional  credit markets.   Minority-owned business are two to three times more likely to be  denied credit; more likely to avoid applying for loans, based on the  belief that they will be turned down; and more likely to receive  smaller loans and pay higher interest rates on the loans that they do  receive. Rural businesses owners often face an uphill battle to secure  funding for their startups. And women are significantly less likely  than men to be approved for a business loan and are more likely to  experience funding gaps.   My bill will make this vital program a permanent loan product  administered by SBA, and it will allow SBA to lift the cap up to  $350,000 from $250,000 to help borrowers in more expensive regions and  industries, as well as victims of abusive loan products.   My home State of Maryland has the highest concentration of minority-  and women-owned businesses in the country. That designation makes me  proud, but it also makes me think of the countless entrepreneurs whose  dreams of business ownership or growth remain unfulfilled because they  could not get financing.   If we pass the Closing the Credit Gap Act, we can empower more  entrepreneurs who have the ideas but not the networks or capital needed  to start and grow their businesses and create jobs.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Booker, Ms. Harris,          Ms. Hirono, Mr. Kaine, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Sanders, and Mr.          Schatz):   S. 2390. A bill to prohibit the imposition of the death penalty for  any violation of Federal law, and for other purposes; to the Committee  on the Judiciary.
