 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 1952) to amend the Intercountry Adoption Act of  2000 to require the Secretary of State to report on intercountry  adoptions from countries which have significantly reduced adoption  rates involving immigration to the United States, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1952         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Intercountry Adoption       Information Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN ANNUAL                     REPORT ON INTERCOUNTRY ADOPTIONS.         (a) Report Elements.--Section 104(b) of the Intercountry       Adoption Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 14914(b)) is amended by       adding at the end the following new paragraphs:        ``(9) A list of countries that established or maintained a       significant law or regulation that prevented or prohibited       adoptions involving immigration to the United States,       regardless of whether such adoptions occurred under the       Convention.        ``(10) For each country listed under paragraph (9), the       date on which the law or regulation was initially       implemented.        ``(11) Information on efforts taken with respect to a       country listed under paragraph (9) to encourage the       resumption of halted or stalled adoption proceedings       involving immigration to the United States, regardless of       whether the adoptions would have occurred under the       Convention.        ``(12) Information on any action the Secretary carried out       that prevented, prohibited, or halted any adoptions involving       immigration to the United States, regardless of whether the       adoptions occurred under the Convention.        ``(13) For each country listed pursuant to paragraph (12),       a description of--        ``(A) what policies, procedures, resources, and safeguards       the country lacks, or other shortcomings or circumstances,       that caused the action to be carried out;        ``(B) what progress the country has made to alleviate those       shortcomings; and        ``(C) what steps the Department of State has taken in order       to assist the country to reopen intercountry adoptions.        ``(14) An assessment of the impact of the fee schedule of       the Intercountry Adoption Accreditation and Maintenance       Entity on families seeking to adopt internationally,       especially low-income families, families seeking to adopt       sibling groups, or families seeking to adopt children with       disabilities.''.        (b) Public Availability of Report.--Section 104 of the       Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 14914) is       amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(c) Public Availability of Report.--The Secretary shall       make the information contained in the report required under       subsection (a) available to the public on the website of the       Department of State.''.        (c) Privacy Concerns.--In complying with the amendments       made by subsections (a) and (b), the Secretary shall avoid,       to the maximum extent practicable, disclosing any personally       identifiable information relating to United States citizens       or the adoptees of such citizens.        (d) Conforming Amendment.--Section 104(a) of the       Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 14914(a)) is       amended by striking ``International Relations'' and inserting       ``Foreign Affairs''.        (e) Application Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall apply with respect to reports required to be submitted       under section 104 of the Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000       (42 U.S.C. 14914) beginning on the date that is 180 days       after the date of enactment of this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1952, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   First of all, I thank Mr. Collins and Mr. Langevin for their hard  work on this bill that would help ease some of the problems parents  face when they are trying to adopt children from other countries.   Madam Speaker, the process of adopting a child is a tough one,  especially when that child is overseas. It is expensive and often  emotionally taxing for the parents. It is filled with legal twists and  turns and often difficult requirements, but it is worth it for these  loving parents who want to give children from faraway places a home and  the chance to be part of a family and a good future.   What can make this process even more daunting is when foreign  governments change their laws without any sort of notice or  explanation. For parents who have to deal with this, it is like having  the rug pulled out from under them.   In 2018, the number of intercountry adoptions to the United States  declined by roughly 600. We saw a similar decline the year before. Part  of the reason is that China and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  changed their policies, for example.   I can't imagine the frustration and anxiety of parents who learned  their adoption has been delayed or derailed. This bill helps to make  things easier on those families.   It would require the State Department to stay up to date on laws and  policies dealing with intercountry adoptions and make sure American  [[Page H3974]]  families get that information. This will make the adoption process  safer and more transparent for both parents and children.   This is a good bill. It passed the House last Congress. After we pass  it again today, I hope the other body, the Senate, will act quickly as  well to pass it.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, we hear far too many gut-wrenching stories about  American families who have trouble adopting children overseas. This  legislation will help make that easier, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill, and I  urge support from all Members.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 753) to promote international exchanges on best  election practices, cultivate more secure democratic institutions  around the world, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 753         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Global Electoral Exchange       Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) recent elections globally have illustrated the urgent       need for the promotion and exchange of international best       election practices, particularly in the areas of       cybersecurity, results transmission, transparency of       electoral data, election dispute resolution, and the       elimination of discriminatory registration practices and       other electoral irregularities;        (2) the advancement of democracy worldwide promotes       American interests, as stable democracies provide new market       opportunities, improve global health outcomes, and promote       economic freedom and regional security;        (3) credible elections are the cornerstone of a healthy       democracy and enable all persons to exercise their basic       human right to have a say in how they are governed;        (4) inclusive elections strengthen the credibility and       stability of democracies more broadly;        (5) at the heart of a strong election cycle is the       professionalism of the election management body and an       empowered civil society;        (6) the development of local expertise via peer-to-peer       learning and exchanges promotes the independence of such       bodies from internal and external influence; and        (7) supporting the efforts of peoples in democratizing       societies to build more representative governments in their       respective countries is in the national interest of the       United States.       SEC. 3. GLOBAL ELECTORAL EXCHANGE.         (a) Global Electoral Exchange.--The Secretary of State is       authorized to establish and administer a Global Electoral       Exchange Program to promote the utilization of sound election       administration practices around the world.        (b) Purpose.--The purpose of the Global Electoral Exchange       Program described in subsection (a) shall include the       promotion and exchange of international best election       practices, including in the areas of--        (1) cybersecurity;        (2) results transmission;        (3) transparency of electoral data;        (4) election dispute resolution;        (5) the elimination of discriminatory registration       practices and electoral irregularities;        (6) equitable access to polling places, voter education       information, and voting mechanisms (including by persons with       disabilities); and        (7) other sound election administration practices.        (c) Exchange of Electoral Authorities.--        (1) In general.--The Secretary of State may, in       consultation, as appropriate, with the United States Agency       for International Development, make grants to any United       States-based organization described in section 501(c)(3) of       the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under       section 501(a) of such Code with experience in and a primary       focus on foreign comparative election systems or subject       matter expertise in the administration or integrity of such       systems that submits an application in such form, and       satisfying such requirements, as the Secretary may require.        (2) Types of grants.--An organization described in       paragraph (1) may receive a grant for one or more of the       following purposes:        (A) To design and implement programs bringing election       administrators and officials, including government officials,       poll workers, civil society representatives, members of the       judiciary, and others who participate in the organization and       administration of public elections in a foreign country that       faces challenges to its electoral process to the United       States to study election procedures in the United States for       educational purposes.        (B) To design and implement programs taking the United       States or another country's election administrators and       officials, including government officials, poll workers,       civil society representatives, members of the judiciary, and       others who participate in the organization and administration       of public elections to study and discuss election procedures       for educational purposes.

(4) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Secretary of State should establish and maintain a       network of Global Electoral Exchange Program alumni, to       promote communication and further exchange of information       regarding sound election administration practices among       current and former program participants.        (5) Further limits.--A recipient of a grant under the       Global Electoral Exchange Program may use such grant for only       the purpose for which such grant was awarded, unless       otherwise authorized by the Secretary of State.        (6) Not duplicative.--Grants made under this subsection may       not be duplicative of any other grants made under any other       provision of law for similar or related purposes.       SEC. 4. CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT.         Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of       this Act and in each of the following two years thereafter,       the Secretary of State shall provide to the Committee on       Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a briefing on       the status of any activities carried out pursuant to this Act       during the preceding year, which shall include, among other       information, the following:        (1) A summary of all exchanges conducted under the Global       Electoral Exchange Program, including information regarding       grantees, participants, and the locations where program       activities were held.        (2) A description of the criteria used to select grantees       under the Global Electoral Exchange Program.        (3) Any recommendations for the improvement of the Global       Electoral Exchange Program, based on the purpose specified in       section 3(b).       SEC. 5. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out the requirements of this Act. Such requirements       shall be carried out using amounts otherwise authorized to be       appropriated.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 753.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 753, the Global  Electoral Exchange Act of 2019. I would first like to thank my  colleague Representative Mark Meadows for his important work on this  measure that he and I introduced.   We passed this bill last Congress, and I urge my colleagues to do the  same  [[Page H3976]]  this Congress. This time, I hope that the Senate acts on this small but  important measure that will promote best practices in election  administration worldwide.   This bill authorizes the Secretary of State to establish an exchange  program for election officials like poll workers, judges, ballot  designers, and civil society to promote best practices in election  administration around the world.   We would send U.S.-based election administrators and officials abroad  or bring foreign administrators and officials to the United States in  order to train and exchange best practices when it comes to election  administration.   This bill is a good idea and is needed now more than ever. Election  irregularities, voter fraud, election manipulation, discriminatory  registration, access to polls, intimidation and harassment while  voting, and violence at polling stations are problems that have plagued  countries around the world. This bill brings people together to tackle  some of these problems and to ensure that best practices are promoted  worldwide.   Credible, transparent, and peaceful elections are the cornerstones of  a stable and robust democracy. This bill furthers that principle.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support the passage of H.R. 753, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this measure. Once again, I thank my colleague Mark Meadows from North  Carolina for his support and hard work on this bill.   The exchanges under this bill would be administered by the State  Department and by USAID and would promote best practices and strengthen  electoral institutions around the world.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 106) denouncing female genital  mutilation/cutting as a violation of the human rights of women and  girls and urging the international community and the Federal Government  to increase efforts to eliminate the harmful practice.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 106         Whereas female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is       recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights       of women and girls;        Whereas FGM/C comprises all procedures that involve partial       or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other       injury to the female genital organs for nonmedical reasons;        Whereas an estimated 200 million girls and women alive       today have been victims of FGM/C, with girls 14 and younger       representing 44 million of those who have been cut;        Whereas more than 3 million girls are estimated to be at       risk of FGM/C annually;        Whereas the practice is mostly carried out on young girls       between infancy and age 15;        Whereas the practice is rooted in gender inequality and is       often linked to other elements of gender-based violence and       discrimination, such as child marriage;        Whereas the World Health Organization asserts that FGM/C       has no health benefits for women and girls, and can have       long-term impacts on their physical, psychological, sexual,       and reproductive health;        Whereas the impacts of FGM/C on the physical health of       women and girls can include bleeding, infection, obstetric       fistula, complications during childbirth, and death;        Whereas, according to UNICEF, FGM/C is reported to occur in       all parts of the world, but is most prevalent in parts of       Africa, the Middle East, and Asia;        Whereas, although the practice of FGM/C is highly       concentrated in specific regions and associated with several       cultural traditions, it is not tied to any one religion;        Whereas, in 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention published a report estimating that 513,000 women       and girls in the United States were at risk or may have been       subjected to FGM/C;        Whereas, in 2015, the United Nations adopted a set of 17       Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 that includes a target       to eliminate FGM/C, having previously recognized in 2010 that       ``the abandonment of this harmful practice can be achieved as       a result of a comprehensive movement that involves all public       and private stakeholders in society'';        Whereas the elimination of FGM/C has been called for by       numerous intergovernmental organizations, including the       African Union, the European Union, and the Organization of       Islamic Cooperation, as well as in 3 resolutions of the       United Nations General Assembly;        Whereas the Department of State reports on FGM/C in its       Annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, including       information on whether FGM/C is prevalent, the type and       category of genital cutting that is most common, as well as       international and governmental efforts being taken to address       the practice;        Whereas the Federal Government recognized FGM/C as a form       of gender-based violence in the United States Strategy to       Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally,       released in August 2012 and updated in June 2016, and the       United States Global Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls,       released in March 2016;        Whereas a Government Accountability Office report released       in 2016 concluded that ``State and USAID currently have       limited international assistance efforts to address FGM/C.'';       and        Whereas, in 2012, the United Nations General Assembly       designated February 6 as the International Day of Zero       Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation to enhance awareness       of and encourage concrete actions by states and individuals       against the practice: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) denounces female genital mutilation/cutting as a       violation of the human rights of women and girls;        (2) affirms the importance of ending the practice of female       genital mutilation/cutting globally for the safety and       security of women;        (3) calls upon the international community to increase       efforts to accelerate the elimination of female genital       mutilation/cutting; and        (4) urges the Department of State and the United States       Agency for International Development in their gender       programming to incorporate coordinated efforts to eliminate       female genital mutilation/cutting.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H. Res. 106, denouncing  female genital mutilation, or cutting.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in strong support of this resolution.   First, I want to thank my colleagues, Ms. Frankel and Mr. Perry, for  introducing this important bipartisan measure.   Every year, 3 million girls around the world are at risk of facing  female genital mutilation, or cutting, also known as FGMC. It is a  horrific practice that mutilates girls without their consent and can  lead to chronic, long-term health problems, and it can even be fatal.   Madam Speaker, the United States rightly considers female genital  mutilation, or cutting, a violation of women's rights. Here in the  United States, it is a Federal crime to perform this procedure on girls  under the age of 18, and many other countries have similar laws banning  the practice.   But despite a rising global awareness about the egregious nature of  FGMC, it is still a reality for millions of women around the world. It  is estimated that over 200 million women and girls today have been  subjected to this heinous mistreatment.   We need to speak out against this injustice. That is why I am pleased  to support H. Res. 106, a resolution that denounces female genital  mutilation, cutting, as a violation of the human rights of women and  girls and urges the international community and the Federal Government  to ramp up our efforts to eliminate this harmful practice.   We need to do everything we can to combat the systemic mistreatment  and injustice women face around the world. So I ask my colleagues to  join me in supporting this resolution to denounce FGMC.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel), the author of this resolution.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   We all agree that female genital mutilation, or cutting, is a  horrific form of child abuse and a violation of women's rights.   The resolution before us today is a signal to the rest of the world  that the United States Congress is paying attention to this issue; we  stand with the millions of women who are still being  [[Page H3978]]  subjected to this practice; and we will not stop fighting for their  right to dignity and respect.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res.  106, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
