 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a very simple  limitation amendment: No funds made available by this act may be used  to purchase heavy water from the Islamic Republic of Iran.   Why are we doing this?   If you remember, the JCPOA provided Iran with $150 billion in  sanctions relief, even had the appalling spectacle of planes hauling in  $1.7 billion in cold, hard cash, dropped off in Tehran. So this regime  has been flush with money as a result of the nuclear deal done during  the Obama administration.   One of the frustrating things about that was that, even after that  deal is enacted, even after all this money is flowing as a result of  the deal, the Obama administration--this was not even required by the  deal--sent millions of dollars to Iran in order to get heavy water. And  that was not required by the deal. That was a gratuitous transaction,  but it certainly provided more economic--an even greater economic  lifeline to Iran.   This is still, to this day, the world's leading state sponsor of  terrorism. They are fomenting discord all around the Middle East, in  Lebanon, in Syria. They fund Hamas in the Gaza Strip. They are  supporting the Houthis in Yemen. They have major control over portions  of Iraq, and the Shiite militias that they back are running rampant.   Remember, they were probably the leading source of U.S. servicemember  deaths in Iraq during the Iraq campaign. They funded Shiite militias.  They had their Quds Force from Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps on the  ground in Iraq; and certainly, hundreds of our servicemembers, some  estimates say as many as 1,500 servicemembers, were killed from some of  these Iranian proxies. They have never been held accountable for that.  [[Page H6506]]                                     time  1600    Now this administration came in saying the Iran deal was a bad deal.  They haven't left the deal. They haven't really done anything to fight  back against the deal, and I hope that will happen. But in the  meantime, I want to make sure that this administration is not repeating  the mistakes of the Obama administration. No more taxpayer dollars to  the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would just say, if you want money to go  to purchase heavy water from Iran, then obviously you should oppose the  amendment. But if you don't think that is a good idea, then it doesn't  hurt us to have this in here, given what has happened in the past.   I wish I had 100 percent confidence that we would not be repeating  mistakes. I hope that is where we go, but I have not yet seen the real  robust action to turn the tide away from a deal that has put Iran on  the path to a nuclear bomb. The danger with the deal was always less  that Iran would cheat on the deal. I think they probably are, but the  danger is they get a bomb by keeping the deal.   This is a major problem. This is one small area of this to protect  the taxpayer.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
