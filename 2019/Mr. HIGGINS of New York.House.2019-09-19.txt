 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I  demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the  ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a  quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, the American Society of Civil  Engineers estimates that, by 2025, the cost of addressing America's  infrastructure needs will reach $4.6 trillion. With Federal  transportation funded at $305 billion this year, we aren't even coming  close.   With each day that passes, the need grows. Safety is threatened;  opportunity is lost; and the cost of getting the job done only  increases.   According to the Federal highway data, in the Buffalo Niagara region  alone, 1 out of every 13 bridges is structurally deficient. Our roads  are crumbling; our water infrastructure is breaking; and our transit  systems are inadequate and outdated. The situation couldn't be more  urgent, and the opportunity couldn't be more obvious.   Numerous economic reports indicate investment in infrastructure  delivers real jobs and real growth in the American economy. It is time  to deliver on the substantial investment in infrastructure. There is a  great deal of work to be done, and there are Americans prepared to do  that work.                            ____________________
