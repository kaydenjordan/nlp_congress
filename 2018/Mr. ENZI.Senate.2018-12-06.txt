 Mr. President, this past weekend the news that George H.W.  Bush, our 41st President had died, quickly made its way across the  country and around the world.   Today, I would like to honor the late President George Herbert Walker  Bush. I appreciate having this opportunity to celebrate the life and  accomplishments of President Bush and to mourn him. His loss will be  deeply felt by all of us here in Congress, throughout the Nation, and  around the world. He is survived by his five children, including former  President George W. Bush, former Governor Jeb Bush, Neil, Marvin, and  Dorothy Bush, his 17 grandchildren, and 8 great-grandchildren.   Great thinkers, writers, and other speakers will take up their pens  and try to determine President Bush's place in history, and they will  debate his significance to the United States of America and his effect  on the world. For those of us who lived through his Presidency, who  experienced his time as our leader, those questions and debates are  unnecessary. His place in history has been determined not by what we  say now, but by his actions as President, his dignity as a person, and  his compassion for others. His dedication to service and humility  remained at the forefront, even as he filled the role as leader of the  free world.   I was serving in the Wyoming Legislature and did not work alongside  President Bush in Washington, but while I did not have the pleasure of  working with him personally, his career and his life speak to what a  remarkable man he was. He was a dedicated husband, father, and public  servant. He lived his life with honor and distinction, from enlisting  in the Navy at the age of 18 during World War II to serving in  Congress. He continued his tradition of public service in the executive  branch as an ambassador, Vice President, and finally as President. His  dedication to serving his country was exemplary.   As an ambassador and negotiator, he was a talented diplomat and  powerful champion for America's interests. As President, he worked  toward education reform and signed the Americans with Disabilities Act  into law, helping to ensure disabled Americans have opportunities  others take for granted.   He was a practical man who preferred prudence and what is real to the  abstract and ephemeral. It was this belief in practicality and prudence  that allowed him to handle some of the most challenging events in our  history with calm tenacity. His pragmatic nature allowed President Bush  to collaborate and befriend President Bill Clinton, once his political  adversary, to help lead the relief efforts to raise funds for the  victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami.   During his Presidency, the Cold War finally ended, the Iron Curtain  came down, and the people of Eastern Europe chose freedom. These events  left a singular super power amid a world free of major conflict, and he  aimed to lead the world into an era where the world would recognize its  ``shared responsibility for freedom and justice, a world where the  strong respect the rights of the weak.''   President Bush once listed the qualities he most cherished and among  them were: ``family, . . . love, decency, honor, pride, tolerance,  hope, kindness, loyalty, freedom, . . . faith, service to country,  [and] fair play . . .'' He and Barbara passed those values on to their  children and lived them in front of the country. In many different  ways, they nurtured the next generation of leaders whose contributions  have continued to enrich this Nation.   President Bush's faith helped him through many of the more trying  times in his life, through his daughter's death, through his time in  war, he was a man who had not one moment but many that helped him turn  to God on  [[Page S7353]]  his spiritual journey. He once said, ``I am guided by certain  traditions, one is that there's a God, and He is good and His love,  while free has a self-imposed cost: We must be good to one another.''  This sentiment is emblematic of his life. He served as many things:  father, husband, President, humanitarian, and fighter. His life is a  study of strong choices and bold strokes across the history of the  United States, all of them guided by the strongest fundamentals of  right and wrong. I am sure that he is joyous to be reunited with his  closest companion, Barbara, and their daughter Robin, in heaven.   While America is remembering a combat veteran, a President, and an  ambassador, his family will be remembering a husband and a father. My  wife Diana and I send our thoughts and deepest condolences to the  entire Bush family as we mourn the passing of a President. The passing  of a loved one, especially someone who has meant so much to so many,  has never and will never be an easy burden to bear.   How can I adequately speak about the life of a man who has had such a  long and distinguished career? By praising the accomplishments of a man  who never stopped working to make the world a better place, the man who  reached across the political aisle to foster friendships, and by saying  thank you.   Thank you for your service. Thank you for your leadership.   God bless you, and may you and your family find peace.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to  recognize a member of the Senate who will be retiring at this end of  this Congress, my colleague and friend, Senator Bob Corker. I have had  the pleasure of serving in the Senate alongside Bob for close to 11  years, and it has been a privilege to work and join with him on a  number of legislative efforts. Particularly, I am grateful for his  diligent fiscal conservatism on the Budget Committee. I will miss  working with him to address our Nation's fiscal issues.   Bob's path to the U.S. Senate began at the young age of 25, when he  founded his own construction company, which would eventually expand  operations in over 18 States. He continued to polish his business  acumen thereafter, acquiring two of the largest real estate companies  in Chattanooga in 1999. As a testament to his success in business, he  would later be inducted into the Entrepreneurship Hall of Fame at the  University of Tennessee Chattanooga. Bob carried his business-oriented  results-driven attitude with him when he ran for mayor in the scenic  city of Chattanooga, TN, at the turn of the millennium. As mayor, Bob  excelled, delivering to Chattanooga denizens a lean and balanced city  budget while also lowering the tax rate, among other noteworthy  accomplishments. Bob's path to Washington is one that we shared. I,  too, was a businessowner and a mayor before serving in the U.S. Senate.   Bob's commitment to public service didn't end in Chattanooga--far  from it. His career was just beginning to take off. In 2006, he won one  of the most competitive U.S. Senate races of the year. Incidentally,  that was the year I met Bob. My initial impressions of him still hold  true today: industrious and principled. Later, I would realize our  shared experiences as businessowners and as mayors uniquely shaped our  understanding of the proper role and scope of the Federal Government.  Bob quickly ascended in Washington, becoming chairman of the Foreign  Relations Committee and making a name for himself on the Banking  Committee. His reputation soon preceded him on a host of issue areas,  including housing finance reform and strategic diplomacy abroad. He  made his disagreements respectfully clear and stood up for what he  believed was right. Evidently, the people of Tennessee liked what they  saw and handily elected him to a second term.   Bob should be incredibly proud of his work and tenure as chairman of  Foreign Relations Committee. His breadth of experience on the committee  and visits to over 70 countries have provided his colleagues with  invaluable institutional insight on the impact American leadership and  diplomacy abroad continues to have on our economy and national  security. The Electrify Africa Act is a significant achievement of the  committee I would like to pay special homage to. The bill states it is  the policy of the United States to promote first-time power services  for at least 50 million people in sub-Saharan Africa by 2020. Having  traveled to Africa myself and witnessed firsthand the severe shortage  of electricity-generating infrastructure, I know that Bob's bill was a  noble one. He worked tirelessly on it before it was signed into law in  2015.   It is with these memories of his service that I watch him depart the  Senate. His bold presence and tested leadership will be profoundly  missed. The mark he has left on the institution will not be forgotten.  My wife Diana joins me in sending our very best wishes and gratitude to  Bob for his public service. We wish him all the best in his future  endeavors, and we are happy he will be able to spend more time with his  wife Elizabeth and his three children.   Bob, from one Sigma Chi alum to another, ``In Hoc Signo Vinces''. May  you continue to pursue a life of high ideals, noble purposes, and  strong character.   Happy trails.                            ____________________
