 I reserve the right to object.    Madam President, I agree with my colleagues Senator  Manchin, Senator Barrasso, and Senator Risch. We need energy  independence, whether it is West Virginia natural gas, Wyoming coal,  Ohio solar, or whatever you do in Idaho.    OK. It means stopping Russian uranium imports into the  United States. It means expanding our domestic enrichment capabilities.  We need to do both. It is a matter of national security. It is a matter  of economic security.   There are Ohioans doing important work with companies like Centrus  and Oklo in Piketon in Southern Ohio. In an industry like this, they  need the support to get off the ground and be successful--not far from  Senator Manchin's home State.   If we do this right, it will mean good jobs in the energy industry in  Appalachia, where union workers have powered our economy for  generations.   To do that, we have to pair these policies together: stopping Russian  imports and--and--investing in the domestic enrichment industry and all  the jobs and opportunities that come with it.   My question is--and I will then drop my objection, of course--to  ensure the action we take today is successful, Senator Barrasso and  Senator Manchin, do I have your commitment to work together to pass  real resources to strengthen our domestic supply chain?    Thank you.   With your leadership, we took an important step forward in the  National Defense Authorization Act we passed last night. I thank  Senator Risch for his work on that. We need to finish this job.   I want to see American companies--in Ohio--enriching uranium in the  United States, creating jobs, supporting communities like Piketon,  Waverly, Pike County, making our energy supply more secure.   I withdraw my objection.
