 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today to offer my first amendment to  H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act.   For the last several years, my constituents and neighboring  communities in North Carolina have dealt with contamination from the  PFAS chemical GenX. The company Chemours has been discharging this  chemical into the air as well as the waters of the Cape Fear River, a  common source of drinking water.   To put it simply, my constituents are scared. They are frustrated  because this has been an ongoing issue, and they don't have enough  information.   This is an issue that I have been working on for many years. I have  demanded action by EPA, and I had the EPA come to Fayetteville and hear  directly from our community.   At our community engagement event, hundreds of people attended, and  many shared their concerns with the potential links between GenX and  serious health problems.   I worked with our chairman to have an Energy and Commerce hearing,  and we invited Emily Donovan, a founding member of Clean Cape Fear in  North Carolina, to testify. Emily gave compelling testimony about her  personal experiences and the many people who have ``suffered from the  trauma of cancer treatments, benign tumors, and terminal diagnosis.''   I have talked with many of my constituents, including one whose  neighbor has cancer, and they don't know if it is connected to GenX.  They can't get information about it, and they are worried about their  own children.   This is about getting answers for our community. This is about making  sure  [[Page H130]]  my constituents are protected and the water we are drinking is safe.   Until I know the science behind GenX, until I know exactly what safe  levels and unsafe levels of exposure are, until we can adequately clean  up the exposure we have had in North Carolina, I am not going to be  satisfied.   I have a letter here from Secretary Michael Regan of the North  Carolina Department of Environmental Quality supporting this effort.   Madam Chair, I include that letter in the Record.                                                     north carolina                                           Environmental Quality,                                       Raleigh, NC, January 9, 2020.      Hon. Richard Hudson,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Hudson: As you know North Carolina has       been at the forefront in dealing with the issue of emerging       compounds. Because of the lack of guidance or action from the       current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA), our       state and others have taken the lead on the necessary       investigations, scientific evaluations, remediation and       enforcement actions for PFAS contamination caused by       government and industrial uses.        It is clear that members of Congress, on both sides of the       aisle, understand the urgent need to immediately address the       contamination from PFAS chemicals, especially in North       Carolina. The North Carolina Department of Environmental       Quality appreciates the leadership you and the state's       delegation are providing to advance the conversation       surrounding PFAS and GenX as we continue in our mission to       protect our state's water and air.        I look forward to continued dialogue with you and your       colleagues to encourage the U.S. EPA to move more quickly to       set PFAS health standards and protections. I hope that we can       count on you and the entire delegation to push for much-      needed resources and support to address current and future       contamination and remediation needs involving these forever       chemicals.            Sincerely,                                                  Michael S. Regan,                                          Secretary, North Carolina                               Department of Environmental Quality.     Madam Chair, while I understand it takes time to develop  the scientific evidence to make these decisions, my neighbors are tired  of waiting. We must act now.   My amendment adopts this commonsense approach and requires the EPA to  investigate methods and means to prevent contamination by GenX of  surface waters, including source waters used for drinking purposes.  This will enable us to find the best ways possible to safeguard our  waters both now and for future generations.   Madam Chair, I thank Chairman Pallone, Ranking Member Walden,  Chairman Tonko, Ranking Member Shimkus, and my good friend and  colleague Mr.   David Rouzer all for working with me on this, and I  urge the rest of my colleagues to support this amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1945     Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), the ranking member of the  committee.    Madam Chair, I have no further speakers. I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today to offer my second amendment to  H.R. 535, the PFAS Action Act of 2019.   As I have just described, the chemical GenX has been a major concern  for my constituents for years.   As I have already stated, my constituents are scared, and they don't  know what the long-term health effects of being exposed to these  chemicals will be.   Madam Chair, we cannot wait to begin the cleanup of drinking waters  that have been affected by these chemicals. While this bill is far from  perfect, I am encouraged that it does create a PFAS Infrastructure  Grant Program to provide assistance to community water systems affected  by PFAS.   My amendment would simply clarify that communities like mine that  have been impacted by GenX are eligible for grants under this section.  It would not affect the program in any way, other than providing  clarity and relief to the people of North Carolina.   I know that we still have a lot of work to do to solve the PFAS  issue. I am committed to working with all Members of Congress,  Republicans and Democrats, as well as State and local leaders to make  sure we are taking care of our communities. Everyone deserves clean  water.   Today, we are taking a positive step, and I look forward to  continuing to work on this issue. I would urge all of my colleagues to  support this amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I just want to say thank you to Chairman  Tonko for working with me on this very important issue.   Again, folks back home in North Carolina are very concerned, to put  it mildly. And so to give them a little bit of clarity, a little bit of  certainty that GenX is covered means a lot to folks back home, so I  appreciate the gentleman working with me on this.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
