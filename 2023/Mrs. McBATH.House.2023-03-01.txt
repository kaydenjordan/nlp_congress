 Madam Speaker, today I rise to commemorate a monumental  milestone in the career of Mr. Eugene Harmond as part of our Black  History Month celebrations. Mr. Harmond will soon celebrate 50 years of  flight service with Delta Airlines.   Eugene Harmond was the first African-American male flight attendant  hired by Delta Airlines in 1973 at a time when there were very few male  flight attendants and even fewer men of color in the industry.   I served as a flight attendant for Delta Airlines for 30 years, and I  would convey my profound gratitude and respect to Mr. Harmond as he  marks 50 years of flight service this year.   Our commitment to kindness, caring, and safety instilled towards all  those we serve always stays with you. I am honored to have Mr. Harmond,  his wife, Loreine, and their daughter, Lokie in the House Gallery  today.   From a former flight attendant and on behalf of the thousands of  Americans you have served, congratulations and thank you.
