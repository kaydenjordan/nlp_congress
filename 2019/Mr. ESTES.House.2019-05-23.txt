 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the SECURE Act.  It is an overall good policy that will encourage Americans to save for  retirement.   I am pleased that this bill makes it easier for small businesses to  join together and offer retirement plans for more Americans. It allows  graduate students and home healthcare workers to save more for  retirement.   It includes a policy change to help Gold Star families. It also  includes a fix to the taxation of children's unearned income that will  support American Indian Tribal youth and encourage them to pursue a  college education, similar to the legislation that I helped introduce  with my colleague from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).   Finally, this bill will allow 529 plans to be used to pay for student  loans and apprenticeship programs.   As a former State treasurer of Kansas, I oversaw a 529 plan and  understand the importance of expanding these plans for our families.  That is why I am disappointed that the manager's amendment removed good  policy from this legislation that would have allowed 529 plans to help  be used for expenses for K-12 education and to help special needs  children.   Earlier this year, my Republican colleagues and I on the Ways and  Means Committee entered good faith negotiations with Chairman Neal and  our Democratic colleagues to craft this bill. As a result, Republicans  and Democrats on the committee unanimously voted for the SECURE Act in  April.   However, since that time, the other side of the aisle played politics  with this legislation when it was before the Rules Committee and  removed those additional 529 provisions that were originally included  to help special needs students. So, while I support today's bill and  the policies that are still included, I sincerely hope that, moving  forward, we can stop playing politics with good pieces of legislation  and work in a bipartisan manner and negotiate in good faith to produce  legislation that will help the American people.
