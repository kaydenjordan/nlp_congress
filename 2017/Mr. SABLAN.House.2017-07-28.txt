 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Amendment in the  Nature of a Substitute to S. 114 that provides for a 6-month extension  of the Choice program, as well as funding for VA recruitment and  retention programs.   Extension of the Choice program is good news for veterans in my  district. The Northern Marianas is the only jurisdiction in our country  that does not have a VA medical clinic and does not have a single,  dedicated VA doctor or mental health professional. There is one  physician contracted by the VA on a part-time basis. But she is at  capacity and cannot take on any more veteran patients.   So, it is the Choice program that allows the veterans I represent to  obtain health care, where they live, rather than having to fly hundreds  or thousands of miles, to Guam or to Hawai'i, for treatment.   It was to ease that burden that I was one of the Members who  identified and spoke up about the problem of access to service for  veterans in remote and rural areas of America; and advocacy by Members  from underserved areas helped lead to the creation of Choice.   Make no mistake, the Choice program does not solve all of the issues  of health care access that trouble Marianas veterans. A VA health  clinic with VA staff in the Marianas remains my goal. But S. 114--short  of a full-fledged clinic--does provide recruitment and retention  authorities that could lead to having more VA staff in my district.  That would be step in the right direction.   Meanwhile, and until we have a real, full-time, fully staffed and  equipped VA clinic in the Northern Marianas, the Choice program will  continue to be needed to fill the gap and provide the care that  veterans deserve.   My thanks to Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz and to their staff  for the time and effort that has gone into ensuring that Choice can  continue for veterans in the Marianas--and in rural, remote, and  underserved areas throughout America.   I am also grateful to the many veteran service organizations, who  have advised on this legislation and who have been steadfast in their  commitment to improve the Department of Veterans' Affairs for those who  served our Nation.                                time  1100    The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 480, the previous question is ordered on  the bill, as amended.   The question is on the third reading of the bill.
