 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 299, the  Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act.   Mr. Speaker, I witnessed firsthand the scope of Agent Orange exposure  experienced by our servicemen and -women while in Vietnam. I am one of  that group of veterans.   Congress recognized the dangerous health consequences of exposure by  passing the Agent Orange Act of 1991, which extended disability  compensation to veterans who served in Vietnam or its inland waterways  between the years of 1962 and 1975. While the Agent Orange Act provided  benefits for tens of thousands of Vietnam mainland veterans, it  overlooked the blue water Navy veterans who served on the ships off of  the coast.   Those dedicated veterans served our country honorably and are now  dealing with health problems due to Agent Orange exposure. This is why  I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 299, which extends the disability  benefits to veterans who served in the blue water Navy in Vietnam.   Mr. Speaker, veterans in Michigan's First District have greatly  sacrificed and earned these benefits, and I look forward to ensuring  that their service is honored.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill.  [[Page H5617]]
