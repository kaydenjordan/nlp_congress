 Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Committee on  Armed Services, it is our privilege to pay tribute to Jennifer  Dougherty as she prepares to leave her position as a detailee for the  Senate Committee on Armed Services and return to her position as a  Senior Analyst for the Government Accountability Office.   For the past 12 months, Ms. Dougherty has assisted the committee and  its members with high-priority work on contracting reform in the  National Defense Authorization Act for 2020 and overseeing  implementation of previously enacted acquisition reforms. Her  contributions to our committee's work have been significant and highly  valued by our members and staff.   On behalf of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, I thank Ms.  Dougherty and wish her future success as she continues to support the  U.S. Government.                            ____________________
