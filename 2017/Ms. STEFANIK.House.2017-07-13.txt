 Mr. Chairman, today I rise in opposition to Mr. Perry's  amendment which would strike language that requires the Department of  Defense to compile a report on the vulnerabilities of military  installations and combatant commander requirements resulting from  climate change. As we heard earlier today, this language passed by  voice vote on a bipartisan basis during our markup in committee.   Increased maritime access to the Arctic, rising sea levels,  desertification, increases in natural disasters, damage to existing  infrastructure, and other effects of climate change are drivers of  geopolitical instability and degrade the security of the United States.   We would be remiss in our efforts to protect our national security if  we do not fully account for the risk climate change poses to our bases,  our readiness, and to the fulfillment of our Armed Forces mission.   This is about a report. Let's get the information. This is why I  believe we have bipartisan support within the committee. We must  incorporate environmental factors in our threat assessments and  contingency planning to ensure the long-term operational viability of  our missions and the safety of our men and women in uniform.
