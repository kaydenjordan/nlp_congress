Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 4285.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 4285, and I thank Mr. Brindisi for  sponsoring this important bill which authorizes the continued  operations of programs and offices vital to addressing the needs of the  veterans we serve.   Mr. Speaker, this bill authorizes the continued operation of the  Manila, Philippines, regional benefits office, the only VA regional  benefits office, or VARO, operating in a foreign country, and I plan to  visit that facility this year.   In addition to administering disability and survivor benefits to over  16,000 veterans, their dependents, and survivors, the Manila RO  administers healthcare benefits, as well.   I urge support for continued operation of this key VA regional office  serving veterans and their families in the Philippines.   This bill also extends the VA Vendee Loan Program, which allows VA to  sell foreclosed properties to the general public, instead of continuing  to own foreclosed properties it cannot use. Our committee is working  hard to ensure we can increase economic opportunities for veterans and  their families so that no bank will have to foreclose on a veteran's  home and place that veteran and his or her family at risk of  homelessness.   That is why this bill also includes a bipartisan agreement to extend  the Supportive Services for Veteran Families Program for 2 years. This  critical program assists homeless veterans and their families, and  those most at risk of becoming homeless. In southern California,  veterans experience some of the highest rates of homelessness in the  country.   In the Inland Empire rents continue to rise. Geographic barriers make  it challenging for veterans to access services that prevent  homelessness. And the recent $9 billion cut to HUD housing assistance  programs is making the homelessness crisis worse generally. That is why  extending the operation of this vital program is so important.   In recent weeks, our Economic Opportunity Subcommittee, led by  Chairman   Mike Levin and Ranking Member Gus Bilirakis, held two  bipartisan field hearings that are helping this committee to identify  solutions to address veteran homelessness.   We have much work to do in understanding the definition of  homelessness, getting true population counts, preventing homelessness,  and working to respond to homelessness after disasters.   During the field hearing in San Diego, we heard prevention was about  one-tenth of the cost of crisis intervention.   The SSVF program, which awards grants to nonprofit organizations,  provides supportive services to very low-income veterans and their  families to assist homeless veterans in moving into permanent housing  and veterans in housing who are at risk of becoming homeless. These  grants help organizations provide case management, outreach, and help  veterans obtain VA healthcare and disability benefits.   These grant recipients also help with child care assistance,  transportation, housing counseling services, legal services, and  financial planning for veterans and their families.   I urge each of my colleagues to support this vital program so that no  veteran is forced to live on the street.   Mr. Speaker, September is National Suicide Prevention and Awareness  Month. Tragically, 20 veterans take their lives each day. Despite  Congress' and VA's efforts to address veteran suicide, the rate remains  unchanged. This year, we have also seen multiple veteran suicides on VA  campuses. For these reasons, I have made addressing veteran suicide the  top policy priority of this committee.   Earlier this month, I called on VA to conduct a 15-day nationwide  stand-down in response to a VA inspector general investigation into a  veteran suicide at the West Palm Beach VA Medical Center. The IG report  exposed weaknesses in procedures, staff training, and installation of  monitoring equipment in the inpatient mental health clinic.   Three-quarters of veterans who commit suicide are not receiving  treatment at VA hospitals and clinics. As Congress and VA chart a  strategy to reach these veterans not receiving VA care, veterans and  the public must be assured that VA's own mental health clinics are  adequately and appropriately staffed. Each unit must have up-to-date  monitoring equipment. All VA staff must undergo appropriate training.  And each mental health unit must be routinely inspected.   While I am disappointed the VA secretary has resisted my call for a  nationwide stand-down, I appreciate that VA is taking actions that meet  the spirit of my request. VA must make every effort to provide the  highest quality treatment for the veterans and their care, especially  veterans in crisis who come to VA for help.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4285 extends a program that provides transportation  for veterans living in highly rural areas to vet centers for counseling  and other mental health and social services.   For veterans in need of mental healthcare who may be uncomfortable  entering medical facilities, vet centers  [[Page H7731]]  serve as a community and counseling center. For some veterans, these  vet centers are a lifeline.   Yesterday, Congressman Rose and I visited the vet center in Staten  Island, New York. We both learned about the support, counseling,  connection to other VA services, and the sense of community the Staten  Island vet center creates with the veterans who visit there.                                time  1645    We also learned that transportation, including a $15 toll, can make  it difficult for veterans in New York City to access vet centers and VA  facilities. Our committee is going to look into a solution to address  this.   Likewise, veterans in highly rural areas tell us distance and  transportation are also obstacles to participating in counseling and  mental health treatment at vet centers. Therefore, Congress has been  authorizing a pilot program since 2012 that pays travel expenses for  veterans attending counseling at vet centers in Bangor, Maine;  Kalispell, Montana; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Spokane, Washington.   Mr. Speaker, suicide is preventable. Veterans who are thinking about  suicide are not alone. If my colleagues have veterans in their district  who are thinking about suicide, please urge them to call the Veterans  Crisis Line at 1-800-273-8255 and press 1. They can also text 741741.   Mr. Speaker, let me repeat this very important number again. The  Veterans Crisis Line is 1-800-273-8255, and veterans are asked to press  1. Veterans can also text 741741.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank Mr. Brindisi, a  member of our Economic Opportunity and Health Subcommittees, for  bringing this bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Levin), the chairman of the Economic Opportunity  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Brindisi), who serves on our Economic Opportunity and Health  Subcommittees and who also is the author of H.R. 4285.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and Veterans' Affairs Committee  Ranking Member Phil Roe for mentioning the tremendous strides the VA  and this Nation have made toward reducing veteran homelessness.   It is true that Secretary Shinseki's goal of ending veteran  homelessness did not occur by the designated year, 2016. But even in  the State of California, where we are still experiencing several  pockets of veteran homelessness, in Riverside County, the county I  represent in Congress, this county has achieved functional zero. This  does not mean that there are zero homeless veterans, but what it does  mean is that when homeless veterans are identified, their homelessness  is brief and nonrecurring. That is the definition of functional zero.   I want to commend, again, the officials at the Riverside County VA  and the Loma Linda VA for the incredible work they have done to achieve  functional zero. I hope that they will be able to share their insights  with other counties in my State and across the Nation that are looking  to do the same.   What I do know is that functional zero will not remain functional  zero without concerted and intentional effort to be vigilant. We need  to be vigilant in areas where we have reduced homelessness to  functional zero, and we also need to ensure that we continue to address  the challenges in Los Angeles, Orange County, and San Diego County  where homelessness among our veterans persists.   Mr. Speaker, I am very proud and pleased to support this package of  extensions of programs--among them, programs that will address veteran  homelessness.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing this very important  legislation, H.R. 4285, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
