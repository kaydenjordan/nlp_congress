 Madam President, yesterday the Senate took up legislation  to block the stream buffer rule, which is a job-killing regulation from  the Obama administration--something the Obama administration will be  long remembered for--a regulatory overreach that strangled the growth  of our economy and the jobs that come along with it. This is a prime  example of a misnomer, though. It is not really about protecting  streams, as it claims, but about killing the coal industry and energy  production in our country.   One of the things that have caused our economy to grow historically  has been access to low-cost energy, but unfortunately this regulation  has made that not possible in coal country, taking many jobs along with  it and I think in part, at least, responsible for the vote President  Trump got in many parts of the country that felt left behind by the  economy and because of job-killing regulations like the stream buffer  rule.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch    Madam President, yesterday I had the chance to meet with Judge  Gorsuch personally, the man President Trump nominated to serve on the  U.S. Supreme Court.   It is plain to me now why President Trump selected him to be the  nominee for the seat vacated by the death of Justice Scalia. Judge  Gorsuch's experience, intellect, and background make him uniquely  qualified and qualify him as a mainstream nominee. That seems to be the  nomenclature that has been embraced by our colleagues across the aisle.  They said they hope President Trump nominates a mainstream nominee.  Well, he did. But I fully expect our colleagues across the aisle to try  to paint him as some sort of extremist, which they can't do based upon  his distinguished record on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals for the  last 10 years as a Federal judge or his previous life. They are going  to have to make things up in order to cause people to believe this  nominee is not a mainstream nominee.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Judiciary  Committee to do our job of advice and consent and to see the nomination  come to the floor, where I hope he will be confirmed. I trust he will  be confirmed one way or the other.   Unfortunately, Senate Democrats--particularly their leader, the  Senator from New York--have already announced that they will fight  tooth and  [[Page S616]]  nail against any nominee put forward by President Trump. Predictably,  the minority leader has made clear that he will try to filibuster the  President's choice. It has been ironic to watch him come here and extol  the virtues of the 60-vote cloture requirement for confirming a Supreme  Court Justice when he and the rest of his colleagues invoked the so- called nuclear option to change the Senate rules by breaking those  rules and reducing the cloture requirement for lower Federal court  judges and Cabinet members to 51.    We see what happened as a result of that action. Now they find  themselves on the receiving end of that 51-vote requirement caused by  the nuclear option. So much for immediate gratification and not so much  for taking the long view in terms of how the Senate ought to operate.   This sort of resistance mentality that has grown up among our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle ignores the fact that we had  an election on November 8. The American people made their choice, and  it is plain that our Democratic colleagues are simply not happy about  the choice they made and are going to undermine and resist this  President no matter what, particularly when it comes to staffing his  Cabinet with the people he has chosen to serve the Nation as part of  his administration.   The American people also indicated they wanted us to move forward,  away from the bickering, away from the gridlock, away from this  mentality that we were here to serve someone else other than the  American people. They want results, not politics as usual. I think that  is the lesson we all should have learned from this last election. The  sad reality is that it is increasingly clear to me that my Democratic  colleagues didn't learn the right lesson last November and are trying  to bring the Chamber to a standstill.   Thanks to the nuclear option that then-Majority Leader Senator Reid  championed and which all of our Democratic friends voted for, they are  not going to be able to stop President Trump's nominees to the Cabinet  because all it requires is 51 votes. Yes, they can slow it down, but  they can't stop it. My question is, What purpose is to be served from  keeping the President fully staffed with the Cabinet that he has  chosen, knowing that you are ultimately going to lose the fight?   Unfortunately, this is not about the Senate alone. This is about the  American people. For 2 days in a row, Senate Democrats on the Finance  Committee, which has been one of the most bipartisan committees in the  U.S. Senate--our Democratic colleagues, each and every one of them,  boycotted the meetings to consider President Trump's nominees.   I sit on the Finance Committee. As I said, it has historically been a  bipartisan committee, but our Democratic colleagues chose to relinquish  their responsibility and ignore their duties to their constituents.  Unfortunately, this type of behavior has become par for the course  throughout the first days of President Trump's administration. We have  seen other examples of slow-walking nominations, invoking every  procedural rule that there is to deny unanimous consent--the sort of  normal courtesies that go along with working in the Senate on technical  or procedural matters.   We have seen countless examples of their slowing down the nomination  process intentionally, even for highly qualified candidates.   On the Judiciary Committee, on which I also sit, there is another  example with respect to the nomination for Attorney General of Senator  Jeff Sessions, a well-respected colleague in this Chamber. I am glad we  were finally able to move his nomination out of the committee  yesterday. But the truth is that even though many Democrats on the  committee had worked side by side with Senator Sessions and had  cosponsored legislation with him, they themselves said what a good man  he was. They voted against him after slowing down this obvious choice  to lead the Justice Department.   President Trump talks about draining the swamp in Washington, DC. The  biggest swamp in Washington, DC, has been a Justice Department headed  by Eric Holder and, sadly, by his successor Loretta Lynch. They have  refused to enforce the rule of law and instead turned that into a  political outpost for the Obama administration. Attorney General Jeff  Sessions is going to change that. He is going to enforce the law, and  he will respect the law no matter who wins and who loses because his  duty is to the Constitution and laws of the United States and to  enforce those laws as Attorney General and, yes, to defend those laws.   Some of our Senate colleagues were shocked when Deputy Attorney  General Sally Yates--although the Office of Legal Counsel said that the  Executive order issued by the President was legal and proper in its  form--wrote a letter saying she was instructing the line lawyers in the  Justice Department not to defend it in court. President Trump fired  her, and he should have. That is political grandstanding by somebody  who should know better, considering her distinguished career at the  Department of Justice for the last 30 years.   I don't know who gave her the bad advice, but I am glad that  President Trump decided to fire someone who basically defied their  duties to the Department of Justice and to the U.S. Government and  preferred to take the side of politics and misinformation.   We know that the Senate is continuing with other nominations as well.  I see this morning that the Environment and Public Works Committee  finally voted out the nomination of the attorney general of Oklahoma,  Scott Pruitt, for Director of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues' bad habits on the Finance  Committee have spilled over to the Environment and Public Works  Committee, and they chose to boycott that hearing as well.  Notwithstanding that boycott, the majority of the committee did vote  out the nomination, and we will take that up soon.   This lack of cooperation is unprecedented. It really is  unprecedented. At this point in 2009, President Obama had 11 of his  Cabinet members confirmed by the Senate--11. Today we have only five  confirmed, and many of those who have been confirmed were slow-walked  by our Democratic colleagues for one lame excuse or another. This is  not because President Trump's nominees aren't qualified; it is because  our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are determined to  undermine this new President and his administration, no matter what  cost is paid by the country.   After the election, President Obama, to his credit, talked about the  importance of a peaceful transition of power from one administration to  the next. Some of our colleagues who are now obstructing this  President's Cabinet members have also paid lipservice to a peaceful  transition of power. What we are seeing is a hostile transition of  power--mindless obstruction, foot dragging, and delay for delay's sake.   Let me remind them once again that the American people voted on  November 8 and chose a President who has the authority to nominate the  people he sees fit to serve on his Cabinet. We can't afford to let this  administration operate with one hand tied behind its back for the  foreseeable future. We need to do our job and provide the President and  the country with the experts and advisers that the administration needs  to keep our country safe and to keep government functioning for the  people.   I hope soon--I am not optimistic, but I hope that soon our Senate  Democrats will start working with us and not against us and, more  importantly, against the interests of the American people who sent them  here.                           Tribute to Linda Bazaco    Madam President, I want to spend a few minutes recognizing an  extraordinary public servant on my staff who served in a unique  capacity that many may not know exists.   One of the most important things we get to do as Members of Congress  is to act as the intermediary or intercessor between our constituents  and a Federal Government that sometimes is not responsive, particularly  in dealing with Federal agencies. For instance, when somebody isn't  receiving their proper check from the Social Security Administration or  is having trouble getting an appointment at a Veterans Administration  clinic or is in need of assistance with foreign adoptions, where do  they turn? They turn to people like Linda Bazaco, who heads my casework  program in Dallas, TX, and is going to be retiring soon.  [[Page S617]]    I am proud to say that we do our very best to make sure that the 28  million people I have the privilege of representing get the very best  help possible to help navigate the very real and very personal issues  that involve the Federal bureaucracy. That way, my office--specifically  my constituent services or what we call my casework team--can help  ensure that no Texan who reaches out to us slips between the cracks.   In some circles, apparently, we have a reputation for bragging in  Texas, but I have to say my staff are some of the absolutely best in  the field when it comes to getting responses for Texans from Federal  agencies. I like to say that if it can be done, it will be done. In  that way, we play an important role in holding the bureaucracy  accountable and reminding the Federal Government who their customer  really is. It is the taxpayers to whom they ought to be responsive.  They shouldn't need to call their Senator or their Congressman or  Congresswoman in order to get responses from the Federal Government,  but, in fact, sometimes they do, and sometimes--well, it is our  privilege to help.   As I indicated, the person who has led this effort in my office for  the last many years is Linda Bazaco, someone whom I came to know after  she worked for my predecessor, Senator Phil Gramm. Linda fervently  believes in the concept of government accountability and has developed  a way to get the answers that Texans need and deserve.   As I indicated, she started under my predecessor, Senator Phil Gramm,  about 27 years ago. Today, Linda's system has become the gold standard  for other elected officials to get results on behalf of their  constituents and, in doing so, has impacted constituents' lives in  profound ways: benefits, checks, expedited passports, medical care, or  even the most basic--simply a return phone call from an agency. All the  while, Linda has done this with enthusiasm and with an eye toward  quality and getting results for the people of Texas.   Linda, along with the team she has built, has pushed the government  to be more accountable and responsive to the tens of thousands of  Texans who have reached out to my office and, in most cases, will never  know she was their secret weapon.   Soon Linda will be taking on another challenge. After serving the 28  million people of Texas for nearly 27 years now, she will take up an  even more important role; that is, a full-time grandmother  extraordinaire. I couldn't be prouder of having someone of her caliber  as a leader on my team, and I wish her and her husband Val and her  three children and her five beautiful grandchildren the absolute best  in the next chapter of their lives.   On behalf of all the generations of Texans you have helped over the  decades, the staff members you have led along the way, and at least two  U.S. Senators, Linda, thank you for your service.
