 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a young  woman in my district who has become an inspiration to women and  athletes everywhere.   Erin Kerkhoff, a University of Northern Iowa sophomore and track star  from Solon High School, earned a position on Team USA for the  Paralympics in Tokyo.   Kerkhoff, who has 20/400 vision due to optic nerve degeneration in  both eyes is ranked fifth in the world in the 400-meter dash after  achieving a personal record of 58.23 seconds in the qualifying trials  earlier this month, finishing second overall in both the 400- and 100- meter dashes.   The Second District and the State of Iowa are lucky to be represented  by stellar athletes like Erin, Thomas Gilman, and Kenny Bednarek  competing in this year's summer Olympics.   I could not be prouder to represent these three in Congress. Good  luck Erin, Thomas, and Kenny, and bring home the gold.   Last week, I wished my sister Mari-Eleanor Martino a happy birthday,  and this week I would like to extend a happy birthday to her husband,  Ralph Martino. Happy birthday, Ralph, and we are delighted to have you  in the family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Natural  Resources Committee, and I thank Representative Westerman for yielding  me time to speak.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill, H.R. 4300,  the Alexander Lofgren Veterans in Parks Act. I was so proud to  introduce this overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation with a fellow  veteran, Congressman Gallego.   Our commonsense legislation would give our servicemembers, veterans,  and Gold Star families free passes to all of our beautiful national  parks and Federal lands for life. This is a reasonable piece of  legislation that will support those who sacrifice so much for our  liberties.   Our Nation is blessed to have some of the most beautiful national  parks and public lands. Each year, millions of Americans access the  more than 2,000 Federal recreation areas, including national parks,  national forests, and wildlife refuges. This includes some of the  Nation's most iconic national treasures, from Acadia National Park in  Maine and the Dry Tortugas in Florida to the Redwood National and State  Parks forest in California and the Gates of the Arctic in Alaska.   In 2020, the America the Beautiful annual pass became free for  veterans and Gold Star families. However, this change for veterans has  never been put into law and could be undone in future years.   My bill protects these veteran passes by codifying them into law and  making them lifetime passes instead of annual passes that would have to  be re-sent every year. Making these passes lifetime instead of annual  also makes the job of the Park Service easier and ensures our veterans  have full access to the benefits they so richly deserve.   Finally, my legislation also creates annual passes for current  servicemembers, which can be converted into lifetime passes once they  retire.   From sea to shining sea, we are a Nation of incredible beauty and  biodiversity. Congress recognizes the mental and physical health  benefits of outdoor recreation for current servicemembers and veterans.  In fact, I think at our hearing, there was not a dry eye when Captain  John Paluska spoke on behalf of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, as a 24-year Army veteran, I understand the sacrifices  made by our military and their loved ones and believe that we must do  whatever we can to honor these VIPs. My bill provides these Americans  with free access to the land they have sacrificed to defend.   Our national parks are there for all of us. Getting outside into  nature and enjoying our beautiful country provides an outlet and escape  with mental and physical benefits. No one is more worthy of  experiencing open access to these incredible places than the men and  women who have fought to keep us free and the families who have made  the ultimate sacrifice.   Unfortunately, it is all too easy to pay lip service to the  military's sacrifice but then not follow through with action to  recognize their service. We can never fully repay our veterans for  their service and their sacrifice, but we want to show our gratitude by  giving them lifetime access to America's most beautiful landscapes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join in supporting my commonsense  bill, H.R. 4300, the Alexander Lofgren Veterans in Parks Act.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding me  time to speak.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of Senator John  Kennedy's Dispose of Unused Medications and Prescription Opioids Act,  S. 957, or the DUMP Opioids Act.   Earlier this year, President Trump signed the Johnny Isakson and  David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act  into law. Under this law, the VA is required to set up prescription  drop boxes on VA campuses so that veterans can safely dispose of unused  and excess controlled substance medications. The DUMP Opioids Act  directs the Secretary of the VA to designate periods during which  anyone, not just veterans, may dispose of unused medications at VA  facilities.   In April, I partnered with Congressman   David Trone to introduce the  House companion to Senator Kennedy's bill, and I am proud to see this  bill before the House today.   As a doctor, I have seen firsthand the challenges created by opioid  addiction and abuse. The opioid epidemic has hit every corner of the  United States, and all of us know someone who has been harmed by  addiction.   The DUMP Opioids Act is a simple expansion of current law that will  give more Americans access to safe opioid disposal sites. Congress must  work in a bipartisan manner and give our constituents the tools they  need to tackle this head-on.   America has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic for years,  especially over this past year during the pandemic, as illustrated by  my colleague from Illinois. Iowa is no exception.   With opioid-related deaths up 35 percent in Iowa over the last year,  we need to be more focused than ever on our efforts to both treat and  prevent addiction. As a physician, I am proud to do my part to help  combat this crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Senator Kennedy for his work with this bill, and  I urge all of my colleagues to support S. 957, the DUMP Opioids Act.
