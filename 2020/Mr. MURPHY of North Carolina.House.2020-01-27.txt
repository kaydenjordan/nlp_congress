 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor  Corporal Scott McDonell, an exemplary marine stationed in my district  at Camp Lejeune.   In the early hours of January 11, 2020, Corporal McDonell heroically  pulled three people from a burning car in Wilmington, North Carolina.  After he saved their lives, he stayed with the injured passengers for  several hours at the hospital. Even though he had never met them, he  felt it was his duty to ensure their safety and well-being.   Even while off duty, Corporal McDonell remained faithful to the  people he serves by running into harm's way and risking his own life to  not only save their lives, but also to provide comfort after a  traumatic event.   Corporal McDonell's actions on that day embody the Marine Corps'  motto, Semper Fidelis, or Semper Fi, which is Latin for ``always  faithful.''   It is such an honor to represent nearly one-third of all active-duty  marines, who, like Corporal McDonell, are always faithful to their  fellow marines, communities, and our Constitution.                            ____________________
