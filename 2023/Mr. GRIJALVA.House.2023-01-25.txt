 Mr. Speaker, since Speaker McCarthy won't tell us what  he had to give extremist Republicans in his caucus in a backroom deal  for power, we can only assume that they agreed to tank the economy and  destroy millions of jobs unless Congress slashes Social Security.   Raising the debt ceiling is a routine matter of business that has  been passed cleanly by Republican Presidents, including Trump, and  Democratic Presidents alike.   If Republican lawmakers default, the shock will plunge the world into  a recession and a financial crisis.   Let's not forget that 65 million Americans are on Social Security.   This debate is clear. Speaker McCarthy made a deal with the devil in  exchange for the power to hold our economy hostage and push through  extremist Republican proposals, such as Senator Rick Scott's plan to  sunset Social Security.   We can't allow it to happen. Tell us what to aim to cut and save  Social Security.                            ____________________
