 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Antonio  ``Tony'' Rangel, a longtime veteran from the city of Placentia, who is  now the namesake of American Legion Post 277.   Mr. Rangel served in the United States Army during the Korean war and  has spent more than half of his life as a member of the American  Legion.   Mr. Rangel has not only served our Nation, but also has long been a  pillar of our Placentia community. He was named Placentia Citizen of  the Year in 1989 and continues to live up to that title each and every  day.   It is only fitting that the Post 277 building is officially the  Antonio ``Tony'' Rangel Hall.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Rangel for his service to our country and to  California's 39th Congressional District.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memory of  Congressman Jerry Lewis, the longest-serving House Republican in  California history.   Throughout his 17 terms in Congress, Congressman Lewis stood as an  steadfast example of civic service.   Congressman Lewis knew how to work across the aisle and get things  done for his community, our state and the nation.   He was known to all as down to earth and remarkably kind. When  someone addressed him as `Congressman Lewis,' he would always reply  with a smile--``My friends call me Jerry. You're my friend, so please  call me Jerry.''   Jerry loved his hometown of San Bernardino and was loved back by the  community.   His legacy of hard work, dedication to conservative values, humor and  kindness will not be forgotten.   I hope you will all join me in keeping his family in your prayers  during this time.                            ____________________
