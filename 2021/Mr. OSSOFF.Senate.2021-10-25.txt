 Madam President, I rise to commend Josh Baker, a British  national, on behalf of the U.S. Senate, for his vital and lifesaving  contributions to the allied evacuation of Afghanistan.   Mr. Baker, of course, is internationally acclaimed for his courageous  and award-winning work documenting armed conflict and war crimes  worldwide. His sacrifices in the production of vital, world-class  journalism included the sacrifice of his own body, when his spine was  fractured by a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device detonated by a  suicide bomber in Iraq while Baker was on assignment for PBS.   Mr. Baker's achievements include the production of landmark reports  exposing ISIS war crimes against Yazidi women and girls, investigations  of international terrorism, and vital reporting on refugee crises. His  work has documented for the historical record and for the education of  the global public the brutality and indignity imposed on innocent human  beings by armed conflict.   When, on August 15, 2021, the Afghan capital of Kabul fell to Taliban  forces, hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals and Afghan allies  were trapped in harm's way. Mr. Baker sprung into action. In August and  September of this year, Mr. Baker remotely coordinated and supported  multiple lifesaving extractions of vulnerable civilians from  Afghanistan.   He applied his deep experience of complex operations in hostile  environments and the trust built over years of communication with  journalists, sources, and contributors in the military, intelligence,  and political domains, in civil society and at humanitarian agencies,  to remotely coordinate and support multiple lifesaving extractions of  vulnerable civilians from Afghanistan.   Mr. Baker's contributions to these historic evacuation efforts  included the coordination of a lifesaving mission to rescue Afghan  orphans and the coordination of logistics necessary for the safe  evacuation of hundreds of Afghan women and girls.   And so let the U.S. Senate commend Josh Baker for his vital and  lifesaving contributions to the allied evacuation of Afghanistan.                            ____________________
