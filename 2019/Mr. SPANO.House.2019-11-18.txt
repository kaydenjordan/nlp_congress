 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the House will consider another  temporary funding measure, this time kicking the can down the road  until December 20. We are nearly 2 months into the fiscal year, and not  a single full-year appropriations bill has been completed. Continuing  resolutions are not the way that we should operate.   Priorities shift from year to year, and the longer a CR lasts, the  more it hurts our military, our ports, and our infrastructure  investment. I have seen no evidence that we are any closer to passing  any full-year bills than at the end of September when we passed the  last CR.   You will hear my colleagues across the aisle blame this on Senate  Republicans, however, the House majority appropriations bills were  filled with poison pills that they continue to insist upon, such as  preventing the use of funds for the border wall. And now the entire  past month has been devoted to their sham impeachment efforts.   I urge my colleagues, put the partisan investigations to the side so  that we can come to a bipartisan agreement to fund the government in a  responsible way.                            ____________________
