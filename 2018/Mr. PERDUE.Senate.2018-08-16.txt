 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of  Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States. One of  the great privileges we have in the U.S. Senate is the responsibility  of confirming nominees a President puts forward for this awesome  lifetime responsibility on the U.S. Supreme Court.   Likewise, nominating Justices to the Supreme Court is one of the most  important responsibilities the Constitution bestows upon the President  of the United States. President Trump knows this, obviously, and has  clearly taken this charge very seriously.   Last year, President Trump made an outstanding choice in nominating  Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court. I remember the debate on  this floor, and I am delighted with his performance since he has been  on the U.S. Supreme Court. President Trump has again put forward an  impressive nominee in Judge Brett Kavanaugh for this awesome  responsibility on the U.S. Supreme Court.   A former clerk for Justice Anthony Kennedy, Judge Kavanaugh is an  accomplished, experienced jurist with over 300 published opinions. More  than 50 circuit court opinions cite one of his concurrences or  dissents, and the Supreme Court has actually endorsed his opinions more  than a dozen times.  [[Page S5684]]    Judge Kavanaugh has dedicated his life to public service, serving in  various roles in the executive branch under President George W. Bush  and for the last 12 years on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the  DC Circuit.   Throughout his years of service, Judge Kavanaugh has also had a very  positive impact on those around him. Just last week, one of Judge  Kavanaugh's earliest clerks was sworn in to serve on the U.S. Court of  Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit of the United States. That judge is  Judge Britt Grant, a native Georgian.   Judge Grant clerked for Judge Kavanaugh, served on Georgia's Supreme  Court, was elected to a full term without opposition, and is now a  justice on the U.S. Court of Appeals. Judge Kavanaugh introduced her  when she was sworn in to the Georgia Supreme Court, and he swore her in  to the court of appeals last week. That both Judge Grant and Judge  Kavanaugh are where they are today is a testament to their years of  service and work upholding the U.S. Constitution.   Even with Judge Kavanaugh's outstanding qualifications, which  transcend party lines, some of my colleagues across the aisle are  already hysterically opposing him. In fact, some of my colleagues  promised to vote against the nominee before Judge Kavanaugh had even  officially been nominated. That kind of blind partisanship is exactly  what the American people find unacceptable about Washington--one of the  many things.   Judge Kavanaugh is an independent, well-qualified nominee to the U.S.  Supreme Court who will defend and uphold the U.S. Constitution. By the  way, at the White House, when the President announced that Judge  Kavanaugh would be his nominee, I was really moved by Judge Kavanaugh's  comments that night. He first spoke about his mom and how she later in  life had become a lawyer. He talked about his father, he talked about  his two children, and only at the very end did he say these brief  words. He made this comment in the East Room of the White House the  night that President Donald Trump had nominated him and made it public  that he was the nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court. This is Judge  Kavanaugh's quote:         I revere the Constitution. I believe that an independent       judiciary is the crown jewel of our constitutional republic.       If confirmed by the Senate, I will keep an open mind in every       case, and I will always strive to preserve the Constitution       of the United States and the American rule of law. I don't       know how you can be more clear than that.    In 2006, during his confirmation hearing for the DC Circuit, he again  faced unmerited accusations, much as he is today. At that time, Judge  Kavanaugh simply responded: ``There is one kind of judge . . . an  independent judge under our Constitution.''   I think it is very clear where this man's mind is, and that is to  protect and uphold the Constitution of the United States. Those quotes  show that this man is very serious, and he needs to be strongly  considered as the next Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.   In my opinion, there can be no higher responsibility in this body  than to be very diligent in our due diligence of nominating and  confirming a Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court. Having done that, I  give this man my fullest unreserved recommendation, and I encourage my  colleagues in this body to also vote positively on this confirmation.
