 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the Senate returns to session in the  shadow of tragedy. A week ago last Friday, the senseless attack on the  Capitol by a lone actor injured one Capitol Police officer and claimed  the life of another, Officer William ``Billy'' Evans.   All of us in the Capitol and all of us across the Nation wish for the  speedy recovery of Officer Shaver and mourn the loss of another fallen  hero.   To pay tribute to his final act of bravery, Officer Evans will lie in  honor under the Capitol Rotunda, at the very center of the democracy he  gave his life to protect. A service in his memory will take place  tomorrow morning.   For everyone who works in the Senate, his loss is particularly  painful. He was a familiar face who greeted lawmakers, reporters,  staffers, and employees at the north entrance as we entered the Senate  side of the building. Whether you knew him or not, his wide smile was  often the first thing you would see in the morning.   This has been an immensely difficult few months for members of the  Capitol Police Force and for everyone who works behind the scenes to  safeguard the Capitol Complex. Senate committees are conducting  bipartisan and comprehensive reviews to ensure the Capitol is as secure  as possible while also remaining accessible to the public. That is a  top priority.   But also, in this moment of profound loss, we need to comfort each  other and support members of the Capitol Police, who, in 4 short  months, have suffered a brutal attack by a violent mob and lost four of  their friends and cherished colleagues. We must never, never take for  granted the work they do, day in and day out, to guard this citadel of  democracy.   I will have more to say tomorrow when we pay tribute to the life of  Officer Evans. For now, I wish to extend my deep condolences to his  friends and family, especially his two young children, and everyone  whose lives were enriched by knowing this incredible, incredible public  servant.    Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.  Con. Res. 27, which was received today.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  concurrent resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.
