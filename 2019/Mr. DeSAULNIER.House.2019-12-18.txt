 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding,  and I thank the leadership of the Rules Committee, Mr. McGovern and Mr.  Cole, for our civility last night. Although it was a long hearing and  we are very much in disagreement, I felt proud to be part of that  hearing, and I really want to recognize both the ranking member and the  chair.   The previous speaker is part of that Rules Committee, and I would  just say that the passion that she demonstrated in her comments, I  can't say how much I completely disagree with her, which is a statement  on the environment we find ourselves in, and I, unfortunately, agree  with some of her comments, but where the responsibility is I would put  at the White House and the President. He is the divisive one. He is not  trying to heal our wounds.   The reality and urgency of this moment cannot be more consequential  to the American democracy. This is not a hypothetical. President Trump  violated the law and solicited foreign interference in our election. At  the same time, objective experts have overwhelming evidence that Russia  interfered in the 2016 election and is actively engaged in undermining  the 2020 elections.   Our vote today and the Senate's actions on impeachment have very real  long-term consequences for American democracy. Where do we go from here  if the Senate does not remove him? The President has a pattern of  escalating behavior. The day before the special counsel testified to  Congress that the Russian Government interfered in our election in  sweeping and systemic fashion, President Trump made this call.    Two days before that, the President says that Article  II of the Constitution says that he can do whatever he wants.   As Washington warned in his farewell address, foreign interference  tampers with domestic factions and misleads public opinion. We must  honor the Nation that our Founders envisioned and impeach this  president for violating the law and betraying the American people.                                time  1045
