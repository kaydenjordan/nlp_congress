 Mr. Speaker, prior to coming to Congress 2 years ago, I  spent 15 years building manufacturing companies. I have been personally  on the receiving end of bad trade policy and bad trade practices. So,  in 2016, when President--then candidate, now President--Trump talked  about making America great again by dealing with bad trade deals and  bad trade practices, frankly, he energized me and many other people in  my industry, in the manufacturing sector, and, indeed, all across the  country because America has lived with bad consequences of bad trade  deals.   In fact, America has built its history on trade. Truly, economic  liberty is as much a part of America's history as religious liberty and  other forms of liberty. We were the world's largest trading country. We  are a great trading power in every way you can measure it. We do have  trade deficits with some countries, but we have to pay attention to the  right metrics.   So when we talk about bad trade practices and bad trade policies, we  talk about, to use an analogy, watching basketball. Think how the sport  would change if there were no fouls called and no one could shoot free  throws. These are the kinds of things that happened with the WTO.  Eventually, after, sometimes, years of filing a  [[Page H6247]]  complaint, the WTO will adjudicate a subsidy practice by China on  steel, for example, and then they will say: Hey, you have to stop.   Well, the moment a complaint is filed, the Chinese company just dumps  faster because they know that it is going to be turned off. The trouble  is there is no consequence for this bad conduct.   So what I had hoped we would be doing is we would be using our great  relationships around the world to unite our allies, our best trading  partners, frankly, people who are also the victims of these bad trade  practices and bad trade policies, to take action against those bad  practices so that we can define what is a foul and what is the  effective free throw. What are the consequences?   I believe that the President's goals are being poorly served by some  of his advisers and I hope that the President will change course,  because what we are doing has resulted in failure in every type of war  studied, from Sun Tzu through World War II, through more modern wars.   When you multiply your enemies, you are not winning, and we are doing  that with the practices that some of the administration is  implementing, things that implement uniform tariffs, things that  distort the very definition of a national security issue to call German  luxury autos a national security issue.   We have tools in the kit bag that could be very effective, tools like  sanctions. When we engage in warfare, when we engage with enemies of  our country that are strategic enemies, we have sanctions in place  against Russia, sanctions in place against Iran, and sanctions in place  against North Korea.   The beauty of sanctions is they can be targeted not just as a country  or a sector; they can be targeted to companies and even individuals. We  can use these things to restrict the flow, and we can define what is  illicit finance.   We can use these tools that the world uses already against bad actors  and, frankly, some of the worst actors in the world to unite our allies  and to define a better way for trade going forward.   So we shouldn't confuse this with a critique of the objective. The  objective is, indeed, noble and necessary. Past trade practices, past  Presidential policies have left America on the short end. True, as  Milton Friedman said:         If countries want to subsidize the cost of a good, let       them. They are just lowering the cost for our consumers.    But we can't simply be a nation of consumers. We need people to put  capital at risk in America to thrive, and for our great industries,  whether it is agriculture or manufacturing or technology, for the  intellectual property to flourish here. We have the best markets for  goods, services, intellectual property, capital, and we need to make  sure that we defend that.   I applaud President Trump for being passionate about putting America  first in these practices, but I do believe that we need to look at the  tactics that have been employed by many who have advised him and say,  ``Is this multiplying our enemies?'' And, in fact, it is.   I hope we can move forward in a better way and we can serve this  great country by restoring trade to its right and proper place as a  vibrant part of our economy. Exports drive our economy, but imports can  benefit our economy. Trade is exactly that.   Trade is something of value for both parties. Both profit when trade  is there. A zero-sum understanding is not the right way to look at  trade. We benefit and so do others; and it is okay that they benefit,  because then they are able to buy more from us in trade.    The practices that are in place today give us a chance to assess the  progress, and I think it is vital that we do that. It is vital that we  keep this economy doing the great things that it has under President  Trump's leadership, under congressional leadership.   We were told that the new normal was a 1.5 percent growth rate, that  we couldn't grow at the high rate. With regulatory relief and tax  reform, our economy is growing higher than 3 percent, and we certainly  don't want to do anything that would derail that momentum.   I am encouraged by Mr. Hill's dialogue tonight, and I thank the  gentleman for the opportunity to speak. I know we have other colleagues  who would like to as well.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Hill.   I want to agree with the importance of bringing allies to the table  to address those practices.   There are four, and there are several others that we would probably  agree on. In a way, I think the thing that our President respects about  China is they put China first. They have used all the resources of  their nation really since 1989, since Deng Xiaoping transformed China's  economy to a more market-oriented economy.   They are not a market-oriented economy. That was one of the things  they committed to do as part of joining the World Trade Organization.  They are a command-driven economy in many respects. They have made  great progress since 1989 to being market oriented. Frankly, since  2008, they have gone the other way in some of their practices.   If you look at the revolutionary idea, though, the idea that lives  can be changed by trade and capitalism, China under Deng Xiaoping, at  the peak, they were using communism with Communist principles, and he  introduced to them communism with Chinese principles, which was  essentially capitalism as long as we can stay in charge.   It is a corrupt, subsidized form of capitalism, but at its peak, it  was lifting 1 million Chinese people a month out of dollar-a-day  poverty.   Trade was a key part of this, inflows of foreign direct investment to  reach this massive market. Today General Motors sells more cars in  China than they sell in the United States of America.   This is a better path than the one I expected. When I graduated from  high school in 1988, Mr. Gorbachev had not torn down the Berlin Wall.  By the end of 1989 when I was there, unfortunately bad things had  happened in Tiananmen Square in China, but, thankfully, great things  happened at the Berlin Wall. I was fortunate to be able to see people  there. I met a man who was from East Germany in his first hours of  freedom who said: Is it like this everywhere?   We were in the Ku'damm district--kind of like Times Square is in New  York--in Berlin. I thought he meant how big the city was. But what he  really meant was the stores were open at night, and there is fresh  milk, as he said. He was astonished that regular people, even  foreigners, could go in, and the shelves had stock.   This is the idea of economic liberty. This has produced abundance  wherever it has been tried. Where the other ideas, the redistribution  that Mao tried every version of Marxist Communist ideology that he  could think of, and they all failed. They produced scarcity, poverty,  and depravity. By engaging in the world, China transformed their  economy. That is something to respect. I think the President admires  the way that they put China first.   But the reality is in putting China first, they have engaged all the  resources of the country to where in 2014 we saw that President Obama  had to take action against hackers. In fact, they were indicted. But  did President Obama cut off all relations and trade with China? He did  not. He engaged in diplomacy with China.   I think it is great that we engage with Russia. Perhaps even Russia  will see a market-oriented economy. They started out that way in the  1990s. But they also proved that deficits do matter. This is something  that the whole West wrestles with, and it is another thing that we  could unite in agreeing with.   I hope we can also get to ways we can unite here, because, as Mr.  LaHood mentioned, the Global Trade Accountability Act is not an  adversarial bill. It doesn't even go retroactive to the actions that  have occurred in the past. It does get Congress engaged. It gets  Congress engaged because the same benefits of cooperation, the same  benefits of multiplying our allies instead of multiplying our enemies,  could happen here in Congress where we multiply the people working on  the problem.   We want to join our President in taking action against bad actors and  in making our trade policy better than it has been even with the  Canadians--they have bad trade practices that we can improve. Even with  the Europeans; they have bad trade practices that we can improve upon.   Great friends work through problems and I feel like that is the  reality that we have with our friends. Here in Congress, the President  has great friends. I would consider the three of us some of his great  friends, not adversaries, in the goal we are concerned, I think, about  the means of getting to that, and the Global Trade Accountability Act  would simply say that Congress works with the President who leads the  negotiations similar to the REINS Act. Where Congress can come  alongside and say we do it, what would that mean? Well, that would mean  that the President is more engaged. But it's really the President's  advisors. Men like Peter Navarro, instead of refusing to come talk to  Ways and Means, would engage with our chairman, would engage with our  committee dealing with trade, and would, in fact, develop a plan  instead of criticize their own failure to plan after the fact.   How do we know this?   This is an example. We have a uniform tariff policy that probably  never should have been implemented, that has got a chance for  exclusions. We have over 20,000 companies that want exclusions right  now. Commerce is doing them not sector by sector, but company by  company; not commodity by commodity, but company by company.   There are only six people working on this massive task. Were there to  be required engagement, I believe there would have been a better plan  in that collaborative approach, and perhaps a different course of  action.   I look forward to seeing other ways that you all might think that we  could collaborate and make the great cause of making our trade  agreements better and more productive.     Mr. Speaker, I think we have made great progress  towards that end in uniting on trying to take a difference course of  action. Just recently, we passed updated export controls and CFIUS  regulation to try to give more tools to the kit bag.   Who is going to execute this? The executive branch. But the  legislative branch passed the law, the House, the Senate. We are  working to get the final package to agree on language--not just against  China, but anybody who would steal our intellectual property, anybody  who would take targeted action to harm our economy or put their  citizens in a position to do that harm--and also try to strike the  balance.   Here is the thing. We can have perfect security for America's  intellectual property by exporting zero of it, but we can't do that.  What we have to do is find a balance that says: We want you to innovate  in the United States of America; we want the ideas to continue to  originate here; we want the capital to be invested here to create those  great ideas; but we do want to have some concern.   You mentioned the Clinton administration. One of the first actions  Bill Clinton took as President was to move release authority for  sensitive information from the Department of Defense into the  Department of Commerce.   And what happened?   Swiftly, Hughes worked with China to be able to help send them launch  vehicles off of one rocket. One rocket went up into the air, multiple  low-Earth orbit satellites went around, precisely positioned in orbit  around the Earth. The down side is that is the exact same technology  that can be used to send warheads to multiple cities after one launch  vehicle penetrates U.S. airspace. This is dangerous technology in the  wrong hands.   So we have to find a way to review those things and keep America  safe, but we also have to find a way to have the ideas and the  intellectual property initiate here.   We can't shut down all these in the name of national security. We  certainly don't want to shut down the production of luxury automobiles.  But we might want to restrict the trade there.   China is actually targeting our entrepreneurs. We have some of the  best education in the world, and the world comes here to become well- educated. Over 50 percent of our graduate and postgraduate students are  not native-born Americans.   We allow, frankly, most of the world to come here to get educated.  Unfortunately, we don't retain enough of that talent. So we send many  of those people out of here with those skills that can be put to work  in our marketplace.   But in the process, Chinese capital sometimes and, frankly, other  foreign nationals are getting into venture capital. They are on our  campuses. They are recruiting our talented people. They also are  looking to buy our innovative ideas for dual use, but sometimes only to  advance their own technology.   The challenge today is that China has had this mixed blend of  aggressive behavior towards us. They have also seen the benefits of  trade. They have seen the benefits of the flow of goods, services,  capital, and, in some cases, people, and they have brought those to  bear to benefit their own economy.   Today, nearly a third of initial public offerings are taking place in  China. This is a challenge. And I would say we are better off finding a  way to compete in the marketplace than as I thought I would as a  soldier, which I never thought I would go to China without body armor  and a rucksack full of ammo and night vision goggles and whatnot. I  would rather trade with them.   I hope we can stay on friendly terms with them. I hope we can get on  friendly terms with Russia, when it is possible. As much as it depends  on us, we should live at peace with everyone.   But we do have to trade. We do have to enforce the rules. We do need  law and order. We have made many of these commitments, including  commitments in the WTO. We should insist that China live up to their  obligation and become a market-oriented economy.    Mr. Speaker, prior to being here, I worked in the  manufacturing sector. I worked in metal stamping.   One of the challenges, as Mr. Hill highlighted, is the tariffs are  only on the commodity. Frankly, they are blunt force. They are all  steel, all aluminum.   The reality is some grades of steel, some grades of aluminum are  commodity. Beverage cans, for example, are a commodity. We make it in  the U.S.; they make it in Canada. Everywhere they consume lots of  beverages, there is a significant ability to produce this grade of  aluminum.   So the idea that we would target that isn't necessarily changing our  market, but where it is, there are things like the grades of rod that  your tire manufacturers are or a similar rod for welding wire. Welding  wire is highly automated.   So we have got domestic welding wire manufacturers who already  weren't the lowest cost provider. China, India, South Korea all heavily  subsidize their welding wire manufacturers. Having domestic welding  wire manufacturers probably is a national security issue.   We want the base rod to be made in the U.S. Some of those grades  aren't. But soon, if we don't get exclusions to our domestic welding  wire manufacturers, we won't have the manufacturer of welding wire  either.   Meanwhile, their cost for the steel has gone up by 25 percent or more  because of the tariffs and they are losing market share. They don't  have a year or 2 to wait for the exclusions review. They are losing  business now. And the size they are could kill their companies.   Some of these companies are big enough to just shift production  offshore, as we have seen other people do, but some of the smaller  companies don't have that option. They will live or die on whether or  not they can get a government-mandated exclusion to a government- created problem that restricts their ability to buy the aluminum.   So we either have to put tariffs on the secondary goods--so you can  see where this goes--and then they will put tariffs on the secondary  goods, or we have to find a way where we say it is a national security  issue for us to get this capability in the U.S. We want that  capability, but we have to go about it the other way.   I believe passionately that it is the sanctions. As you alluded to  your own articles in the sixties, you have to take sanctions action.   When you talk about how you deal with transshipments, we already deal  with transshipments for national security purposes. And it is targeted.   The sanctions protocol offers a path forward. I hope we can engage on  that. I hope we can pass the Global Trade Accountability Act to provide  a check, and I hope that more of our colleagues will engage in this  sort of discussion. I hope colleagues across the aisle can engage in  it, not necessarily to be an attack on our President or our policies,  but as a gateway to support economic liberty that has indeed made  America the land of opportunity.                                time  2015
