 Mr. President, S. Con. Res. 5, the fiscal year 2021  congressional budget resolution, included an instruction to the  chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget to file enforceable  levels in the Senate in the event the budget was agreed to without the  need to appoint a committee of conference on the measure. On Friday,  February 5, 2021, the Senate passed the budget resolution, and the  [[Page S987]]  House of Representatives passed it without changes later that day. As  such, today, I submit the required filing.   Specifically, section 4001 of the fiscal year 2021 congressional  budget resolution allows the chairman to file an allocation for fiscal  year 2021 for the Committee on Appropriations and an allocation for  fiscal years 2021, 2021 through 2025, and 2021 through 2030 for  committees other than the Committee on Appropriations.   In addition, section 4005 of S. Con. Res. 5 provides authority for  the chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget to adjust the  allocations, aggregates, and other appropriate budgetary levels to  reflect changes resulting from the Congressional Budget Office's  updates to its baseline for fiscal years 2021 through 2030. On February  11, 2021, CBO released ``The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2021 to  2031.''   The figures included in this filing are consistent with the spending  limits set forth in the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended by the  Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, P.L. 116-137, as well as with the levels  included in S. Con. Res. 5, as adjusted pursuant to section 4005 of  that budget resolution.   For purposes of enforcing the Senate's pay-as-you-go rule, which is  found in section 4106 of the fiscal year 2018 congressional budget  resolution, I am resetting the Senate's scorecard to zero for all  fiscal years.   All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.   Finally, this enforcement filing supersedes the filings made pursuant  to section 205 the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019.   I ask unanimous consent that the tables detailing enforcement in the  Senate be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:             ALLOCATION OF SPENDING AUTHORITY TO SENATE COMMITIEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021               [Pursuant to Section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and S.

This  contest gives students in my State the opportunity to  [[Page S989]]  articulate what issues they would prioritize if they were President of  the United States.   This is the contest's 11th year, and I would like to congratulate the  319 students who participated. It is truly heartening to see so many  young people engaged in finding solutions for the problems that face  our country. To my mind, this is what democracy is all about.   A volunteer panel of Vermont teachers reviewed the essays and chose  William Taggard as this year's winner. William, a junior at Brattleboro  Union High School, wrote about the State of our Nation's democracy.  Emilia De Jounge, a sophomore at Burr and Burton Academy, was the  second place winner. Emilia wrote about gun control. Simon Rosenbaum, a  junior at Vermont Commons School, was the third place winner, with an  essay on democracy.   I am very proud to enter into the Congressional Record the essays  submitted by William, Emilia and Simon.   The material follows:       Winner, William Taggard, Brattleboro Union High School, Junior         In the wake of the Watergate scandal of 1972, author and       journalist Frank Herbert remarked that ``good governance       never depends upon laws, but upon the personal qualities of       those who govern. The machinery of government is always       subordinate to those who administer that machinery.'' The       current administration has overseen an unprecedented       undermining of trust in our government, the scale of which is       scarcely rivaled in our nation's history. The subsequent       damage leads us to Herbert's inevitable conclusion: ``The       most important element of government, therefore, is the       method of choosing leaders.''        Our democracy has been under unprecedented pressure in       recent months, culminating in the insurrection in our       nation's capital. Fortunately, democracy and the truth have       prevailed. However, our current system leaves ample room for       improvement: namely the electoral college. We face a       fundamental problem that puts at risk one of the most       essential assets of our great nation. We need to review the       merits of the electoral college and determine how best to       protect our democratic process. Two of the last three       Presidents elected have failed to secure a majority of the       popular vote, suggesting that while the Declaration of       Independence states we are all created equal, our current       democratic system makes some votes more impactful than       others. A select number of ``swing states'' hold a       disproportionate amount of power in determining the outcome       of a race.        A short term solution to the flaws of the electoral college       system is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact       (NPVIC). This is an agreement between states to award all of       their electoral votes to the candidate that wins the national       popular vote. To become effective, its signatories must       control at least 270 electoral votes. Currently, they hold a       total of 196 votes, with another 67 pending. By eliminating       ``swing states,'' the NPVIC would spread voting power       equally, regardless of which state you live in. This change       would force politicians to campaign not only to ``swing       state'' voters, but to everyone.        Long term, it is in the country's best interest to consider       alternate methods of voting. Our current system forces voters       to pick between two popular candidates rather than support       their true favorite, but this dynamic only arises from our       pick one voting system. Methods such as approval or instant       runoff voting can combat polarization, legitimize third       parties, and eliminate spoiler candidates; forms of       proportional representation can transcend gerrymandering and       incentivize cooperation through coalition building. These       practices allow voters to voice their conscience without       worry of ``wasting'' their vote and fix many of the problems       our current system has.        The importance of choosing good leaders has perhaps never       been more apparent--divisive rhetoric dominates the political       sphere, suffocating any chance at productive discourse. As       President-elect Joe Biden cautioned, ``the words of a       president matter.'' We would be wise to ensure that those       words come from a leader whose authority derives not from the       exploitation of the electoral system, but rather from broad       consensus and a commitment to the growth and prosperity of       our nation.     Second Place, Emilia deJounge, Burr and Burton Academy, Sophomore         Columbine, Sandy Hook, Parkland . . . every parent's worst       nightmare, yet what has America done to prevent another? A       study by the American Journal of Medicine in 2016 found that       Americans are 25 times more likely to die from gun homicide       than people in other wealthy countries. Our futile attempts       at gun control have seen little success, as gun violence       rates are still steadily rising, increasing almost 25% from       2019 to 2020. The right to bear arms is in our Constitution,       yet that does not negate the need for sound and rational       policies around the sales of firearms. Currently, nearly 400       million guns are privately owned in the US, more than the       country's population, with sharp increases in recent years.       Gun violence needs to be recognized and addressed as a top       priority public health issue.        ``It is much easier to be a legal gun owner in the US than       it is to be a legal driver,'' says David Hemenway, director       of Injury Control Research at Harvard. A first step to       prevent gun violence is to make it more difficult to purchase       a gun through safe gun-owning training programs and requiring       registration of all gun purchases. According to the State       Firearms Law project, just seven states require a permit to       possess a gun of any kind. A 2014 study in the Journal of       Urban Health found that Missouri's 2007 repeal of its permit-      to-purchase handgun law was associated with a 25% increase in       firearms homicide rates.        Another important step to combating gun violence is       investing in research. According to a 2017 study published in       the Journal of the American Medical Association, gun violence       research should have received $1.4 billion from 2004 to 2015,       based on mortality rates and funding levels for other leading       causes of death, but only received 1.6% of the projected       amount. According to Dr. Elinore Kaufman, chief resident in       surgery at New York-Presbyterian, ``we know far less about       gun violence as a cause of injury and death than we do about       almost every medical problem.'' In 1996, the NRA pressured       Congress to pass the Dickey Amendment mandating that no CDC       funds could be spent on research that promotes gun control,       which has impaired our ability to make informed legislation.        We can look to other nations to see that gun control works.       Germany has been successful in upholding the rights of its       citizens, yet preventing unnecessary deaths. With one of the       highest weapons-per-head rates in the world, Germany       maintains one of the lowest gun homicide rates in Europe: a       death rate of 0.05 per 1,000 people, compared with 3.34 in       the US, and the rate in Germany is decreasing. This       accomplishment is due to strict gun laws which include       psychiatric evaluations, random spot checks, and limits to       numbers of guns per person. The US can enact its own version       of these laws while upholding the rights of citizens. Gun       violence is a widespread disease plaguing our country which       can be prevented through more effective control policies.        Third Place, Simon Rosenbaum, Vermont Commons School, Junior         This past year terrified me. It was not just the carnage       and isolation of the pandemic. I wasn't afraid of war in       Iran. I was afraid because a United States Senator said it       was okay to assault peaceful protestors in front of the White       House for a photo op and negate the constitutional right to       assembly. I was afraid because the President of the United       States is fighting to subvert the cornerstone of our       democracy: our election process. I was afraid because the       America I love and believe in felt like it was on the brink       of collapse. The most pressing issue that we as Americans       face today is the preservation of our democracy.        Before and after the November election, people on all sides       of the political spectrum have carried on about policy and       rhetoric, conspiracy theories and misinformation. No one       seems to understand the gravity of the situation. What makes       America special is our belief in a functioning democracy and       an uncompromising defense of our constitutional rights. My       ancestors came to America to grant that to me. Our       predecessors built that for all of us. The one inheritance       bestowed upon every American is the dignity of being       American. This year, our democracy was pushed to the brink,       our rights were subverted, and the dignity of America was       cast aside. To me, this felt like the end.        Of course, it was not the end. We Americans kept fighting       for a more equitable, democratic union and it looks like our       democracy will survive. My concern is for next time. What       happens if next time, the system is assaulted by a savvy       politician, someone who understands the systems they hope to       destroy? This year, we saw that people in positions of power       would do anything to keep it.        To preserve the union and our nation, we must eliminate the       possibility for a President to wield unitary executive       authority. Diminishing the power of the Executive Branch will       mitigate the damage that an unfit executive could cause. We       must also depoliticize judicial appointments, and instate a       nonpartisan federal oversight commission independent of the       executive branch to ensure that political leaders are working       for the people.        Additionally, we must rebuild our demoralized, undervalued       federal public service. These patriotic, nonpartisan public       servants have been caught in the crosshairs of this attempted       coup, and we must put them first as we rebuild from this       sabotage of the framework of our country. They are the ones       who put their careers and in some cases their lives on the       line to save America. Now we must repay that priceless debt.       Increasing protections for whistleblowers, creating a federal       public service academy similar to our military academies, and       simply paying public servants more for the invaluable work       they do will make great strides in strengthening the system       against assault next time.        This past year, the great American experiment almost came       to an end. The most pressing issue we face now is how do we       make sure this never happens again?
