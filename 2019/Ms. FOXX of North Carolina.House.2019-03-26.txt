 Mr. Speaker, I rise to call for debate in  this Chamber on H. Res. 109, referred to as the Green New Deal.   This resolution lays out an agenda that is, frankly, anti-American  and goes against everything our Constitution is all about.   The resolution states: ``It is the duty of the Federal Government to  create a Green New Deal.''   The main components of this deal include: net-zero greenhouse gas  emissions; creating millions of good, high-wage jobs; and upgrading all  existing buildings and building new buildings to achieve maximum energy  efficiency, water efficiency, safety, affordability, comfort, and  durability. All of this is to be accomplished in 10 years' time.   Among the things the Federal Government has meddled in beyond the  scope of its limited powers, completely overhauling every building and  method of transportation in the country would be, by far, its most  egregious transgression to date.   However, the Green New Deal certainly will require Congress'  constitutional authority to levy taxes and borrow money to pay for it.    This so-called ``deal'' would come at the cost of trillions to the  middle class  [[Page H2800]]  and spend taxpayers' hard-earned money, as if they don't know best how  to use their money and need the government to do it for them.   The Green New Deal reflects zero understanding of moral hazard and  the government's capacity for waste, suggesting the government assume  the risks in the unchartered research and development this socialist  experiment would require. The way the resolution's supporters see it,  money will simply be put back into the economy and create millions of  new jobs. They think nothing of the fact that these actions actually  take power away from ``We the people.''   Now, in light of the Senate taking up this resolution for a vote this  week, I would like to offer some thoughts as to why it needs deeper  thought and debate in the House.   America is currently on a sustainable plan with its all-of-the-above  energy strategy, including renewable, oil, gas, coal, and nuclear  sources.   Renewables presently make up 17 percent of U.S. electric power  generation, and despite enormous subsidies, are far from capable of  serving as exclusive energy sources that are reliant and affordable.  Yet, since 2005, use of cheap natural gas has reduced carbon emissions  from power generation by 30 percent.   Our current approach encourages development of renewable sources and  accounts for both environment and monetary costs.   This resolution instead throws money exclusively at renewables and  entirely eliminates the oil, gas, and coal industries.   Secondly, if the goal is to build the middle class and create jobs,  why go in completely the opposite direction of what has worked to  create over 5 million jobs in the past 2 years?   Reducing the Federal footprint with regulatory reform and middle- class tax cuts have caused wages to rise, job growth to soar, and  consistently low rates of unemployment. Allowing small businesses to  keep more of their money has worked to create jobs and increase wages.   We certainly don't need to raise taxes and spend more money to create  this effect.   Finally, this massive government intervention will push businesses  overseas and disrupt the lives of workers, farmers, and students making  the most of America's abounding opportunities.   Americans cherish freedom, which includes the ability for individuals  to determine their own paths without the Government deciding how they  will contribute to society.   The Socialist ideology behind this resolution is at odds with the  American values that have caused our society to flourish and innovate  since its founding.   I encourage the 90 House Democrats who have cosponsored H. Res. 109  and Speaker Pelosi to engage in serious and open debate on this  legislation, or at least publish a new fact sheet they can stand behind  so accurate representations of opposing viewpoints can be heard by the  American people.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further  consideration of H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection  Act, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, if this unanimous consent  request cannot be entertained, I urge the Speaker and the majority  leader to immediately schedule the Born-Alive bill so we can stand up  and protect the sanctity of human life and I ask all others to join in  in that request.
