 Mr. President, I oppose today's resolution to  overturn the Bureau of Land Management planning 2.0 rule.   The Bureau of Land Management is charged with ensuring responsible  use of public lands, which requires extensive land use planning to  balance priorities like recreation, conservation, and energy  development. Planning 2.0 simply updates outdated planning processes  that date back 30 years to provide greater community input and  transparency. This is intended to create plans that work better for all  users, including local communities. It is also meant to reduce the time  it takes to complete the planning process.   Under the new rule, the public is involved in the planning process  early to avoid costly and time-consuming disputes later. The rule  allows for the use of current technology like geospatial data to allow  for more science-based decisionmaking.   Developing planning 2.0 took 2 years and included consideration of  more than 6,000 public comments. With today's resolution, we would  abandon modernization that makes it easier for the public and State and  local governments to be involved in the Federal planning process and  revert to rules that were written in 1983.   A wide range of sportsmen groups, including the Izaak Walton League  of America, the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, and Trout  Unlimited have asked us to preserve Planning 2.0. They write:  ``Stakeholders  [[Page S1621]]  from across the multiple-use spectrum agreed that the previous BLM  planning process could be improved. Under the outdated process,  opportunities for public involvement were too few, and the public  didn't learn about agency plans until they were already proposed.''   If we pass this resolution today, BLM will have to go back to that  outdated process and would be prohibited from proposing a rule that is  substantially similar to planning 2.0. I urge my colleagues to vote  against this resolution.
