 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, we stand in solidarity with the people of Venezuela,  and I share many of the comments of the gentlewoman from Florida, but I  must rise in opposition to H.R. 549.   H.R. 549 statutorily designates Venezuela for inclusion in the broken  program known as Temporary Protective Status. Pursuant to the  Immigration and Nationality Act, the Secretary of DHS can designate a  country for TPS if there are circumstances that would prevent the safe  return of aliens to that country or if a country is temporarily unable  to adequately handle the return of its nationals.   When DHS does so, nationals of the designated country who are inside  the United States on the date of the designation, whether legally or  illegally, may apply to stay here and receive employment authorization.  DHS has estimated there are 270,000 such Venezuelan nationals currently  in the United States, over 100,000 of whom are here illegally.   TPS is usually initially designated for a period of 18 months and  then redesignated in 18-month increments after the Secretary reviews  the conditions in the country to determine whether the conditions for  the initial TPS designation continue. If the Secretary determines the  country no longer meets the conditions for the TPS designation, the  Secretary is required by law to terminate the designation. There are  currently over 415,000 TPS recipients from 10 different countries in  the United States.   Despite the fact Congress intended TPS to be a temporary protection,  over time it has become a permanent, automatically renewed status with  some countries being designated for TPS for decades.   For instance, Honduras was initially designated for TPS back in 1999  due to Hurricane Mitch which struck the country in October of 1998.  Somalia was initially designated in September of 1991 based on armed  conflict.   The current administration applied the law under section 244 of the  INA regarding mandatory termination of TPS designation if the  conditions no longer exist, and terminated TPS for Sudan, Nicaragua,  Haiti, and El Salvador. The DHS Secretary gave those populations at  least 12 months to wind down and prepare for departure, but a lawsuit  was filed, and activist Federal courts issued an injunction.   I oppose H.R. 549, but do not do so lightly. There is no doubt that  the people of Venezuela are suffering. They are in a dire situation as  a result of the socialist policies of long-time President Hugo Chavez  and his successor Nicolas Maduro.                                time  1745    But I hold out hope for a regime change in Venezuela, and I know the  administration is watching this situation closely.   If Congress is, nevertheless, inclined to statutorily designate  Venezuela for TPS, we should not do so without reforming the process to  ensure renewal is not a rubber stamp; otherwise, we risk being in the  same position we are currently in regarding other TPS designations. No  other administration will terminate it, and 25 years from now, Members  of Congress will call for green cards for Venezuelans here on TPS.   Another concern is two Federal circuits, the sixth and the ninth,  have held the mere grant of TPS is an admission for purposes of the  Immigration and Nationality Act. The effect of those rulings is that  TPS holders who were meant to be here temporarily can now get a green  card pursuant to family or employment-based petition even if they  entered the country illegally. Also problematic is the fact that the  fee for a TPS application is statutorily capped at $50.   Last week, the Immigration and Citizenship Subcommittee held a  hearing regarding the long wait times for processing immigration  benefits applications. Large volume is the biggest driver of longer  processing times, but there is also not enough money to hire additional  staff. Since it is a fee-funded agency, U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services should be allowed to set the fee commensurate with  the cost of application adjudication, which is obviously more than the  mere $50.   Lastly, I must point out the glaring hypocrisy of designating a  country for temporary protective status after the majority recently  passed H.R. 6, which created a green card path for 417,000 aliens in  the country on temporary protected status. If the majority had its way,  Congress would amend the INA to remove the word ``temporary'' from the  TPS statute and just start handing over green cards immediately.   Madam Speaker, I oppose H.R. 549. I urge my colleagues to do the  same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for  her remarks and for her sharing the concerns of the president for the  socialist regime of Maduro.  [[Page H7214]]    I would note that there are very few detained noncriminal Venezuelans  with removal orders, and there is no mechanism currently in place for  directly removing aliens to Venezuela.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico  (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Madam Speaker, I rise in support  of H.R. 549, the Venezuela TPS Act, introduced by the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Soto), my friend.   Madam Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor of this bill, essentially  allowing Venezuelan nationals living in the United States to be  eligible for temporary protected status. This status will extend travel  authorization, allow lawful employment, and, ultimately, prevent their  removal from the United States.   The crisis in Venezuela is dire.   In April, I had the opportunity to travel to Colombia with other  Members of Congress to visit a humanitarian aid center on the border  with Venezuela. I saw firsthand the appalling conditions that our Latin  American brothers and sisters are enduring, and believe me, it is worse  than anyone can imagine.   The hunger and the need experienced in the country are unprecedented  and heartbreaking. Over 90 percent of the population is living in  poverty; 7 million people need humanitarian assistance; and diseases  that have been previously eradicated have, unfortunately, returned.   To make matters worse, there is a shortage of 85 percent of necessary  medicines to treat those diseases on the ground, while infant mortality  rates have increased by 30 percent and maternal mortality rates have  increased by an alarming 60 percent.    This is unacceptable, Madam Speaker.   The main obstacle at hand lies in the hands of Nicolas Maduro and his  ruthless dictatorship. He is holding the people of Venezuela hostage,  depriving them of basic human rights.   Additionally, the number of Venezuelans migrating to Puerto Rico has  doubled since the crisis began and can be expected to continue  increasing as long as Maduro remains in power.   I will continue working to move this bill so that Venezuelans can  have a temporary safe haven in our country, where they can live freely.   Madam Speaker, I do understand that the House needs to do something  about this, and I urge my colleagues to do the same and support this  bill.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks  against the socialist regime of Maduro as well.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Brooks).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As was said earlier, there are very few detained noncriminal  Venezuelans with removal orders, and there is no mechanism currently in  place for directly removing aliens to Venezuela.   Madam Speaker, we stand with the people of Venezuela in their fight  against the socialist regime of Nicolas Maduro.   We recognize that only through change in leadership and a change in  direction will Venezuela change course and begin to rebound, in terms  of adopting economic reforms and abandoning the socialist policies of  the Maduro regime.   We stand with the people, and we stand ready to embrace the newly  elected President, should he take control of the country.   But this bill, H.R. 549, is a bill that is simply not appropriate for  the circumstances right now. This broken TPS system that we have would  not be sufficient to accommodate the hundreds of thousands of  Venezuelans who would seek to use it.   Suffice it to say, it is similar to helping people by throwing them a  raft full of holes.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against H.R. 549, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I speak in support of the bill, and I want to thank the gentleman  from Rhode Island for his leadership on this issue.   We should all honor and support America's veterans and their  families. The HAVEN Act does that by making sure disability and death  benefits received by veterans and their families receive special  protection during the difficult process of bankruptcy.   I also want to thank the gentlewoman from Georgia for her leadership  on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would simply state that the HAVEN Act makes  the Bankruptcy Code work better and more fairly for our Nation's  veterans and those who depend on them; so I encourage my colleagues to  support the bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of the bill and I want to thank the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline) and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Cohen), the sponsor, for his support of this important legislation  which would provide National Guard members, Armed Services reservists,  and their families continued flexibility to qualify for greater debt  relief in bankruptcy.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  important legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of the bill. I want to thank the gentleman from  Rhode Island for his leadership on this issue.   The bankruptcy system is a critical component of our economy. It  provides an important step, an important safety net for households and  entrepreneurs when they need a fresh start. It also stabilizes and  encourages lending, because it is a tried-and-true way for creditors to  recover as much as feasible when things go wrong for borrowers.   It is particularly important that the Bankruptcy Code work for small  businesses. Small business owners are the backbone of communities  across our country. It is their risk-taking that drives the creation of  new jobs in America. When they need the Bankruptcy Code's help to  reorganize their debts and keep their businesses going, the Bankruptcy  Code should be there as a tool to help them.   That is why I am particularly happy that the House today considers  the Small Business Reorganization Act. This important bill offers long- needed reform of Chapter 11 in the Bankruptcy Code to help small  businesses, and I am proud to introduce it, along with Chairman  Cicilline.   I want to thank the full committee chairman, Chairman Nadler, and  Ranking Member, Mr. Collins, for their support for this legislation and  for being original cosponsors this term.   Mr. Speaker, this bill promises to finally make Chapter 11 work for  the entrepreneurs whose small businesses are critical to life in  communities across this Nation, and I encourage all my colleagues to  support the bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of S. 504, the LEGION Act, and I want to  thank my colleague, the gentleman from California, for his leadership  on this issue. I am proud to stand here today in support of our  Nation's veterans.   One hundred years ago, Congress chartered The American Legion because  it recognized, as our veterans returned home from World War I, we must  provide for them. The American Legion has advocated for our veterans,  servicemembers, and their communities ever since.   In the last century, The American Legion has grown to nearly 2  million members around the world. The group is headquartered in  Indianapolis, Indiana, and has 13,000 offices, including one in every  State, advocating to State and Federal officials.   The American Legion now provides thousands of dollars in scholarships  to help students attend college, and grants for the study, prevention,  and treatment of various diseases.   They have also been at the forefront of the fight to improve mental  health services for all, but particularly for our troops who struggle  as they return home.   Beyond The American Legion's rich national history, it has held a  special place in my home State of Virginia for many decades. The  American Legion Department of Virginia was also chartered in 1919, with  91 local posts and several thousand members. In the intervening  century, it has grown to 212 posts and over 33,000 Legionnaires, and it  provides a variety of services to veterans and their families.   Today's legislation makes necessary amendments to The American Legion  charter to include all existing members and opens it to all future  members of the Armed Forces who are honorably discharged, separated, or  continue to serve. It provides future flexibility to enable The  American Legion to continue to provide opportunities for our servicemen  and -women. It also enables The American Legion to serve the next  generation.   I would like to thank Congressman Correa again for his partnership on  this legislation and his support of The American Legion and our  servicemen and -women.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H7222]]
