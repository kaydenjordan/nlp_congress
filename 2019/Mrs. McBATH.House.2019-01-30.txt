 Mr. Speaker, when it comes to gun violence, we talk  about Parkland, we talk about Trayvon Martin, and we talk about Jordan  Davis. But I want to take a moment today for the victims whom we don't  always talk about.   I want to talk about the nearly 100 Americans who lose their lives to  gun violence in this country every single day.   I want to talk about the mothers and the fathers who have suffered  tragic loss--the voices that we don't always hear.   Just last week, four lost their lives in a shooting just a few miles  outside of my district in Georgia. Those four families are torn apart  forever.   Each day, nearly 100 families are torn apart forever. For those loved  ones, thoughts and prayers are simply not enough. We need policy and we  need change. It is on us here in Congress to do something.   Mr. Speaker, I pray that my colleagues here and in the Senate will  support me in acting to pass meaningful gun safety legislation                            ____________________
