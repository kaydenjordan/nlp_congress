 Madam Speaker, ready, fire, aim.   What we are hearing today are made-up articles to fit an ever- shrinking impeachment foothold. George Washington could be impeached  under this criteria.   Democrats believe they are saving our democracy with these  hysterical, made-up charges, which is odd because we are a republic,  not a democracy, as they keep insisting.   No one came to Congress to impeach, we hear. Several new and  returning Members have come specifically to impeach President Trump.   I hear a lot today about sadness and solemnity. From impeachment? No,  because their candidate lost in 2016. The American people chose Donald  J. Trump to lead us into prosperity, not a socialist government.   We will survive this day, but I call upon the American people to see  through this sham, heal, and unite by speaking the truth.
