 Madam Speaker, to Mr. Meeks and Mr. Wilson: Thank you  for your hard work on this legislation.   Now, the Lord works in strange ways. As you get older, you can list  the ways. The country is closer together in a most weird way for a  common objective. We speak of unity more now than we spoke of division  8 months ago.   Russia is bombing hospitals--war crimes. Russian soldiers are  violating women and murdering children. Russia is seeking the total  destruction of Ukraine.   Against all odds, Ukraine and the Ukrainian people have pushed Russia  back. Russia and Putin are losing.   This war will not end soon. Putin is deranged and humiliated. The  violence will only intensify. It is the responsibility of our  government and every single American to support the Ukrainian people.   Before Pearl Harbor, America enacted the Lend-Lease Act to keep  democracy alive. Our legislation channels the same spirit and the same  purpose. In 1940, FDR awakened America's arsenal of democracy. With it,  we preserved freedom.   With our action today, we reawaken that arsenal of democracy once  more. We again are witnessing a conflict of civilization versus  darkness, freedom versus tyranny.   New Jersey's Ninth District has one of the largest Ukrainian-American  populations in America. They cry out for help. We cry with them. The  brave Ukrainian people have undaunted courage. They must know America  stands with them no matter what.   God bless Ukraine, and God bless the United States of America. The  Lord does work in strange ways.  [[Page H4598]]
