The Senator from South Dakota.                            ____________________     Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Without objection, it is so ordered.   The messages of the President are as follows:  To the Senate of the United States:   With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to  ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the  United States of America and the Republic of Serbia (the ``Treaty''),  signed at Belgrade on August 15, 2016. I also transmit, for the  information of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with  respect to the Treaty.   The Treaty would replace the Treaty between the United States of  America and the Kingdom of Servia for the Mutual Extradition of  Fugitives from Justice, signed October 25, 1901 (the ``1901 Treaty''),  which applies to the Republic of Serbia as a successor state to the  former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Treaty follows  generally the form and content of other extradition treaties recently  concluded by the United States. It would replace an outmoded list of  extraditable offenses with a modern ``dual criminality'' approach,  which would enable extradition for such offenses as money laundering,  cyber-related crimes, and other newer offenses not appearing on the  1901 Treaty list. The Treaty also provides that extradition shall not  be refused based on the nationality of the person sought and contains a  modernized ``political offense'' clause. Finally, the Treaty  incorporates a series of procedural improvements to streamline and  expedite the extradition process.   I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to  the Treaty, and give its advice and consent to ratification.                                                         Barack Obama.                                        The White House, January 17, 2017.  To the Senate of the United States:   With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to  ratification, I transmit herewith the Extradition Treaty between the  Government of the United States of America and the Government of the  Republic of Kosovo (the ``Treaty''), signed at Pristina on March 29,  2016. I also transmit, for the information of the Senate, the report of  the Department of State with respect to the Treaty.
