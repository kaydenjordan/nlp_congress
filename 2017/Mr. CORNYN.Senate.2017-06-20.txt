 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we continue to make progress on  legislation to clean up the mess left by the meltdown of ObamaCare, at  least insofar as it affects the lives of millions of people who buy  their insurance on the individual markets. These are individuals and  small businesses that don't have the benefit of large employer  healthcare plans, and they have been devastated by ObamaCare.   This is a rescue mission. ObamaCare is collapsing for millions of  people, and we have to act in the interest of countless families and  small businesses that are suffering tremendous harm.   I have told the stories myself; others have likewise told the  stories. We have seen those reported in the media. For many people,  healthcare costs, their insurance premiums are skyrocketing. We also  know that because of the distortion in the insurance markets, many  insurance companies are simply pulling out of counties and States  around the country, so people have no choices when it comes to  purchasing their healthcare on the exchanges. Of course, many people  continue to lose access to their doctors.   We need to contrast this with what was promised when ObamaCare was  passed. I know it sounds repetitive, but I am afraid that if we lose  sight of what the promises were with ObamaCare, we can't actually  calculate the tremendous harm and the deception that was involved in  actually delivering on that promise.   President Obama said that if you liked your policy, you could keep  it--not true. He said if you liked your doctor, you could keep your  doctor--also not true. He also said that a family of four could see an  average decrease in premiums of $2,500 a year--also not true.   What is the response of our Democratic friends? We saw last night  that they took to the Senate floor, and they gave impassioned speeches.   First of all, they criticized the Republicans for coming forward to  try to rescue the people who were being hurt by the failures of  ObamaCare. They criticized us for that. Then they said that it was a  secret bill after they had rejected every entreaty--every request--for  them to work with us on a bipartisan basis to rescue the people who are  being hurt by the failures of ObamaCare. They rejected that.   What did they do? They came to the Senate floor. They said that they  hate the bill that they have not seen yet. Then they said: Oh, it is  secret. So I guess it should be one or the other. Either they hate it  because they know what is in it or it is secret. It cannot be both.   The fact is that we are working hard to meet our own internal  deadline because we want to make sure that the people who will be hurt  in 2018, when the insurance companies raise their premiums by digits-- and they are in the process of getting those approved. It will occur in  the July-August timeframe when insurance companies will have to  calculate what the premium is that they will have to charge. Then they  will have to go to the State regulators and get approval for that  premium increase. What we are being told is that the 105-percent  increase in premiums on the exchanges since 2013--that is right, a 105- percent increase--is going to go up 20 percent or more next year unless  we come to the rescue of those who are being harmed by ObamaCare.   We would say to our Democratic colleagues: Please do not wear  yourselves out by doing something that is going to accomplish nothing.  Channel all of that energy and that passion into trying to do something  that will actually help the people who are being hurt today by the  failures of ObamaCare.   They went even further. They said, well, they may decide just to  obstruct the Senate's business on other matters that are not healthcare  related until they can see the bill, which they will get to see soon.   As soon as we see the final product, we will get it scored by the  Congressional Budget Office. Then we will have, literally, a vote- arama, where there will be an opportunity to debate in a fulsome and  comprehensive sort of way and an opportunity to offer dozens--if not  hundreds--of amendments to the bill, and we will vote. We will vote, as  that is what we do.   There is nothing happening in secret here. In the fullness of time,  we will all see the product we have been working on. As a result of  their refusal to work with us, we have been working on it the best we  can to try to accomplish something better than the failed status quo of  ObamaCare.   We are told that they may obstruct the Senate's other business,  including committee work. That is unrelated to the healthcare debate  but, I guess, is just their lashing out in trying to find some way that  they can make life a little more difficult here in the Senate with  regard to our accomplishing other important work as well.   I happen to serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee. One of the  things that we are doing is a comprehensive investigation of Russia's  active measures undertaken during the last election. We have a  committee meeting this afternoon.   Are Democrats really going to obstruct the Senate Intelligence  Committee's work in conducting and completing its investigation into  Russian activities in the 2016 election? Are they really going to do  that? It strikes me as nuts.   On Thursday, for example, we also have a Judiciary Committee meeting  that is scheduled to consider a critically important bill that I  introduced with my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Klobuchar, to help  fight human trafficking.   Are Democrats going to obstruct our ability to conduct our business  and block our consideration of bills involving human trafficking and  providing relief for the victims?   This bill reauthorizes key programs that support survivors, and it  provides  [[Page S3617]]  additional resources to Federal, State, and local law enforcement  officials who are on the frontlines of fighting this heinous crime.   Will the Democratic leader from New York jeopardize the committee's  ability to actually consider and pass this law? Does he plan to block a  Member of his own political party from advancing her bill to fight  human trafficking as well?   This strikes me as wrong for a number of reasons, and I think it  would actually be appalling if our Democratic colleagues, out of their  frustration--frankly, borne out of their failure to do their job and  work with us to find a solution to the meltdown of ObamaCare--lashed  out in a way that affected victims of human trafficking and affected  the Senate's ability to conduct its investigation into the Russian  activities involved in our election.   Now is not the time to grandstand and make damaging, symbolic  gestures like this because, while our Democratic colleagues talked a  lot last night, we did not hear anything from them about the current  realities of ObamaCare and how it has failed the American people. They  seem to be whistling by the graveyard. We did not hear anything about  rising costs or the lack of choices.   I talked to one of my Democratic colleagues this morning. He told me  that his own son was looking at $7,500 premiums a year and at a $5,000  deductible. This friend, a Democrat--and I will not reveal his name  because I do not think it would be appropriate to do so--told me that  his own son had to spend $12,500 out of pocket before his insurance  actually kicked in. That is a disaster, not just for his son but for  millions of people who are negatively affected by ObamaCare. Yet our  friends across the aisle want to flail about and threaten to block  trafficking legislation or an investigation into the Russian  involvement in the election.   The only thing they have not done is offer a constructive  alternative. That is the only thing they have not done. They have tried  about everything else. You know why, of course. It is that we know what  the alternative is.   Basically, they did ObamaCare all by themselves. I remember. I was  here on the Senate floor, in 2010, on Christmas Eve. I think it was at  about 7:30 in the morning when we had the vote out of the Senate that  passed ObamaCare. It was a pure party-line vote. So the Democrats have  had it all to themselves--the ability to design a healthcare system  that they thought America should have. It has failed time and again.   Do you know what their current proposal is right now? It is a single- payer option that puts our country even more in debt and that we know  does not work.   The reason we know it does not work is that it will, no doubt,  emulate things like the British National Health Service, which has  resulted in two-tiered healthcare--healthcare for people who cannot  otherwise afford to pay out of their pockets to get better healthcare,  with all of the problems of government-run healthcare added to it, but  far-left elements of the Democratic Party want a plan that goes even  further than ObamaCare. That, I believe, could ultimately be their  goal--one that would increase government spending on healthcare by  $518.9 billion just this year, ballooning to $6.6 trillion between 2017  and 2026, according to the Urban Institute.   Take a look at the State of California, where a similar proposal--a  single-payer system--was pushed at the State level there to enact a  single-payer system that would add $400 billion each year to the  California State budget. I think that is roughly double the amount of  the whole budget for the State of California--$400 billion each year.   It strikes me that at least one conclusion you might draw from this  is that our Democratic friends' solution, rather than trying to work  with us in a bipartisan way to save people who are being hurt from the  failures of ObamaCare, is to say: Let's throw more money at it. That is  not going to work. What it will do is add to our national debt without  solving the healthcare problem, and it will further burden future  generations who will have to pay that money back at some point.   We already have about $20 trillion in national debt. These young  people up here who are serving as pages are going to have to deal with  that, I guess, unless we have the courage to do it ourselves. It  strikes me as profoundly immoral for us to spend the money today and  say: Well, our kids and grandkids are going to have to pay it back  later. That is immoral.   If we thought ObamaCare crushed any semblance of competition in the  healthcare marketplace, the single-payer plan from our friend Senator  Bernie Sanders, from Vermont, who is the chief spokesman for the  Democrats in the Senate on what an alternative might look like, removes  competition completely because it is a government takeover. It takes  away even more authority from State and local governments, and it takes  away choices from individuals. Forget ``if you like your doctor, you  can keep your doctor. If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.''  Forget all of that because it is the opposite of what American families  have repeatedly asked for.   This is what the extreme factions in the Democratic Party want. They  want to expand government. They want an even larger takeover of  healthcare, and they want to simply throw more money at it--as if we  are not spending enough money already. Throwing more money at the  problem certainly will not fix it. I suggest that it will only make  things worse.   We need to be realistic about what it will take to rework our  healthcare system and put patients first. I am under no illusion as to  what Republicans are going to be able to come up with on our own, given  the constraints of the fact that the Democrats will not work with us at  all and appear not to be in the business of lifting a finger to help  the millions of people who are being hurt. I am not under any illusion  that what we are going to be able to come up with--and it is an interim  step--is going to be perfect, as no legislation ever is, but I think we  are obligated to do our best. The fact that our Democratic friends will  not help at all makes it a lot harder, but I do not think we can say:  It is too hard. We cannot do it. We give up.   We are committed on this side of the aisle and invite our colleagues  on that side of the aisle to work with us to fix the problems that are  caused by ObamaCare and to implement real healthcare reforms that will  work.   First of all, we need to stabilize the market--I mentioned this  earlier--and rescue millions of folks who are losing all of their  access to coverage because insurance companies are simply quitting  because they are bleeding money. They cannot charge a high enough  premium that somebody will actually pay, so they leave the market. In  Texas, alone, there are dozens of counties that have only one insurance  marketplace option. If we do nothing, I fear there will be no choices.  When there is only one choice, the economic backlash is pretty simple.  There is no competition to drive down costs and improve the quality of  coverage.   I think this is, really, in some ways, a test of our convictions. If  you really do believe that competition in the marketplace improves  quality and cost for the consumer, as I do, then going to a single- payer system or even trying to repair ObamaCare is the opposite of what  we should do. We need to return the market to a competitive one so that  families can have the ability to make choices about their healthcare,  what suits their needs, not what government is going to force you to  buy, and if you do not buy the government-approved plan, it is going to  punish you by fining you. That is what the status quo is like under  ObamaCare.   ObamaCare is so bad that, currently, we have almost 30 million people  who are still uninsured. About 6.5 million of them simply pay the  penalty--I think it is $695 a year now--instead of buying the  government-approved healthcare plan. They figure that paying the  penalty is better than buying the insurance for them. Then there are  others--millions more--who simply opt out because of hardship. If the  goal of ObamaCare were universal coverage, it has failed that goal as  well. So we need to stabilize the market.   Secondly, we need to address ObamaCare's skyrocketing premium  increases. We all know that if ObamaCare stays in place, premiums will  stand only to rise for consumers. That is something I think our friends  across the aisle are missing as well.   [[Page S3618]]  Doing nothing is not an option because people are going to be even more  priced out of the marketplace, assuming they can find an insurance  company to sell them healthcare.    In Texas, a Houston-area insurer has asked for a 16-percent annual  rate hike for its 2018 ObamaCare coverage--a 16-percent increase over  this year they want for next year. That is what doing nothing will do.  It warns it might even need a greater increase just to cover its costs.   Private businesses can't actually operate in the red like the Federal  Government does. Private businesses can't just print more money or run  up $20 trillion in debt. So when they can't make money, they simply  have to raise premiums or they have to quit the market.   The third thing we need to do is this. Remember, the first thing I  said is stabilize the market. The second is attack premiums to bring  them down, and the third thing we need to do is make sure we continue  to protect American citizens from preexisting conditions. This is  something I think everybody believes that needs to happen, without  regard to political or ideological affiliation. No one should be denied  basic healthcare because they have a preexisting condition, and we want  to preserve those protections. That is the third goal.   The fourth goal is to make Medicaid, which is the medical safety net  for millions of people, sustainable into the future. Right now we know  it is not sustainable, like our other entitlement programs. The way we  want to do that is by giving States more flexibility. We want to make  sure that those who rely on the program don't have the rug pulled out  from under them, and we want to make sure that it continues to grow  year after year, but at a sustainable rate.   Right now, there is no cap, no rate of increase provided. So it is an  unlimited entitlement. One of the suggestions from the House bill is to  grow it each year at the rate of the consumer price index for medical  costs; that is, medical inflation plus 1 percent. In other words, more  money would be spent next year than this year. Even more money than  next year will be spent the following year and so on, but it will be  done at a sustainable rate.   Finally, we want to free the American people from the onerous  ObamaCare mandates that require them to purchase insurance they don't  want and can't afford. It shouldn't be a surprise to anybody that if  you take the penalty away and don't force the American people to buy  insurance they don't want, many of them--the younger, healthy ones, in  particular--will decide not to buy it. That is called freedom of  choice. That is not what ObamaCare did. ObamaCare forced people to buy  something they didn't want and penalized them if they didn't. So many  people will choose not to purchase it and decide to handle their  healthcare in other ways--perhaps, at the emergency room, where under  Federal law everybody who comes in as a medical emergency is entitled  to be treated. It is not what I would tell my daughters. It is not what  I would recommend for anybody, but if somebody wants to make that  choice, it is certainly their right.   So I would just conclude by observing that it is shameful that  Members on the other side of the aisle sit on their hands and do  nothing to fix a law that continues to hurt American families. We know  that regardless of who won the last election--whether it was Hillary  Clinton or whether it was Donald Trump--we would have to take steps to  address this failed law. So I would implore our Democratic friends to  listen to their own stories, which some have recounted to me in  confidence. So I won't repeat their names here, but they know this is a  problem. They have heard from their constituents just like we have. So  we would implore them to work with us to try to help us help our  constituents. That is what I thought we were here for.   Americans are ready for healthcare reform that actually works, and it  is our responsibility to do our very best to provide that to them, and  that is what we intend to do.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Carolina (Mr. Graham).
