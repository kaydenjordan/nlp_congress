 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for the  President's counsel.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question is from Senator Johnson for the President's counsel:         If House Managers were certain it would take months to       litigate a subpoena for John Bolton, why shouldn't the Senate       assume lengthy litigation and make the same decision as the       House made--reject a subpoena for John Bolton?    Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, I  think that is precisely the point. And the fact is that if, in fact, we  are to go down that road of a witness or witnesses that had national-- in the case of Ambassador Bolton, high-ranking NSA--this is an  individual that is giving the President advice at the highest level.  The Supreme Court has been very consistent on that. That is where  privileges are at their highest level. The presumed privilege,  actually, is what the Supreme Court has said.   And in a situation like this, I think we are going down a road--if  the Senate goes down this road--of a lengthy proceeding with a lot more  witnesses. And then I want to ask this question and just plant it as a  thought: Is that going to be the new norm for impeachment? You put an  impeachment together in a couple of weeks. We don't like what the  President did. We get it through in a 2-day proceeding in front of the  Judiciary Committee. We wrap it up and we send it up here and say: Now  go figure it out. Because that is what this is really becoming. That is  what this actually is.   So I think, if we are looking at the institutional interests that are  at stake here, this is a very dangerous precedent because what they are  doing--what they are saying is basically: We have enough to prove our  case--that is what Manager Schiff says--but not really, so we really  need more evidence--not because we need it; because we want it. But we  didn't want it bad enough when we were in the House, so we didn't get  it. So now you issue the subpoena, and then let's duke it out in court  and see what happens.   It sounds like, to me, that this is--they are acting like this is  some municipal traffic court proceeding. I remind everybody that we are  talking about--under their Articles of Impeachment, they are requesting  the removal of the President of the United States. So, you know, they  are already saying in the media that their ongoing investigation here-- they are going to continue to investigate. So are we going to be doing  this every 3 weeks, every month except in the summer? There is an  election months away. The people should have a right to vote. My  colleague Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, said that.   So when I look at all of this, whether it is the late need of  witnesses after you prove your case, whether privileges apply or not  apply--Senator Schumer said: We get anybody we want--we would be here  for a very, very long time, and that is not good for the United States.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Democratic leader is recognized.
