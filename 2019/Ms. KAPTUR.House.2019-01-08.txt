 Madam Speaker, the President's demand for $5 billion for  a wall won't stop the drug trade, and here is why: The drugs will keep  flowing in here, due to NAFTA and CAFTA's exploding continental trade  resulting from U.S. jobs being shipped south of our border and the  goods they produce down there being transshipped back here with an  endless flow of trucks, planes, ships, and railcars. Colombian drug  cartels figured this out when NAFTA came along.   Madam Speaker, I have a story from last Friday's Wall Street Journal,  entitled: `` `El Chapo' Jury Told of Cartel's Tricks, From Submarines  to Laundry Carts.'' Two characters among the most significant drug  traffickers ever extradited to our country are undergoing trial.   They explain how massive amounts of cocaine and methamphetamines were  ferried from Colombia through Mexico into major U.S. cities and how the  cartel hired families from the United States to drive down through El  Paso into Mexico and bring back contraband material hidden in  compartments in their cars. This is a shot of Laredo, Texas, just one  of hundreds of portals into our country.   Madam Speaker, the trucks go for miles from the control point all the  way back. This is how the majority of contraband material comes into  this country, through those portals of entry. A wall will not solve the  major reason these materials end up in this country.                            ____________________
