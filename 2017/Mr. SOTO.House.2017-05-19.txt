 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Direct Connect  to Success Act.   In my district and across the State of Florida, hundreds of thousands  of striving students start in community colleges and automatically get  admitted into our 4-year universities if they graduate with a minimum  of 2.0. A 4-  [[Page H4362]]  year degree opens up even more opportunities for these students, many  of whom come from underserved and rural areas.   This has been a nationally recognized program that is only available  in a few States, but by expanding this simple, proven program  nationwide, we will extend the opportunity to continue higher education  to millions more hardworking, deserving students.   We can all agree that government has a role to play in reducing  barriers to success, and this guaranteed admission is a low-cost,  highly efficient way to remove this big barrier. I ask you and others  to join me in support of the Direct Connect to Success Act to create  more opportunities to pursue the American Dream for all students.                            ____________________
