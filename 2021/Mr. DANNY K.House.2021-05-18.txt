 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I want to thank  Representative Sheila Jackson Lee for reminding us what a difference  100 years make. But, you know, 100 years or so ago, there was a race  riot in Searcy, Arkansas. Thousands of African Americans were murdered.   A little more than 100 years ago, there was a riot in Chicago,  Illinois, where hundreds of African Americans were injured. But then  100 years ago in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Black Wall Street, a community where  people had labored, worked hard, seriously put everything into it that  they could, was destroyed. Yet in my town, there is a John Rogers, who  is a descendant. His great grandfather owned the hotel.   John Hope Franklin, the great historian, his relatives were part of  that massacre and the events surrounding it. So Representative Sheila  Jackson Lee, thank you for reminding us that we can never forget and  never go back.
