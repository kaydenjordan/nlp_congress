 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to tell this body about a  tremendous success story with healthcare in my district: the story of  our free medical clinics and their membership in and longtime  association with the South Carolina Free Clinic Association.   Founded in 2001 under the umbrella of the South Carolina Hospital  Association, the South Carolina Free Clinic Association is an  independent, nonprofit membership organization that provides training,  research, resource development, and advocacy to member free clinics.   Additionally, the South Carolina Free Clinic Association was  incorporated as an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization in  January of 2008.   The South Carolina Free Clinic Association represents and supports  our State's network of 40 free clinics in 25 counties across South  Carolina. The member free clinics provide comprehensive care to  economically disadvantaged individuals all across our great State,  including those individuals who are both uninsured and/or underinsured.   The South Carolina Free Clinic Association is the only statewide  organization that supports and advocates for South Carolina's free  clinic network and for the various and truly diverse populations they  serve.   South Carolina Free Clinic Association is improving the quality and  access of healthcare to South Carolina's medically underserved  individuals and communities. The South Carolina Free Clinic Association  does this by assisting their members to be valued and engaged partners  in their communities' systems of care.   Through financial support from foundations, fundraisers, and  individual donations and through the efficient use of donated supplies  and volunteer provider services, South Carolina's free clinics were  responsible for the following activities and achievements in 2017:  $108,839,801 total value of services provided; 363,369 prescriptions  which were filled; 40,062 patients were treated; 4,442 volunteers; and  40 member clinics in 65 sites across South Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, free clinics are truly vital, safety net healthcare  organizations that utilize a volunteer and staff model to provide a  range of healthcare services, which may include medical, dental,  pharmacy, vision, and/or behavioral health services to economically  disadvantaged individuals.   Such clinics are 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations or operate as a  program component or affiliate of a 501(c)(3) organization. Entities  that otherwise meet the above definition but charge a nominal or  sliding fee to patients may still be considered free clinics provided  essential services are delivered regardless of the patient's ability to  pay.   Free clinics limit eligibility for their services to individuals who  are uninsured, underinsured, and/or have limited access or no access to  primary, specialty, or prescription healthcare.   Every free clinic is unique. Each clinic has its own qualification  guidelines. But they all serve low-income and no-income patients  without health insurance who do not qualify for government assistance.   In addition to general medical and prescription services, free  clinics may offer such services as oral health, specialty services and  referrals, lab testing, diagnostic procedures, and health education and  prevention, as well as prescription medications.   Free clinics are independent, community-based, nonprofit  organizations that rely on grants and donations from their communities  for support. Clinics have a varied base of community support, which  includes but is not limited  [[Page H4857]]  to individuals, businesses, churches, foundations, and government.   I would like to recognize and applaud the efforts of the South  Carolina Free Clinic Association and its executive director, Virginia  Ann Mullikin, for their support of more than 40,000 South Carolina  families.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, with the passage of the bipartisan budget  agreement back in February, Congress essentially gave themselves a  blank check to spend billions and billions more of taxpayers' dollars  over the next two fiscal years.   Our national debt stands at over $21 trillion and we decided to spend  more. How does that make any sense? People back home continuously ask  me why our government keeps spending and spending. You know what I tell  them? I have no idea. I have no idea why Members of Congress willingly  go along with this abysmal continued spending. I have no idea why we  would cut taxes for millions of Americans, grow our economy  exponentially, and then decide to spend more.   If anything, now is the time to get spending under control. Now is  the time to rein in reckless spending habits. My amendment should not  even be controversial. It simply cuts spending back to what they were  last year. $1.5 billion is a drop in the bucket compared to our  national debt. We need to start somewhere.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.  [[Page H4956]]
