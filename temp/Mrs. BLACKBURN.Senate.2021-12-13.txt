 Madam President, the time has come to once again bid  farewell to another one of Team Blackburn's esteemed fellows.   Over the past year, we have had the privilege of working with Capt.  Edward Pritchard, who came to us from the U.S. Marine Corps to serve as  our first Department of Defense fellow.   It was a strange year to be a fellow here in the Senate, but Ed rose  to the occasion and impressed us. He impressed every one of us with his  work ethic, humor, and his singular commitment to maintaining the  strength and integrity of the U.S. military. It has truly been an honor  having Ed on our team, and I think I speak for each and every one of us  when I say we will miss him.   Captain Pritchard, I thank you for your service to Tennessee and to  this great Nation and wish you all the best as you head across the  river to the Pentagon to start the next exciting chapter in your  already distinguished career.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Captain  Edward Pritchard, a Department of Defense fellow with my team, be  granted floor privileges for the remainder of this Congress.
