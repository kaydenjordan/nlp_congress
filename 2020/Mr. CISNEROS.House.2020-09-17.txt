 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this  resolution condemning all forms of anti-Asian sentiment related to  COVID-19.   The AAPI community in the 39th District has been an integral part of  fighting the coronavirus. They are first responders, essential workers,  educators, and small business owners.   Yet there have been too many stories in my district and across the  country of racism, discrimination, and physical and verbal assault  towards Asian Americans.   I had the opportunity to hear some of these stories during one of my  town halls, including the emotional encounter of a constituent from  Brea, California. This young woman was unable to pick up her mother's  prescription drugs due to racist aggressive remarks she received that  were directed towards her. She left, running away in tears.   This resolution will assure that cases like hers are justly  investigated and receive the attention they deserve.   I thank my colleague Representative Meng for her leadership, and I  urge my colleagues to vote in support of this resolution to ensure  protection, safety, and respect for our AAPI community.
