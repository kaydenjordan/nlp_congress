 Mr. Speaker, you have just heard from a man, J.D. Greear,  that I have the distinct privilege of calling my friend.   Pastor J.D. Greear leads The Summit Church in Durham, North Carolina.  Under Pastor J.D.'s leadership, The Summit Church has gone from 300  members to over 10,000, making it one of the fastest growing churches  in our country.   His vision is to plant 1,000 new churches around the world by the  year 2050.   He believes the deeper we dive into the extravagant love of Christ,  the more our lives will be filled with unquenchable joy, reckless  generosity, and audacious faith.   Pastor J.D. is the author of several life-transforming books and is  the current president of the Southern Baptist Convention.   One of his most important accomplishments is his dedication to his  wife, Veronica, and their four children.   It is an honor to have him here in Washington, D.C., today. He is  also the mentor of my pastor, Andrew Hopper.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to his continued work as a father, as a  pastor, and as a leader.                            ____________________
