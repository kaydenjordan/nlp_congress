 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This is a problem that has been vexing representatives from our  territory of Guam for many years now. I appreciate the gentleman from  Guam, who has adequately explained what he is attempting to do and what  this bill actually does. I congratulate him on this bill, which is  finally going to recognize and compensate a very small group but a  significant group of people who literally sacrificed for this country.   This is the right thing to do. This House has done this before. This  passed out of our committee on a voice vote. It has passed on the floor  on a voice vote. It then went to the Senate, where the Senate felt  compelled to make changes, as is their wont to do. And in lightning  speed, the Senate, in only 8 months, was able to strike the 22 lines  and return this bill to us.   So, lest we vex them even further and ask them to do something else,  I would urge everyone in here to give this another ``yes'' vote and  send this on to the President's desk immediately from this floor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
