 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the passage of  the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, a piece of legislation of  which I am a proud co-sponsor. Importantly, this bill protects workers'  rights to unionize, holds employers accountable for violating workers'  rights, and ensures unions can have free, fair, and safe elections. By  empowering workers to exercise their rights to organize, workers will  be given the power to override ``right-to-work'' laws that prevent  unions from collecting dues from the workers they represent.   It is significant to me that this body is coming together to pass  this legislation on the same day as Mr. Joseph ``Joe'' Girolamo's 100th  birthday. Mr. Girolamo of Livonia, Michigan is a veteran of World War  II and the son of Italians, family he had a chance to visit while  serving overseas. In a recent interview with Hometown Life, Mr.  Girolamo shared that after returning home he moved to Livonia with his  late wife Lillian. They met playing music and settled down in 1953. Mr.  Girolamo worked at the River Rouge complex in Dearborn. He witnessed  workers being treated unfairly and became a union man, and spent years  advocating for workers' rights. His daughter Joyce Hermann shared with  Hometown Life, ``So, there were actually thugs and goons running the  place. It was a difficult situation until the union came in. He made  sure  [[Page H1154]]  everything was done by the book and his workers weren't doing anything  unsafe. It was a really big change back then.''   Earlier today as I wished Mr. Girolamo by phone a Happy Birthday and  thanked him for his work with the American Legion and the Veterans of  Foreign Wars, I got to listen to him play his harmonica and proudly  informed him that today we were passing the PRO Act. He informed me he  was smiling over the phone and glad to hear it.   When I think about the legacy and shoulders of giants we stand on in  the Congress, it's incredible patriots like Joe, who represent the best  of America and Michigan. I am proud and grateful we were able to take  another productive step in the direction of the working men and woman  in this country and all they are counting on to earn a decent living  and save for retirement.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a Michigander as my home  State is recognizing 1 year from the arrival of our first cases of  COVID-19.   I rise today to say that more help is on the way, that today we are  delivering for the American people and delivering for my home State of  Michigan.   I rise today to say that we passed the PRO Act to stand up for  hardworking Michiganders, that we will get rid of right-to-work, that  people are at the heart of what we do here in this Chamber, and that by  prioritizing the legislation that stands up for hardworking Americans,  we are delivering for them.   Tomorrow, we will pass the Butch Lewis Act. We will right the  pensions of almost a million Americans. That is what we came here to  do. That is what unity is.                            ____________________
