 Madam Speaker, I think what we need, again, is a little  truth, transparency, and consistency.   I will share, as a mother of four, I resent the fact that you tell me  that I don't care about children. In fact, when you have soft-on-crime  policies, I need my Second Amendment right to protect my own children  because the soft-on-crime policies don't help.   During these debates, on these unconstitutional--you know the thing  we all took an oath to uphold--gun bills, the Democrats have been  making the claim, well, if you can't buy alcohol or cigarettes, you  shouldn't be able to buy an AR-15.   All right. Let's stick with that concept. Here is a concept: Apply it  throughout every form. But let's talk about a couple of things that the  Democrats feel you are mature enough to do under the age of 18.  Because, once again, their standards clearly aren't consistent. What a  concept, to be consistent.   Democrats believe that under the age of 18, you should be able to get  an abortion. While you are at it, don't even talk to your parents about  it.    Under the age of 18, Democrats think you should be able to change  your sex without notifying parents.   At 18, you can vote.   At 18, you can join the military and lay your life on the line for  this country.   And I bet they think that the 18-year-old Buffalo shooter is actually  mature enough to be charged as an adult, right?   So, again, let's have some consistency in our standards.
