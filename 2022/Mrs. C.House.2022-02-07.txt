'' She had a  phenomenal staff, Carolyn Smith. She had an African-American woman as  her chief of staff. She was one of the few, like Ron Dellums, who had  senior staff members who were Black, Black women, three of us on the  Hill at that point. So she lived a life that we can all be proud of and  how she paved the way for so many of us to be here as Members of  Congress, but also throughout the country as members of elected bodies  and corporate boardrooms. Congresswoman Chisholm made sure that she  left her legacy so that, yes, as someone said earlier, we finally have  the first African-American Vice President in the country. Because of  Shirley Chisholm, I am. Because of Shirley Chisholm, Kamala Harris is.   Madam Speaker, I thank my staff Rico Doss and Kayla Williams on my  staff for really pulling this all together and helping us with all of  this. And, Sheila, your staff and the Congressional Black Caucus  members' staff because without our staff--as I know because I was a  staffer for many years--none of this would have happened tonight. So I  thank you guys very much.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
