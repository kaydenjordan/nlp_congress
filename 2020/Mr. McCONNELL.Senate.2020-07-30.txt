 Madam President, on Monday, Senate Republicans  released a starting proposal for another major pandemic rescue package.   This is what we want to do: Continue a Federal supplement to  unemployment benefits that is otherwise about to expire; send thousands  of dollars more in cash to American families; keep funding the Payroll  Protection Program to prevent more layoffs; subsidize rehiring to get  laid-off workers their jobs back and create new incentives for  workplace safety; give K-12 schools, colleges, and universities funding  to reopen safely--more money than the House Democrats have proposed;  support healthcare providers in the latest hotspots and keep supporting  the race for vaccines; provide commonsense legal protection so that  schools, hospitals, and other employers can reopen without being buried  in lawsuits.   That is what we put forward--a trillion dollars for kids, jobs, and  healthcare. It is a framework that is more generous in key areas than  House Democrats' totally unserious proposal--a framework that could  have kept the additional Federal payments to unemployed workers flowing  instead of expiring this week.   There is a fact of life here in the Senate. It takes 60 votes to  legislate, so the American people cannot get any of the additional  relief that Republicans want to give them unless Democrats at least  come to the table. Either our Democratic colleagues come to the table  or the American people will not get the help they need. That is why I  said this week we have come down to one key question: Will the country  get the Democrats who showed up back in March to pass the bipartisan  CARES Act or will the country get the Democrats who showed up in June  to block police reform and keep that issue alive through November?   Unfortunately, 3 days in, it hasn't been a close call. The Speaker of  the House and the Democratic leader refuse to let anyone else speak on  their side. I understand the Democratic leader has actually forbidden-- forbidden his own Democratic ranking members from talking and  negotiating with their Republican counterparts who are spearheading the  different components. You see, bipartisan, Member-level discussions  might actually generate some progress, and progress does not appear  [[Page S4600]]  to be something the leaders on the other side want.   On Monday, the Speaker of the House claimed she could not wait to  start negotiations, but then on Tuesday, she said her discussion with  the administration ``isn't a negotiation.'' And then the Speaker said:  ``The appropriate thing for the Senate to do is pass a bill and then we  can negotiate with them.'' Meanwhile, the Democratic leader is over  here making sure that cannot happen. This is quite the partnership: the  House Speaker moves the goalposts while the Democratic leader hides the  football. They will not engage when the Trump administration tries to  discuss our comprehensive plan. They will not engage when the  Administration floats a narrower proposal. They, basically, will not  engage, period.   The Speaker and the Democratic leader are playing rope-a-dope with  the health, welfare, and livelihoods of American families. With  benefits expiring, with the Paycheck Protection Program winding down,  and millions unemployed, the Democrats are saying ``my way or the  highway'' with a Socialist wish list that was laughed off by everyone  from journalists to economists the instant they introduced it.   This is what reporters had to say about Speaker Pelosi's proposal in  May:   ``The more than 1,800-page bill makes a long wish list for  Democrats.''   ``Neither this bill nor anything reassembling it will ever become  law.''   Even the Speaker's own Democratic Members knew it was a joke.  ``Privately, several House Democrats concede the bill feels more like  an effort to appease the most liberal members of the caucus.''   Yet this is what they are holding out for. Let's recall some of the  specific items. These are the things over which Democrats are blowing  up negotiations and forcing a lapse in extra unemployment benefits: tax  increase on small businesses; taxpayer-funded checks for illegal  immigrants; taxpayer-funded diversity studies of the legal pot  industry; and their ongoing obsession with something called the State  and local tax, or SALT, which would be a massive giveaway for high  earners in blue States. In other words, a tax cut for high earners in  blue States. Let me say that again. Democrats are holding up help for  struggling people over special tax breaks for rich people in blue  States, an idea that has been criticized by economists from all sides.   Republicans want to get more help to families right now, but Speaker  Pelosi says: Let them eat SALT.   They also want to spend another trillion dollars bailing out State  and local governments that only spent--listen to this--25 percent of  the money we sent them back in March. Some State and local governments  have only spent 25 percent of the money we sent them back in March, and  the Speaker and Democratic leader want to send them another trillion  dollars.   This is silly stuff. None of it should be stopping negotiations and  none of it would be if our Democratic colleagues actually wanted to get  an outcome.   Let's talk about unemployment insurance. Both Republicans and  Democrats agree in these extraordinary times it makes sense for the  Federal Government to provide the stark additional help on top of  normal unemployment. Republicans don't want this aid to expire. Our  plan continues it, but the Speaker and the Democratic leader say they  will not agree to anything unless the program pays people more to stay  home than to work.   Prominent Democrats have publicly said they agree with our position.  The Democratic Governor of Connecticut says he wants to continue the  benefit at a more targeted level. Multiple Members of the Senate and  Speaker Pelosi's own House Democratic Majority Leader have all said in  the last few days that they are open to negotiating this, but the  Speaker and the Democratic leader have cut all their colleagues out.  They are standing alone, saying: ``Our way or the highway.'' And so  people are going to suffer.   I understand the Democratic leader said he felt offended when I noted  that some people are suggesting the Democrats' strange behavior is  explained by politics; that some people think Democrats are behaving  like national suffering would only hurt President Trump. Now, the  Democratic leader, himself, pointed that exact accusation at various  Republicans during the Obama Presidency on multiple occasions. I know  memories can be short around here when it is convenient.   More broadly, actions speak louder than words. Democrats spent weeks  shouting that the Senate should act on police reform, but when Senator  Tim Scott gave them the chance, they blocked action. They blocked the  Senate from even taking up the subject. And now, so far, this is the  sequel.   Democrats talked a big game about wanting to provide more assistance,  but now that it is ``go time,'' they show zero appetite for any  bipartisan outcome at all.   This is personal for me. Kentucky has not finished fighting with the  coronavirus, and the Federal Government must not be finished helping  Kentucky. Laid-off Kentuckians need more help. Kentucky schools need  more help. Under our proposal, Kentucky alone would receive $193  million for testing and contact tracing to fight the spread of the  disease. This should be just as personal for every single Senator.   None of our States deserve the Democrats' rope-a-dope. No American  family deserves it. Don't my distinguished ranking member colleagues  wish they could be involved in robust bipartisan discussions with our  chairman, like back in March, and not watching from the sidelines as  their leader shuts down talks on TV? Do they really think the  Democratic leader's tactics are serving the common good of their  States?   Republicans have put forward a framework that would do huge amounts  of good for huge numbers of American families. If Democrats ever come  to the table, we will be able to bridge our differences and make a law.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, on Monday, the Republicans introduced a  trillion-dollar proposal to give American families more coronavirus  relief. Most urgently, the Republicans want to continue a Federal  supplement to State unemployment insurance, which is set to expire, as  we all know, tomorrow.   If our Democratic colleagues had acted with the urgency that  struggling people deserve, we could right now be finishing up a major  bipartisan package for kids, jobs, and healthcare. If our Democratic  colleagues had acted with urgency, unemployed Americans wouldn't be  facing a total elimination of this extra help.   Instead, jobless Americans are staring down this cliff because  Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leader have refused to negotiate.  They have refused to move 1 inch from the Speaker's far-left proposal  that is so absurd and so unserious that their own moderate Democratic  Members began trashing it the instant it came out. This is the  multitrillion-dollar boondoggle that would tax and borrow in order to  provide a massive tax cut to the rich people in blue States--the SALT  giveaway; that would fund diversity studies of the legal pot industry;  and that would do 1,000 other things with no relationship whatsoever to  the crisis.   Just a few minutes ago, our colleague from Wisconsin tried to get  consent to continue the unemployment assistance to prevent it from  expiring tomorrow, and the Democratic leader objected unless he got to  pass the entirety of the massive wish list. The Republicans want to  continue this aid before it expires, but the Democratic leader says:  Let them eat SALT.   This is what was written about their proposal: ``Privately, several  House Democrats concede [the bill] feels like  [[Page S4617]]  little more than an effort to appease the most liberal members of the  caucus.''   Yet, now, Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leader have declared that  unemployed Americans will not get another cent--not another cent-- unless the Senate agrees to pass the entire bill that even the  Democrats say is ridiculous. This is their position: Unemployed people,  schools, hospitals, and American families will not see another dime  unless they get to cut taxes for millionaires in Brooklyn and San  Francisco. That is what this is about.   Sure, they will call the Republicans names for wanting to make sure  the system doesn't pay people more not to work, but the Democratic  leader gave away the game this morning. He said on the floor that he  now opposes even continuing the aid at the $600 level. They want  jobless aid to expire tomorrow--period. Lest we forget, just a few days  ago, multiple Democratic Senators and the Democratic House majority  leader were all saying they were prepared to negotiate and land  somewhere south of $600. Multiple Democrats said they were open to  continuing the aid at a level that didn't pay people more to stay home.   Now the Democratic leader hasn't just contradicted his colleagues and  refused to talk, he has gone even further and declared he will not even  let the aid continue at $600. The Democratic leader has tried to rule  out every option except that of leaving the Capitol today and beginning  his weekend with this unemployment benefit set to expire.   These aren't the actions, my friends, that would lead to any  agreement. They aren't the actions that will actually make a law.   I am not sure whether my Democratic colleagues really agree that  hurting unemployed people is their side's best political strategy, but  if that is their position, they will have to vote on it with the entire  country to see.   In just a moment, I am going to make the Senate vote on a privileged  motion that will be a motion to proceed to legislation which would be  used to prevent the unemployment aid from expiring.   We have a number of views on both sides of the best way to accomplish  that. The bill would be amendable. Nobody who actually wants to  negotiate, nobody who actually wants a bipartisan outcome would be  disadvantaged by merely proceeding to the debate.   We have had enough rope-a-dope. We have had enough empty talk. It is  time to go on the record. We will see who really wants a bipartisan  outcome for the country and who is trying their hardest to block one.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the  Senate the message to accompany S. 178, and I ask for the yeas and  nays.    Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment  with a further amendment, No. 2499.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 711.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.  [[Page S4623]]     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call be waived.
