 Mr. Speaker, this bill ignores the harm that anti-law  enforcement rhetoric and unchecked violence have inflicted on our  communities and our police.   Since last year, we have seen businesses and communities terrorized,  burned, and looted by criminal gangs and thugs, while some elected  officials justified the violence, called for defunding the police, and  moved to tie the hands of law enforcement. In essence, lawlessness  prevailed and accountability failed. This legislation doubles down on  that failed policy.   In my home State of Wisconsin, we watched city officials in Madison,  Kenosha, and Milwaukee stand by as violent rioters destroyed property,  monuments, shops, and livelihoods. Sheriffs in my home State tell me  they are having significant retention and recruiting issues. This will  only exacerbate that. It is a back door to the misguided defund the  police efforts. Defunding the police does not make the police safer.    Mr. Speaker, this bill empowers criminals, while stripping cops of  the tools they need to do their jobs and due process guaranteed to them  by the Constitution. It exposes law enforcement officers and their  families to potential retribution by criminals.
