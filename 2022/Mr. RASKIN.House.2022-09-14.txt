(c) Upon the offering of a motion pursuant to subsection       (a) concerning multiple measures, the ordering of the yeas       and nays on postponed motions to suspend the rules with       respect to such measures is vacated to the end that all such       motions are considered as withdrawn.        Sec. 12.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Reschenthaler), pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1339, providing for consideration of  three measures: H.R. 302, H.R. 2988, and H.R. 8326, all under  structured rules.   For H.R. 302, the rule provides 1 hour of general debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Oversight and Reform, makes in order one amendment, and  provides a motion to recommit.   For H.R. 2988 and H.R. 8326, the rule provides 1 hour of general  debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority  member of the Committee on Oversight and Reform for each bill, makes in  order four amendments for H.R. 2988 and three amendments for H.R. 8326,  and provides en bloc authority for both bills and motions to recommit  for both bills.   The rule further provides the majority leader or his designee the  ability this week to en bloc requested roll call votes on suspension  bills considered from September 13 to September 16.   Lastly, the rule provides same-day authority through September 30 for  a measure dealing with continuing appropriations for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2023.                                time  1300    Mr. Speaker, I rise proudly today in support of House Resolution  1339, the rule for three crucial bills, each of which will protect an  essential institution in American Government and public life that came  under serious attack in the previous administration: our Federal civil  service, whistleblowers acting against public corruption, and the  Census Bureau. All three bills were marked up and passed by the House  Committee on Oversight and Reform.   H.R. 302, the Preventing a Patronage System Act, is a bipartisan bill  led by Congressman Connolly of Virginia and Congressman Fitzpatrick of  Pennsylvania. This legislation will insulate our civil service against  partisan political interference and ensure that no future President can  fire government experts and civil servants simply to replace them with  their own political loyalists and sycophants.   The civil service system was created in the 19th century with the  explicit purpose of ending the so-called spoils system and ensuring  that Federal employees are hired, promoted, and fired based on their  qualifications and performance, not their political party connections  or the political favors and services they are willing to render to  elected officials.   The merit-based Federal workforce exists to effectively implement  Federal laws and programs passed by Congress and signed into law by the  President and translate those laws and programs into concrete results  and benefits for the American people. Professional civil servants, like  scientists, engineers, meteorologists, statisticians, economic  researchers, and policy analysts must be able to do their jobs and  advise government officials and the public based on empirical methods,  facts and data, not ideological filters and bars of political  correctness, and without fear of retaliation and discharge for  political reasons.   But the previous administration attempted to turn our civil service,  Mr. Speaker, into a top-down political and ideological party machine,  the kind that the original architects of civil service tried to  dismantle in the 19th century. In October of 2020, the former President  issued Executive Order 13957 to create Schedule F, a sweeping new  employment category for career civil servants who work on public policy  issues. Schedule F specifically targeted about 50,000 presently  nonpartisan policy experts, many of them holding advanced degrees and  having served for decades as policy experts across different  administrations with Presidents from different political parties.   For these civil servants, Schedule F would have stripped away their  rights, their merit-based legal protections, and their professional  independence. Civil servants transferred into the new Schedule F could  have been fired and replaced at any time for any political or  ideological reason or for no reason at all given by a hostile  administration. The 50,000 civil servants deemed to be involved in  formulating policy could have been swept up in a Schedule F political  purge and replaced with unqualified loyalists and flunkies, with  potentially catastrophic consequences for national security, the  continuity of  [[Page H7806]]  governance, and the evenhanded and effective enforcement of Federal  laws and programs.   The President already has the opportunity to appoint more than 4,000  political appointees. But Schedule F sought to go much further in  radically transforming the civil service into an instrument of the  chosen political ends and designs of the President.   Thankfully, President Joe Biden rescinded the order in January 2021.  However, several top Republicans have already expressed support for  picking up right where the previous administration left off with a new  Schedule F.   Our civil servants must be hired based on their merits and then  evaluated based on their actual job performance in office, not their  political party membership, not their ideological viewpoints, and not  their political campaign activism. Indeed, there are already processes  in place for evaluating Federal employees' actual job performance,  which is why in 2021, more than 10,000 Federal employees were removed  from their jobs for not living up to job expectations. That is how you  deal with people who are not actually doing their jobs. This bill is  precisely about ensuring that civil servants will be evaluated based on  their job performance and not the partisan political goals or  extracurricular demands of a particular administration.   As a member of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, which  considered this legislation carefully and reported it favorably and the  proud Representative of tens of thousands of Federal workers in  Maryland's beautiful Eighth District, I am proud to advance this bill  and urge all of my colleagues to support its passage on a bipartisan  basis. We have an urgent mandate to protect the historic merit-based  civil service and the integrity of the Federal Government against  anyone who would turn the clock back more than a century to allow  Presidents to convert our Federal workforce in service of agreed-upon  Federal laws and programs into an instrument of personal ambition,  campaign reelection, or party patronage.   Now, turning to H.R. 2988, the bipartisan Whistleblower Protection  Improvement Act of 2021, led by Chairwoman Maloney. This is another  piece of critical legislation in defense of another critical democratic  safeguard.   Whistleblowers are a great American institution and an important  mechanism for guaranteeing the integrity of government. Our protection  of whistleblowers reflects the fact that in our system of government,  we have checks and balances all the way down. An individual Federal  employee can hold even the most powerful government officials  accountable to the rule of law, which binds all of us. Whistleblowers  in American history have exposed self-dealing, bribery, kickbacks,  sweetheart contracts, lost and stolen Federal property, national  security failures, criminal coverups, other political corruption, war  crimes, rape and sexual harassment in the military, major public health  violations, episodes of environmental and toxic contamination, and the  systematic waste or pilfering of taxpayer dollars.   This bill will improve current protections for whistleblowers by  clearly prohibiting retaliatory investigations and other actions  against Federal employees who share information with Congress, the  House of Representatives, or the Senate, or with their supervisor. The  bill limits the public disclosure of the identity of whistleblowers and  extends whistleblower protections to new categories of Federal officers  and employees, including Public Health Service workers and the National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's commissioned officers.   The bill also contains provisions to ensure a timely and fair  procedure for whistleblowers facing discrimination and retaliation.  Currently, the backlog at the Merit Systems Protection Board means that  some whistleblowers may wait years for a hearing to be scheduled on  their claims. This bill grants whistleblowers access to a jury trial in  Federal district court if the Merit Systems Protection Board does not  render a timely decision in their case.   Whistleblowers are integral to government transparency and  accountability in our country. I strongly support this bill to ensure  whistleblowers can come forward without fear of reprisal or punishment.   The last bill before us, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 8326, the Ensuring a Fair  and Accurate Census Act, also led by Chairwoman Maloney, will protect  the Census Bureau against future efforts at political interference, and  it will ensure the Bureau's independence in the performance of its  essential duties.   The Census is a constitutional mandate and imperative. The U.S.  Constitution requires an actual enumeration of the whole number of  persons in the country for apportioning Representatives among the  States and Congress. The Census is an expression of the original  principle that democracy must rest on the Jeffersonian idea of the  consent of the governed. And, therefore, we need to know everyone who  is here and part of the sovereign people of the Nation. The Census  determines congressional apportionment of House seats and the  allocation of trillions of dollars of Federal spending. Even many  businesses in the private sector rely on Census Bureau statistics to  guide their decisions.   The previous administration's spectacular contempt for our  constitutional system was on full display during its many efforts to  interfere with the 2020 Census for purposes of political gain. The  effort to complete a comprehensive and effective Census was undermined  at every turn by efforts such as the unlawful plot to add the  citizenship question to the short form, which was struck down by the  Supreme Court, or the installation of a record-breaking number of  highly partisan political appointees to the ranks of the Bureau's  leadership. The reforms contained in the Ensuring a Fair and Accurate  Census Act will safeguard the integrity of the Census count against  this type of sinister political interference in the many years to come.   Mr. Speaker, I will reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to hear my good friend from  Pennsylvania make his presentation. I was surprised that he described  these three bills as completely irrelevant, given that one is about  protecting the integrity of the Federal civil service, a force of more  than 2 million people who are doing the work of the American people in  the National Park Service, the Department of Energy, the Department of  Defense, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security,  and so on.   I don't know what is completely irrelevant about that. Nor do I  understand what is completely irrelevant about protecting the rights  and our encouragement of Federal workers to be whistleblowers when  there is massive waste, fraud, abuse, or exploitation taking place with  the taxpayers' money. That is an essential purpose of government.   We have a government that is an instrument of the will of the people,  and we have a lot of public policies that are being enforced, but we  want to make sure that they are being enforced correctly and that the  people's taxpayer moneys are being respected.   The whistleblowers are helping us do that in blowing the whistle on  hundreds of millions of dollars of waste, corruption, and abuse that  have taken place. Why we would turn a blind eye to that and describe it  as completely irrelevant is beyond me.   Of course, the Census is foundational to the workings of American  democracy, and we want to prevent precisely the kind of political  finger-pointing all over the Census Bureau and our laws that we saw in  the last administration.   I am just curious whether the gentleman really believes that if the  current President suggested that we take 40,000 or 50,000 Federal  workers who presently have civil service protection and put them  directly under his control for political appointment, he would think  that is a good idea because our legislation will prevent any President  in the future from doing that, including this Democratic President, any  future Democratic Presidents, any future Republican Presidents or  Independents or anyone else.   We don't think that is a good idea, and I can't believe that my good  friend from Pennsylvania would just be agnostic as to that proposition.   Let me just say, finally, about the whole question of what is  relevant and what is irrelevant, it seems like all we are hearing from  the other side is embodied in the big statement coming out of the  Senate from Senator Lindsey Graham, saying it is time for a national  Federal ban on abortion that could even be exceeded by the States.   Now, originally, they said: Well, Roe v. Wade is settled precedent,  and we accept that.   Then, they packed the Court with their Justices, who were determined,  hellbent, on overturning Roe v. Wade, and they did it.   Then, we heard from our friends across the aisle: Well, this is a  matter for the States. Let the States decide.   Now, we hear from our colleagues in Congress that, no, they want a  national criminal ban on the right of women to make their own decisions  about their health, their families, their careers, and their futures.   Then, they will even allow States to go beyond that to completely ban  abortion, which is, of course, the essential pro-life position which we  have heard from our colleagues across the aisle. That is what they are  focused on.   Meantime, the President signed, this week, the Inflation Reduction  Act, which will dramatically lower healthcare costs for tens of  millions of Americans and, finally, overturn the Republican ban on the  government negotiating in the Medicare program with Big Pharma for  lower prescription drug prices.   We are actually making progress. They want to drag everyone into  their insatiable efforts to ban the right to abortion in America.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, my colleagues tempt me to wander afield from  what we have come here to talk about since they want to talk about  seemingly everything else. So let me try to respond to a few of the  points that have just been lobbed in our direction.   First, they seem to want to assign responsibility to the President of  the United States for the inflation rate. But then, surely, they will  assign responsibility to the President of the  [[Page H7809]]  United States for the unemployment rate, which now stands at around 3.5  percent, the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years. You have got to go  back a half century to find the kind of job situation that President  Biden has brought to the United States of America.   Last week, we learned that payroll employment is up by 315,000 in the  month of August alone. Since President Biden came into office, we have  added 668,000 manufacturing jobs.   Now, it is true the President has been fighting inflation ever since  he got into office. Why?   Well, the economy started to come roaring back--not just in America,  but all over the world in the wake of the pandemic. So we saw a  tremendous demand with broken supply chains. So what happens under the  law of supply and demand? The prices go up. But, unlike our colleagues  who seem to want to chortle about it and use it as a campaign talking  point, President Biden and the Democrats have been acting to bring  inflation down. Every single day.   Yesterday's Consumer Price Index data showed continued progress in  bringing global inflation down here in the U.S. economy. Gas prices are  down an average of $1.30 a gallon since the beginning of the summer.  Price increases slowed at the grocery store this month. Still too high.  But real wages went up again for a second month in a row, giving  hardworking families more breathing room.   It is amazing to me that some of the time has been delegated to one  of our distinguished colleagues who seem to want to blame these global  economic conditions arising from COVID-19 and the pandemic and broken  supply chains, as well as Vladimir Putin's filthy imperialist war in  Ukraine, which fortunately, the people of Ukraine, with the support of  a lot of people in this body--but not everybody--is starting to win.  And we have seen dramatic reversal of fortune in that war as the  democratic forces are beating Vladimir Putin and the autocrats in  Russia.   But in any event, we just heard someone who wanted to blame all of  these global economic conditions on an SEC regulation, which we are not  here to discuss and, therefore, unfortunately, I can't address. I might  agree with the gentleman, for all I know. It has nothing to do with the  legislation before us, and it is hard for me to believe that that is  the source of inflation around the world or the unemployment, which now  is practically at the bottom level that we have ever seen in over a  century.   But in any event, Mr. Speaker, back to the point at hand, I thought  we were going to be distracted with Republican calls to ban abortion  across the country. Well, the polls must be teaching them something  because I am not hearing about abortion today.   For many years, all I heard from them was abortion is murder, and the  millions of persons who are being murdered by abortion. They demanded  the overthrow of Roe v. Wade, and they got their way.   Yesterday, Senator Lindsey Graham introduced legislation for a  national criminal ban on abortion. But, of course, the so-called pro- life forces want to go further in the States and ban it completely. A  lot of them don't even want to allow exceptions for rape or incest.   I thought our colleagues were going to explain what their position  really is. I would invite them to do so as long as they don't want to  talk about the legislation before us today.   Why don't they tell us what their position on abortion is, because  America wants to know.   I think their position has changed somewhat. They are singing a  somewhat different tune since the people of Kansas, by 20 points,  destroyed their anti-choice agenda, and explained to them in numerical  terms that the people of America are on the side of freedom and the  rights of women and men and families to make their own decisions and  not to have those decisions be made by Lindsey Graham, one Senator, who  yesterday pronounced that he chose 15 weeks as the right point to  criminalize abortion. He chose that himself.   What is their position now? America wants to know. What is their  position?   Do they support a national criminal ban on abortion? Are they going  to allow any exceptions for rape or incest? What is their position on  it, if they don't want to talk about the legislation at hand?   Meantime, the Democrats continue to fight for lower drug prices, for  a record, unprecedented, historic investment in renewable energy.   We are addressing the problems of the future. At the same time, we  are defending the integrity of the Federal civil service and our  workforce, which was compromised and abused in so many ways by the last  administration.   We are defending the rights of whistleblowers to tell the truth about  what is taking place in terms of political and public corruption and  not to have to face retaliation from their supervisors. We are  defending the institutions of democracy, including the Census, against  all of the kinds of machinations and corruption and political abuse  that we saw in the last administration.   We are glad that the Supreme Court struck down their last  interference with the Census by trying to paste questions outside of  the rule of law on the short form. This legislation is designed to  protect the integrity of the Census along with the civil service, along  with the whistleblowers.   But as long as my dear colleagues and friends don't want to talk  about the legislation at hand, please clarify for America what their  plan is to take away the health rights of American women and their  families. Are they supporting the plan we heard yesterday announced by  Lindsey Graham for a nationwide Federal criminal ban?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the very distinguished gentleman from  Kentucky purported to speak for what Americans are worried about.  Undoubtedly, many Americans are worried about inflation, which is why  this administration has been taking strong action not just to get jobs  for everybody who wants a job and good jobs and union jobs for people,  but also to bring inflation down.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a New York Times article titled  ``U.S. Gas Prices Have Fallen for 91 Straight Days, a Relief for  Consumers.''                 [From the New York Times, Sept. 13, 2022]      U.S. Gas Prices Have Fallen for 91 Straight Days, a Relief for                                 Consumers                          (By Isabella Simonetti)         The price of gasoline continues to fall steadily, easing       pressure on American consumers as the cost of filling a tank       continued to tumble from record levels reached earlier in the       summer.        Gas prices fell 10.6 percent in August, which helped       moderate still-sky-high inflation, Tuesday's Consumer Price       Index report showed.        The energy index, which tracks gasoline and electricity       among other energy sources, dropped 5 percent last month, as       electricity and natural gas prices rose.        After peaking at $5.02 in June, gasoline prices have       dropped for 91 straight days, and the national average stood       at just over $3.70 a gallon on Tuesday, data from AAA show.       But analysts point to a few reasons this streak of declines       is unlikely to continue.        Because they're determined by oil prices, gasoline prices       are also susceptible to a wide range of challenges, like       hurricanes that knock out drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and       efforts to punish Russia for its invasion of Ukraine by       curbing its ability to sell crude on the global market.        While gas prices are down, the overall energy index still       remains up 23.8 percent over the 12 months that ended in       August. Electricity prices alone jumped 15.8 percent,       representing the largest 12-month increase since August 1981,       the inflation report said. The jump in electricity prices is       largely attributable to the high cost of natural gas, said       Laura Rosner-Warburton, an economist at MacroPolicy       Perspectives.        As winter approaches, other fuel prices could influence       inflation data. The cost of heating a home with natural gas,       the most common source of home-heating fuel in the United       States, is expected to jump more than 25 percent from last       year, to $952 for the six months from October through March,       according to the National Energy Assistance Directors       Association.        ``You would expect that a hard winter could create a       significant increase in demand in price of natural gas,''       said Bryan Benoit, U.S. national managing partner of energy       at Grant Thornton. ``And then of course all of this is       further exacerbated by what's going on with the war in the       Ukraine.''     I want to talk about some of the other things that  Americans are worried about since my colleague purported to speak for  Americans because I saw a poll recently saying that Americans are  worried about the attack on democracy and voting rights.   Part of that may be the fact that some of our colleagues seem to be  ambivalent about whether or not to denounce the rampant violence that  was unleashed against this institution, this body, on January 6, 2021,  when thousands of rioters came and attacked our officers, wounding and  injuring more than 150 of them, breaking their jaws, their necks, lost  fingers, strokes, heart attacks, concussions, and contusions. And, of  course, the former President says that his mob actually greeted the  police with hugs and kisses.   Some of our colleagues shamefully have followed the former President  in trying to whitewash the worst episode of domestic mass  insurrectionary violence ever unleashed on the Capitol of the United  States with an attack on the Vice President, Mike Pence. We heard those  words, ``Hang Mike Pence. Hang Mike Pence,'' bouncing off of the walls  of the Capitol and against the Congress of the United States.  [[Page H7811]]    So, yes, people are worried about the state of our democracy with so  many members of the GOP following Donald Trump in not only his terrible  big lie, the first time we have ever seen that in American history, but  also the big lie encompassing this mob violence and this insurrection  against the Government of the United States.   Do you know what else Americans are worried about, Mr. Speaker?  Americans are now worried about State politicians and Federal  politicians trampling the rights of women. For more than a half  century, women have had a right to make their most intimate procreative  and reproductive decisions with their families, with their husbands,  with their partners, with their ministers, and with their church  leaders.   Then, they gerrymandered the Supreme Court. They kept Merrick Garland  off the Supreme Court by not even giving him a hearing over on the  Senate side.   Then, what do you know, Mr. Speaker? They followed what the RNC was  asking for in all of their platforms for all of these years: Overturn  Roe v. Wade. They overturned Roe v. Wade.   Then, we heard from our colleagues: Well, we just want the States to  decide.   But, yesterday, Senator Lindsey Graham unveiled what the real plan  is: a nationwide criminal ban on abortion, and if they can go further  in the States, they will go further in the States.   We have Republican proposals all over America to completely ban  abortion from the moment of conception, which is the pro-life  orthodoxy, which is life begins at conception.   We heard it in the Judiciary Committee. We have heard it in the  Oversight and Reform Committee. We have been hearing it for years. But  now they have fallen strangely and demurely silent. Why is that? Part  of it is because of the good people of Kansas, who showed them just  where America is on this.   America is a country committed to individual freedom and the rights  of the people to make their own decisions and not having busybody,  theocrat politicians in State capitals telling them how to make their  own decisions about their careers, about their lives, about their  families, and about their healthcare--and certainly not allowing  Lindsey Graham to dictate to the women of America what their destiny  will be.   They won't say a word about it. They will talk about an SEC  regulation nobody heard of that we are not here to talk about today.  They will blame Joe Biden for global inflation. They will blame Joe  Biden for Vladimir Putin's filthy, imperialist invasion of Ukraine.   I hear them denouncing Joe Biden. They won't denounce Vladimir Putin  for 1 second.   I would happily yield 1 minute if they would denounce Vladimir Putin,  but they won't do it. We have heard people over on their side  cheerleading for Vladimir Putin. I heard the gentlewoman from Georgia  say: Russia wins.   Guess what? Russia doesn't win. The people of Ukraine are winning  today, and the people of America are with the people of Ukraine. We are  on the side of democrats, small d democrats, all over the world against  the autocrats like Putin, against the theocrats like people who would  dictate to the women of America their own health decisions.   We are against the tyrants, the bullies, and the despots. We are  against Presidents who get into office and try to dictate the political  decisionmaking of individual members of the workforce and try to push  their ideological program into the government. We are for defending  whistleblowers; we are for defending the Census; and we are for  defending democratic institutions in America.   I am just shocked that I hear from my good friend from Pennsylvania,  someone I like and someone I trust, that he actually is defending Putin  against Biden and blaming Joe Biden for Putin's long-running plan to  invade Ukraine. That is a remarkable thing to me, and I hope we can  have that clarified.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Kentucky spoke about what his  constituents are interested in. Apparently, they are interested only in  the question of inflation.   My constituents are interested in that and are satisfied about the  fact that we have had more than 90 days of decline in gas prices and  that this administration is fighting to reduce inflation, including  with the Inflation Reduction Act, which dramatically reduces healthcare  costs, saying that nobody will have to spend more than $35 a month on  insulin--no diabetic in America--and no one in the Medicare program  will have to spend more than $2,000 a year on prescription drugs,  generally.    How is that for getting inflation down?   But that is not all they care about. They care about women's right to  choose and the GOP assault on the freedoms of the people, something  which our colleagues maintain their demure and uncharacteristic  circumspect silence about today. They didn't want to talk about this  new GOP plan to ban abortion all across America. That is what we heard  yesterday from Senator Graham about his plan for America.   My constituents want freedom in America. They want democracy in  voting rights. They don't want to see violence unleashed against the  Capitol of the United States, against school boards, against State  capitols, or any of the political violence we have seen from whatever  source. I am happy to denounce all of it.   I wish my colleagues would denounce political violence when it comes  to our very doors, when it enters this Chamber, rather than playing  follow the leader with the former President who has disgraced himself  as the first President in U.S. history to be impeached twice and  continues to be embroiled in all the political corruption  investigations all over the country, as it has been shown that he egged  on armed protesters to come to try to attack this body, to drive Vice  President Pence out of the body, and to drive us out of the body, as  well, interfering with a Federal proceeding.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1339         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 13. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 8589) to prohibit the Securities and Exchange       Commission from finalizing the proposed rule titled ``The       Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related       Disclosures for Investors''. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The bill shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and on any amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Financial Services; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 14. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 8589.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.                                time  1400
