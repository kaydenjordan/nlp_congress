 Madam President, this is National Police Week--a time  each year when we remember and honor those who have fallen in the line  of duty.   There are more than 900,000 law enforcement officers serving in our  country, and tragically every year dozens lose their lives defending  our communities and our freedoms.   This year, as part of National Police Week, I am so thankful that  Javier Vega, Jr., one of Texas's own, was honored at the National Law  Enforcement Officer Memorial over the weekend, right here in  Washington, DC. Just a few hours ago, I had the honor of meeting his  family--his wife, his children, and his parents--along with several of  his friends whom he served alongside in the U.S. Border Patrol.   They know, all too well, the high cost paid by our law enforcement  officers who put themselves at risk every day. Javier--who was known by  his close family and friends as Harvey--grew up in La Feria, TX, a  small town in South Texas. He was a man known for putting others before  himself--someone who would always serve rather than be served.   That desire turned first into a military career. He enlisted in the  Marine Corps right out of high school, and later he put himself through  college. Then he decided he hadn't done all he wanted to do in public  service so he joined the Border Patrol, and just like everything else  he pursued in life, he dedicated himself to tirelessly serving others  and serving his country.   Sadly, that service was cut short when he and his family, while out  on a fishing trip on a Sunday afternoon, were ambushed by two men who  tried to rob them. The clash turned violent. Javier immediately thought  of protecting others before himself so he jumped into action to fend  off the attackers and defend his family.   Tragically, he was killed by the two men--illegal immigrant criminals  who had been reportedly deported but managed repeatedly to find their  way back into the country, even after committing serious crimes. What a  testament to the great need we have to strengthen our border security  and justice system to keep us all safe.   Now, there is no denying that Javier Vega, Jr., was taken from his  family, his community, and from all of us far too soon. So while we  consider the fallen this week, like Javier, and their lives of service,  I hope we can also take time to consider how we can better support and  serve those who have promised to defend us to the point of risking  their very lives.   As we learn from the story of Javier, one obvious way we can do that  is by making sure our Federal laws are fully enforced to protect our  communities from those who would take advantage of our generosity and  commit violent crimes, even though they are not in the country legally.   We have a chance to do more for our law enforcement officers, and we  should always look for ways to do right by them. Now isn't the time to  look the other way or to pretend that real problems facing our Nation  and our law enforcement community will simply go away. So during this  year's National Police Week, I look forward to playing my part to put  forward policies that better support their mission to defend and  protect communities all across the country.   Let me thank the family of Javier Vega, Jr.--particularly his wife,  his children, and his parents who are here with us today--for letting  me share his story and honor his service.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
