 Madam Speaker, it has been 9 months since  Hurricanes Laura and Delta devastated southwest Louisiana.   Our region has endured natural disaster after natural disaster. This  past year has been incredibly challenging: two very powerful, major  hurricanes; a crippling ice storm; and this week, ongoing, a severe  rainfall event that is causing homes and businesses to flood.   Many families will have to again restart the difficult process of  rebuilding their lives. Our people have been resilient in the face of  great adversity, a show of incredible strength.   But the need for help from the Federal Government is dire. While much  work has been done, southwest Louisiana has long-term recovery needs.  To date, we have worked with our Federal partners to deliver well over  $1 billion in disaster relief to Louisiana, with more on the way.   We have worked with President Trump and President Biden to secure  increased Federal assistance through cost-share adjustments, now at  levels of 90 and 100 percent.   These resources have supported southwest Louisiana's most immediate  needs: housing and rental assistance, utility repairs, debris removal,  hazard mitigation, and other disaster response costs.   Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related bills, these Federal  disaster accounts have received supplemental funding well beyond normal  appropriations and are still available to the people of southwest  Louisiana.   However, our region requires additional support in the form of long- term  [[Page H2556]]  recovery resources, primarily through community block grant funding.   Louisiana's Governor issued a formal request to the Biden  administration in January of this year. My office has supported our  Governor's request in every way through every channel. We worked for  months to build support in Congress for long-term recovery resources,  and our efforts to build that coalition has been successful.   While that support exists broadly, the Biden administration must  first respond to our Governor's official request for supplemental  disaster funding. President Biden must formally request specific  supplemental disaster relief from Congress. Only then can our  brotherhood of support take action here in the House of  Representatives. That is the way it works. We have communicated these  extreme needs directly to the Biden administration and House  leadership.    Additionally, the State must do more to ensure private insurance  companies are treating Louisiana citizens fairly. This has been a  significant issue that has frustrated Louisiana citizens and hindered  our recovery efforts.   I will not stop fighting for the citizens of south Louisiana, and I  ask that my colleagues here in this body stand with us. I ask that our  President stand with the people of Louisiana. We are one Nation. As a  Republic of sovereign States, we have never failed to come to each  other's rescue in the wake of natural disaster. Now is one of those  moments.   This is a time when Americans must stand together as one. Every day,  we are working to help Louisiana stand back up.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in memory of Charles  Elson ``Buddy'' Roemer, III, who was born October 4, 1943, and died on  May 17 of this year, a couple of days ago, went home to his reward.   Buddy was a very nice guy, and he had a saying: ``I love Louisiana,  but I hate Louisiana politics.'' Many of us can understand that remark.   He was an American patriot, an investor, and a banker. He served in  this body, the House of Representatives, from 1981-1988. He was the  52nd Governor of Louisiana, 1988-1992. He will be missed, remembered,  loved, and respected.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, Americans are bewildered about  what is happening in our Nation today. Americans who actually work have  deep concerns about the future of our country. It is incredible to  observe, from my perspective as a humble constitutionalist servant  within this august body, exactly what is going on with my colleagues  across the aisle and our newly inaugurated executive branch.   We have moved from policies out of our executive that put America  first to policies out of the President's administration to put America  last. We are facing $31 trillion in debt.   Let me help my American brothers and sisters who work very hard to  earn their living and have portions of their income seized and sent to  Washington, D.C., let me help them get their head wrapped around $31  trillion in debt.   If this body, which is responsible constitutionally for all Federal  spending, were to run a $1 billion surplus in a fiscal year--meaning we  spent $1 billion less in Federal expenditures than we took in Federal  revenue, $1 billion--it would require 31,000 years of a $1 billion  surplus to address a $31 trillion debt. A trillion is a thousand  billion, and a billion is a thousand million.   It is insane what is being presented as fiscal responsibility out of  the Biden administration's White House in their budget request.   President Biden shut down the Keystone pipeline, killed thousands of  American jobs overnight with the stroke of his pen on his first day in  office, and now has approved support for a Russian pipeline under the  guise of ecological concern, which is why he shut down Keystone, which  is done incredibly clean in America.   The oil and gas industry, the energy industry in America is the  cleanest in the world. We are going to shut down an American pipeline  and approve and authorize a Russian pipeline. It is absurd the  direction we are going in.   Our border crisis. My sources, which are accurate, we have added at  least 700,000 to 800,000 illegal crossings this year. Our vice  president, alledgedly, has been put in charge of handling the border.  She can't find her way to south Texas. We should send a map to the  White House.   Israel. Could you imagine what our response should be as a nation if  we received 6,000 to 8,000 rockets fired at our citizens?   We should be standing unwavering beside our ally, Israel. A nation  that stands against Israel stands against itself.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker for allowing me to address the  House, and I thank my colleague for holding this important Special  Order this evening.
