 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 5283 by  Representative Malliotakis, the Protecting our Communities from Failure  to Secure our Border Act of 2023.   Our national parks should be used by our families for recreation.  They should not be used as a cover-up for President Biden's failed  border policies. Since President Biden took office, there have been  over 6.4 million illegal crossings of our southern border, including  169 on the terrorist watch list. Yet, instead of implementing more  border security and reinstating the policies that worked, this  administration is housing migrants in our schools and now in our  national parks.   Meanwhile, there are ICE facilities that are sitting empty, such as  the Adelanto ICE processing facility in California. This 2,000-bed  facility, which is already fully funded, has sat empty since April 2020  due to a court injunction.   We must be fully utilizing the ICE facilities we already have that  are prepared to care for migrants versus burdening our communities that  don't have the proper resources or facilities.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to stop this lawlessness at our  southern border and protect our national parks from becoming tent  cities for illegal immigrants.
