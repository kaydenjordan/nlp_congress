 Madam Speaker, I also rise in support of H.R.  1219. I absolutely believe that the time has come for us to modernize  how capital gets to our small businesses.   Prior to Congress, I have a history in business, so I fundamentally  understand that having a better mousetrap is not enough. Small  businesses need capital, need access to more capital in order to grow  and get their innovations out to market. They also need access to these  sophisticated, accredited investors so that they can get the advice  that they need in order to get those better mousetraps out to the  people who need them, want to buy them, and want to use them to better  their lives.   Fundamentally, everybody can agree that we want Americans to have  more economic opportunity, and many Americans find that economic  opportunity by starting small businesses or by being a part of small  businesses, by investing in small businesses, by working for and with  small businesses.   Whether it is a startup in New Albany, Indiana, or a small company  growing in Franklin, Indiana, these businesses need access to capital  to realize the dreams of their founders, the dreams of their investors,  and the dreams of their employees.   Quite simply, H.R. 1219 provides them with the access to more  accredited investors, enabling them and empowering them to bring their  innovations to market. I am excited to be a cosponsor of this important  legislation, and I thank all of my colleagues in the Financial Services  Committee, as well as, hopefully, on the floor later today, for their  support of this important legislation.
