 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this is a  very simple thing that we are talking about, and I can boil it down  real easily.   If the Senate of the United States can find hundreds of billions of  dollars to give to big government and big business, surely it can find  some relief for working families and working individuals. And I would  just submit to you that it is working families and working people who  should be first in line for COVID relief, not last.   That is why the amendment that Senator Sanders and I have proposed is  so common sense--$1,200 for individuals, $2,400 for families, $500 for  every child--and as Senator Sanders rightly said, every Member of this  body has voted yes, in favor of this relief before.   What is more, I can't figure who exactly is opposed to it. The  President of the United States has said that he is in favor of direct  assistance. I thank the majority leader for his own support of direct  assistance. The Speaker of the House says she is in favor of direct  assistance. And that is why there is no reason why this body should  leave next week before we vote on and approve direct assistance to  working families.   Now, let me just say one other thing. Let me tell you about a phone  call I had with a friend of mine at home when this Congress approved  direct assistance back in March. He texted me, and then he called me  and he said: I am seeing this news about relief that we are going to  maybe get a check. Is that real?   I said: Yeah, that is real.   He said: Well, I don't know. I am worried about taking it. I mean,  what if we spend the money? I mean, we could use the money, but what if  we spend it, and I can't pay it back? You know, it comes back and now I  have got to pay it back?   I said: You don't have to pay it back. It is relief, because you need  it, because you are working. This is a guy who works in concrete. That  is his business.   And he said: Are you serious, now? You are serious that we can keep  this money? I can use this for my family.   I said: That is exactly what it is for.   And his comment to me was--his words were: Man, this is a godsend.   There are families like that not just all over Missouri, not just all  over Vermont, but all over this Nation, and they are in need today like  they were in need in March. It is incumbent upon this body to act, and  we should not leave until we do that.   So having reserved the right to object, today, I do not object.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, had there been a rollcall vote on H.R.  8900, the Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021, I would have  voted no                            ____________________
