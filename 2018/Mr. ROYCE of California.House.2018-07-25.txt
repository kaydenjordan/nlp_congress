 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the resolution (H. Res. 981) condemning the violence,  persecution, intimidation, and murders committed by the Government of  Nicaragua against its citizens, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows                                H. Res. 981         Whereas Daniel Ortega has taken systematic steps to weaken       democratic institutions in Nicaragua since 2006, including by       manipulating the Nicaraguan Constitution through actions such       as eliminating presidential term limits;        Whereas Daniel Ortega selected his wife, Rosario Murillo,       as his vice-presidential candidate in 2016;        Whereas domestic and international observers have       repeatedly documented and criticized irregularities in the       2011 and 2016 presidential elections as well as the 2012 and       2017 municipal elections in Nicaragua;        Whereas, on April 18, 2018, students in Nicaragua began to       protest the unilateral decision of the Government of       Nicaragua to impose reforms on the Nicaraguan Social Security       Institute;        Whereas the protests were met with a violent and brutal       response from the Nicaraguan National Police, subsequently       resulting in a widespread call by the Nicaraguan  [[Page H7195]]       people for freedom, democracy, electoral reforms, and respect       for human rights;        Whereas since April 18, 2018, the Nicaraguan government,       the Nicaraguan National Police, or militias controlled by the       Nicaraguan government have been responsible for escalating       violence, committing murders, and many cases of torture and       disappearances;        Whereas to block the dissemination of reports of violence       and repression committed against peaceful protesters, the       Nicaraguan government shut down the signal of media stations       throughout Nicaragua;        Whereas according to press reports, the Nicaraguan       government has denied basic medical care to and attempted to       poison the food and water of those protesting oppression       under the Ortega administration;        Whereas, on the night of April 20, 2018, a pro-government       mob set fire to the offices of independent radio station       Radio Dario in the city of Leon;        Whereas, on April 20, 2018, Ambassador Michael Kozak, the       Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of       Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor of the Department of       State, said, ``Nicaragua is going in the wrong direction on       many fronts and that is one of them, of media freedom. But       also on all the basics, I mean, it's a long litany of       torture, extrajudicial killing, the elections were a sham . .       . the Ortega government has basically shut down a lot of the       opposition, a lot of the independent civil society       organizations as well as the free media'';        Whereas, on April 21, 2018, Nicaraguan journalist Angel       Gahona was shot and killed by pro-government security forces       while broadcasting live on Facebook;        Whereas, on April 21, 2018, the Department of State issued       a travel advisory for Nicaragua and since then has continued       to advise travelers to reconsider travel to Nicaragua due to       ongoing violence;        Whereas, on April 22, 2018, the Department of State issued       a statement that ``we condemn the violence and the excessive       force used by police and others against civilians who are       exercising their constitutional right to freedom of       expression and assembly'';        Whereas, on April 23, 2018, the Department of State ordered       the departure of family members accompanying United States       Government personnel in Nicaragua and also authorized the       departure of such personnel;        Whereas, on Mother's Day in Nicaragua, May 31, 2018, press       reports stated that peaceful marches to support the mothers       of the victims of the earlier protests encountered violence       from ``the repressive police and shock forces'', leaving 15       dead and nearly 200 injured in the cities of Managua, Esteli       and Masaya;        Whereas, on May 31, 2018, the Department of State issued a       statement saying that ``those individuals responsible for       human rights violations will be held accountable by the       international community in international fora'' in response       to the violence during the Mother's Day protests;        Whereas, on June 4, 2018, Secretary Pompeo, participating       in the Organization of American States General Assembly in       the District of Columbia, stated, ``In Nicaragua police and       government-controlled armed groups have killed dozens, merely       for peacefully protesting'';        Whereas, on June 7, 2018, the Department of State announced       visa restrictions against individuals involved in human       rights abuses or undermining democracy in Nicaragua;        Whereas, on June 20, 2018, the Department of State       announced, ``The United States condemns the ongoing       government-sponsored violence and intimidation campaign in       Nicaragua, including the June 16 arson attack against the       home and business of a family in Managua, killing six, and       the further intimidation of the family during the wake'';        Whereas a report from the Asociacion Nicaraguense Pro       Derechos Humanos (Nicaraguan Association for Human Rights)       states that as of June 25, 2018, at least 285 people have       been killed, over 1,500 people have been injured, and 156       people continue to be disappeared;        Whereas the Catholic Church has played an important role       serving as a mediator between protesters and the Government       of Nicaragua, and Catholic bishops and priests have risked       their lives trying to prevent more massacres; and        Whereas the United States House of Representatives has       sought to reestablish democracy and the rule of law in       Nicaragua by passing H.R. 1918, the Nicaraguan Investment       Conditionality Act, on October 3, 2017, by unanimous consent:       Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns the violence, persecution, intimidation, and       murders of peaceful protesters by the Government of       Nicaragua;        (2) supports the people of Nicaragua in their pursuit for       democracy, including their call for free and fair elections       overseen by credible domestic and international observers;        (3) urges the international community to stand in       solidarity with the people of Nicaragua;        (4) calls on the United States to continue to condemn the       atrocities in Nicaragua, demand the release of individuals       wrongfully detained, and identify those individuals whose       involvement in this violence qualifies for the imposition of       sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights       Accountability Act (subtitle F of title XII of the National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016; 22 U.S.C.       2656 note); and        (5) affirms that--        (A) the rights to freedom of assembly, association, and       expression, the freedom of the press, and freedom from       extrajudicial detention and violence, are universal human       rights that apply to all persons; and        (B) countries that fail to respect these rights jeopardize       the security and prosperity of all of their citizens.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would really like to begin by thanking our Foreign  Affairs chairman emeritus, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and I do also want to  thank my other colleagues on the committee. I also thank Albio Sires  for his work on this measure, along with Colonel Cook. I think it is  very timely. It is very important.   I think, for those whose families have experienced what it is like  under a totalitarian system, there is a special identification with  what the victims are going through right now as a result of the  authoritarian bent, right now, of President Daniel Ortega, the same  Daniel Ortega we remember from 1979. But he lost an election, I think  it was, in 1990. He has had five terms.   But in consolidating his power, he has moved to an authoritarian  approach in tightening that grip where he has now resorted to using  brutal force against the students on their campuses if they protest;  brutal force against the people who seek refuge in the churches,  shooting up the churches, something that Congressman Juan Vargas was  talking to me about the other day; brutal force in the villages against  those who protest, creating a situation with hundreds and hundreds of  deaths and thousands of injuries.   I can just tell you personally, I have a constituent and friend in  the district, and she is from one of those villages. She saw me and  gave me a little letter the other day about the fate of some of her  neighbors who died at the hands of one of these attacks in the  villages. They were murdered there on the streets of her small village.   I think the reason that this resolution represents such a broad,  bipartisan consensus in this condemnation of Ortega's regime is because  of the nature of that violence. What this resolution does is support  the people of Nicaragua in their pursuit of freedom.   Nicaraguans, understandably, want self-determination. They want an  end to corruption. They are asking for free and fair elections. The  international community--in particular, the Organization of American  States regional leaders--must continue to stand with these brave  students and church leaders and villagers who are being targeted and  being assassinated by thugs working on behalf of and at the behest of  Daniel Ortega.   When we think about this circumstance and other authoritarian  leaders, one of the allies of Daniel Ortega is Nicolas Maduro. He uses  these same tactics against the Venezuelan people, and the people  deserve better than this.   This resolution shows this body's commitment to standing shoulder to  shoulder with those without a voice, seeking freedom from those  authoritarians who are becoming dictators.   The administration was correct earlier this month in sanctioning  three senior Nicaraguan officials for human rights abuses and  corruption under the U.S. Global Magnitsky Act, a measure that we  passed out of our committee, and that is something that this resolution  affirms. But more can still be done.   This resolution encourages the administration to continue to pressure  Ortega to stop the violence and to move forward with free and fair  elections.  [[Page H7196]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), the chairman emeritus of  the Foreign Affairs Committee and the author of this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from  Florida an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I shared with this body the letter from my constituent  and neighbor outlining what had happened to her village where she had  grown up and how she had lost friends at the hands of a gang allied  with Daniel Ortega quite recently who attacked the village. So I want  to thank Albio Sires, Chairman Emeritus Ros-Lehtinen, and others who  worked on this resolution for bringing this bipartisan measure forward.   I want to thank them for their continued leadership. Because of the  continued attacks on demonstrators in Nicaragua, the shooting up of  churches, and the threatening of priests there, hundreds of protesters  have been murdered, and thousands more have been injured. This is  unacceptable.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, it is imperative that this body, and our  friends and allies across the region, continue to call on Daniel Ortega  to end the violence and to allow free and fair elections in Nicaragua.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5535) to amend the State Department Basic  Authorities Act of 1956 regarding energy diplomacy and security within  the Department of State, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5535         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Diplomacy Act of       2018''.       SEC. 2. ENERGY DIPLOMACY AND SECURITY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT                     OF STATE.         (a) In General.--Subsection (c) of section 1 of the State       Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2651a) is       amended--        (1) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (4); and        (2) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following new       paragraph:        ``(3) Energy resources.--        ``(A) Authorization for assistant secretary.--Subject to       the numerical limitation specified in paragraph (1), there is       authorized to be established in the Department of State an       Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources.        ``(B) Personnel.--The Secretary of State shall ensure that       there are sufficient personnel dedicated to energy matters       within the Department of State who shall be responsible for--        ``(i) formulating and implementing international policies,       in coordination with Secretary of Energy, as appropriate,       aimed at protecting and advancing United States energy       security interests by effectively managing United States       bilateral and multilateral relations in the fields of       petroleum, natural gas, biofuels, renewable energy, nuclear,       and other energy resources;        ``(ii) ensuring that analyses of the national security       implications of global energy and environmental developments       are reflected in the decision making process within the       Department of State;        ``(iii) incorporating energy security priorities into the       activities of the Department of State;        ``(iv) coordinating energy activities within the Department       of State and with relevant Federal agencies;        ``(v) working internationally to--         ``(I) support the development of energy resources and the       distribution of such resources for the benefit of the United       States and United States allies and trading partners for       their energy security and economic development needs;        ``(II) promote availability of diversified energy supplies       and a well-functioning global market for energy resources,       technologies, and expertise for the benefit of the United       States and United States allies and trading partners;        ``(III) resolve international disputes regarding the       exploration, development, production, or distribution of       energy resources;        ``(IV) support the economic and commercial interests of       United States persons operating in the energy markets of       foreign countries; and        ``(V) support and coordinate international efforts to       alleviate energy poverty;         ``(vi) leading the United States commitment to the       Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative;        ``(vii) coordinating within the Department of State and       with relevant Federal departments and agencies on developing       and implementing international energy-related sanctions; and        ``(viii) coordinating energy security and other relevant       functions within the Department of State currently undertaken       by--         ``(I) the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs of the       Department of State;        ``(II) the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental       and Scientific Affairs of the Department of State; and        ``(III) other offices within the Department of State.''.         (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 931 of the Energy       Independence and Security Act of 2007 (42 U.S.C. 17371) is       amended--        (1) by striking subsections (a) and (b); and        (2) by redesignating subsections (c) and (d) as subsections       (a) and (b), respectively.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as America's energy production has increased, and as  Chairman Mike McCaul, the author of the measure, can tell you, our  Nation's influence in global energy policy has grown.   The U.S. is now the world's top producer of petroleum. It is also the  top producer of natural gas for the fifth straight year. I will add to  that: The United States has become more energy efficient.   Our abundant supply of energy resources is not only good for our  economy, it is also good for our national security. It offers American  allies a critical alternative to countries like Russia, which use their  energy resources to bully their neighbors, in the case of Vladimir  Putin, and, in the case of the global oil cartel OPEC, enrich its  member states at the expense of U.S. consumers.   In this moment of heightened American energy leadership, it is  critical that the State Department have the leadership and direction  needed to fulfill its statutory responsibilities governing  international energy diplomacy.   This bill, the Energy Diplomacy Act, will elevate America's energy  security and diplomacy priorities. It authorizes an Assistant Secretary  for Energy Resources at the State Department. This Assistant Secretary  will replace the Coordinator for International Energy Affairs,  demonstrating the importance of energy issues to our foreign policy and  our national interests.   The Assistant Secretary will be responsible for developing and  implementing policies to advance U.S. energy interests abroad by  managing our relations in petroleum, in natural gas, in biofuels, in  renewable energy, and in nuclear and other energy resources.   This bill also requires the State Department to use diplomacy to  support the development of U.S. energy resources to bolster our energy  security, grow our economy, and support our allies.   Mr. Speaker, for years, the world's leading petroleum producers have  been rigging the world market by cutting production to drive up  gasoline prices, and this hurts families in places like our home  States. It is in our interests to promote the availability of  diversified energy supplies in a functioning global market for energy  resources, technologies, and expertise. That is exactly what this bill  requires.   Energy policy expertise must be more deeply integrated in our foreign  policy. As a major energy producing nation, it is time we elevate this  important issue within our diplomatic ranks, which is what this bill  will do.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul for his work on this important  measure with us today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), who is the chairman of the Committee  on Homeland Security and a senior member of the Committee on Foreign  Affairs. The gentleman is the author of this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues,  Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Engel, and Mr. Sires, for crafting  bipartisan legislation to ensure that the State Department has the  leadership and the direction to support America's energy diplomacy  priorities.   Working with our allies and partners in the private sector, we can  counter Putin's weaponization of his energy resources and provide our  allies with a stable alternative to unreliable energy suppliers whose  priorities are self-enrichment and geopolitical self-interest at the  expense of a functioning market.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bipartisan bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on the Judiciary be  discharged from further consideration of the bill (H.R. 5754) to  promote free and fair elections, political freedoms, and human rights  in Cambodia, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to  place into the Record an exchange of letters with the Judiciary  Committee on H.R. 5754.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an  exchange of letters.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                      Washington, DC, July 20, 2018.      Hon. Edward R. Royce,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Royce: I write with respect to H.R. 5754, the       ``Cambodia Democracy Act.'' As a result of your having       consulted with us on provisions within H.R. 5754 that fall       within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the       Judiciary, I forego any further consideration of this bill so       that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for       consideration.        The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 5754 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our       committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our       committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and asks       that you support any such request.        I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 5754 and would ask       that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                      Washington, DC, July 18, 2018.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 5754, the Cambodia Democracy       Act, so that the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House       floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 5754 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                   Edward R. Royce,      Chairman.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks on H.R. 5754.    Mr. Speaker, thank you for bringing this  important and timely legislation to the House Floor.   I want to begin by thanking Rep. Yoho, the Chairman of the Asia and  Pacific Subcommittee, for authoring this bill, which is the product of  his important oversight work. I would also like to recognize Rep. Alan  Lowenthal for his tireless advocacy for this bill, as well as Ranking  Member's Engel and Sherman for their strong support.   In four days, Cambodians will vote for a new head of government.  Unfortunately, this election will not be legitimate in any way. Hun Sen  and his thugs long ago decided the outcome, by marginalizing, beating,  and imprisoning members of the opposition.   Since Cambodia's deeply flawed elections in 2013, we have seen  intensifying attacks on Cambodians peacefully opposing their  government. Hun Sen's thuggish regime continues to crack down on  political opposition and other activists who oppose his rule. Freedom  House consistently rates Cambodia as ``Not Free,'' noting harassment of  the regime's political opposition.   That's putting it mildly. Three years ago, opposition lawmaker and  American citizen Nhay Chamreoun was severely and brutally attacked by  plainclothes bodyguards, who repeatedly kicked and stomped him. He was  hospitalized for months. Several months later, Kem Ley, a popular  Cambodian political commentator, was murdered in broad daylight for his  outspoken protests of the regime.   Over the last year, Hun Sen has dispatched any notions of democracy  in Cambodia. He dissolved the opposition party, CNRP, arrested its  leader Kem Sokha--who now faces spurious treason charges--and  completely dismembered the political system in Cambodia.   Importantly, the Cambodia Democracy Act of 2018 imposes sanctions on  all members of Hun Sen's inner circle for their role in undermining  democracy in Cambodia and committing serious human rights violations.  Specifically, it bars these individuals from entering the U.S. and  blocks any assets or property they may possess.   It will be up to the President to determine who should be designated  for these sanctions. But given the brashness of this regime, we do have  a good idea of who the President should target:   Hun Sen: Prime Minister, President of Cambodian People's Party (CPP);  Sar Kheng: Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of the Interior, Vice  President of CPP; Tea Banh: Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of National  Defense, Member of the CPP; Aun Pornmoniroth: Minister for Economy and  Finance; Koeut Rith: Secretary of State of Ministry of Justice; Sun  Chanthol: Minister of Public Works and Transport; Prak Sokhonn:  Minister of Foreign Affairs; Om Yentieng: President of Anti-Corruption  Unit attached to the Office of the Council of Ministers, Advisor to the  Prime Minister; Pol Saroeun: Four-Star General, Member of the Supreme  Council of National Defense, Commander-in-Chief of RCAF; Neth Savoeun:  Director-General of the National Police, Member of CPP Permanent  Committee; Kun Kim: Four-Star General, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of  RCAF, Chief of RCAF Joint General Staff, Chief of Personal Advisers and  Cabinet of the Prime Minister; Sao Sokha: Four-Star General, Deputy  Commander-in-Chief of RCAF, Commander of the National Royal Military  Police; Hing Bunheang: Four-Star General, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of  RCAF; Choun Sovann: Deputy Chief of National Police and Chief of Phnom  Penh Municipal Police; Hun Manet: Deputy Chief of RCAF Joint General  Staff; Sok Puthyvuth: CEO of SOMA Group conglomerate; and Hun Mana:  Chair of Bayon Height Media System.   Again, thank you Mr. Speaker for bringing up this very important and  timely legislation. The people of Cambodia deserve far better than the  Hun Sen's despotism. Political pluralism will soon reach Cambodia, and  this legislation will not only help Cambodians attain that goal, but  will also send a strong signal that Congress will not tolerate these  human rights abuses.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take  from the Speaker's table the bill (S. 2779) to amend the Zimbabwe  Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks on S. 2779.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Senators Flake  and Coons for their leadership and sustained engagement on this issue.  I also want to thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Bass for their  focus on Zimbabwe at the Africa subcommittee.   On July 30th, the people of Zimbabwe will have the opportunity to  vote for their next president. As the first election since Robert  Mugabe, this is a pivotal moment for Zimbabwe. For 37 years,  Zimbabweans have suffered greatly under authoritarian rule and economic  devastation. The government drove the economy into the ground and  violently suppressed any opposition to their power.   With elections now just days away, the situation in Zimbabwe should  be viewed with cautious optimism. I am encouraged by some of the  statements and actions taken by the government. President Mnangagwa,  along with key opposition candidates, signed a public pledge to ensure  peaceful elections. The opposition is allowed to campaign across the  country, the voter roll has been released for inspection, and U.S. and  international observers will be permitted to observe the elections.   However, reports of voter intimidation, efforts to politicize food  aid, and increased military presence in rural polling stations are  deeply concerning. The people of Zimbabwe, as well as the international  community, remember the horrific violence that occurred during the 2008  elections. That cannot happen again.   That's why this legislation is so critical. This bill makes important  changes to update the 2001 Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery  Act. It lays out our expectations for a free and fair election, as well  as actions needed to achieve key economic reforms. The expectations of  the 2001 legislation hold true today--Zimbabwe must make credible  progress towards holding free and fair elections, restore the rule of  law, and ensure military subordination to the civilian government,  among other desperately needed reforms. These are realistic and  universally recognized standards.   Both the government and the opposition must follow through on their  statements to hold a free, fair, and credible election on July 30th.  This is an opportunity to chart a dramatic new course for Zimbabwe. We  urge the next President to take bold and immediate action to address  key governance  [[Page H7672]]  and economic issues. We stand by the people of Zimbabwe in their  efforts to see a more democratic, peaceful, and prosperous Zimbabwe.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
