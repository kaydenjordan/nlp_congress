 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life, legacy, and  ministry of Chaplain G. William Bryan. I just knew him as Chaplain  Bill.   He was a fellow alum of Dallas Theological Seminary and was most  widely known as DTS' beloved chaplain. To many, he was a friend and  encourager. To Shirley, he was a devoted husband. He was the father of  three, grandfather to nine, and a spiritual mentor to many, including  me and my wife, Amy Kate.   I will never forget, when tragedy struck my family a few decades ago,  that Chaplain Bryan was one of the first to reach out with comforting  words, prayer, and follow-up. His role as chaplain served thousands  every year, but when you saw him, you felt as if you were connecting  with a best friend.   Chaplain Bill was also known to play his trumpet with full vigor. As  a student at DTS, I avoided the front row in chapel for fear he might  actually explode during the hymn, ``All Hail the Power of Jesus'  Name.''   Chaplain Bill, we will miss you down here, but we look forward to  joining you in the everlasting song, with your trumpet at full tilt, as  we crown Him Lord of all.
