 Madam Speaker, I rise today in great sadness. Last  night, at 6:16, my friend, a community leader and a member of my  district staff, passed away, Barbara Morris Stafford.   Barbara was born in 1953, and was part of a political family. Her  father, Howard Morris, was chairman of the Giles County Board of  Supervisors. Her husband was a 10-term member of the Virginia House of  Delegates, and when he died young, she took over his seat.   Now a single mother to Chris, Elizabeth, and Mary, she served her  community for many years as a member of the Virginia House of  Delegates; mayor of her hometown of Pearisburg, Virginia; director of  the chamber of commerce; and then, for over 10 years and until last  night, as a constituent services representative in my district office.   Barbara was a great leader and she will be sorely missed by the  community she loved and the community that loved her.                            ____________________
