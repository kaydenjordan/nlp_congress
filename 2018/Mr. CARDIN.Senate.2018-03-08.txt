 Mr. President, I rise to recognize March as Women's  History Month and today, March 8, as International Women's Day.   Both at home and abroad, how a country treats its women is very much  a barometer of its success. When women live without limitations on  their ability to work, societies prosper. When women live without  restrictions on their access to jobs, healthcare, or justice, societies  prosper. When women succeed, so do their families, their communities,  and their countries.   International Women's Day reminds us that America's global leadership  starts with our progress here in the United States. Unfortunately,  President Trump moved the United States in the wrong direction when he  decided not just to reinstate the global gag rule but to expand it. The  global gag rule disqualifies international organizations from receiving  U.S. family planning assistance if they use any non-U.S. funds to  provide abortion services or even counseling.   What President Trump fails to realize is that access to the family  planning services that these organizations provide is one of the best  tools we have to prevent abortions. When enforced, the global gag rule  has closed the door on some of the most effective, lifesaving women's  health programs in developing countries. By reinstating and expanding  the global gag rule, President Trump is denying millions of women and  their families access to critical healthcare services and is  endangering their lives and the lives of their children.   International Women's Day is the appropriate time to remind my Senate  colleagues that we must end the global gag rule once and for all.   It was also recently reported that the State Department is removing  references to women's rights from this year's human rights report. I am  troubled to learn that the Trump administration, apparently, doesn't  feel that women's rights are important enough to include in our  conversation on human rights. I was equally troubled to learn that the  State Department removed gender equality integration from the Foreign  Affairs Manual. The Foreign Affairs Manual is the chief document for  instructing our foreign policy leadership on the ways to integrate  gender considerations into our diplomatic efforts. Abandoning that  signals a reversal of decades' worth of work in promoting global gender  equality.   The United States should be taking the lead on fostering an open and  honest dialogue about women's issues internationally, not silencing it.  We are better than this.   Here at home, women have succeeded this past year in taking control  of the narrative on sexual harassment, and they have forced deaf ears  to listen. We are witnessing the rise of a new, more equitable social  order that is built on the raw guts and courage of women who are  speaking out to say, ``Me too.''   Hearing so many of my fellow Americans--mothers, sisters, wives,  daughters, friends--retell and relive some of their most traumatic  experiences has been deeply troubling, but it has also been a lesson in  bravery, in tenacity, and in women's unbreakable spirits.   It is that bravery which we must now meet with our own as individuals  and collectively. If we witness harassment, we must be brave enough to  intervene. If we are told about abuse, we must be brave enough to take  decisive action. If we hear about gender discrimination, we must be  brave enough to fight it even when doing so may not be politically  expedient or popular. Scores of women have proved their moral strength.  It is time for us to demonstrate ours.   This Women's History Month, let us take a moment to reflect on the  thousands and thousands of ``Me Too'' stories that go untold and  unheard.   Let us recognize the single working mother making barely more than  minimum wage, living paycheck to paycheck, and struggling to turn $5  into a meal for three. When her coworker begins propositioning her,  there are no cameras and cable talk shows waiting to expose him. She  bears the burden alone, often feeling forced to choose between enduring  disparaging behavior at work or providing for her children at home.   Let us recognize the college graduate working in an office, empowered  and excited about the direction of her career. Yet, in every meeting,  her boss undermines her ideas and, one day, when they are alone,  questions her suggestively about her method of birth control. Weeks  later, his lewd remarks evolve into inappropriate physical contact, and  he tells her that if she ever complains, he will ensure she never finds  another job in her chosen profession.   Let us recognize the immigrant woman working hard at her new job in  her new home, motivated to become part of the American dream. Her male  coworker calls her by disparaging names and suggests openly to their  supervisor that she should make less than he does in the event she ever  becomes pregnant and costs the company money. She begins to fear both  for her job and for herself, but to quit would mean to lose the new  life she has so painstakingly built.   For an untold number of women, these stories are painfully familiar.  The ``Me Too'' movement has proven that sexual harassment and  discrimination know no age and no income level. These experiences are  felt by all women of all backgrounds, so it is up to all of us to  combat it. Sexual harassment is about power. It is about the harassers  and authority figures feeling emboldened by being able to behave the  way they want, wherever they want, with impunity. So let us end the  sense of impunity.   If behavior is about exerting a twisted kind of power, let us arm  women with the most powerful tool in our legal system--the U.S.  Constitution. Let us finally pass the Equal Rights Amendment. The Equal  Rights Amendment is barely longer than a tweet, but it would finally  give women full and equal protection under the Constitution. Section 1  of the ERA states, quite simply: ``Equality of rights under the law  shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on  account of sex.''   When Congress proposed the ERA in 1972, it provided that the measure  had to be ratified by three-fourths of the States--38 States--within 7  years. This deadline was later extended to 10 years by a joint  resolution. Ultimately, only 35 out of 38 States had ratified the ERA  when the deadline expired in 1982--three short. Note that the deadline  was not contained in the amendment, itself. The deadline was contained  in a joint resolution.   Article V of the Constitution contains no time limits for the  ratification of amendments, so the ERA deadline is arbitrary. To put  the matter in context, the 27th Amendment to the Constitution, which  prohibits congressional pay raises without an intervening election, was  ratified in 1992--203 years after it was first proposed. The Senate  should vote to remove the ERA deadline immediately, and every State in  our Nation that has not yet taken up its consideration should do so  without further delay.   Nevada became the 36th State to ratify the amendment last March,  leaving the ERA only two States short of the required three-fourths of  the State threshold under the Constitution if the deadline were to be  abolished. I think many--perhaps most--Americans  [[Page S1540]]  would be shocked to learn that our Constitution has no provision  expressly prohibiting gender discrimination.   The ERA would incorporate a ban on gender-based discrimination to be  explicitly written into the Constitution. It would change outcomes in  unequal pay cases by requiring the Supreme Court to use the higher  standard of ``strict scrutiny'' when assessing those cases--the same  standard it uses on racial and religious discrimination cases.   Just as importantly, it would provide a constitutional basis for  claims of gender-based violence and give the Congress the  constitutional basis to pass laws that would give women who have been  victimized by gender-based violence legal recourse in Federal courts.   In a 2011 interview, the late Justice Antonin Scalia summed up best  the need for an Equal Rights Amendment.   He said:         Certainly the Constitution does not require discrimination       on the basis of sex. The only issue is whether it prohibits       it. It doesn't.    So I, most sincerely, ask my Senate colleagues this question: Are we  willing to do what must be done to prohibit gender discrimination by  including protection against it in the Constitution? Progress has no  autopilot feature. We must be its agents. We must be its champions.  When we wake up each day to the loud and growing chorus of women saying  ``me too,'' how can we deny them the legal tool as powerful and  important as our own country's Constitution?    The people being affected by systemic gender inequality are our  constituents. They are our wives, our daughters, and our  granddaughters. They are American citizens and human beings who deserve  basic respect and equality.   We are capable of so much more than lip service. We are capable of  celebrating Women's History Month by making history. I call on this  Senate to remove the deadline on passing the Equal Rights Amendment and  show the American people we are the leaders they sent us here to be,  and we will take action. Let us prove that we will use our voices when  silence becomes complicity, and we will use our votes when our values  need defending.   Women deserve to see that their Nation's founding document values  them and treats them in a fashion equal to men. They are right to  expect that gender equality should be an explicit, basic principle of  our society. Let us all work together to get this done.   Women's rights are human rights, and human rights are not and never  should be a partisan issue.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a common sense  piece of legislation that will expand the ability of the Small Business  Administration (SBA) to nurture innovative and high-growth small  businesses in Maryland and across the country.   Let me first say, I recently returned to the Senate Committee on  Small Business & Entrepreneurship as the Ranking Member. I look forward  to continuing the important work of helping America's 29 million small  businesses--the job creating engine of the country--access the  essential capital to grow, to earn their fair share of Federal  contracts, and to take advantage of SBA's counseling and mentoring  programs that help entrepreneurs market and manage their businesses.   The Small Business Investment Opportunity Act is straightforward. It  [[Page S1581]]  modifies SBA's Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program by  increasing the amount of capital that SBICs with a single fund can  invest in qualifying small businesses.   The SBIC program stimulates investment in America's high-growth small  businesses. SBICs are privately-owned and managed investment funds that  use their own capital--plus funds borrowed with an SBA guaranty--to  capitalize small businesses.   Last year, SBICs made 36 investments totaling $61.3 million in 12  innovative Maryland firms. Over the past five years, the program has  channeled more than $21 billion of capital to 6,400 American small  businesses across a variety of industries.   The program operates at no expense to taxpayers. Instead, the cost of  the program is covered by fees paid by SBICs and their portfolio  companies.   Consider this: since the program launched in 1958, SBIC has:   Deployed more than $67 billion of capital;   Made more than 166,000 investments in American small businesses; and   Licensed more than 2,100 investment funds.   Some of America's most iconic brands have received investment capital  from SBICs, including Apple, Tesla, Whole Foods, Staples, Intel, FedEx  and Costco, among others.   Under current law, SBA can guarantee up to $150 million of an SBIC  investment fund. Our legislation increases that cap to $175 million and  unlocks additional capital for small businesses with high-growth  potential. The cap has not been raised since 2009.   Raising this cap would simply keep up with inflation and maximize the  amount of capital SBICs can direct to innovative small businesses that  hire our workers, support our communities, drive innovation and help  our country maintain its competitive edge.   This bill also builds upon a change that Senator Risch, Senator  Shaheen and I passed in 2015 to increase the maximum amount of leverage  to SBICs with more than one fund. As some of my colleagues will recall,  those types of SBICs are known as ``Family of Funds.''   As with the bill in 2015, the legislation we are introducing today is  also bipartisan and bicameral. I am pleased the Small Business  Investment Opportunity Act has the support of our Chairman, Senator  Risch, as well as Senators Shaheen and Kennedy. An identical bill  passed the House last year, and the legislation is endorsed by the  Small Business Investor Alliance.   Thank you, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a common sense  piece of legislation that will expand the ability of the Small Business  Administration (SBA) to nurture innovative and high-growth small  businesses in Maryland and across the country.
