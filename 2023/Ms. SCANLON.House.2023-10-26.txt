 Mr. Speaker, my heart is breaking for the parents,  children, friends, and neighbors in Lewiston, Maine, who woke up today  to the unfathomable grief of yet another mass shooting.   We do not have to live like this. My constituents know it, and, Mr.  Speaker, your constituents know it, too.   Americans are disgusted by Congress' failure to check the gun  violence that is so rampant across our country, and they should be. Gun  violence now impacts all of us, in urban areas, in rural areas, and in  red and blue States. We must work together to address the gun violence  crisis.   The House can and must act now to consider the numerous gun violence  prevention bills that are waiting to be brought to the floor and that a  majority of Americans, Democrats, Independents, and Republicans,  support.   We call on Speaker Johnson to bring these commonsense and  constitutional bills to the floor as soon as possible. Our  constituents, our children, deserve to know where their Representatives  stand on these bills. The very least we can do is have the courage to  show them.                            ____________________
