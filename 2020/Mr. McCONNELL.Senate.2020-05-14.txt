 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this pandemic is weighing heavily on  the American people. Roughly, 1.4 million Americans have been infected,  more than 80,000 have died, and unemployment has not been this high  since World War II.   Just a few months ago, millions of hard-working men and women were  thriving and optimistic. They were making big plans across kitchen  tables. Now all of that is in chaos.   The Chairman of the Federal Reserve reports that nearly 4 in 10  American households that earn less than $40,000 a year had somebody get  laid off in the month of March alone. This emergency is very serious,  so the Senate's response has been serious.   In March, Senate Republicans designed and the full Senate passed the  CARES Act. It pushed trillions of dollars to working families, job  creators, and medical professionals. We sent direct cash to almost 130  million Americans. We delivered hundreds of billions of dollars in  paycheck protection loans to small businesses, saving tens of millions  of American jobs. We helped State and local governments defray  coronavirus costs. We funded healthcare providers and testing. Even  now, its programs are still taking effect, still coming online, still  helping. The Senate took a blank sheet of paper and turned it into the  largest rescue package in history.   We have taken this crisis seriously, but the House Democrats have  taken a totally different approach. While we finalized the CARES Act,  the House parachuted in with miscellaneous liberal demands that were  completely unrelated to COVID-19--solar energy tax credits, airline  emissions. One senior House Democrat called the virus a ``tremendous  opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.'' One Senate  Democratic colleague asked: ``How many times are we going to get a shot  at a $1 trillion-plus program?'' They told us exactly what they were up  to, so we ignored the leftwing wish list and stayed serious, and the  CARES Act is still helping Americans bridge these temporary shutdowns.   So let's fast-forward to today. The Democratic House is still not  back in Washington. Its constitutional duty  [[Page S2432]]  stations are still unmanned, but the Democrats cannot stop salivating  over the possibilities for partisan gain.   Former Vice President Biden says he sees this tragedy as an  ``incredible opportunity . . . to fundamentally transform the  country.'' Biden said it is an ``incredible opportunity . . . to  fundamentally transform the country.''   Speaker Pelosi said: ``I see everything as an opportunity.''   A cochair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus said: ``For me, the  leverage is that there is enormous suffering.'' ``The leverage is that  there is enormous suffering.'' There are 80,000 Americans who have died  and more than 20 million who have lost their jobs. I call that a  crisis; they call it leverage.   This week, the Speaker published an 1,800-page seasonal catalog of  leftwing oddities and called it a coronavirus relief bill. So here we  go again. It includes a massive Tax Code giveaway to high earners in  blue States. Working families are struggling to put food on the table,  but the House Democrats are prioritizing millionaires on the coasts. It  would print another round of checks--listen to this--specifically for  illegal immigrants. Can you believe it? We forgot to have the Treasury  Department send money to people who are here illegally. My goodness.  What an oversight. Thank goodness the Democrats are on the case.   The Speaker's bill also tries to use the virus as cover to implement  sweeping changes to election laws that the Democrats have literally  wanted for years, like forcing every single State to embrace  California's sketchy ballot harvesting whether they want to or not.   Then there is the cherry on top. It is the bold new policy from the  Washington Democrats that will kick the coronavirus to the curb and  save American families from this crisis. Here it is--new annual studies  on diversity and inclusion within the cannabis industry. There is not  one study but two of them. Let me say that again. The Democrats'  supposed coronavirus bill includes taxpayer-funded studies to measure  diversity and inclusion among the people who profit off of marijuana.   The word ``cannabis'' appears in this bill 68 times--more times than  the word ``job'' and 4 times as much as the word ``hire.'' Maybe that  is just as well because when their proposal does try to treat the  economic crisis, it proposes stifling, anti-work policies that would  only make it harder for Americans to get their jobs back. For example,  they literally propose to raise taxes on small business and drain more  cash from Main Street during a Main Street meltdown. So maybe it is  best if the House Democrats focus on cannabis studies and leave  economics to the rest of us.   This is a totally unserious effort. Even the mainstream media says:  ``Neither this bill nor anything resembling it will ever become law.  It's a Democratic wish list.''   Forget about making law; this thing even fails as a messaging bill.  That is what is so remarkable. The House Democrats had a blank slate to  write anything they wanted to define the modern Democratic Party--any  vision for the society that they wanted--and here is what they chose:  tax hikes on small businesses, giveaways to blue State millionaires,  government checks for illegal immigrants, and sending diversity  detectives to inspect the pot industry. The House gave itself no  assignments for 2 months except to develop this proposal. Yet it still  reads like the Speaker of the House pasted together some random ideas  from her most liberal Members and slapped the word ``coronavirus'' on  top of it--an unserious product from an unserious House majority that  has spent months dealing itself out of the crisis.   The House Democrats have been missing in action for months. While the  Senate was passing the CARES Act, the Democratic House was on the  sidelines substantively and literally. They had already gone home.  Nearly 2 months later, the Senators are back at our duty stations with  new precautions. We have been back for 2 weeks. We are holding major  hearings on the pandemic. We are legislating and confirming nominees.  Yet the House is still at home. And when it does contribute, it is not  serious.   The House Democrats have checked out of this crisis and left  governing up to the Senate. They even intend to shatter congressional  history and jam through remote voting so they can continue to be  counterproductive from the comfort of their homes. Let me say that  again. They even intend to shatter congressional history and jam  through remote voting so they can continue to be counterproductive from  the comfort of their own homes.   Look, here in the real world, the Senate Republicans are working  seriously to help the country reopen. The crushing unemployment  figures, even with the CARES Act, show that no amount of Federal  spending could substitute for the entirety of the U.S. economy. We need  to be smart, and we need to be safe, but we have to find a more  sustainable middle ground.   This week, Chairman Alexander and the Committee on Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions heard from Dr. Fauci, Dr. Redfield, and other top  experts on exactly this subject. There are at least two big things our  Nation will need to start recovering: stepped-up testing nationwide and  legal liability protections so that K-12 schools, universities,  charities, and employers are not invaded by trial lawyers the instant  they unlock their doors.   On testing, fortunately, the Senate has already done a great deal.  The executive branch and especially the States are in the driver's  seat, but we have already sent billions of dollars to help scale up  testing nationwide. On legal liability reform, the work lies ahead of  us. As my Republican colleagues and I have made clear, strong legal  protections will be a hard redline in any future legislation.   That is what is happening here in the Senate--serious leadership on a  serious crisis like we have been doing for months. This half of the  Capitol is doing our job                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 564.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, as spring begins to give way to summer,  there is a singular tradition that unites everyone from across my home  State. Even after particularly contentious college basketball seasons,  Kentuckians of all backgrounds can look with pride to the Twin Spires  of Churchill Downs for the Kentucky Derby. Since 1875, the pride of  Louisville has been inextricably linked to the ``Most Exciting Two  Minutes in Sports.''   This year, however, fans couldn't gather at the Grandstands, the  infield, or at a Derby Party. The coronavirus pandemic has changed the  daily lives of nearly every American. Even our most sacred traditions  have been put on hold as we follow the advice of medical experts to  slow the spread of this terrible virus. As a result, the Kentucky Derby  has been postponed for the first time since the Second World War. The  146th Run for the Roses will instead take place over Labor Day weekend  in September.   Jerry Brewer, a Kentucky native and Washington Post sports writer,  put into words the sense of longing felt by so many Kentuckians. In a  wonderful column published on what would have  [[Page S2446]]  been Derby weekend, Jerry shared both his personal reflections and our  shared emotions. In Louisville, the Derby is more than a single race.  Kentuckians spend the weeks before celebrating our people and our  heritage. I am grateful that someone with such eloquence could describe  Kentucky's Derby passion.   That is not to say horseracing fans weren't treated to a race on May  2. Instead of hosting the world's most anticipated horse race,  Churchill Downs created a virtual running of Triple Crown winners. In a  match of some of horseracing's biggest names, Secretariat--one of the  greatest horses to ever run--completed an all-star victory.   Although a lot will be different about the Labor Day Derby, so much  of what makes the Kentucky Derby special will remain the same. Whether  at the track or watching from home, fans will still get to sip a mint  julep filled with Kentucky's signature spirit. Longtime residents and  first-time visitors alike will feel the sentimental tug as they sing  ``My Old Kentucky Home.'' And the thundering hooves of thoroughbreds  will echo in the ears of millions.   The postponement is certainly a disappointment, but I would encourage  my fellow Kentuckians not to despair. Our traditions are rooted deeply  in the Bluegrass. We will beat this virus, and Kentucky will get the  chance to shine once again. Like the champions whose names surround  Churchill Downs, Kentucky has the strength and grit to overcome any  obstacle and cross the finish line.   We may not have a 146th Kentucky Derby champion for a few more  months, but I think Jerry Brewer would agree, it is worth the wait.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jerry Brewer's article be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Washington Post, May 1, 2020]              On Derby-Less Weekend, Missing My Kentucky Home                             (By Jerry Brewer)         A Kentuckian's most humbling Kentucky Derby story: About 15       years ago, I hosted Washington Post colleague Rick Maese,       then with the Baltimore Sun, for his first Run for the Roses.       Picked him up from the airport. Bought us tickets to a       concert that week featuring Common and the Roots. Probably       had a mint julep and slice of Derby pie waiting in the       cupholder. I was thrilled to show him Louisville at its       proudest time.        On the drive to my apartment, Rick looked out the window       and saw a man who was walking clumsily, perhaps drunkenly,       while pulling a dog that was missing a leg. The scene was       cruel, heartbreaking, ridiculous. It was Rick's first       impression of my state.        And that's usually how we are: Mostly rural, largely odd       and shockingly complicated. Our long-standing problems with       big issues such as race and education are well documented.       We're weird. We see blue in grass. We love basketball more       than we love people. We are known for keeping it real hick,       and as much as we despise that stereotype, part of us plays       along because it helps the beauty of Kentucky remain a       secret, never to be swarmed and overtaken by careless       outsiders.        But during Derby week, that mentality shifts. We want to       shine. Louisville--the only city in the state that feels like       a big city (when it actually claims its relationship to       Kentucky)--becomes the most gracious host that any sporting       event has ever had. Don't challenge me on that; I can wield a       mean pitchfork. When it comes to tailoring every inch of an       area to ensure an unforgettable experience for all visitors,       Louisville rolls out a red carpet and throws rose petals at       your feet.        Rick shook off that weird introduction and loved his first       Derby experience. He has been back several times. When I       started dating my wife seriously, I took her to the Derby;       meeting the entire family was a mere afterthought. As a       Paducah native who lived in Louisville for several years,       there is no greater personal holiday than the first Saturday       in May. And so, as the novel coronavirus pandemic keeps us in       isolation, there is no stronger sense of loss for me than       what I'm experiencing right now.        I have attended 11 Derbies. I have partied during the Derby       for just about all 42 of my years. My childhood memories are       full of gatherings at my grandparents' house in east       Louisville, where the scent of mint was more welcome than       pine at Christmastime. My adult memories are even better,       from trying to cover the event as poetically as the       sportswriting legends I grew up reading to, well, acting a       fool in the infield during my college days.        Even in Kentucky, with its beautiful rolling hills and       horse farms, this is a niche sport. Everyone is a Kentucky       Derby fan, though. Our connection to this event is a very       powerful and emotional thing.        Derby week is so grand, and we delight in sharing all of       the festivities with the world while fighting to keep the       Kentucky Oaks--the illustrious Grade I stakes race for 3-      year-old fillies held the day before the Derby--a more local       event. But over the past 20 years, even the Oaks crowd has       surpassed 100,000 with regularity.        Still, the fancy affair turns intimate when ``My Old       Kentucky Home'' plays before the Derby. We wait all year just       to feel alive and relevant in that moment. Soon after, the       most anticipated two minutes in sports conclude, and before       you know it, the time to clean up and plan anew has arrived.        I like the fleeting nature of this joy. The Derby is our       cherry blossom. Wait, wait, wait, revel. Go back to waiting.       It's deflating to know the wait will be much longer this       time.        The 146th Kentucky Derby has been rescheduled for Sept. 5.       Churchill Downs announced Thursday that its spring meet will       open May 16. Fans won't be able to attend, but the plan is to       start racing again. There's something even emptier about the       thought of horses competing in a bubble than human athletes.        And who knows if even that is safe enough? Everything about       the resumption of normalcy comes back to this: We are at the       mercy of a virus that we are still trying to understand. So       the odds of this Derby really being the Derby in September--      with 150,000 fans flaunting their style, understanding of       color and taste in hats--seem long. If it happens, it may       play decently on television, but it won't be the same.        To me, the Kentucky Derby is a homecoming with a paisley       bow tie wrapped around it. We get the floor, and we make it       the most majestic floor you have ever seen. Home can be       cringeworthy, but it's also swanky and magnificent. We clean       up good for y'all, but mostly we clean up good for us.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
