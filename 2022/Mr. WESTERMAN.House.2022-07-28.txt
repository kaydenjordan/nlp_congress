 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 263. There are a lot of  things the gentleman from Hawaii said that I think me, and a lot of  other Republicans would agree on about what needs to happen as far as  the outcomes of regulating big cats. But the devil is in the details,  and that is what I hope to show today, that the details and the process  and the procedures that the policy will create with this Democrat bill  are not what is best for this policy.   Today's consideration of H.R. 263, the Big Cat Public Safety Act,  follows action last month by the Committee on Natural Resources, where  this bill passed on a party-line vote after 2 days of lengthy markup.   At a time when gas prices were setting record highs on a near daily  basis, the Committee on Natural Resources considered big cat  legislation, once again, failing to address the economic and energy  crisis facing Americans. At that time, committee Republicans offered  several amendments aimed at reminding our majority that we should be  focused on reducing energy and food prices, not on exotic pet  ownership.   Rather than address the real crisis of the day, Democrats shut down  debate on our amendments and forced a vote on final passage of this  bill.   So here we are, once again, considering this big cats bill in what  looks to be a very crowded legislative week, a week that does not focus  on energy prices and inflation, even when gas is still averaging an  unbearable and unacceptable $4.50 per gallon.   Versions of this bill have been around since the 112th Congress,  begging the question of why, if it is such a good idea, has it not been  enacted over the last decade. Two clear reasons are that it would  create a new regulatory framework and strip away States' rights.   The bill before us today is aimed at regulating the private ownership  of so-called big cats by creating a new and duplicative regulatory  authority at the Department of the Interior.   The legislation is a considerable expansion of Federal regulation  under the Lacey Act. In 2003, Congress amended the Lacey Act to make it  illegal to import, export, buy, sell, transport, receive, or acquire  certain live big cats across State lines or the U.S. border. Interstate  trade. The bill proposed by my friends across the aisle regulates big  cats from the Federal level or an intrastate level, an area where State  laws are already in place to handle this.   The Lacey Act historically deals with interstate and international  commerce on endangered or injurious wildlife, and the 2003 provisions  specifically state that nothing in the act will supersede State laws,  but here we are today taking another step to supersede State laws.   This bill would expand the Lacey Act by blatantly overriding State  law and enforcing intrastate regulation of big cats.   It would require big cats exhibited at USDA-licensed or USDA- registered facilities be at least 15 feet from the public or behind a  permanent barrier, irrespective of State laws. It would end new private  ownership of big cats, and it would mandate all big cats be registered  with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service within 180 days or risk having  the Federal Government confiscate their animal and impose criminal  fines and penalties.   It would require big cat owners to certify that they will not breed,  acquire, or sell any big cats, and would prohibit direct public  contact.   All these mandates would supersede State authority and duplicate  existing Federal Government regulation.   Not only would this bill expand the Fish and Wildlife Service  authorities, but it would overlay the U.S. Department of Agriculture's  responsibilities, which already regulates the treatment of big cats in  research and exhibition pursuant to the Animal Welfare Act of 1966.   The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, at the USDA  already has inspectors and law enforcement officers in place that are  experts in animal welfare issues. But this bill ignores that existing  regulatory framework and would create a new regulatory system that the  Congressional Budget Office estimates would lead to $80 million in  foregone revenue from current USDA licensed facilities.                                time  1530    The result of this bill would be that USDA-licensed facilities will  be regulated by both APHIS under USDA and the Fish and Wildlife Service  under the Department of the Interior.   My staff and I have spent considerable time on this issue. One of our  first questions was: Why not just work with the House and Senate  Agriculture Committees under the jurisdiction of the Animal Welfare  Act?  [[Page H7391]]    The response we received was an admission that the bill's outside  proponents would rather work through the Committee on Natural Resources  than the Committee on Agriculture. This is a classic case of venue  shopping.   Creating two regulatory frameworks and dual Federal agency management  superseding existing State regulation will create confusion, waste  taxpayer dollars, and risk failing to adequately regulate these  facilities at all.   There is a simple fix to the issues that exist. For that reason, I  offered an amendment at our markup that will move the authorities  proposed by H.R. 263 into the current USDA framework without  superseding State authorities. That commonsense alternative was,  unfortunately, rejected on a party-line vote, and unfortunately, it was  not allowed to be considered today during the debate in the full House  of Representatives. I would dare say that had we adopted that  amendment, this bill would be on the suspension calendar.   While I agree that we want to reduce dangerous encounters between the  public and big cats, I cannot support this bill because it is an  overreaching, duplicative, and precedent-setting proposal that has  already served as a blueprint for pending legislation on other species.   We need to work within existing authorities, not create new and  duplicative ones. More importantly, we need to focus on the crises  facing Americans, including staggering inflation and the high price of  energy, not big cats.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 263, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, we were just wanting a hearing on addressing the energy  crisis that is facing our country, and we have yet to have that. We  have continued to see development of energy on Federal lands put to a  halt by this administration, and we are still waiting for when we are  going to have that first hearing to address that issue.   While it is unfortunate that 18 big cats and 49 animals escaped and  had to be put down by police officers in Zanesville, Ohio, that was in  2011. It is unclear how this bill would have prevented the situation,  for the owner committed suicide after letting all of his animals out of  their pens.   Actually, if this bill was based on putting the authority under  APHIS, where they already have law enforcement and the infrastructure  and the structure in place to enforce the regulations, it probably  would have had a better chance of stopping this than the language in  the current bill does.   No one wants to have people put in danger through escaped big cats,  but enacting duplicative Federal authorities under the Lacey Act and a  new agency is totally unnecessary. Any new authorities at the Federal  level should rest with APHIS.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  LaMalfa), who serves on the Agriculture Committee and can talk about  why this bill should have been under APHIS.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend, the chairman of the Natural  Resources Committee, for making a point that we have made, and that is  that there are bigger issues to talk about.   Unfortunately, the issues that my friend mentioned are not under the  jurisdiction of the House Natural Resources Committee. But energy  production on Federal lands and Federal waters are big issues that are  in the jurisdiction of our committee. So is mining all the critical  resources, the elements and minerals, that are going to be needed to  electrify the economy.   Regarding the big CHIPS bill that was just passed on the floor here,  a lot of the ingredients that go into those chips actually come from  China. One hundred percent of them come from China. So there are bigger  issues that we need to talk about.   Really, this bill shouldn't be taking all of this time, and it  wouldn't have taken all of this time if the majority had just worked  with us a little bit.  [[Page H7393]]    If they had done the commonsense thing and had put the jurisdiction  of regulating these cats under APHIS where it belongs, as I said  before, we would probably have this bill on the suspension calendar and  we would all be talking about what a good piece of legislation it is  and how it will benefit the country.   But when we take a simple issue and create a new Federal bureaucracy  and give authorities to an agency, that I don't even think wants these  authorities much less needs these authorities, is something we have to  make an issue of.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Hice).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I find this a bit amusing that the proponents of this  bill are rolling out all the law enforcement agencies that are  supportive of the bill.   And why wouldn't they be?   Why would they care which Federal agency deals with it?   They just don't want to have to deal with the problem themselves. So,  sure, they support this bill because it addresses a problem that they  are having to deal with now. But I doubt they have looked past the  point that it is creating a new Federal agency that doesn't affect  their budgets, it is creating a new Federal agency that makes things  duplicative, it doesn't affect their operations, and I am quite  certain, had we put the amendment in to put this under APHIS, we would  still have all those law enforcement agencies supporting this bill. So,  Mr. Speaker, you have to take that for what it is worth.   H.R. 263 is a template that is already being used to regulate other  animals. This is the weaponization of the Lacey Act. USDA does have  jurisdiction over privately owned cats. The USDA-licensed facilities  are not government-owned. So every time the logic trail that you go  down about why should this regulation be under U.S. Fish and Wildlife  or under the Department of the Interior, it comes back to there is no  logic. It is just that somebody had an agenda to put it under an agency  that is not equipped right now and doesn't have the personnel right now  to enforce it.   So it is creating a new authorization that, I believe, is going to  have happen to it what happens to many well-intended laws. They get  weaponized to go after something that they originally weren't set up to  go after.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr.  Fulcher).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Bentz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I just want to point out that it has been argued that we have got a  hodgepodge of laws across the State, or across the country, and that is  what makes America great is that we can have different laws that are  tailored to different regions of the country.   But there are two Federal laws regulating exotic animals, and they  are already on the books. The Captive Wildlife Society Act governs  interstate commerce of big cats, and the Animal Welfare Act governs big  cat enterprises.   H.R. 263 would overlay existing exotic animal laws, further  complicating Federal law and explicitly superseding State laws. If a  new Federal law is necessary--I will say it again--the Animal and Plant  Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, within USDA, has the expertise and  knowledge to carry out these responsibilities.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Again, this is a simple issue. It is an issue that we shouldn't even  be having to debate like this. It should be on suspension; but it just  shows you how there has been an unwillingness to work on commonsense  solutions to a simple problem.   It took up 2 days of committee debate when we could have been talking  about energy; when we could have been talking about high inflation  prices; when we could have been talking about a water crisis in the  West, the drought.   Mr. Speaker, there are 600,000 acres of land laying fallow in  California this summer because they don't have water. That has not even  come up for one debate in our Natural Resources Committee.   The gentleman talked about the crisis at the southern border. Forty  percent of the southern border is public lands, which falls under the  jurisdiction of our committee. We have not had a single discussion  about it.   We spent 2 days talking about big cats. We are spending valuable  floor time before we split for the August break debating big cats. And  we are debating an issue that could have been resolved simply.   I hope that going forward, I hope we can work on these issues in a  way that is better for the country; that is not trying to create some  new bureaucracy that can be used to achieve other goals. And I hope  that my colleagues will vote against H.R. 263.   If it somehow gets out of the House, I hope the Senate will not pass  it and maybe, in the next Congress, we can come back with commonsense  legislation that addresses this issue; puts the jurisdictions under the  right authorities; and we can, once and for all, move on from big cats,  and we can start talking about real issues that matter to our  constituents and to the hardworking taxpayers across the country.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 7283, the Safeguarding  Treatment for the Restoration of Ecosystems from Abandoned Mines Act,  also known as the STREAM Act.   The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act appropriated $11.3 billion  to the Abandoned Mine Lands, or the AML, trust fund. This money is for  use by State AML programs to address abandoned mine lands created  before enactment of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of  1977.   This historic, fee-based AML program allows a State to set aside up  to 30 percent of its annual AML grant in an interest-bearing account to  cover the long-term costs of acid mine drainage, or AMD, facilities,  which are often needed to address water treatment in historic coal  mining states.   The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act reauthorizes the  collection of the AML fee at a reduced rate, as well as a 30 percent  set-aside authority for States. However, the IIJA neglected to grant  parallel set-aside authority for the newly authorized $11.3 billion in  Treasury funds for AML projects.   This is one of the many areas Congress will need to correct in the  hastily passed IIJA bill, and it goes to show why we need to have  regular order, why we need to have committee hearings, and why we need  to take our time on these large bills.   That large IIJA bill never went through a committee in the House. It  was sent over from the Senate, hastily adopted, and here we are today,  trying to fix it. I am sure it won't be the last time.   The STREAM Act is a bipartisan bill that will make a technical fix to  IIJA, clarifying that States receiving newly authorized funds for AML  cleanup have the authority to set aside a portion of those funds for  AMD cleanup purposes consistent with existing law. This will allow  States to utilize AML funds according to their specific needs.   That said, the Department of the Interior recently released final  guidance for States applying to receive funds authorized for AML  cleanup that includes requirements over and above the letter of the  law. DOI should allow States to make decisions on prioritizing AML  sites and refrain from imposing unauthorized and heavy-handed  requirements.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  West Virginia (Mr. McKinley), who is the Republican lead on this  legislation and who is also a fellow engineer and knows a lot about  coal mining.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. I urge adoption  of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 5093, sponsored by the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler). This is a good bill,  and I commend her for her leadership on this effort.   Skamania County in Representative Herrera Beutler's district is  almost 77 percent federally owned. Unfortunately, because of the large  number of public lands in the county, less than 2 percent of the  county's land base can be taxed at full market value.   The presence of a large Federal estate is shared by many other rural  counties in the West, and it makes it very difficult for communities to  generate revenue needed to fund schools, roads, and vital public  services, such as police and fire departments.   H.R. 5093 would transfer ownership of approximately 23 acres of the  former Wind River Nursery from the Forest Service to the county to  expand uses that will draw in tourism, provide economic opportunities,  and create additional tax revenue for the county. The county estimates  that this conveyance will ultimately lead to an additional $600,000 in  revenue each year.  [[Page H7400]]    Skamania County has also already made considerable investments to  restore this site with upgrades to water mains, full restorations to  two residential buildings, and electric improvements to four additional  buildings.   I, again, thank the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler)  for her leadership on this bill. The legislation reflects a locally  driven compromise that meets the needs of the community, creates  additional recreation opportunities, and will lead to better management  of Federal land.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Herrera Beutler).    Mr. Speaker, I have had the opportunity to visit  Skamania County. It is a beautiful place, and I know that the people  there will be great stewards of this land. It will be good for Skamania  County, for Washington, and for the United States, and I urge adoption  of the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of S. 3451. However, when we  start sacrificing regular order to score political points, we are on an  extremely slippery slope. Unfortunately, that is the course this bill  sets us on.   It didn't move through the Committee on Natural Resources, the  committee of jurisdiction. Instead, it was one of the many promises  made by Democrat leadership to secure the votes they needed in the  Senate to pass the CHIPS-Plus Act.   The irony of this, Mr. Speaker, is yesterday we were in an all-day  long markup in the Natural Resources Committee on Chairman Grijalva's  Environmental Justice for All Act, which is a bill that really doubles  down on NEPA regulations. Obviously, we have differences of opinion on  that, but we were having the debate. Democrats wanted to increase NEPA  regulations, Republicans wanted to streamline regulations.   So you can imagine the shock when Chairman Grijalva's staff, almost  simultaneously with my staff, told us to be prepared tomorrow afternoon  because there is going to be a NEPA streamlining bill on the suspension  calendar.   When I was told the bill was being added, I thought to myself, this  bill didn't go through regular order, and this is something my  colleagues across the aisle would normally really be opposed to. So I  Googled the bill, and it turns out that S. 3451 is but a bargaining  chip in the larger CHIPS debate.  [[Page H7401]]    This is what I found on the internet. It said, ``From yesterday's  Roll Call, as they reported on the CHIPS-Plus package.'' A quote from  that is: ``One of the Republicans who voted for the bill . . . had  sought an amendment to fast track the permitting process for companies  building semiconductor plants . . . instead he was promised that the  House would clear his Senate-passed bill.''   This legislation, S. 3451, provides modest permit streamlining to  expedite reviews of infrastructure projects concerning semiconductors,  artificial intelligence and machine learning, high-performance  computing and advanced computer hardware and software, quantum  information science and technology, data storage, and data management,  or cybersecurity.                                time  1645    Mr. Speaker, I strongly support streamlining. In fact, for the last  18 months, Republicans on the Committee on Natural Resources have been  calling to move legislation that would streamline the onerous NEPA  process, cut bureaucratic red tape, and fight back against  environmental activist litigants, the kinds of meaningful actions  Congress needs to take to move our country forward.   I woke up this morning, and I was reading online my local newspaper  back home. There was actually a story about the CHIPS Act that talked  about this very bill that we have on the suspension calendar today. I  found it interesting that someone from the Sierra Club was interviewed  about it.   Now, normally if you are going to streamline NEPA, it sets Sierra  Club's hair on fire, and they are calling all of their activists and  putting alerts out. But it was interesting that on this one, the Sierra  Club was going to study the text a little bit more, even though we are  here this afternoon passing this on suspension.   These commonsense Republican solutions are crucial to improving the  health of our Federal lands, repairing our crumbling infrastructure,  constructing water storage projects needed to make our Western  communities more resilient to drought, and developing America's  domestic resources to secure our supply chain and our country.   In response, Democrats have repeatedly told us we were gutting  bedrock environmental laws, and that we support pillaging the land from  sea to shining sea.   Just yesterday, I spent, as I mentioned, over 10 hours in a Committee  on Natural Resources markup where the Democrats advanced a bill--we not  only debated it; we marked it up and advanced it--a bill to expand  NEPA, create more burdensome red tape, and handcuff our great Nation  from future development.   Now, today, after years of committee Republicans hearing how we are  trying to destroy America, suddenly the exact same commonsense  streamlining and reasonable sideboards on frivolous litigation are  necessary to build semiconductor plants and America's future.   This bill is only part of the solution. While building domestic chip  manufacturing facilities is important and we want to bring those jobs  to the United States for American workers, the reality is there is not  much domestic about a chip made with 100 percent foreign materials.   For instance, today, the United States is 100 percent reliant on  other countries to meet our demand for gallium and indium, both of  which are needed in semiconductors. China is the lead supplier for  both.   Semiconductors also require a mineral called bismuth, 90 percent of  which the U.S. imports. Again, China is the lead supplier to the U.S.  of bismuth.   Semiconductors are among dozens of high-tech commodities, such as  satellites, electric vehicles, and missile defense systems reliant on  mineral resources to function. China unquestionably controls the market  on nearly every one of the necessary minerals.   If we truly want to secure the supply chain for semiconductors and  the huge array of other products dependent on critical minerals, it is  imperative to ensure a robust domestic mining industry through an  efficient, predictable mine permitting system here in the United  States.   While the bill before us is a step in the right direction, it does  not address the supply chain necessary to build our domestic high-tech  manufacturing technology.   Republicans have the solutions. To name a few: H.R. 2604, the  Accessing America's Critical Mineral Act, introduced by Congressman  Pete Stauber, reforms onerous and duplicative steps in the critical  mineral permitting process by requiring Federal agencies to adhere to  timelines and improve coordination.   H.R. 2637, the American Critical Minerals Independence Act,  introduced by Congressmen   Michael Waltz and Paul Gosar, invests in  recycling technologies and innovative mining and processing techniques,  streamlines the permitting of critical minerals production, and  requires that agencies analyze the mineral potential of Federal lands.   If Democrats were serious about streamlining and promoting a robust  domestic manufacturing sector for semiconductors and other high-tech  applications, they would be bringing these bills and others to the  floor.   Mr. Speaker, S. 3451 is a modest step in the right direction, and I  support the passage of this bill. Now that it appears Democrats have  seen the error of their ways and they suddenly have done a 180 on  streamlining environmental bureaucracy, I look forward to working with  each and every Member who votes for this bill to advance many other  Republican solutions to further address streamlining and secure a  robust domestic critical minerals supply chain.   Unfortunately, while I would like to say that, with Democrats'  newfound support of streamlining, the remaining Republican solutions  will be coming to the floor quickly, something tells me Democrats'  willingness to ignore environmental extremists and bring up commonsense  policy solutions like S. 3451 has a lot more to do with politics than  making good policy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
