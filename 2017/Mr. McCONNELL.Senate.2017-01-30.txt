 Mr. President, for too long, coal communities in  States like Kentucky were unfairly targeted by the Obama administration  as part of its War on Coal. We now have the opportunity to start  providing relief to coal families, whose only crime was working to  support their loved ones. Easing the pain of these regulations is a  priority. I laid it out in a letter to President Trump earlier this  year. That letter was a continuation of efforts I began several years  ago to push back against the previous administration's assault on coal  families. I am pleased the President has already begun taking steps to  provide relief from several different regulations imposed by the former  administration, regulations that for too long have stifled growth and  held our country back.   Together, we can do more, including right here in Congress through  the Congressional Review Act or CRA process. One of the first  regulations we are working to address is the so-called stream buffer  rule, a harmful regulation put into place by the Obama administration  at the eleventh hour. One analysis estimates that it could threaten  one-third of the Nation's coal-mining jobs--one-third. That is why so  many across coal country have called for relief from this harmful  attack.   We have heard individual voices against this regulation. We have  heard union voices in opposition, like the United Mine Workers of  America, and we have heard from groups like the Kentucky Coal  Association, who recently wrote to me about its negative impact. Here  is what they said:         The undeniable truth is that this rule will have a real       impact on the real world. It will cause real harm to real       people who support real families in real communities.    This regulation is an attack on coal families. It jeopardizes jobs  and transfers power away from States and local governments. Today, I am  introducing a bipartisan resolution to overturn it.   Congress will also continue acting to provide relief from other  regulations that attack our economy and our constituents. In fact, the  House will act on its own version of this Congressional Review Act  resolution and several others this week. I urge our friends to do so  quickly so we can pass them here in the Senate and start providing  relief to our coal communities, to our national economy, and to our  constituents.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Senate will continue working to put  into place President Trump's Cabinet, and tonight we will have a  cloture vote on the nominee for Secretary of State. This nominee is  well qualified. He has been a leader at one of America's largest  employers, and he has the type of international work experience that  will serve him well as our next Secretary of State. We are looking  forward to advancing his nomination tonight.   Remember, it is in everybody's best interest to confirm each of the  President's well-qualified nominees in a timely manner so they can  begin the very important work before them on  [[Page S462]]  matters of national security, the economy, health care, and so many  others.   It is also in our Nation's best interests to confirm the next Supreme  Court nominee, which the President has said he intends to announce  tomorrow. Justice Antonin Scalia was a towering figure on the Supreme  Court. His unfortunate passing was not only a great loss to our  country, but it came, as we all know, as our country was already in the  midst of a contentious Presidential election process. So in keeping  with the Biden rule, which states that action on a Supreme Court  nomination must be put off until the election campaign is over, I have  stood firm on the principle that the American people should have a  voice in the selection of the next Supreme Court Justice. I  consistently maintained that the next President would fill this  vacancy. I held to that view even when nearly everyone thought the  President would be Hillary Clinton. Our friends on the left may lack  the same consistency on this topic. The principle we have followed,  after all, is not only known as the Biden rule but also the Schumer  standard.   But there is one thing from which we can expect the left not to  waiver: trying to paint whoever is actually nominated in apocalyptic  terms. It does not matter whom this Republican President nominates. It  does not matter whom any Republican President nominates really. The  left has been rolling out the same tired playbook for decades.   When the Republican President was George Herbert Walker Bush, groups  on the left said the record of his first Supreme Court nominee was  ``disturbing'' and ``very troubling'' and that his opinions ``threaten  to undo the advances made by women, minorities, dissenters and other  disadvantaged groups.'' That is what the left said about President Bush  41's first nominee. Who was it? David Souter.   When the Republican President was Ronald Reagan, groups on the left  also said that the record of one of his nominees was ``troubling.''  They even called him a ``sexist'' and said he ``would be a disaster for  women'' if confirmed. The nominee in question? Anthony Kennedy.   When the Republican President was Gerald Ford, the left said that  they had ``grave concern with his Supreme Court nominee'' and that the  record of this nominee ``revealed an extraordinary lack of sensitivity  to the problems women face.'' In fact, they said he was disqualified  from being a member of the Supreme Court of the United States because  of his consistent opposition to women's rights. Who was the nominee  they were referring to? John Paul Stevens.   I am serious. That is what they said about John Paul Stevens, David  Souter, and Anthony Kennedy.   So we can expect to hear a lot of end-times rhetoric from the left  again today. In fact, we already have. The same groups on the left that  always seem to say the sky is falling when a Republican President puts  forward a Supreme Court nominee are saying it is falling again. Only  this time, they are saying it before we even have a nominee. We don't  even have a nominee yet.   President Trump has a list of about 20 Americans he is considering  nominating to the Supreme Court. These men and women have different  professional backgrounds, different life experiences. Some have  distinguished themselves in State courts; others have distinguished  themselves in Federal Court. Some are appellate court judges; others  are trial court judges. Some passed the Senate without a single  negative vote against their nomination; others passed the Senate  without requiring a rollcall vote at all on their nomination.   The bipartisan support, the years of judicial experience, the  impressive credentials--none of these appear to matter to some on the  left. They say things like ``We are prepared to oppose every name on  the list.'' That is right. Every single name on the list they have  already announced opposition to. Even more troubling, some Senate  Democrats are saying the same thing. My friend from New York said it  was hard for him to imagine a nominee from President Trump whom Senate  Democrats could support. We don't even have one yet.   I hope we can all skip past that and get down to our serious work.  The election is now behind us. The President has been working to make  his decision on a nominee. We expect him to announce that decision  tomorrow. The Senate should respect the results of the election and  treat this newly elected President's nominee in the same way the  nominees of other newly elected Presidents have been treated; that is,  with careful consideration followed by an up-or-down vote.   We had two nominations in the first term of President Clinton:  Ginsburg and Breyer. Both got up-or-down votes. There was no  filibuster. We had two nominations in the first term of President  Obama: Sotomayor and Kagan. No filibuster. Up-or-down votes. First-term  Presidents. We have every right to expect the same courtesy from  today's minority when we receive this nomination tomorrow.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the joint resolution be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was  ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S.J. Res. 10         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress       disapproves the final rule submitted by the Secretary of the       Interior relating to stream protection (81 Fed. Reg. 93066       (December 20, 2016)), and such rule shall have no force or       effect.
