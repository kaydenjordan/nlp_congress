 Mr. President, today, I want to honor Rabbi Menachem  Mendel Schneerson, who led the Lubavitch movement and contributed  greatly to education, morality, and charity worldwide. Menachem Mendel  Schneerson, much like his father, was a rabbi and scholar who served  his community immensely. April 12, 2022, marks the celebration of what  would have been the Rebbe's 100th birthday.   In 1941, Rabbi Schneerson, also known as the rebbe, fled war-torn  Europe, and arrived in the United States. As a refugee who experienced  the despotic rule of Stalinist Russia and the horrors of Nazi Germany,  he understood the importance of faith in times of hardship. Upon  arriving in New York, Rabbi Schneerson led the Chabad-Lubavitch  movement. This movement grew greatly under Rabbi Schneerson's  leadership and helped to guide the Jewish community after the  atrocities of the Holocaust.   By the time of Rabbi Schneerson's death in 1994, the Chabad-Lubavitch  movement consisted of over 2,000 institutions with centers in cities  and university campuses worldwide. These outreach organizations  function to teach people about Judaism and foster the Jewish identity.   Rabbi Schneerson also published renowned works on the Torah and  Judaism. His work continues to lead many in spirituality, learning, and  the process of restrengthening the Jewish faith internationally. He  understood that all were created equal and exemplified this in his  inclusion of every man, woman, and child in his teachings.   Rabbi Schneerson's extraordinary life and work has long been  recognized by the Congress and, in 1994, was posthumously awarded the  Congressional Gold Medal for his contributions.   Today, we celebrate the life of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. The  rebbe was an individual who exemplified channeling personal struggles  into positive change internationally. His legacy lives on through the  impacts he made, and the many Chabad centers worldwide, including those  in Kentucky. For Kentuckians, Americans, and all in the international  community, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson's efforts will continue to  make an impact well beyond the century since his birth.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize the  small business, A Place To Belong Home Care of Radcliff, KY, as the  Senate Small Business of the Week.   It is not every week that I have the privilege of honoring a veteran- owned small business, but when I do, it is with profound gratitude and  respect not only for this Kentucky entrepreneur, but for our men and  women in uniform. A Place to Belong Home Care was founded by SFC Lolita  R. Martin who, before opening her business, spent 24 years in uniform,  3 and half of which spent on the battlefield in support of Iraq Freedom  and Enduring Freedom. Even while serving her country overseas, Ms.  Martin knew that entrepreneurship was her next calling. With that in  mind, Ms. Martin remained steadfast in her desire to continue serving  others in her career, which led her to the idea of senior care. Thus,  after retiring from a lengthy career in our Nation's uniform, Lolita  Martin founded A Place to Belong Home Care in 2019.   The mission behind A Place To Belong Home Care is to improve the  quality of life for aging adults and to support their families in  caring for loved ones. The business provides a wide variety of  services, not limited to elderly care. Whether the client is an adult  or child with special needs, recovering from surgery or illness, or  managing a disease or lifelong condition, A Place To Belong Home Care  is there to help. And with services offered in Hardin, Bullitt, Meade,  and Grayson County, as well as in other parts of Kentucky, Ms. Martin  ensures that her business reaches the broad scope of needs for anyone  requiring daily care.   Upon her retirement from the U.S. Armed Forces, Ms. Martin was primed  for her current career. During her third deployment to Iraq, Ms. Martin  began pursuing her Bachelor of science in healthcare management. A  requirement for the degree was a capstone project on senior care, thus  the seed for A Place To Belong Home Care was planted. The idea grew and  developed throughout her time protecting our Nation; hence there is no  doubt as to why her business has seen such success and growth in  Kentucky. In 2019, Ms. Martin was proud to receive the Best in Class  Home Health Certification from the 21st Century Health Care Consultants  group. After caring for others throughout her life, Ms. Martin clearly  is the right fit for the job.   This entrepreneur also understands the importance of maintaining an  active presence in her local community. Ms. Martin preserves her  dedication to national service by being an active member of the  National Association of Black Veterans, the Kentucky Colonel, and the  Veterans of Foreign Wars group. Though this patriot has moved on from  her Active-Duty career, she stays true to her roots as she ventures  into an equally honorable career of providing care for those who are  not able to take full care of themselves. Congratulations to Lolita  Martin and the entire team at A Place To Belong Home Care. I thank you  for your brave service to this country and for your enduring desire to  serve others. I wish the whole team the best of luck and look forward  to watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Kentucky Chapter of the National  Association of Women Business Owners--NAWBO--provides dynamic  opportunities for women to network with other business owners, mentor  one another, develop partnerships, and incubate and foster that next  big idea. It is comprised of women of all ages and levels of experience  from all sectors of the marketplace.   This year, as NAWBO Kentucky celebrates three decades of success  stories that are as diverse as our Commonwealth, its members have  established a Legacy Award to recognize women business owners who have  excelled for 30 or more years. The first to be honored in such a way is  Alice Houston, of Louisville. Alice is known as an entrepreneur, the  president and CEO of the largest minority-owned transportation company  in North America; as a tireless and dedicated board member, of such  organizations as the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and the National  Urban League; as a philanthropist, leading with her own generosity to  raise funds for worthy causes and institutions; and as a wife, mother,  and grandmother. She embodies the true character of the Legacy Award.   Every young woman who wants to be a trailblazer, who envisions a life  of giving back while moving forward, or who is struggling to chart a  bold new direction for her business is thankful that there are real- life phenomena like Alice Houston, whose business acumen, love of  family and community, and generosity of spirit light a pathway to great  possibilities.   I am proud to salute the Kentucky Association of Women Business  Owners on its 30th anniversary and to honor Alice Houston as the  inaugural recipient of its Legacy Award.                            ____________________
