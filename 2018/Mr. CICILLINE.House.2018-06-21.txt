 Mr. Speaker, every single day, seven children and  teens are killed by gun violence; 40 more are shot and survive. Most of  the time, the incident could have been prevented if the gun involved  was unloaded and locked away safely.   Mr. Speaker, 1.7 million American children live in a home with a  loaded, unlocked gun, and three out of every four children ages 5 to 14  know where guns are kept in their home.   That is why today I am introducing a resolution to recognize June 21  as National Ask Day, the first day of summer, to encourage parents to  ask a simple question to anyone who is responsible for their children  in another home after school: Is there a loaded, unsecured gun in your  house? Asking this simple question will help save lives and reduce the  level of gun violence in our country.   This is a commonsense idea that both Democrats and Republicans should  be able to agree on, because no matter our politics, we all believe  that our children should be free from the scourge of gun violence.   Again, this is National Ask Day. We are asking everyone to just ask a  simple question. Wherever your children are going after school, whether  to another residence or to a family member or friend, ask the simple  question: Is there a loaded, unlocked gun in that house? And be sure  that it is secured. Help save the lives of so many American children.                            ____________________
