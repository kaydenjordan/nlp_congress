 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  accomplishments of some outstanding students in my district.   Recently, the Principles of Engineering Class at Pella High School  won the high school division of the Build Iowa's Future Design  Challenge. This design challenge asks students to create innovative  projects to improve their community.   Pella is the home of some global, worldwide excellent manufacturing  facilities, such as Pella windows and Vermeer manufacturing, so the  students drew inspiration from their own hometown.   The class designed an advanced manufacturing lab to be created at the  Career Academy of Pella to provide experiences and opportunities for  students looking to pursue a career in manufacturing.   Congratulations to Isaac, Crista, Jack, Stephen, Kaysar, Emmalee,  Grace, Wyatt, and Jackson on the win. I am thrilled to acknowledge  these high school students and to see them introduce innovative  solutions to the growing field of manufacturing, and I am excited to  see these students become leaders of tomorrow.   Recognizing Sarah Watson    Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Sarah  Watson.   Sarah is a University of Iowa graduate, where she was editor of the  student-run newspaper, The Daily Iowan. Sarah took her talents to Quad- City Times following graduation where she reports on politics and  elections.   During Sarah's time at Quad-City Times, she has reported on pertinent  veterans' issues and the full breakdown of legislation introduced at  the local, State, and Federal levels.   Sarah's commitment to journalism has not gone unnoticed. Recently,  Sarah was awarded the Jay P. Wagner Prize for Young Journalists by the  Iowa Newspaper Association. This award is dedicated to the late Jay P.  Wagner, an Iowa newspaper reporter and editor who had a passion for  encouraging young reporters to report on local communities. This award  is awarded to journalists 30 years old or younger who display a deep  passion and love for Iowa and its people.   I can think of no person more deserving of this award than Sarah. Her  drive to inform the community on issues and topics in their government  is unmatched, and I am proud to have journalists like her reporting on  issues in my district.                 Happy Birthday to Joseph and Matthew Martino     Madam Speaker, I would also like to take a minute  to recognize the birthday of my nephews, Joseph and Matthew Martino.   Happy birthday to Joseph and Matthew.                            ____________________
