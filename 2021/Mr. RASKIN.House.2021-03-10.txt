 Mr. Speaker, Americans are 25 more times more likely to  die from gun violence than people who live in other developed  countries, and on that point our perpetually outraged and indignant  colleagues have absolutely nothing to say.   We lose 38,000 people a year, more than 100 people a day. From  Newtown, Connecticut, to El Paso, Texas, gun violence is ripping the  heart out of our social contract, making life for more Americans nasty,  poor, solitary, brutish; in short, a Hobbesian state of war.   H.R. 8 will close three gaping loopholes in the law; the gun shows  loophole, the internet loophole, and the private sale loophole, cutting  down precisely on the traffic in illegal guns, which our colleagues  cite as the source of criminal gun violence.   In opposing the American Rescue Plan, they voted against science. In  opposing H.R. 1, they voted against democracy. And now in opposing H.R.  8, they are voting against public safety and the social contract  itself. What a moral collapse for a once-great party.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, some of my colleagues are invoking the  Second Amendment quite promiscuously today, but they obviously haven't  read any of the relevant Supreme Court authority because Justice  Scalia, in District of Columbia v. Heller, explicitly upheld  reasonable, commonsense regulations to guarantee that violent criminals  don't get guns.   So, everything that we are doing is perfectly in advance of, in  pursuit of, Second Amendment rights that are exercised coextensively  with the public safety and with the common good.   Here is a regulation that we need, that we have known we have needed  ever since a violent white supremacist killed nine African-American  Christian worshippers at a Bible class in Charleston, South Carolina.  He should have been denied a gun, but he got it because the background  check search wasn't completed in 3 days. He got it automatically,  although he shouldn't have had it, and nine people are dead because of  it.   We say, let's close that loophole. Just like with H.R. 8, let's make  sure that the universal background check is universal.   Mr. Speaker, 90 percent of the American people support it.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman very much for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, this is reasonable, commonsense gun safety legislation  contemplated by Justice Scalia, by the Supreme Court, under the Second  Amendment of the Constitution.   It is what America needs so that we don't have a rate of gun violence  and gun deaths 25 times higher than everybody else in the  industrialized world.   Yet, some people are so under the spell of the NRA, a deeply corrupt  organization that is ripping off money from loyal gun owners around the  country, that they are unwilling to stand with the common good.
