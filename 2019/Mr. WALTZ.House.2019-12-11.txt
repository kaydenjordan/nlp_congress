 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this defense bill  because we are a nation at war.   We are in a hot war with extremists around the world, and we are in a  cold war with our peer competitors, Russian and China and other rogue  states.   And Madam Speaker, if the country isn't safe, everything else that we  do in this body is secondary. Our domestic priorities, our economy, our  education, trade, everything else that we debate in this Congress is at  risk if we fail to protect this great Nation.   One of the reasons that I ran for elected office, was that often what  comes out of Washington isn't worthy of our previous veterans, my  fellow special operators around the world, as we speak, and other  military currently deployed, and it is not worthy of their families and  the sacrifices of their families.   This defense bill, from the sixth branch of the military and the  Space Force, to childcare for Gold Star families, it is worthy. It is  worthy of their sacrifice, past and present.   I deeply and personally thank the chairman, Adam Smith. I thank the  ranking member, Mr. Thornberry, and everyone else who stepped up,  frankly, and all of my colleagues who stepped up to make the  compromises necessary to pass this critical piece of legislation to be  worthy of those who have sacrificed for all of us breathing free air  today.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it. It is worthy of  them, as we all are with this bill.
