 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a  friend and senior member of my team, Jim Lazarus, upon his recent  retirement from public service. Jim has been a key adviser to me, in  official roles and otherwise, for the past 40 years, and I wish him all  the very best in retirement.   Jim has spent nearly 50 years of dedicated service to San Francisco  and the people of California. After graduating from American University  and the University of Santa Clara Law School, he was admitted to the  California Bar in 1974 and went to work for Governor Jerry Brown where  he, among other things, made strides in protecting the  [[Page S1177]]  rights of farmworkers. He then served as the deputy city attorney for  the city of San Francisco when I was serving on the board of  supervisors.   After a few years in private practice, I was lucky enough to bring  Jim back to city hall in 1983 as executive deputy mayor for finance and  administration. Jim helped run San Francisco, managing our operations  and keeping us in good financial shape. Jim has said, ``The best job I  ever had was the years I was deputy mayor to Feinstein, a great job if  you're a San Franciscan and love the city.'' And I will add to that:  The City of San Francisco benefited greatly from Jim's legal acumen and  management during that critical time.   Jim served in a variety of public and civic positions after that,  including with the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, Hunters Point  Citizens Advisory Committee, chief of staff to Mayor Frank Jordan, and  even chief operating officer of the San Francisco Zoological Society.   Wherever there was a need to solve a problem, Jim was ready and  willing to go. It was my good fortune to have him come back to my  office in 1999 as State director for my Senate operation. In that role,  he oversaw the staff across our State offices and advocated for  California's needs in the U.S. Senate.   Unfortunately, Jim was a rolling stone and returned to the San  Francisco Chamber of Commerce in 2006, where he remained for 13 years  as senior VP for public policy.   Anyone who knows San Francisco can imagine how challenging and  sensitive that role must be. It combines the business interests of  cutting-edge leaders in high tech, the longstanding commercial goals of  mainstream U.S. businesses, and one of the most challenging legal and  regulatory frameworks in the United States.   To my eternal gratitude, I was able to convince Jim, at the end of  2018, to put off retirement and come back one last time to be my State  director. He was in that position when COVID hit the Nation, and our  office went into overdrive to help Californians get through the  pandemic and the economic collapse. He has overseen the State staff  through California's two worst fire seasons on record and the growing  drought. For many months, he has been a trusted friend and partner,  going over the issues of day, business before the Senate, and life in  San Francisco.   Jim's last day with the Senate was February 28, a day fittingly named  ``Jim Lazarus Day'' in San Francisco by Mayor London Breed. His efforts  have made the city a better place and have made me a more effective  Senator. In addition to his work at the Federal level, he has been  pivotal in protecting and strengthening the rights of so many  Californians, to include the LGBT community, the business community,  renters, and those seeking clean air and water. He has made a huge mark  over decades improving the services and culture of San Francisco.   Jim has now retired and plans to spend more time with his wife Ann  and their children Kate, Nicole, Jack, and Michael. I have no doubt  that he will keep his oar in civic life, and I will leave the door open  for another chat over a glass of California Chardonnay.                            ____________________
