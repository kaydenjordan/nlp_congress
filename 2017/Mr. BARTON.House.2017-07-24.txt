 Mr. Speaker, today is the 19th anniversary, if you can  call it an anniversary, of a shooting in the United States Capitol in  which two Capitol Police officers, Officer Chestnut and Detective  Gibson, were killed. They were defending the Capitol, and a gunman got  in and was heading towards the majority leader at the time, Tom DeLay's  office. And they, in defending that office, were shot and killed.   The Speaker at the time and the Congress at the time established a  Wounded Officers Fund, but they made it specific to those two fallen  officers.   As we all know, on June 14, we had another shooting, although it was  at a baseball practice for the charity baseball game where the  Republican Members were practicing out in Alexandria, Virginia. Two  officers, Officers Bailey and Griner, were both seriously injured in  defending the 20-some-odd Republican Members that were at practice that  morning.   What this bill does, Mr. Speaker, is simply take an existing fund  that was established for two officers that were killed in the line of  duty and open it up, now and in the future, for Capitol Police officers  who were seriously injured in the line of duty defending the Capitol  and defending the Members.   I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F.  Doyle), the Democratic manager, for being an original sponsor with me.  I want to thank every member of the Republican and Democratic baseball  teams who have signed on as original sponsors.   I want to thank Paul Ryan and Kevin McCarthy, Steny Hoyer and Nancy  Pelosi, leadership on both sides of the aisle, for making it possible  to bring this bill to the floor. We introduced it last Thursday, and we  are voting on it tonight; and wonder of wonders, the Senate is probably  going to vote on it tomorrow, and there is a chance the President will  sign it this week.                                time  1700    We are showing the American people that we can work together for a  noble cause. As has already been pointed out, Officers Bailey and  Griner both, at risk to their own lives, defended the Members, staff,  and volunteers at that baseball practice on June 14.   I watched Officer Bailey run past me directly at the shooter, risking  his life, and two other Alexandria Police officers who had arrived on  the scene assisted him. Officer Griner was wounded but was providing  covering fire, and that is when they brought down the shooter.   They are heroes. They have sustained injuries. They deserve some  assistance. The American people have donated probably $600,000 or  $700,000 to provide some assistance, and this technical change in the  existing fund would allow that to happen.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Davis. I hope everybody can support  this.
