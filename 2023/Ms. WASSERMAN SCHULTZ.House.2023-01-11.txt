 Madam Speaker, it is time for our Republican  colleagues to stop playing politics with women's bodies.   With the fall of Roe, the criminalization of abortion access  nationwide with no exceptions is well underway.   Just last year in my home State of Florida, Governor DeSantis signed  a 15-week abortion ban into law that offers no exceptions for rape,  incest, or human trafficking, and more restrictive policies are coming.   Other States are even more restrictive, and the bill and resolution  before us will further erode women's reproductive rights. These  measures incentivize violence by failing to condemn a history of  violence against abortion providers and patients.   While millions of Americans will lose under these measures, its  harshest impacts land on single, working, and women of color.   A lack of access to safe abortions not only deprives a woman of the  basic right to control her own body, but it also stifles her future  economic, educational, and family planning opportunities. It basically  hands her body, life, and future over to the State.   These horrific anti-abortion measures are a revolting assault on  women's rights, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on both  measures.
