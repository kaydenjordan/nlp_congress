 Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader  and the distinguished other Senator from Mississippi for their  comments.   I have often thought that Thad Cochran and I would serve here  together straight through whatever time we have in the Senate. Because  he is such a dear friend, I have often felt that Senator Thad Cochran  was plucked from a central casting to fill the role of a devoted public  servant. More than most of us, he looks the part, but more than most of  us, he embodies the best of what the Senate can be. Currently, in this  body, I have served longer here than anybody else, but I have never  felt closer to a Senator than I do to Thad Cochran, my dear friend.   Our country needs more public servants like Thad. As Congress has  become more partisan in recent years, Thad has stood by his values. He  brings substance, not sound-bites, to the upper Chamber. His  leadership, as has been described, as ``the quiet persuader'' is going  to be missed.   They talk about his being the son of a schoolteacher. So it is no  shock that he devoted his life to public service. He joined the Navy  after graduating from Ole Miss. He went on to earn a law degree from  the University of Mississippi and then became engaged in Mississippi  politics, often traveling with his father to help with voter  registrations in campaigns around the State. He worked on campaigns  from county sheriff to the Governor's race.   Thad then went to the House in 1972--here to Washington, a couple  years ahead of me--and then we became Senate partners in 1978.   He and I both became chairmen of the Senate Committee on Agriculture,  Nutrition, and Forestry. Today in the committee's hearings room, our  official portraits hang together. It is easy to tell them apart. He is  the one with the hair and better looking.  [[Page S1895]]    Marcelle and I have joined Thad in Mississippi to visit sprawling  cotton farms and fish farms, and twice Thad joined me in Vermont to  visit small family dairy farmers. I even introduced him to my mother in  Montpelier.   Now, I have to make a confession here, and I hope this doesn't go out  of this room. It was during one of those trips to Vermont--to St.  Johnsbury, VT--in 1985 that I had extolled the beauty of Vermont in the  wintertime. When we arrived, I think the southern gentleman was not  ready for temperatures that dipped down to around 20 below zero. That  is cold weather even by Vermont standards. This wonderful southern  gentleman turned to me and he said: Pat, this is not Mississippi  weather. Then, he made a few other suggestions of what I was trying to  do to him, but we had a wonderful visit just the same. We stayed in  what is called the Rabbit Inn, with fireplaces going. The next day at  our meetings, I think Vermont was ready to elect Thad Cochran as its  third Senator, because he was so impressive.   We also traveled beyond Vermont and Mississippi. We met with leaders  around the world. As senior Members of the Senate, we could go in a  bipartisan way to see what they thought about the United States and to  answer their questions. We and our wives became closer in these fact- finding visits. No matter how long the trip was--and some were to the  other side of the Earth--Thad, through his conversation and his  friendship, made even the longest trip seem short.   In our travels, one of the things I could always count on was that  Thad would always check in on the Cochran fellows in whatever country  we were in. Starting in 1984, the Cochran Fellowship Program has  provided training for more than 17,500 people from 125 different  countries to develop agricultural systems and to strengthen trade  between our countries. The program also strengthens understanding  between the United States and other countries.   Thad is leaving a legacy that is tied to our Nation's agricultural  development. When he was chair of the Agriculture Committee, he left  his fingerprints on the farm bill, which are still there today. More  recently, we championed the reauthorization of the Farm to School  Program, which provides Federal resources to bring fresh and nutritious  local food from local farmers to more than 40,000 schools across the  country, including 83 percent of the schools in Vermont--what a legacy,  as the son of a teacher and a great advocate for Mississippi farmers.  Thad knows how important this program is to strengthening local farm  economies and educating young kids and their families about the  importance of eating locally grown and nutritionally dense food. This  picture was taken as we were visiting a farm--obviously not when it was  25 below zero. It was probably a warm summer day. So that is why we  only have on light sweaters.   Even though we are on the opposite ends of the political spectrum,  Thad and I have crossed the aisle to work hand-in-hand for the American  people--from our work in the Senate to our work for years as regents at  the Smithsonian. In every bill and program on which we have worked, he  has been a Senator with integrity, decency, civility, and, most  importantly, a dear and cherished friend. Thad will always keep his  word, and I tell that to the Senate because that is a quality that is  becoming too rare sometimes in both parties. He is old school. Many of  us would say the best school.   When I became vice chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I  knew I would have a steadfast partner in Senator Cochran. He has earned  the moniker of ``the quiet persuader.'' He was also referred to by one  of the members of the Appropriations Committee once--a moniker that  should be appreciated--as a workhorse, not a show horse. That is why he  has been so successful--the quiet persuader. Well, the quite persuader,  when Hurricane Katrina struck, used his leadership to direct nearly  $100 billion to communities on the gulf coast to rebuild.   Thad will leave this Chamber having cast more than 13,000 votes and  becoming the 10th longest serving Senator in the history of our  country. A constant champion of Mississippi and the American people, I  don't think many people truly understand how much Senator Cochran has  accomplished for his State and his country.   Marcelle and I count Thad and Kay among our dearest friends. His  leadership on the Appropriations Committee in the Senate will be sorely  missed. Our country needs more devoted public servants like Thad  Cochran, and I am sad to see my dear friend leave. But I know his  legacy is a presence that will be felt in this Chamber, in Mississippi,  and across the country for generations to come. I will enjoy looking at  the photographs of my dear friend taken in Vermont, Mississippi, and  around the world. He is one of my heroes.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we are at an interesting time. We have had  months of intense negotiations, sometimes lasting all night and  throughout weekends. We have had very tough choices. We have had some  very good-faith compromises. In other words, we have actually handled  legislation the way we should.   We have reached a bipartisan agreement to fund the government for  this fiscal year and to make renewed investments in the American people  and to protect our national security.   The fiscal year 2018 Omnibus appropriations bill has $1.3 trillion in  discretionary spending. That includes $700 billion for defense programs  to support our men and women in uniform and $600 billion in nondefense  programs that will help us invest in America and support our working  families.   The bill has critical resources dedicated to combating the opioid  epidemic, to rebuilding America's infrastructure, to improving  healthcare facilities for our veterans, to improving access to  affordable healthcare for all Americans, to ensuring the security of  our elections, to supporting advances in scientific research, and to  investing in rural communities across the country.   The Presiding Officer and every Senator have rural parts of their  States, and the investments to be made in those rural communities  should be good news for every Senator.   These investments would not have been possible without the 2018  bipartisan budget agreement that lifted the budget caps on  discretionary spending--lifted the caps for defense by $80 billion and  for nondefense by $63 billion--providing relief from the severe cuts in  both defense and nondefense known as sequestration.   The consequences of the 2011 Budget Control Act, which mandated  sequestration, have been devastating to our military and domestic  priorities. This bill is a long-awaited step toward reversing those  cuts and allowing us to reinvest in the American people.   I wish the President would actually read what is in the bill. He is  calling these investments in our country's priorities a waste. Can you  imagine--investing in the priorities of the United States of America a  waste?   This morning, he tweeted that they were ``Dem''--I suppose he means  Democrats--``giveaways.'' I would ask, Mr. President, is it a giveaway  to provide medical care for the 7 million veterans who rely on the VA?  I would ask, is it a giveaway to help the family in Rutland, VT, heat  their home during a dangerously cold winter so they can afford their  groceries? I would ask, is it a giveaway to finally take the opioid  crisis seriously by making investments in research, treatment, and  prevention?   The President slammed our efforts for budget parity, but he has since  shamelessly held press conferences to tout initiatives only made  possible by this agreement, including the sizeable new investments to  counter the opioid epidemic. Even though it was critical  [[Page S1930]]  that we put money in for that, he is now saying, of course, it was his  idea.   A budget is where you set your priorities. The President made clear  in his budget that his priorities do not rest with the needs of hard- working, middle-class Americans. The bill rejects many of those areas  where the President wanted cuts in the needs of hard-working, middle- class Americans. Instead, the bill sets a vision for the future of our  country. We invest not only in the wealthiest among us but in middle- class families and those who are struggling to make their way and make  their community better.   We dedicate $18.25 billion to begin rebuilding our infrastructure.  The American Society of Civil Engineers gives our country's  infrastructure a D-plus. A lot of countries have much higher. This was  the collective grade for the roads, bridges, dams, drinking water,  wastewater, public parks, and schools on which we all depend. That is  not acceptable, not in this country, and this bill is an important,  long-overdue step toward bringing our infrastructure into the 21st  century.   The bill takes the opioid crisis seriously by investing $3.3 billion  into law enforcement, healthcare, and community efforts that we know  help to rid our country of this scourge. The time for sloganeering and  sound bites is over. I have always preferred substance over slogans,  and the time for real, effective, and meaningful investment in ending  this epidemic has arrived. Marcelle and I have met with too many  Vermonters as we go around our State who are impacted by opioid abuse,  too many neighbors and friends who are struggling to get the help they  need or to help those in need. I am glad that when I return to Vermont,  I can say that we heard them, and we delivered.    This bill strongly rejects the partisan package passed by House  Republicans in September, which would have recklessly slashed funding  for domestic priorities by $68 billion below the bipartisan agreement  introduced Wednesday. Most importantly, this bill rejects devastating  cuts proposed by the Trump administration. These included the  President's proposed cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency, which  helps ensure we have clean air and drinking water. The bill rejects his  cuts to job training, education, and childcare programs that so many of  our Nation's working families rely on. It rejects the President's  misguided proposal to slash the budget for the Department of State.  This bill also rejects the President's misguided immigration priorities  by refusing his request to hire an additional 850 ICE agents and  increase the number of ICE detention beds. It also rejects his request  to build a ``big, beautiful wall'' on the southern border--something  that reflects last century's technology. Instead of his original $1.6  billion request for 74 miles of wall, which was later increased to a  request for $18 billion to build a wall on the entire southern border,  the bill funds only a fraction of that, and it includes important  restrictions on how the funds can be used.   The bill provides $641 million for 33 miles of fencing in the Rio  Grande Valley, $251 million to replace secondary fencing, which is  already in San Diego, and $445 million for replacement of existing  pedestrian fencing. It speaks to real need, not to funding a campaign  slogan.   Incidentally, in the request, somehow the campaign promise that this  would be paid for by Mexico, and not by American taxpayers, seems to  have been forgotten.   Importantly, the bill includes language requiring the Department of  Homeland Security to use proven fence designs that currently exist on  the border instead of allowing the President to build a 30-foot  concrete wall, which would endanger our men and women who patrol the  border.   I would still like the President to tell us when and how he wants  Mexico to cover these costs because, time and again, he promised the  American people Mexico would a pay for it. Time and again, he gave us  his word. We now know that was never a promise he could keep.   One critical thing missing from this bill, though, is a remedy for  the crisis the President has created, and that crisis relates to DACA  recipients. I have watched with fury as the President has, day after  day, tweeted the Democrats are responsible for not addressing DACA.  Late last night, he tweeted:         Democrats refused to take care of DACA. Would have been so       easy, but they just didn't care.    Balderdash. For nearly two decades, I have been a proud supporter of  the DREAM Act. I included it in the 2013 comprehensive immigration  bill. I care. Democrats care. We voted for that bill on the floor of  the Senate. Republican leadership in the House refused to take it up.  Yet, after promising before Members of Congress in both parties and the  American people, making a big splash on TV, the President said he would  sign an agreement to address DACA, but then he walked away from a  bipartisan DACA and border security compromise in February.   There is no fix for DACA because the President and the Republican  leadership are not serious about getting one. I wish they would. This  Senator is willing to sit down with any Senator--Republican or  Democratic--if we can get such an agreement.   This bill does strike more than 130 poison pill riders. These riders  would have restricted women's access to healthcare. They would have  rolled back environmental protections. They would have put significant  restrictions on consumer financial protections. Had these riders stayed  in, we would not have reached a successful conclusion to this  negotiation, notwithstanding the all-night sessions of negotiating,  notwithstanding the weekends.   I do not agree with everything in this bill. When you have a package  of this magnitude, there is always going to be matters included that we  like and things on which we disagree. That is the nature of compromise,  but the Senate was designed by the Founders of this country to require  compromise. This bill represents tangible progress that is going to  benefit all Americans, and I am proud of the compromise Republicans and  Democrats reached together.   I thank my own staff. They have worked days and nights and weekends.  I am able to leave at night. They are still working well past midnight.  I was able to go to Vermont last weekend. I worked with them by phone,  but they stayed here working throughout the weekend--all hours, for  several weeks, and nonstop in the homestretch of finishing this  comprehensive bill:    My staff director, Chuck Kieffer, whose experience and depth of  knowledge has become essential to me in my role as vice chairman of the  Appropriations Committee. It was especially helpful, too, that Mr.  Kieffer's expertise was available to any Senator who asked--Republican  or Democratic;   Chanda Betourney, a native Vermonter, deputy staff director and  general counsel, who has taken with her to these negotiations her  Vermont values and her long Senate experience;   Jessica Berry, another native Vermonter, who has fought for many of  my priorities, and those of other Members in this body, in this  spending bill;   Jay Tilton, my committee press secretary, who has gotten the word out  far and wide about the importance of this bill so everybody, even  though we work all night long many times--people would know exactly  what we have been doing;   Jean Kwon, who has provided hours of support to the entire  Appropriations Committee staff.   I also thank the Democratic subcommittee clerks for their support and  their tireless efforts in crafting this bill:   Tim Rieser, Jessica Schulken, Jean Toal Eisen, Erik Raven, Doug  Clapp, Ellen Murray, Scott Nance, Rachel Taylor, Alex Keenan, Melissa  Zimmerman, Chad Schulken, and Dabney Hegg.   I also thank my dear friend, one of the most senior Republicans in  this body, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Thad Cochran.  It has been an honor and pleasure to serve with him. Senator Cochran  and I have served together since 1978. We have worked together on  appropriations matters, agriculture matters, every matter before this  body. We have traveled the world together to help carry out America's  interests. It has been a particular honor to work with him on this  appropriations bill. It is his last in the U.S. Senate. As vice  chairman, I salute the chairman. He is going to be sorely missed. I  spoke about him earlier today.  [[Page S1931]]    I thank Chairman Cochran's staff for all their hard work on this  bill. Particularly, I want to thank Bruce Evans and Fitzhugh Elder.  They both have had long careers in the U.S. Senate. They share Chairman  Cochran's dedication to this institution and his dedication to his own  State of Mississippi, and they have been a pleasure for me and my staff  to work with.   I say this to the Appropriations Committee staff--both the Democrats  and the Republicans, some who are in the Chamber today--I thank you for  the long nights and weekends you worked to get this bill across the  finish line. We could not have done it without your hard work. I hope  you will soon be able to spend time with your families and friends. I  am sure they remember what you looked like since you left to continue  this work. Certainly, we Senators know what you look like because we  have seen you practically around the clock. The work has been worth it.  Because of the tremendous work the staff on both sides of the aisle and  the leadership staff have done, I urge an ``aye'' vote on this bill.  When we can, I hope this body will give a resounding aye and send the  bill to the President.   I don't see any Senator seeking recognition, so I suggest the absence  of a quorum.
