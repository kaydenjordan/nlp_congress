 Mr. Speaker, Chinese Communists have been poisoning  Americans. President Biden and Secretary Mayorkas have refused to  secure our southern border and refuse to hold China accountable.   In the State of Tennessee alone, overdose deaths have increased 200  percent--200 percent in 5 years. The situation at the southern border  has gotten so bad, even the United Nations is saying that our border  crossing is one of the deadliest in the world. Think about that for a  moment.   Therefore, I am introducing the Countering CCP Fentanyl Act. This  bill would require the President to submit a list of all CCP government  officials trafficking fentanyl and imposes property-blocking sanctions  on all of them.   We can't stop there. This legislation will make any CCP official  caught pushing this poison inadmissible to the United States.   Congress cannot stand idly by while Chinese Communists and cartel  thugs line their pockets by drugging and killing American citizens.    The CCP is using our porous border to continue their march to  dominate the Nation. It is time to send China a message that their  scheme to scourge the American population will not be tolerated.                            ____________________
