 Mr. President, I rise today to speak to an issue that I  have spoken to many times on the floor of the Senate. It is the issue  of the DREAM Act, a measure which I introduced in the Senate 16 years  ago.   Sixteen years ago I tried to find a way to give young people brought  into the United States, who grew up here in this country but did not  have legal status, a chance--just a chance--to earn their way to legal  status, to earn their way to citizenship. We set a number of hurdles in  their path. We made it clear that they had to complete their education.  We made it clear that they had to pass a serious criminal background  check. We gave a timetable when they would be able to reach legal  status and not fear deportation.   That was 16 years ago, and it still is not the law of the land.  Unfortunately, there are hundreds of thousands of young people who fit  the description that I have just given.   When President Obama was in the White House, I wrote him a letter and  said: Mr. President, can you do something to help them? And he did. He  created something called DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood  Arrivals. It was an Executive order that said to these young people: If  you fit that definition of the DREAM Act and if you will come forward  and pay a filing fee of $500 or more, if you will submit yourself to a  criminal background check and give us all of your background  information about you and your family, then, we will give you  temporary, renewable status to stay in America, not be deported, and be  allowed to work.   It was a big leap for many of these young people to do it because  they had grown up in families where, in whispered conversations in the  evening, their parents told them: Be careful. If you get arrested and  they come to see this family, many of us will be forced to leave this  country. Be careful.   These young people decided to trust the President of the United  States, to trust the Government of the United States, and to run the  risk of disclosing everything--giving the most sensitive, personal  information about themselves and about their families. They trusted us,  and they trusted this country to treat them fairly and justly.   So 780,000 have come forward. They submitted their filing fees. They  paid for the expenses of the government. They did it knowing that even  with this new status--this DACA status under President Obama's  Executive order--they didn't qualify for one penny of Federal  Government benefits, and by working, they would be forced to pay taxes,  which they were glad to do. Again, 780,000 came forward.   Then came the last election--the election of a President of the  United States who had made immigration the centerpiece of his election  message and who had really sewn doubt, and even fear, about allowing  immigrants into our Nation of immigrants. It is not a new message in  America. It is hardly a new message around the world. Being suspicious  and fearful, even hateful, of immigrants has been a part of human  experience from the beginning of time.   So what would happen to these DACA-protected 780,000 young people?  President Trump announced, through his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions,  on September 5 of this year, that DACA protection was ending. As of  March 5 of next year, 2018, no one could sign up for DACA protection,  and as the protection expired for each of them, there was no renewal  for 780,000 young people.   The President then challenged Congress and said: Do something. If I  believe, he said, that DACA is wrong, pass a law; take care of the  problem. He said that on September 5. Here we are in December, just  days away from the end of the year, and we have done nothing--nothing.  And what has happened?   Across America, these young people, their families, and the people  who believe in them have begged us to step up and do something. They  have said: In the name of justice, in the name of fairness, in the name  of morality, do something. And we have done nothing--nothing.   Many of them have decided in desperation to bring their message here  to the Capitol. Right now, as I stand and speak on the floor of the  Senate, there are thousands outside on the Mall, roaming through the  corridors, trying to stop people who they believe might be Congressmen  or Senators, to beg for the passage of the Dream Act, to beg for the  reinstatement of the DACA protection. Some of them have made great  sacrifices. I have gone out to talk to a lot of them. They have never  been to Washington before. They have never been inside this Capitol  Building. They don't know what it means to lobby. They can't afford a  lawyer or a lobbyist. They are coming here to beg for their lives and  to beg for their families. Some people are shunning them, refusing to  talk to them. Others are gracious and warm and welcoming. They get on  people's nerves because there are a lot of them and they want to talk  to people about solving the problem. Some of them have sat in our  offices--even my office--and I understand it. As awkward as it may be,  as uncomfortable as it may be, I welcome them. I want them to know what  America is about--a place where people in this country have the right  to speak, to assemble, to petition their government. They believe this  is their government. They look at that flag and they say: That is my  flag too.   Legally, they are wrong. They are undocumented. Many have no country  at all to which they can turn.   Who are they? Who are these 780,000 young people? I can tell you who  900 of them are. Nine hundred of these undocumented young people stood  up and took an oath to a country that will not legally recognize them  to serve in our military and risk their lives for each and every one of  us. What greater proof can we ask about their commitment to this  country? Nine hundred of them did this. If we fail to provide DACA or  Dream Act protection to them, these 900 will be forced to leave the  military of the United States of America. They will be turned away,  despite the fact that they have volunteered their lives for this  country.    Twenty thousand of them teach in our classrooms around America. I  have met many of them. They are teaching in inner city schools through  a program called Teach For America, which sends them to some of the  poorest school districts in America. They are spending their lives, as  undocumented in America, trying to help the least of those of the  population, those in desperate need of their assistance.   Among them are thousands who are going to school now and college. Let  me tell you that their challenge in college is a heck of a lot harder  than the challenge for most young people. They don't qualify for any  Federal assistance to go to college--no Pell grants, no Federal loans.  They have to go to work. They have to work and earn the money to pay  for tuition. That is what their lives are all about.   So for those who would dismiss these as lazy people who really can't  offer much to the future of America, take a minute to get to know them.   Yesterday, one of my Republican colleagues looked me in the eye and  said: We are talking about amnesty; these are people who violated the  law. You are talking about forgiving them for violating the law.   Some of them, by his definition, violated the law when they were  carried in their mothers' arms to the United States at the age of 2.  Does that sound right? Does that sound just? Does it sound fair to say  that these are people who have broken the law in America? I don't think  so.   Let me say a word about their parents. There are some people who say:  OK, I don't hate the Dreamers, but I get to hate their parents, right?  They did break the law.   Technically, they probably did. I will not argue the point, but I  will tell you something. As a father, I would risk breaking the law for  the life, future, and safety of my children. I would, and most people  would, and they did. It wasn't for any selfish motive. It was so that  their kids had a chance. That is what it was all about, and that is why  they came to this country. They knew that at any minute it could fall  apart and they would be asked to leave, or worse. They risked it for  their children. So I am not going to stand in  [[Page S8164]]  moral judgment of these parents of Dreamers. As to legal judgment, the  case is clear. But as to a moral judgment, no, I just will not do it.   What I have done 101 or 102 times is to come to this floor and just  tell a story--a story about a Dreamer--so that people know who they  are. Today I would like to tell you the story of this young lady whose  name is Karen Reyes. Karen Reyes is the 104th Dreamer whom I have  introduced on the floor of the Senate, brought to the United States  from Mexico. She grew up in San Antonio. She had a childhood like other  American kids--Girl Scouts, summer camps, church groups, volleyball.  Karen didn't even know she was undocumented until she was in junior  high school.   She was a good student. She graduated with honors from high school.  She was a member of the marching band. Here is what she said about  growing up in America:         I might be an undocumented American, but I am an American.       I came to this country when I was 2 years old. The only       recollection that I have of Mexico is when I visited as a       young child. I have not gone back in 20 years. I grew up       here. I formed a life here. I made friends here. I received       my education here.    After high school, Karen went to San Antonio College and then  transferred to the University of Texas San Antonio. She made the  President's Honors List and the Dean's List.   She found time to volunteer at the University Health System and at  the San Antonio Youth Literacy project. She tutored second grade  students in reading, and she worked with communities and schools where  she mentored and tutored elementary students.   In 2012, Karen graduated with a bachelor of arts in interdisciplinary  studies. She went on to the Deaf Education and Hearing Science Program  at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio.   In 2014, Karen graduated with a master's degree in deaf education and  hearing science.   Today, she is working as a special education teacher in Austin, TX.  Here is a picture of her with the kids. She teaches 3- and 4-year-old  kids who are deaf or hard of hearing. She teaches kids with  disabilities. Here is what she said about DACA, the program that was  abolished by President Trump, which allows her to live in the United  States and to work as a teacher:         DACA made me visible. DACA made it possible for me to teach       children who are deaf and hard of hearing. I am helping these       students and families on their journey to being able to       communicate and achieve their dreams. Before I didn't think I       had a voice, but now I do. . . . I get to change lives every       single day.    Twenty thousand other DACA students and recipients like Karen are  teachers in our schools. Because DACA was repealed, Texas stands to  lose 2,000 teachers. I ask the State of Texas: Are you ready to lose  Karen? Are you ready to lose 2,000 more just like her because the  Senate and the House of Representatives refused to act, refused to  legislate, refused to provide protection to her?   As for Karen, her DACA expires in August of next year. This will be  her last school year. If Congress doesn't step up and meet its  responsibility and pass the Dream Act, her time teaching these deaf and  hard of hearing children will come to an end.   In a few days we are going to go home and celebrate Christmas with  our families. It is a big, important time of year. My wife and I are  looking forward to it. We get to see all of the grandkids in one place.  It is going to be pure bedlam, but we are going to love every second of  it. Christmas means that much to our families. Being together means so  much to our families.   Think for a moment about those who are protected with DACA. This may  be their last Christmas in the United States. They don't know where  they will be next Christmas because the President abolished the  protection program and because Congress refuses to act. They don't know  where they will be and they don't know whether they will be with family  or not. That is the reality.   What a reflection on our Nation that we have reached this point to  punish someone like Karen, a giving, caring, educated professional  person who is spending time helping little boys and girls who  desperately need her help.   Some in this Chamber--and I have seen them face to face--are ready to  tell her to leave: We don't need you anymore, Karen. Go back to  wherever you came from. Just get out of here. That is their attitude.  It is not mine nor the majority of Americans.   Over three out of four Americans believe Karen deserves a chance.  Over three out of four Americans believe she should be allowed to stay  and earn her way to legal status and citizenship. Incidentally, 60  percent of those who voted for Donald Trump happen to believe that same  thing.   But there are voices of division and fear and hatred in this  administration. I have seen them. I have heard them. I know what they  have to say. The question is, will they prevail? Will they define this  President in terms of his treatment of people who are just asking for a  chance to be part of America's future? The answer to that question is  really not in the President's hands. It is in our hands. We owe it to  these young people to do the right thing.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, Cesar Chavez, the great champion of  justice and human dignity, once offered this advice about friendship:  He said; ``If you really want to make a friend, go to someone's house  and eat with him. . . . The people who give you their food give you  their heart.''   The Senate Dining Room isn't Steve Johnson's house, but for the 22  years that he has worked there, Steve has poured his heart into his  job, and he has become a friend--or at least a friendly face--to  Senators, our families, staff members, and visitors.   As general manager of the Senate Dining Rooms and two other eateries  in the Capitol, Steve works hard to create places where people who  might not normally talk to each other can sit down at adjoining tables,  eat a meal, and maybe swap stories or jokes.   In the Senate Dining Room, with its white linen table cloths and  crystal chandeliers, you might see Republican and Democratic Senators  and staff members asking after each other's families. In the refectory  on the first floor, reporters and visitors to the Capitol stand in line  together to grab a  [[Page S8177]]  quick bite. Downstairs, in the carryout, you can find the whole Capitol  family, as Steve calls them; ``the white collars, the blue collars, the  green collars, and the Capitol Police,'' all eating together.   It is a little like stepping back into a better, less partisan time.   On Friday, December 22, Steve Johnson is leaving the Senate. He is  retiring. Before he does, I want to take a moment to thank Steve for  his many years of good and loyal service to the Senate.   Until 1995, when Steve began working as a maitre d' in the Senate  Dining Room, he had never seen the inside of the U.S. Capitol, but he  had seen the outside of this magnificent building many times.   You see, Steve grew up in Freehold, NJ, home of ``The Boss,'' Bruce  Springsteen. He was one of six kids. His mom trained as a nurse, and  his dad was a director of a YMCA.   In 1963, Steve's Dad, Herbert, attended the March on Washington,  where Martin Luther King gave his ``I Have a Dream'' speech. The  experience made a profound impression.   During Steve's childhood and teen years, whenever there was a big  march or rally in Washington, the whole Johnson family--mom, dad, and  six kids--would pile into the family station wagon, drive to  Washington, DC, for the day, and drive back to Freehold that night.   During those childhood trips, Steve developed a reverence for this  building. After 22 years of working here, he still has it. He is still  awed when he sees the Capitol dome gleaming in the sun as he arrives at  work, or sees the Capitol Christmas tree lit up at night.   It is a feeling that many of us share.   Steve started his career in food service nearly 40 years ago, shortly  after he graduated from Glassboro State College in New Jersey with a  bachelor's degree in business administration. He went to work at a  restaurant in his hometown.   A few years later, he and a business partner took over running a more  than 200-year-old inn, the Liberty Tavern, in New Jersey's capitol city  of Trenton. They gave it their best try, with clever marketing and a  hard-working staff, but couldn't make good of it.   Fortunately for us, Steve's wife, Joanne, took a job with the Federal  Government in Washington, and Steve made the move with her.   Before the Senate, he worked at the Mayflower Hotel, another  Washington legend. As I mentioned, he started in the Senate Dining Room  as maitre d' and worked his way up to assistant general manager and  finally general manager.   He works incredibly hard, from early in the morning until evening or  later. With his calm demeanor, he makes a tough job look almost easy.   That calm may have something to do with the fact that Steve is a  dedicated marathon runner. He has run 18 marathons, including seven  Boston Marathons.   He is a modest man in a sea of big egos, a scrupulously nonpartisan  man in era of sharp partisan lines. He and his dedicated staff are  important members of the Senate family.   There is a line in a Bruce Springsteen song where Bruce says, ``I'm  ready to grow young again.''   Sadly, none of us can actually do that.   But Steve has decided that he is ready to be a rookie again and try  something completely new and different. In this next chapter of his  life, he will work as a volunteer literacy tutor for adults who speak  English as a Second Language.   It is another way, I think, of making people feel at home and cared  for, something that Steve Johnson is so good at.   In closing, I want to thank Steve again for his many years of service  to the Senate, and I want to wish Steve and Joanne the very best of  luck as they start this new chapter in their lives.                            ____________________
