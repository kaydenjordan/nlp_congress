 Mr. Speaker pro tempore, Mr. Clerk, colleagues, on  behalf of the House Republican Conference, I rise today to nominate the  gentleman from Ohio, Mr.   Jim Jordan, as Speaker of the people's  House.   We are at a time of great crisis across America, a time of historic  challenges in this very Chamber, and a time when heinous acts of terror  and evil have been committed against our great ally, Israel.   As this body convenes for the sacred responsibility to elect the next  Speaker of the people's House, I am reminded of the Book of Esther: for  such a time as this.     Jim Jordan will be America's Speaker for such a time as this:   A time when hardworking American families are struggling under the  vice of inflation, not able to afford groceries, heat, or gas because  of the trillions and trillions of dollars of reckless spending by  failed far-left government;   A time when millions are being illegally trafficked and smuggled  across our southern and northern borders due to the catastrophic and  inhumane wide-open borders of Joe Biden;   A time when violent crime is skyrocketing across America, destroying  our great cities, suburbs, and small towns, where people no longer feel  safe in their homes or in their communities;   A time when American energy production has been crushed by Joe  Biden's radical, failed, far-left policies, causing seniors, farmers,  and families to pay more at the pump and struggle with skyrocketing  utility bills;   A time when the Federal Government is weaponized against we the  people, who they are supposed to serve, stripping us of our God-given  constitutional rights and wrongfully targeting conservatives,  Catholics, and even parents at school board meetings;   A time when the people of our closest and most precious ally, Israel,  suffered the bloodiest day since the Holocaust, with acts of inhumane  evil committed by Hamas terrorists backed by Iran, grotesque  atrocities, the beheadings of babies, rapes, kidnappings, and slaughter  of women, children, and the elderly, and Israelis and Americans taken  hostage.   We are here in this very Chamber for such a time as this.   Jim  Jordan will be we the people's Speaker for such a time as this.   Our friend and colleague   Jim Jordan is a patriot. He is an America  First warrior who wins the toughest of fights, going after corruption  and delivering accountability at the highest levels of government on  behalf of we the people.                                time  1245    Jim is the voice of the American people who have felt voiceless for  far too long. Whether as Judiciary chair, conservative leader, or  Representative for his constituents in west central Ohio, whether on  the wrestling mat or in the committee room,   Jim Jordan is strategic,  scrappy, tough, and principled.   He is a mentor, a worker, and above all, he is a fighter. We know  that   Jim Jordan is a winner on behalf of the American people.   Almost 10 years ago, many of us sat with our colleague   Jim Jordan  in this very Chamber when Prime Minister Netanyahu delivered his  historic joint address--which some of our colleagues across the aisle  shamefully boycotted. Bibi pointed out that in this very Chamber, we  serve under the watchful gaze of Moses.   He said, ``Overlooking all of us in this Chamber is the image of
