 Mr. Chair, as a physician I have seen firsthand how  frivolous lawsuits against experienced physicians have hindered the  health care system and increased costs to all patients.   It is imperative we address this through common sense legislation.   This amendment would require expert witnesses in medical malpractice  negligence cases to have practiced in the same specialty and  geographical area as the physician defendant.   This limitation ensures that the expert witness has the qualified  experience with and knowledge of the standard of care recognized in  their local communities. I was a heart surgeon. I was not qualified to  testify in a dermatology case.   I ask my colleagues to join me in voting yes on Dr. Roe's amendment  and the Protecting Access to Care Act.
