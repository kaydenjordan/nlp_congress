 Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend, Trent Franks,  for yielding to me and for providing the leadership in the pro-life  movement.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 36, the Pain- Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. As a proud father of 5 and a  grandfather of 13, I firmly believe that the value of an unborn life  cannot be understated.   H.R. 36 takes a crucial step to ensure that we protect thousands of  innocent lives every year. Scientific evidence clearly demonstrates  that unborn babies feel pain by at least 20 weeks of age. By 20 weeks,  an unborn baby is so developed that he or she can hear and respond to  sounds.   Ending these lives through abortion is both cruel and inhumane. There  is no excuse. Our Nation must do better. We should not be one of only  seven countries--including North Korea, Vietnam, and China--to have  elective, on-demand abortion after 20 weeks of development. This is an  abuse of the basic human rights, and it is unacceptable in the eyes of  God and by any standard of human morality.   As Members of Congress, it is our duty and our moral obligation to  pass H.R. 36 so that we may protect those who are the most defenseless.  Mr. Speaker, our Declaration of Independence guarantees all Americans  enjoy the unalienable right of life, and that includes the unborn.   Thanks to incredible advances in modern medicine, babies born at 20,  21,  [[Page H7659]]  and 22 weeks of age are able to survive. Our medical community strives  to save and protect these premature babies, yet, in an inconsistent  fashion, current policy permits aborting a child at that exact same  stage of development.   Mr. Speaker, the sanctity of every human life must be protected. This  bill affirms the humanity of the unborn while curbing the inhumanity of  abortion. God knows that it is time that we hold abortionists who  perform these late-term abortions accountable for their abhorrent  actions.
