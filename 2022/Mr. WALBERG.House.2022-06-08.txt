 Madam Speaker, when President Biden took office, the  price of a gallon of gas stood at $2.39 a gallon. Today, the national  average is more than double, clocking in at $4.96 per gallon.   Since the beginning of the travel season, gas prices have reached a  new record high every single day. The situation in my home State of  Michigan is even more dire and unaffordable. In the past week, gas  prices spiked more in Michigan, the motor capital of the world, than  any other State. Our State average has skyrocketed up to $5.21.   In Jackson, in my district, gas prices rose 20 cents overnight last  week. In Lenawee County, my home county, they rose at an even quicker  rate to $5.29, when I drove to the airport yesterday morning. Michigan  families are struggling to pay these historic prices at the pump.   Robert from Tecumseh, Michigan, told me that he along with many other  seniors on a fixed income are simply unable to use their cars because  of the price of gas.   Another constituent wrote to me that someone drilled a hole in their  truck's gas tank and stole their gas.   This is the environment that President Biden's antienergy policies  have created. Since day one, the Biden administration has been hostile  to American energy. They canceled the Keystone XL pipeline. They halted  oil and gas leases on Federal lands. They recklessly depleted our  strategic reserves, which is now at its lowest level since 1987. They  have done everything possible to discourage investment in domestic  production.   At the same time, the administration continues to beg Saudi Arabia  and other foreign countries to boost their oil supply. It simply makes  no sense.   In Congress, just one side--House Republicans--has been proposing  solutions. We should pass the American Energy Independence from Russia  Act to unleash our domestic production capability.  [[Page H5343]]    We should pass the Strategic Production Response Act to transition  supply concerns from stopgap measures to permanent production  solutions.   And we should pass the PIPES Act, which I introduced, to prevent a  sitting President from unilaterally attacking existing domestic energy  infrastructure.   Let's not forget: America was energy independent just 2 short years  ago. There is a path to regaining that independence and bringing down  prices at the pump if President Biden will reverse course and flip the  switch on American energy.   My constituents cannot afford $5-plus per gallon of gas. They need  relief. We need relief. America needs relief, and fast.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, the despicable violence that took place  in Uvalde and other places was horrific, and we mourn the loss of  innocent life. The thought of losing my fourth-grade grandson in this  way shakes me to the core.   There are steps we can take to prevent tragedies from occurring  without endangering and infringing upon the rights of law-abiding  citizens. I will not support legislation taking away the Second  Amendment rights of my constituents. We must focus on root causes of  violent crimes and the many cultural issues plaguing our society.   As a Nation, we face a severe mental health crisis, fatherless homes,  breakdown of families, glorification of violence that permeates our  culture at every level, even to the devaluation of 63 million innocent  babies' lives taken in the last 50 years. It must be all-hands-on- deck--in our homes, our schools, and our churches--to address the  foundational issues that keep our kids and communities safe.   Madam Speaker, let's not just do something. Harden our schools.  Tackle them with real solutions. Oppose this legislation and do the  right thing to save innocent lives.
