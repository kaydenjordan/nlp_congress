 Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said  that impeachment should be ``compelling, overwhelming, and  bipartisan.''   Let me tell you that, if you come from the State of Illinois, you  understand what it is to have an impeachment that is compelling,  overwhelming, and bipartisan, and what it looks like.   And if you are a Member in this House and you served in Illinois, you  know, because your constituents know as well.   A decade ago, the Illinois General Assembly impeached Governor Rod  Blagojevich. There was clear and convincing evidence of crimes  committed by the Governor.   I served on that bipartisan impeachment committee to recommend  impeachment, and it was recommended by the committee 21-0.   After impeachment advanced to the floor, it passed 114-1, and the one  that dissented was his sister-in-law.   Let me tell you that that was compelling, overwhelming, and  bipartisan.   What we have that we are dealing with here this week is not a crime,  and it is not overwhelming, and it is not compelling, and it sure isn't  bipartisan.                            ____________________
