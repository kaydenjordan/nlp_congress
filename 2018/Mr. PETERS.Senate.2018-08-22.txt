 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and  congratulate Grace Shore, CEO of the Macomb County Chamber of Commerce.  Grace is being honored for her lifetime achievements and her 40 years  of service to the Macomb Chamber and to Macomb County, upon her  induction into the Macomb Hall of Fame. During her tenure with the  chamber, Grace has been a champion for businesses throughout Macomb  County and an advocate for improving the community where she has spent  most of her life.   Grace has been with the Macomb Chamber for 40 years and was named its  CEO in 1991. Since then, Macomb has grown economically and cemented  itself as a key economic player in the region. During her tenure, Grace  has implemented many programs to help bolster Macomb's economy. A  recent program was ``Shop Local Macomb'' during the 2017 holiday  season, a campaign that encouraged residents to  [[Page S5830]]  visit stores in their local community in order to ensure that their  holiday shopping made an impact close to home.   In her role as CEO, Grace has brought innovative thinking, new  programs, and the ability to create partnerships with local governments  and stakeholders, turning the Macomb Chamber into a catalyst for  economic development, and allowing it to provide member organizations  with a number of economic development initiatives, networking  opportunities, and professional development seminars. All of these  achievements have earned the Macomb Chamber the respect of its peers,  not just in the region, but around Michigan. Grace's hard work and  efforts have culminated in the Macomb Chamber being recognized twice  with the Outstanding Chamber of the Year Award from the Michigan  Association of Chamber Professionals. Grace has also been previously  named the Michigan Chamber Professional of the Year by the Michigan  Association of Chamber Professionals.   The Macomb Chamber has two branch organizations that work side-by- side with it: the Macomb Foundation and Macomb Advocacy for Business.  The Macomb Foundation hosts events such as the annual Macomb Hall of  Fame and the Athena Award with the aim of expanding the role Macomb  County plays in Michigan's economy and to support the many community  and nonprofit groups throughout Macomb County. Macomb Advocacy's  mission is to educate member organizations and the public on policy and  political issues, as well as candidates, to make Macomb a better place  for businesses and residents alike.   In the 40 years that Grace has been with the Chamber of Commerce,  Macomb has diversified from its manufacturing heritage and grown into a  high-tech corridor. While it still stays true to its industrial roots,  it now has many defense and technology companies within its borders and  continues to present more opportunities every day. I would like to  congratulate Grace on reaching the momentous milestone of 40 years with  the Macomb Chamber of Commerce and on being inducted into the Macomb  Hall of Fame. I ask my colleagues to join me today in honoring Ms.  Grace Shore for her lifetime of contributions to Macomb County and the  economic development of the surrounding region.                            ____________________
