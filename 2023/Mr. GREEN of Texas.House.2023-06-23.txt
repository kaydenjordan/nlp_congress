 And still I rise, Mr. Speaker. I am grateful for  the time and the opportunity to share some of my thoughts and views  about crucial issues, to share them not only with my colleagues here in  Congress but also with the people of our great country.   And still I rise today to talk about Juneteenth. I believe Juneteenth  is a very special time in the history of our country, and I would like  to say a few words about Juneteenth. I would also like to talk about  Slavery Remembrance Day.   For those of you who are tuning in, please know that I will speak  about Juneteenth, and I will speak about Slavery Remembrance Day, but I  will also speak about a day that occurred before Juneteenth.   As you know, President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation  on January 1, 1863. Prior to signing the Emancipation Proclamation,  President Lincoln signed the District of Columbia Compensated  Emancipation Act of 1862. April 16, 1862, is the day it was signed.   This is an important piece of legislation because the District of  Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act impacted Washington, D.C. The  District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act would accord  compensation for slaves who were freed--human beings held in bondage,  human beings who had been kidnapped, likely, or they may have been born  into slavery. Some people were born into slavery and lived their entire  lives as slaves and died as slaves.   These human beings, the genesis of which was persons who were  kidnapped from the Continent of Africa, for our purposes today, as we  talk about slavery here in the United States, these human beings were  kidnapped, brought to this country, sold, forced to work, and forced to  be separated from their families. Children were sold at the auction  block. They went to one plantation, and their mother and father went to  another.   This is what slavery was about: kidnapping, rape, murder.   These are true words, words that we don't like to hear because, in  this country, we have reviled the enslaved and revered the enslavers.   Let's go back to the District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation  Act of 1862, which impacted Washington, D.C., as I indicated. This act  was to free slaves. It would free them. It brought with it  compensation.   A reasonable and prudent person would believe that the compensation  would be accorded the slave, the person who had been working at the  mercy of a person known as a master. Slaves had masters.   This act, one would assume, would compensate the slave upon the slave  being freed. That was not so, my dear friends--not so.   The District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act of 1862  compensated the master. The person who owned the slave received  compensation for allowing a person to have the liberty that God has  accorded all of his children. Some have been denied the liberty, but it  was a birthright for every person ever born, the right to be free.   This act of trying as best as he could--President Lincoln--to free  slaves accorded persons who owned them approximately $300. Before the  $300 was presented, as it were, there was a slave owner who came and  actually appraised slaves. They were considered chattels, property.  They were appraised, and owners received this compensation, sort of  like compensating the kidnapper who kidnaps a person, compensating this  person for the act of kidnapping. Release the person you kidnapped, and  you can receive compensation.   It is like the bank robber bringing the ill-gotten gains back to the  bank and being rewarded for bringing the ill-gotten gains back after  having robbed the bank. It was similar to this, only more horrific, of  course, because we are talking about human beings.   We have this situation where persons who were enslaved in Washington,  D.C., the Nation's Capital, enslaved right here in Washington, D.C.,  when they were released, they received the opportunity to fend for  themselves. They were released to the winds and the rains and the  weather and the elements. They were not given any compensation for  their labor, for the crime against humanity.   Slavery was one of the greatest crimes ever committed against  humanity--committed for centuries, I might add. It is a crime against  humanity that has never been properly addressed.   Even to this day, people don't want to hear this message. There are  people who literally cannot tolerate hearing the message because they  have been indoctrinated to believe that the enslaved people somehow  were wrong and that the enslavers were heroes.   Well, this didn't work so well, emancipation for consideration to be  accorded the enslavers. It didn't work so well. Hence, we find that  President Lincoln did, in fact, issue the Emancipation Proclamation,  which was issued to free these enslaved persons who were a part of the  States that left the Union. They were said to have been given their  freedom, but that didn't work too well for the people who were enslaved  because in States like Texas, the enslavers didn't really honor the  Emancipation Proclamation.                                time  1245    There are some who say, well, they didn't know. Well, they did, but  in Texas they chose not to honor it.   Some more than 2 years and a half later, General Gordon Granger came  to Galveston, Texas, to inform the people of Texas that the persons  that were being held--and this was after the end of the Civil War, I  might add--the persons that were being held, to inform them that they  had been liberated, and to tell the holders, the masters, the  enslavers, that these human beings had to be released.   General Gordon Granger was an intelligent man. He did not come by  himself. He had the good sense to know that the people of Texas were  not likely to find his words with favor; that they were not likely to  see and look upon what he was about to do with favor.   General Gordon Granger, understanding that Texans spoke a specific  kind of language and, as a result of understanding Texas-speak, General  Gordon Granger concluded that he would bring some translators with him,  persons who would be understood by Texans. Well, I say persons; they  weren't really persons, but these were instrumentalities, if you will,  that Texans would understand.   So he brought with him the Colts. He brought with him the Smith &  Wessons, and the Winchesters. They spoke a language that Texans  understood.   But before General Gordon Granger arrived, a wonderful thing  occurred. It is said about a week before he arrived, they sent in the  25th Corps. The 25th Corps consisted of about 1,000 or more persons,  and it was the 25th Corps that came in and ran the rebels out of  Galveston, chased them to the border of the country, the boundaries,  chased them all the way to Mexico. It was the 25th Corps that paved the  way for General Gordon Granger to come into Texas and to issue his  General Order No. 3.   But here is what history doesn't say enough about. The 25th Corps  consisted of Black men. Somehow we don't choose to celebrate these  Black men who actually were the liberators, who came in before General  Gordon Granger, came into Texas, fought fiercely to liberate the Black  people in Texas.   General Gordon Granger appeared with his General Order No. 3,  accompanied by a lot of firepower, about 2,000 military personnel with  him and, as a result, slaves in Texas were free to work for their  masters.   Imagine that. The person that has held you in slavery now becomes  your boss--your employer, is the way it was stated--but your boss, your  employer. Your slave master is now your employer. Well, that didn't  work well for the enslaved persons.  [[Page H3138]]    This was followed with a series of laws that caused Black people to  have to serve time and become slaves by another name; convict leasing  is what it was called because we had these Black codes, these laws,  that would require persons to work. If you didn't work you could be  arrested, and then you could be leased to a plantation owner.   In Houston, Texas, just outside actually, in Sugarland, there is a  grave with about 95 common bodies having been buried in it, called the  Sugarland 95. These persons served as slaves under a different title.   But the point is, we had the Emancipation Proclamation. We had the  enforcement of it by virtue of General Gordon Granger coming into  Galveston, Texas. Then we had other circumstances that were unpleasant  for people of color.   All of these things are things that we should take note of. I think  we should actually celebrate the persons who came in in the 25th. I  plan to introduce a resolution. I plan to introduce a resolution to  honor these persons, the 25th Corps. I plan to introduce legislation so  that they can be properly honored.   Now, I know that there are people who hear me say these things and  sometimes they decide that, well, I think I will do it first. Well, go  ahead. I will still have the original.   It is something that we ought to do to celebrate Juneteenth, but also  to commemorate the lives of the persons that suffered under slavery,  commemorate them and celebrate them, on Juneteenth. Quite frankly, I  believe we ought to do that, and I am going to do it. I have supported  Juneteenth.   I have supported Al Edwards who is the father of Juneteenth. Al  Edwards, a State representative out of Houston, the father of  Juneteenth. He was the person who, as a freshman State representative  in Texas, managed to get the impossible done, the impossible. We are  talking about Texas now.   He managed to get Texans in the State legislature, that would be the  House and the Senate, and the Governor to sign a law causing Juneteenth  to become a holiday in the State of Texas. It is a miracle.   Al Edwards, Juneteenth. He managed to get it to become the first in  the entire country, the first State in the entire country to recognize  Juneteenth, June 19, as a holiday. Al Edwards, the father of  Juneteenth.   Unfortunately, not a lot has been said about Al being the father of  Juneteenth, but I will be filing a resolution in this House honoring  him as the father of Juneteenth.   We ought to do these things. We ought to tell the truth. This is  history. And obviously, a person who is the very first to file a piece  of legislation that becomes law, that eventually permeates and becomes  the law in other States, and now, in the United States--but it was Al  Edwards. He is the father of Juneteenth. So I will be filing that  resolution as well; and other legislation.   I seem to have become the person whose mission in life is to right  these wrongs, and I plan to do it with my colleagues, many of whom will  support what we are trying to do. I thank them, all of them who sign on  to these pieces of legislation.   So we have Juneteenth to celebrate the lives of those who were freed,  and we commemorate the day and those who didn't get the opportunity to  be liberated because, you see, liberating those who were still alive is  a wonderful thing to do. But we still really and truly must commemorate  the lives of those who were not alive on June 19, 1865. Their lives  have to be remembered and respected.    In this country, we have days of remembrance. We have a day of  remembrance for 9/11, a day of remembrance for the bombing of Pearl  Harbor, a Holocaust Remembrance Day, and this House, just last year,  passed a remembrance day for slavery, Slavery Remembrance Day. It was  done by this House of Representatives.   I must tell you, Mr. Steny Hoyer--Mr. Steny Hoyer, I will never  forget, nor will I let others forget the role that he played. It was  Mr. Hoyer that assisted me, or perhaps I ended up assisting him. It was  my legislation, but legislation that Mr. Hoyer helped get through this  House. He took, as it were, the proverbial bull by the horns, and he  helped this Congressperson pass this legislation.   So Mr. Hoyer, wherever you are, I thank you and want you to know that  at some point we would like to honor you for what you did to make real  Slavery Remembrance Day in the House of Representatives.   The bill did not pass the Senate, but Ms. Warren, the Senator,  Senator Warren, had legislation in the Senate to honor the enslaved  people. It was to commemorate their lives, as well.   So Slavery Remembrance Day passed the House, and on August 20 of last  year, we actually celebrated, commemorated--excuse me--because Slavery  Remembrance Day deals with solemnity and commemoration, not  celebration. We celebrate on Juneteenth and commemorate.   But Slavery Remembrance Day is for commemoration, not celebration,  because we want to commemorate the lives that were lost to slavery, the  lives of people who were born into slavery, lived their lives as  slaves, many of them, and died as slaves.   I heard somebody repeat that just recently. It is a wonderful thing  to hear people repeat that. One of my colleagues did, and I appreciated  hearing that being repeated.   But Slavery Remembrance Day is about solemnity, and there is a  ceremony that we had reminding us that we must always remember. This  ceremony requires that a person talk about the various things that  occurred and at some point would say, we must, and those who were in  attendance would say, always remember, because we must always remember.   Slavery Remembrance Day, August 20 of last year, the first. We had  over 1,000 people show up on short notice. We plan to have it again in  Houston, Texas, and in other places, as well. Slavery Remembrance Day,  a day for us to commemorate the lives of those who were enslaved in  this country for centuries, I might add, centuries. It wasn't just some  short period of time.   I think many people assume that slavery occurred for maybe a few  months or a few years, perhaps a decade, maybe several decades. But no,  my dear friends, it was centuries. Centuries that our country, the  country that I love, the country where I say the Pledge of Allegiance,  the country where I sing the national anthem, it was in this country,  my country that we enslaved people for centuries.   But it is also in this country, my country, where we decline, to this  day, to respect the people who were enslaved. We respect the enslavers.  We have named schools after the enslavers; there are Lee High Schools  across the country.   We respect the enslavers. We name military bases after them; Bragg,  Braxton Bragg. We name bases after them, schools after them, but not  the enslaved.   Somehow there seems to be this belief that the enslaved persons must  have been wrong in some way.   What was their wrong?   What did they do to cause this country to demean them to this day?   I stand here in the House of Representatives of the Congress of the  United States of America to say that this country has got to respect  the lives of those that were sacrificed so that it could have the  riches that it has today. The economic foundation that we stand on  today was put in place by enslaved people.                                time  1300    They were the economic foundational mothers and fathers of this  country and they ought to be at least respected. At minimum they should  be respected.   They ought to be respected to the same extent that we have respected  the enslavers. This is the second item on the conscience agenda. In  1956, the Congress of the United States of America, honored Confederate  soldiers with a Congressional Gold Medal. A Congressional Gold Medal  for the enslavers. A Congressional Gold Medal for the persons who  fought to keep persons in bondage and disrespect for the enslaved. No  dignity was accorded the enslaved.   As a matter of fact, in Texas, there was a movement afoot to rename  slavery, to style it as involuntary relocation. Theft of human beings,  kidnapping, rape, murder--involuntary relocation. Let's just sanitize  it rather than show a person the dignity and respect that they have  earned by virtue of the suffering and the pain that we inflicted upon  them so that this country could become the great Nation that it is.  [[Page H3139]]    How sad it is to know that Members of this House refuse to this day  to show them the dignity and respect that human beings deserve after  having been enslaved for centuries. The House is a symbol of national  shame just as the Richard Russell Office Building is, by the way.   I will say more about that, perhaps, in a moment or two, but we are a  symbol of national shame. If anybody thinks that I am going to cease to  say this, you are entirely wrong because it is the truth. We ought to  do for the enslaved persons what we did for the Confederate soldiers in  1956. We ought to accord a Congressional Gold Medal to them. We should,  but we won't.   We have the power to do it. We did it for the Confederate soldiers,  but we lack something else that we don't have to do it--the integrity.  It takes integrity to do this. Don't have the integrity to do it.   By the way, this circumstance is not something that is unknown to  Members because I have circulated the request for the Dear Colleague,  the request for persons to sign on and help us acquire the signatures  necessary to accord the enslaved persons who built the country, planted  the seeds, harvested the crops, fed the Nation, the enslaved persons,  accord them a Congressional Gold Medal.   My colleagues are aware so it is nothing new that I am saying, but it  takes integrity. It takes being a person of good will to do this. I am  sad to say that we cannot get 290 persons of good will. All they have  to do is sign a piece of paper and we can then move forward with the  process to present a Congressional Gold Medal to the enslaved people.  Sign your name. That is all. That is not going to happen. It hasn't  happened so far.   I don't mean to sound pessimistic; I am just realistic. It is not  happening. I hope that there will be a change in the hearts of Members  so that we can do this. I pray for a change in the hearts. It hasn't  happened so far. It takes a person with integrity, a person of good  will, a person who understands the wrong that has to be corrected, that  has to be righted, and we can do it.   I am going to ask my colleagues to do, again, for the enslaved  persons what we did in 1956 for the enslavers. We have shown that we  revere the enslavers and revile the enslaved. We don't consider them  heroes.   I was at the Museum of the Bible just recently with a dear friend  here, a name I need not and shall not mention, but we went to the  Museum of the Bible located just a stone's throw if you got a really  strong arm, but near here. It is about a mile or two away at most.   There in the Museum of the Bible on the wall, they had this huge  painting of what we will call liberators, and there was a word  ``liberators'' under the painting. They showed the liberators. One of  the liberators was Abraham Lincoln. I think Abraham Lincoln qualifies  as a liberator, but here is something that will offend a lot of my  colleagues to know that one of the liberators at the Museum of the  Bible was John Brown.   You see, we have been taught in this country that John Brown was a  murderer. John Brown was a liberator. People were enslaved. John Brown  sought and fought to liberate people from slavery. He was a liberator.  We revere the enslavers, who murdered, killed, kidnapped, and raped. We  revere them. We pay tribute to them, but to the persons who were the  victims of the kidnapping, murder, rape, we revile them and anybody  that tried to help them.   John Brown was a liberator. This is over at the Museum of the Bible.  I beg that people would go over there, dear brothers and sisters. We  are one race and that is the human race. We are all related. I love  you, but you have got to be told the truth.   Go to the museum and see for yourself. Nat Turner was a liberator. Go  over and view this for yourselves. Nat Turner's name was not among  those. I don't want to mislead you, but he was a liberator, as well.   The point is, we have a duty, a responsibility, an obligation to  ourselves, Members, to do justice, to demonstrate that, yes, we have  come a long way and we are going to go the rest of the way.   Yes, we have a Juneteenth. We need a slaver remembrance day that has  been acknowledged by the Senate, signed into law by the President. This  House has already taken one step.   We need that, but we also need to accord dignity and respect to the  enslaved people. One way of doing it is with the Congressional Gold  Medal to them just as we have done it for the enslavers.   I am of the opinion that we can do it, but it hasn't happened and I  have indicated to you that it probably won't. However, I am going to  keep hope alive. I will be back to remind us again and again and again.  I don't know that the reminder is sufficient. I am going to use prayer,  and we will find out if we have 290 people in this House who have the  courage and the heart to just sign their names so that we can do for  the enslaved what we did for the enslavers.   Dear friends, I love the words of Maya Angelou. She indicates in  these words--I might not quote her exactly, but she indicates: ``. . .  bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave, I am the dream and the hope  of the slave.'' ``. . . the dream and the hope of the slave.''    I stand here in the Congress of the United States of America knowing  that somebody some centuries ago prayed for a day when they would  receive the dignity and respect God accords all human beings as a  birthright. Dignity and respect of liberty and justice for all as we  have placed in our Pledge of Allegiance. Dignity and respect, that is  all. That is all we are indicating we should have, dignity and respect.   Now, as I bring this to a close, dignity and respect would also  require that the name Richard Russell--Richard Russell, dear friends,  was a man who fought antilynching legislation, fought civil rights  legislation, coauthored the Southern Manifesto. Richard Russell was a  self-proclaimed white supremacist. Richard Russell said this is a White  man's country.   By the way, there are some Richard Russells alive today. He wasn't  the last Richard Russell, but this Richard Russell said this is a White  man's country and he wanted to keep it that way.   Now, this Richard Russell has his name on a building, the Senate  Russell Office Building. Richard Russell, the white racist, his name is  on a building.   Is it asking too much to remove Richard Russell's name from the  building? We haven't named any buildings John Brown or Nat Turner. By  the way, I am not asking that this building be named John Brown or Nat  Turner, but we haven't done it. No taxpayer dollars go toward a  building being named John Brown, but we have a building named in honor  of Richard Russell, a white supremacist.   I don't think tax dollars ought to support a building that honors a  white supremacist. The Senate is a place of shame. The building is a  symbol of national shame. Senators can change this. Senators can change  this almost overnight. All they have to do is remove his name. The  Senate has the power and the authority to take Richard Russell's name  off of the Russell Senate Office Building.   They haven't done it. Some tell me that if they did it, we would have  to have another name and we can't agree on a name, so they keep the  name of the bigot on the building because we don't have another name.   By the way, I haven't said name it Martin Luther King. I haven't said  name it Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman. I haven't said name it John  Brown, Nat Turner.                                time  1315    Here is what I have said. I have said to remove his name and let the  name become what it was before it was the Russell Senate Office  Building. It was called the Old Senate Office Building. Revert back to  the Old Senate Office Building and take as much time as you like to  develop a process, if you like, and then a name, a name that is  suitable for the building.   The excuse of ``we can't take it off because we can't agree on a  name,'' that is shameful. Every Senator over there ought to be ashamed.   I don't go into the Russell Senate Office Building. I am a one-person  protest. I am not going to demean myself. I have enough respect and  dignity for myself not to go into a building named in honor of a racist  and bigot. I am not going to do it. Those who do it, it is their  choice. If you don't have to, you are disrespecting yourself.   I have written a letter to various organizations when I was invited  to come  [[Page H3140]]  and speak over in the building for various reasons. I have written a  letter, and I am sending it to all the human rights and civil rights  organizations, letting them know that I am a one-person protest and  that I won't be going into the Russell Senate Office Building, except  to protest. There is an exception. I will go in to protest.   I will be going in to protest, so I am giving everybody fair notice.  There will be protestation at the Russell Senate Office Building. I  won't say when, but I will be going to protest.   I am hopeful that we can take the name of Richard Russell off the  Senate office building paid for in tax dollars. It is easy to do but  difficult if you don't have the courage, if you don't have the  integrity, and if you don't have the heart to do what is right.   Here is what I suspect will happen at some point. At some point, my  brothers and sisters in the Senate will find a way to do this and  ignore the fact that I have been standing in this House appealing to  them to do it.   You see, people are written out of history who make these kinds of  demands. They are written out of history because it can never be said  that a person of African ancestry had the courage to do this and then  it was done. That would mean, then, that there are other things that  people of color might have the courage to do and to get done in a  similar fashion.   They will find a clever way to get it done. The name will change, and  we will just go on as though none of this ever happened.   I just pray that the record will show that someone came to this well  and stood for justice. Just as we like to record the history of all the  things that people do, let it be known that at least one person came  here and asked that we take that name off of that building.   It will happen. It is just a matter of time. At some point, there  will be people who are going to coalesce around this, and the Senate  will have to do it. It is shameful that they haven't done it, but they  will have to do it.   Maybe not while I am here, but at some point, this Congress is going  to award a Congressional Gold Medal to those persons who suffered  slavery. Congress will do it, but they have to find a way to do it so  that it doesn't look like they were forced to do it, that they were  forced by a person, a Black man who had the courage to come and stand  in the well and say this is something that we must do.   They can't let it seem as though this person did this, so they will  find a way to do these things, and it will be as though none of this  ever happened.   Do you know what? The good news is that it will happen. Maybe not in  time for me to see it, but it will happen.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that I love my country. In spite of  the way my country has behaved, I still love it. It is sort of like a  mother or father loving children. Sometimes children don't behave  properly, but you don't cease to love them. You want to correct them. I  come here to correct my country and help us to do the right thing.  Actually, more important than that, Mr. Speaker, is to do the righteous  thing. I love my country, and I pray that my country will do the  righteous thing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 21 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Tuesday,  June 27, 2023, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
