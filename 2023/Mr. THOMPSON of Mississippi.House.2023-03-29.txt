 Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chair, last Friday night, a lot of  Mississippi was damaged by a very serious tornado. Over 20 lives were  lost.   To paint a picture, these are communities that under the best of  times struggle, communities where we don't have public transportation,  where there is not a single motel room in the entire county, and where  the downtown area no longer exists.   For the people of Rolling Fork, Silver City, Black Hawk, and a lot of  other Mississippi communities that are only a ZIP Code tied to some  other people, we are saddened by that destruction.   Importantly, President Biden approved record disaster approval within  2 days because destruction was clear as to the help that was needed.   The State of Mississippi and the locals involved in it, we are  resilient people, but we can't do it by ourselves. Our national support  system has kicked into place. Churches have stepped forward.   We look forward to the long-term recovery, and we are talking about  years, not months, before those communities will be made whole again.   I thank all of you who have expressed your concern and sympathy and  those of you who invested in the communities. I can assure you it is  much appreciated.
