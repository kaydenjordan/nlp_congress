 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I  rise to give notice of my intention to raise a question of the  privileges of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   H. Res. 878 submitted by Mr. Guest, providing for the expulsion of  Representative George Santos from the United States House of  Representatives.   Whereas, Representative George Santos is a Member of the United  States House of Representatives;   Whereas, soon after his election in November of 2022, Representative  Santos' background came under public scrutiny;   Whereas, on February 28, 2023, the Committee on Ethics of the House  unanimously voted to impanel an investigative subcommittee (hereinafter  in this resolution referred to as the ``ISC'') to review whether  Representative Santos may have engaged in unlawful activity with  respect to his 2022 congressional campaign, failed to properly disclose  required information on statements filed with the House, violated  Federal conflict of interest laws in connection with his role in a firm  providing fiduciary services, and engaged in sexual misconduct toward  an individual seeking employment in his congressional office;   Whereas, the ISC met nine times and, over the course of the  investigation, authorized 37 subpoenas and 43 voluntary requests for  information (RFIs) leading to its receipt of over 172,000 pages of  documents, contacted or interviewed over 40 witnesses, and reviewed  materials received from the Office of Congressional Ethics and relevant  court records;   Whereas, the ISC determined in its investigation that there was  substantial evidence of violations of Federal law, the rules of the  House, and other applicable standards related to many of the  allegations charged in the indictment and substantial evidence of  additional unlawful and unethical contact not charged in the  indictment;   Whereas, these additional violations relate to falsely reported loans  reportedly received by his 2020 campaign and  [[Page H5931]]  leadership political action committee, GADS PAC, improper loan  repayments to himself, systemic reporting errors in his 2020 and 2022  campaigns' Federal Election Commission filings, and substantial  evidence that campaign funds were converted to personal use;   Whereas, the ISC also identified additional errors and omissions in  his 2020 and 2022 Financial Disclosure Statements, as well as  violations of Federal law and the rules of the House related to his  unfiled 2021 and 2023 Financial Disclosure Statements, which were not  charged in the indictment;   Whereas, the ISC also found that Representative Santos failed to meet  his duty of candor with respect to the ISC's investigation and instead  presented the ISC with misrepresentations and delay tactics;   Whereas, on May 10, 2023, Representative Santos was charged in  Federal court in the Eastern District of New York with wire fraud in  connection with a fraudulent political contribution scheme, unlawful  monetary transactions in connection with the wire fraud allegations,  theft of public money in connection with his alleged receipt of  unemployment benefits, fraudulent application for and receipt of  unemployment benefits, and false statements in connection with his 2020  and 2022 House of Representatives Financial Disclosure Statements;   Whereas, Nancy Marks, who served as treasurer to Representative  Santos' campaign, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud,  falsifying records, and identity theft in connection with the Santos  campaign;   Whereas, a superseding indictment was filed on October 10, 2023,  charging Representative Santos with additional violations related to  his 2022 campaign, including allegations of falsifying Federal Election  Commission reports in connection with a $500,000 personal loan that was  never made, falsifying the names of contributors to his campaign,  engaging in aggravated identity theft and access device fraud, and  enriching himself through a fraudulent contribution scheme;   Whereas, Sam Miele, who served as a fundraiser to Representative  Santos' campaign, pleaded guilty to a Federal wire fraud charge after  impersonating a senior congressional aide for the purposes of  soliciting funds;   Whereas, the ISC that was established to review the allegations  against Representative Santos adopted a report of its findings and  submitted the report to the full committee;   Whereas, the Committee on Ethics of the House unanimously voted to  adopt the ISC report based upon the investigation providing substantial  evidence that Representative Santos--   One, knowingly caused his campaign committee to file false or  incomplete reports with the Federal Election Commission, used campaign  funds for personal purposes, engaged in fraudulent conduct in  connection with Redstone Strategies, LLC, and engaged in knowing and  willful violations of the Ethics in Government Act as it relates to his  Financial Disclosure Statements filed with the House;    Two, was a knowing and active participant in the wrongdoing; and   Three, was given an opportunity, pursuant to committee rule 17(b), to  submit a signed written statement responding to the allegations raised  in a complaint filed by his fellow Members but did not do so;   Whereas, the ISC--   One, requested that Representative Santos provide all documents and  information responsive to its request for information, but he did not  do so;   Two, asked Representative Santos to voluntarily testify, but he did  not do so, and   Three, provided Representative Santos the opportunity pursuant to  committee rule 19(b)(3) to provide a statement under oath, but he did  not do so;   Whereas, as a Member of the United States House of Representatives,  Representative Santos must be held accountable to the highest standards  of conduct in order to safeguard the public's faith in this  institution;   Whereas, the Constitution of the United States of America charges the  House with policing the behavior of its own Members, and the House  should take action against Representative Santos commensurate with his  violations of Federal law and the rules of the House, and   Whereas, given his egregious violations, Representative George Santos  is not fit to serve as a Member of the United States House of  Representatives.   Now, therefore, be it resolved that pursuant to Article I, Section 5,  Clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States of America,  Representative George Santos, be, and he hereby is expelled from the  United States House of Representatives.
