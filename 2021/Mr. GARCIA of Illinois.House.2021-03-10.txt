 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chair Nadler and my  colleagues for their leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446,  two gun violence protection bills that would help keep our communities  safe.   Mr. Speaker, I am from Chicago, and we are no strangers to gun  violence. In 2020 alone the city recorded 3,261 shootings and 769  murders.   Some of my colleagues might point out that Illinois has some of the  strictest gun laws in the country. That is true. But studies tracking  the guns show that guns often come from neighboring States with weaker  gun laws. People drive one or two States over, and they come back with  deadly weapons.   The reality is that State laws aren't enough. We need stronger  Federal laws, too.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass these critical laws that  have bipartisan support among voters across the country that would help  keep guns off the streets.
