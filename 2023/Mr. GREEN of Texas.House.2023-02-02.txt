 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise.   I rise with a message related to the month. This is, indeed, Black  History Month. But I rise with a message that goes far beyond this  month, a message that carries with it a moral imperative to do certain  things that are on the conscience agenda.   Today, I will first thank the leadership for allowing me to have this  time,  [[Page H660]]  this privilege to come to the floor and speak on these issues. I am  grateful to the leadership on both sides of the aisle.   I am grateful because it is a rare privilege that one is accorded  when one can stand in the well of the Congress and literally speak to  the world. Each time I do it, Mr. Speaker, I ask myself, could you have  ever imagined this happening to you? And the answer is always the same.  Never.   So I don't take for granted this privilege that I have, and I am  honored to stand here and represent the 9th Congressional District of  Texas, but as a United States Congressman, I do represent everyone in  the country because my votes impact the entirety of the Nation.   Today, Mr. Speaker, I am going to talk about several issues that are  our moral imperative. These issues will include, first, August 20 as an  annual day wherein we will recognize slavery remembrance. We want to  inculcate this into the fiber and fabric of our country.   Slavery Remembrance Day is important because it is unlike any other  day. There are many holidays in this country, and I recognize them, I  have no quarrel with them, but in this country we have certain days  that are set aside for us to remember certain events, certain events  that have been similar moments in time:   9/11, a similar moment in time, a day to be remembered;   Pearl Harbor, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, December 7, a similar  moment in time, a day to be remembered;   The Holocaust, a similar moment in time that has impacted the rest of  time, should be remembered.   All of these are remembrance days, days that we have set aside in  this country to remember.   Well, August 20, 1619, the White Lion landed--docked, if you will--at  Point Comfort, and the White Lion had on it 20 persons of African  ancestry, 20 people who were traded. They traded cargo. They had other  things that were desired by the colonists, and they traded, they  exchanged these things, but they also had 20 people that were exchanged  for goods that they desired.   These 20 people became the persons that we know as slaves, slaves who  were among the first, if not the first, in this country. There may be  some debate about some other circumstance, but generally speaking,  August 20, 1619, is acknowledged as the date that slavery had its ugly  face shown in our country.   August 20, 1619, 20 people, human beings treated like cattle called  chattels. Treated like cattle called chattels, chattel slavery. We want  to commemorate their lives and all of the millions of lives that  followed, commemorate their lives, and commemorate their contributions  to the success of this country.   America is a great country, but it is great because of these humble  hands. There were others who contributed to the greatness, and they  have been acknowledged, and many are going to be acknowledged, but the  humble hands of slaves have not been properly acknowledged for what  they have done to make America the great nation that it is.   These humble hands helped to construct this Capitol. They helped to  raise the Statue of Freedom that is on top of the Capitol. These humble  hands helped to build roads and bridges. They planted the crops. They  harvested. They literally were the means by which the Nation was fed.   These persons were worked, some of them, for their entire lives  without remuneration, without compensation. They were kept alive. They  were given clothing; they were given food; they were given the  necessities of life only such that many of them could continue to slave  their lives away.   We don't recognize them for what they have done for this country. The  truth is, we revile them. We revile the slaves, those who were enslaved  to be more appropriate. We revile them and we revere the enslavers.                                time  1400    Confederate soldiers have been revered across the length and breadth  of this country.   Confederate soldiers who fought to maintain slavery have been honored  and celebrated and appreciated.   Confederate soldiers who took the lives of many people, many of whom  were not slaves, in the Civil War.   Confederate soldiers have been honored, celebrated, and appreciated,  but not so with the enslaved persons who are the foundational mothers  and fathers and children of this country. They haven't been properly  recognized.   I mentioned that the Confederate soldiers have been lionized by  having their names placed on schools and statues around the country.  There is no statue honoring Nat Turner, no statue that I know of; there  may be one or two someplace that is unknown to me. Those who fought to  liberate the slaves have been demonized.   I remember well what I was taught when I was in grade school, how Nat  Turner was a bad man. Nat Turner was a liberator. How John Brown was  crazy; he was a White man who was a liberator. We have been taught to  demonize the liberators, lionize those who would maintain slavery, and  literally overlook, marginalize--literally try as best as we can to  reshape history as it relates to those who were enslaved.   Here is how far we have gone with this.   In 1956, this Congress, the Congress of the United States of America  accorded a Congressional Gold Medal to Confederate soldiers. The  Congress of the United States of America honored Confederate soldiers.  Never has this Congress bestowed any honor on the enslaved.   It is almost impossible for people of good will to comprehend that  such a thing occurred and is still occurring because we still have  places around the country where Confederate soldiers are being  lionized, but the slaves have not been recognized. No recognition,  appreciable recognition for the slaves, the people who helped build the  country, foundational mothers and fathers of the country, born into  slavery.   Babies were slaves, for edification purposes.   Babies. Babies were slaves.   If you were born the child of a slave, you were a slave at birth. You  lived your entire life as a slave. You died as a slave.   At some point this wrong has to be addressed. I believe that it  should be addressed by according the slaves, the persons who were  enslaved--they didn't place themselves in this condition--I believe  that it should be addressed by according them a Congressional Gold  Medal just as we accorded the Confederate soldiers who sought to  maintain slavery a Congressional Gold Medal. That is not asking too  much of the country.   In this Congress, we are going to give Congressional Gold Medals to  people. Yes, last Congress we did. Why can't we give a Congressional  Gold Medal to those who were enslaved?   Oh, because that happened centuries ago.   Because they are no longer with us.   Well, we have accorded Congressional Gold Medals posthumously. This  would not be the first time.   We have done it for the code talkers, the Tuskegee Airmen, the  soldiers who died in Afghanistan. We have done it.   The question is, do we have the decency to do for the people who  helped build this country what we have done for so many others? Do we  have the decency?   I believe that we can and we should do this. It would be historic but  it would be meaningful to a good many people. It would say that we  respect those people. We regret what happened to them but we respect  them and we respect them enough to recognize their lives, not just the  work, not the building of the country, but their lives that were  sacrificed.   I believe it can be done. I believe it should be done. And I'm not  alone in my belief. We opened the letter up and started circulating it  today.   I will read the names of the persons who have similar beliefs. These  are persons who are already on as original cosponsors and we will close  the opportunity at the end of Black History Month. It is open now to  everyone this Black History Month. This is a piece of Black history, a  seminal piece of Black history.   I will tell you who agrees that a Congressional Gold Medal ought to  be accorded to persons whose lives were sacrificed to make America the  great country it is.   First on the list is the Honorable Maxine Waters; the Honorable  Bennie Thompson, the Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee, the Honorable    Danny Davis, the Honorable  Jim McGovern.  [[Page H661]]    For fear that someone may just be tuning in or starting to follow  what we are doing, I am announcing the names of persons who have  allowed their names to be associated with the Congressional Gold Medal  legislation that we will be filing at the end of this Black History  Month.   I will continue with the names:   The Honorable Brad Sherman, the Honorable Barbara Lee, the Honorable  Emanuel Cleaver, the Honorable Yvette Clarke, the Honorable Hank  Johnson, the Honorable Gerry Connolly, the Honorable Kweisi Mfume, the  Honorable   David Cicilline, the Honorable Joaquin Castro, the  Honorable Mark Veasey, the Honorable Pete Aguilar, the Honorable Ted  Lieu, the Honorable Adriano Espaillat, the Honorable Colin Allred, the  Honorable Lizzie Fletcher, the Honorable Sylvia Garcia, the Honorable  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Honorable Ilhan Omar, the Honorable  Ayanna Pressley, the Honorable Troy Carter, the Honorable  Greg Casar,  the Honorable Jasmine Crockett, the Honorable Bonnie Watson Coleman.   I trust that there would be more names that I would be permitted to  announce at a future point in time.   Remember, historic legislation, original cosponsorship closes at the  end of Black History Month, the last day. It will close at the end of  this month. This legislation is designed to be brought to the attention  of the House this month. So we will close it and we will file it on the  last day of this month.   I believe that should we do this, and we should, if we do this, I  believe that it will make a difference in the lives of all people in  this country, because I think that in large part, the reason we had a  person of African ancestry assaulted by other persons of African  ancestry who are a part of the constabulary, police officers, is  because there is little respect for Black lives. Not as much respect  for Black lives.    We say all lives matter. If we say that, then we have to say Black  lives matter. You can't say all lives matter and not say Black lives  matter. They do.   I do not believe that if that young man had been of European  ancestry, what we would call an Anglo or White, whichever you prefer-- I, quite frankly, don't like saying White--but if he had been an Anglo,  a person of European ancestry, those officers wouldn't have behaved  that way. They would not have disrespected his life to the extent that  they disrespected that young man of African ancestry's life.   We have got to respect Black lives. If you say they matter, then you  respect them.   And for further edification purposes, this is not the first time. If  anybody thinks this is the last, you are mistaken. I want it to be the  last. I don't want it to ever occur again, but it can and likely will  because we don't respect Black lives to the same extent as many others,  and we should.   This will go a long way toward our saying to the world: Black lives  ought to be respected. I believe that Black lives when properly  respected will not be abused as was the case with that young man.   What they did to him is unthinkable. I would say unforgivable but my  religious teachings don't allow me to say that. I would say it but we  forgive according to my religiosity. We forgive. But I assure you, it  is the kind of thing you never forget. I have memory for a reason, to  remember so that I can shape the future.   Black lives do matter, and I would like to think that we can pass  this first thing on our list on this conscience agenda, the inculcating  of August 20 annually as Slavery Remembrance Day.   I will move on to the next item on the list. All of these items are  important. Some would say that some items are more important than the  others but they are all important.   By the way, there are many more things that will be added to this  list. This is not exhaustive of the things that are a moral imperative  for this conscience agenda.   I have talked about the August 20 as Slavery Remembrance Day and I  talked about awarding a Congressional Gold Medal to the enslaved. The  third item that I have listed is removing the name of Richard Russell  from the Russell Senate Office Building.   Richard Russell was a self-proclaimed white supremacist. I don't go  in the Russell Senate Office Building. I think I respect myself enough  not to go in the Russell Senate Office Building. Others do what they  may.   And I assure you, if that office building had on it a name associated  with the Third Reich, lots of other people wouldn't go in too.                                time  1415    We would take that name off of that building. What Richard Russell  did to people of color is not only sinful, it is so shameful as to not  reward him with placing his name on a building paid for with tax  dollars, maintained with tax dollars, knowing that people of color of  necessity have to go in and out of the building.   Do you have no respect for us? Do you not care how we feel about  things? Is it just another thing that we will get around to when we  feel like it?   When things are harmful to us, our psyche, our well-being, can we not  say when they should cease to exist? Do you have to always set the  timetable for the people who suffer?   What is wrong with the Senate? The United States Senate can change  this. Take his name off.   Richard Russell fought antilynching legislation. Richard Russell was  the father of the Southern Manifesto. The man called himself a white  supremacist.   What is wrong with us? Why do we disrespect Black people to this  extent?   The Senate ought to immediately take it up, but it won't. This is  Black History Month. It would be a great time to do it, but it won't.   There are people hiding behind, ``Well, who do we name it after? Who  do we honor? What name do you put on it?'' I am not asking you to put  Nat Turner's name on it. I am not asking you to put John Brown's name  on it. I am not asking you to put Dr. King's name on it, Rosa Parks'  name on it, Harriet Tubman's.   I am not asking you to put any name on it other than the name it had  before it became the Russell Senate Office Building. That name was the  Old Senate Office Building. Revert to the name it had, and then take  all the time you desire, my dear brothers and sisters. Take as much  time as God allows, ad infinitum. Go beyond the end of time if you so  desire.   Richard Russell's name won't be there ad infinitum. It won't be there  beyond the end of time. We will have done more than the right thing.   You can do the right thing. That would be a part of it, but we will  do more than the right thing if we take his name off.   We will have done the righteous thing, the righteous thing. His name  ought not be there. Richard Russell, notorious bigot, notorious white  supremacist, his name ought not be on that building.   At some point in time, at some point along this infinite continuum  that we call time, we all are going to have to account for our time.   Those of you who had it within your power to change these things, you  are going to have to account for your time. At some point on the  infinite continuum, you will account for it.   You will account for holding in your hands the ability to make  righteous change and deciding that you will do it when you get good and  ready and when it benefits you.   You ought to be concerned about the people adversely impacted and how  it would benefit them as opposed to how it would benefit you.   The minister talked about the Good Samaritan today. The Good  Samaritan didn't ask the question, ``What will happen to me if I cross  over and help this person who has been beset upon by thieves?'' That  wasn't the question. The Good Samaritan wanted to know, ``What will  happen to him if I don't do it?''   Senate of the United States of America, ask what will happen to the  many people who have to suffer knowing that there is a racist name on a  Senate office building that is paid for with their tax dollars.   If the tables were turned, and he insulted European Anglos to the  same extent that he has insulted Black people, his name wouldn't be  there. They would have removed it long ago.   It is time for the name to come off the building. Let it revert to  the Old Senate Office Building.  [[Page H662]]    The fourth thing on the agenda: Enacting the Securities and Exchange  Atonement Act.   Friends, our research has shown that financial institutions engaged  in the slave trade--banks. Many of the big banks now had predecessor  institutions, banks that literally, actually, made loans to people and  allowed those loans to be secured with enslaved people, enslaved people  treated like cattle, called chattels, like a piece of property, like  you secure a loan now with a piece of property. They secured the loans  with enslaved people and made money doing it.   Insurance companies' predecessor institutions literally insured  enslaved people just as you would insure cattle, a horse, a cow. They  insured them and made money.   They need to atone. They need to atone. Atonement has not been  defined in the sense of ``do a specific thing.'' One institution has  made an effort, but there has to be atonement. There has to be some  sort of atonement for that.   I assure you, if the tables were turned, if Anglos had been treated  in the numbers and the same way, in a similar fashion to the way people  of color were treated, Anglos would be demanding atonement.   I assure you. It is not even debatable. You would. You would. By the  way, I would be there with you. I would stand with you because it would  be the righteous thing to do.   I would stand with you if the tables were turned on any of these  issues because it would be the righteous thing to do.   I plan to proceed with this legislation. We will be filing it in this  Congress.   Finally: Establishing the department of reconciliation. We have not  reconciled in this country.   By the way, I am of the opinion that there are many people who just  don't care. They don't care. But there are many others who do, who do.   Those who care, people of good will, they know that we need to do  more to reconcile. We need to cover this moral imperative.   We have a Department of Education with Under Secretaries of  Education; a Department of Labor, Under Secretaries of Labor; a  Department of Commerce.    Why, then, can we not have a department, a department of  reconciliation; a department of reconciliation with a secretary of  reconciliation and under secretaries, structured such that it will deal  with the moral imperatives; a department of reconciliation such that at  the end of the day, when one President leaves office and another comes  in, the work of the department continues, just as the Department of  Labor continues, the Department of Commerce continues? One President  coming and leaving does not change the work of any of these  departments.   It is not going to be easy to complete the moral imperative, the  conscience agenda. It is not going to be easy, but it is something that  we must do.   We are not going to change history. Those who desire to no longer  teach what actually happened to people in this country--there are  people in Texas now who would have slavery become ``involuntary  relocation.'' That is true, ``involuntary relocation.''   Kidnapping? Involuntary relocation. Murder, rape? Involuntary  relocation. Separating families at the auction block? Involuntary  relocation.   No, you are not going to change history. You are not. There are  people who want to, under some specious theory that the people who want  to teach history are somehow wanting to harm the country by telling the  truth.   Now, we are a country that believes in truth. We preach truth in this  country. Somewhere it is written, ``You shall know truth, and the truth  will set you free.''   There is a certain amount of freedom associated with actualizing,  realizing, the truth. We have to know the truth. You are not going to  be able to hide it. But there are people who would say that by teaching  truth, we are going to harm the country.   What about the people who suffered and still suffer as a result of  the truth not being told? People have to know what happened.   Black History Month is not nearly enough time to explain what  happened. We pick out certain things that happened, certain meaningful  moments in time, but that is not Black history.   Black history is more than the civil rights movement. It really is.  It is more than the history of Africans in the Americas.   Yes, Black history is American history, but it is also world history.  It is world history. Just as the history of others who are global, they  have a global history, too.   I remember, in my history book, there was an indication that the  reason the nations or countries in Africa were not mentioned in world  history was because they made little contribution to history. I had to  grow up with that--little contribution to history.   Friends--I say ``friends,'' and I am very sincere when I say it. I  consider people friends who may not consider me a friend.                                time  1430    Friends, or as Dr. King might say it, brothers and sisters, we must  reconcile. We will not reconcile without some structured department,  something that has no end in sight. The end would be when  reconciliation is ultimately achieved.   We need this department of reconciliation. The country needs it. It  will benefit us all. It will make the country a better place.   Not everybody wants it. Not everybody wants to see the change in the  status quo.   I know this is a very difficult thing for many people to embrace, and  I am very much aware of what Voltaire called to our attention, and it  impacts many people. He reminded us that it is dangerous to be right in  affairs where established men are wrong. It is dangerous to be right.  Many people, they understand that, and because they understand that,  they avoid this.   This is a righteous agenda. There is nothing on here that cannot be  done and should not be done. Everything on here is a part of the  righteous agenda.   Nothing wrong with inculcating August 20 as Slavery Remembrance Day  because of what happened to the slaves, just as we have a 9/11  remembrance, just as we have a Pearl Harbor remembrance, a Holocaust  remembrance--by the way, all recognized by the Congress. That would be  the House and Senate, Congress as the House and Senate, not just the  House, all recognized.   I do confess this, and I should have mentioned it earlier, but it is  never too late to speak truth. The President of the United States has  acknowledged August 20, has acknowledged Slavery Remembrance Day, the  Honorable Joe Biden.   The House passed this resolution, by the way. Many Members are not  aware of it. We did pass a resolution honoring August 20. I don't know  what the Senate will do, but I am at a point where I just believe we  need to go on and commemorate the day. Just commemorate the day.   Nobody gets paid. I am not asking does anybody get paid. Nobody  should be paid. This is a day of commemoration, not celebration. No  celebrations. I don't want the stores to give discounts, Slavery  Remembrance Day discounts. That is not what this is about. This is  sacred. This is not secular.   This, August 20, nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with it. The  President has acknowledged it.   If I just may say so, the President, in his efforts to acknowledge  that Black lives matter, and do so in a very positive way, the  President appointed an African-American female to the Supreme Court of  the United States of America, something that could have been done by  many others but never achieved. He did it.   Now, if anybody thinks I am going to forget that the President did  something as significant as that--see, it may not be important to other  people, but to me it is probably one of the most important things that  he has done. I will be eternally grateful, and there are a lot of other  people who will be equally as grateful.   So, there is nothing wrong with this August 20 as Slavery Remembrance  Day. Nothing wrong with according, giving, a Congressional Gold Medal  to the enslaved people who built the country, laid the foundation for  the economic success of the country. Nothing wrong with that.   If we can do it for the Confederate soldiers, surely we can do it for  the enslaved people born into slavery, lived as slaves, many of them,  and died as slaves.  [[Page H663]]    Nothing wrong with removing the name of a self-proclaimed white  supremacist from a building paid for with tax dollars.   Nothing wrong with saying that these companies, mega companies,  nothing wrong with saying that these mega companies which profited  enormously from the slave trade--nothing wrong with saying they should  atone.   Good Christians understand atonement. People of good will understand  atonement. All religions address atonement in some way. Nothing wrong  with atonement.   Wanting to reconcile? Having a department of reconciliation, how does  that hurt a country wherein we see circumstances necessitating  reconciliation, our moral imperative?   Mr. Speaker, it is always an honor, it is a privilege, to have this  freedom of speech. Freedom of speech may be the hallmark of our  democracy. We don't have to agree. That is what freedom of speech is  all about, freedom to say and not be persecuted for having said.   I am grateful to have this opportunity to speak without fear of  persecution. I could be wrong, but I am not afraid. I am not afraid,  and I am grateful.   I love my country. I try to conclude by saying this. I love my  country. I salute the flag. Yes, I say the Pledge of Allegiance. I sing  the national anthem. I stand when I sing it. I place my hand on my  heart when I sing it. I place my hand on my heart when I say the Pledge  of Allegiance. But I also defend those who choose not to.   That is the greatness of America. The greatness of America is not in  my standing and saluting and singing. The greatness is in allowing  those who choose not to. That is the greatness of the country, that we  can accept those who would not do what others do, those who would say,  ``Look, I am not an automaton. I am not going to march in lockstep. I  choose to take a different path.''   I defend their right to do so. I do so because I love my country.   God bless you, Mr. Speaker. God bless the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
