 Madam Chair, I thank the ranking member.   I originally had intended to offer my support for this disaster  supplemental package, especially as it relates to agricultural and  rural development. But because of the actions of our colleagues on the  other side of the aisle, I can no longer support the bill in its  current form.   As the former chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee on  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies, I worked with my friends and the new chairman,  Sanford Bishop, and other Members who represent districts impacted by  historical weather-related disasters to provide relief to the farming  and rural communities.   However, including the already-failed CR in the rule puts partisan  politics above bipartisanship. I cannot support this poison-pill  package, especially after all we have heard from our Democratic  colleagues about letting the legislative process work.   Members from the Southeast to California, to Hawaii, to all of the  communities in between represent districts with agriculture and rural  constituencies that have suffered devastating losses in their  livelihoods. From cotton to vegetables, to livestock, to losses in my  home State of Alabama, as well as Georgia, Florida, and North Carolina,  including South Carolina, means lost income now and lost income for the  future.   Unfortunately, constituents are being used politically as human  shields. Everyone in Democratic leadership knows the President will  veto this CR, and it is very unfortunate to have this in the rule.                                time  1430    Our farmers put food on our tables and clothes on our backs. They put  in countless hours of labor and take risks. Putting the CR in this bill  is making it 100 percent veto bait.   Madam Chair, I encourage my colleagues to do the right thing and take  out the CR, and let the bill proceed to the Senate with a chance of  passage.   Madam Chair, when Superstorm Sandy ravaged the Northeast in 2012, the  House put aside partisan differences and provided $750 billion. I hope  that our Democratic colleagues would look at that and do the same.
