 Mr. Speaker, I am so excited to be here on the floor  today to congratulate Rabbi Larry Sernovitz on becoming the senior  rabbi of Temple Kol Emeth in Marietta, Georgia.   In just the few short months that I have known the rabbi, he has been  instrumental in helping to spread our shared message of God's love for  all people and tikkun olam.   ``Tikkun olam'' translates to ``repair of the world,'' and I know  that, together, our community in Georgia will help build bridges to a  better and more just tomorrow.   I congratulate the rabbi on his new mission from God. Our community  is blessed to have been gifted a leader like him.   I hope that, if he or his congregation ever need assistance from my  office, they don't hesitate to call upon us. I truly look forward to  working with the rabbi and the Jewish community in Georgia for many  years to come, and I wish them all a happy and blessed Hannukah season.                            ____________________
