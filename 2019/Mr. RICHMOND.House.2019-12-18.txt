 Madam Speaker, President Trump, on January 20, 2017,  raised his hand and swore to preserve, protect, and defend the  Constitution. Now we must preserve, protect, and defend the  Constitution from him.   Madam Speaker, I rise today, not to disparage and embarrass the  President of the United States, but to defend our precious democracy.   I speak today, not because I hate this President, but because I love  this body, the people's House.  [[Page H12148]]    I have heard Republicans say: Why are we rushing to judgment? This is  not a rush to judgment; it is a rush to justice, and we must not delay.   Corruption is corrosive; it eats away like acid. The longer we wait,  the more time we allow for this President to do irreparable harm to our  country and our democracy.   Just last week, Rudy Giuliani was back at it in Ukraine. So please  don't tell us to wait, because the corruption continues.   There is a famous quote that says: Politicians worry about the next  election; statesmen worry about the next generation. Today calls upon  us to be statesmen and stateswomen--Democrat, Republican, and  Independent. Our election is under attack from within.   So, to my Republican colleagues, many of whom spent a lifetime trying  to build a reputation of honesty and courage, I beg you: Don't throw  that away for President Trump. He doesn't deserve it, nor will he  appreciate it past the next tweet or next week.   My fear and my prediction is that his actions will continue.   Madam Speaker, Donald Trump recently said: I can do anything I want.  He also bragged that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get  away with it. Well, he is shooting holes in our Constitution on  Pennsylvania Avenue, and our House, the people's House, must defend the  Constitution from a domestic enemy to the rule of law: Donald Trump.   Because I don't want generations to come to blame me for letting our  democracy die, I, therefore, rise in favor of impeaching Donald Trump.
