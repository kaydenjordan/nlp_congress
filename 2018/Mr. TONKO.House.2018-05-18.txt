 Mr. Speaker, 1 year ago this June, President Trump  announced that it was Infrastructure Week. He declared it again last  August, and then again in February, when he rolled out a proposal that  was about 15 percent the size of what he promised. And this week, well,  you won't be surprised that it is Infrastructure Week again.   In a year and a half of the Trump Presidency, we have had four  Infrastructure Weeks, but no real infrastructure bill, no solution, and  no problem solving. Many of our roads, bridges, pipes, electric lines,  railroads, ports and airports need our help. They are crumbling,  structurally unsound, or simply out of date.   Instead of being bold and proposing a plan like President Eisenhower  did, our current President proposed selling off these critical public  systems to the highest bidder and sticking local taxpayers with the  rest of the bill. That is a bad deal.   Democrats have A Better Deal to rebuild America by putting our money  where our mouth is, investing $1 trillion in helping to jump-start 16  million middle class construction jobs. That is a better deal. That is  what America deserves.                            ____________________
