 Mr. Speaker, I was listening to the colloquy earlier. I  have listened to comments here during debate. I have seen comments made  in the media by some of the folks here in the House over the vote that  was taken, basically, on an anti-hate resolution that was originally  intended to address anti-Semitic remarks that were made by a Member of  the House.   Yet, instead of addressing the anti-Semitic remarks, it was made a  global, general: Oh, we are against almost all hate--well, not all  hate. Apparently, not the kind of hate for Republicans that would cause  our minority whip,   Steve Scalise, to be shot and almost killed; not  the violence being perpetrated on supporters of President Trump,  including on college campuses. But even they, as horrendous as they  were, have no moral equivalence to the Holocaust.   Expanding the resolution from a simple condemnation of anti-Jewish,  anti-Semitic remarks to a panoply of other items--actually attempted to  give everything ever done to anyone, except a few hate-filled actions,  of course--attempting to give them the moral equivalence of the  Holocaust where none exists, that is tragic.   And then to compound that regrettable action by the majority in  trying to please everyone, instead of standing up and calling out anti- Jewish, hate-filled remarks, biased, bigoted remarks, then came here  and condemned those of us who call them out for not standing up against  anti-Semitic remarks and accuse us of being hate-filled because we took  a principled stand against anti-Semitic remarks that needed to be  singularized, needed to be addressed, needed to be condemned.   And not only that, to come in and also take the occasion to slander    Steve King, saying: Well, he should have been called out 10 years ago.   No allegations, no specifics. Let's just generally slap somebody down  because we don't like them; we don't like what they have said.   This is outrageous. This was no place for any of those actions, any  of those comments, and I deeply regret people for whom I have had  respect who would come in here and try to draw moral equivalence to  every little action.   Look, I bet most of us--I know a lot of us have had plenty of death  threats. We have had plenty of nasty comments made. But we don't go  running to the media every time somebody threatens to kill us or  somebody makes these outrageous threats or allegations.    The Holocaust was different. The suffering caused during the years of  slavery in the United States really were unforgivable. It was a  horrible thing to inflict on anybody.   I was shocked to find out here in February that there are more slaves  in the world today--40 million--than there have ever been in the  world's existence. That is horrendous.   We ought to take actions to stamp out slavery wherever it is, against  whatever race or nationality, whatever. It has no place in the world.   But we know what leads to a Holocaust, the killing of millions of  Jews simply because they were Jewish. It starts with maligning comments  against Jews.   At first people will say, you know, that is really not appropriate.  But then it gets watered down to where, well, there are a lot of bad  comments against all kinds of people. You know, we are not for any of  those.   And that is where we find ourselves this week in the House of  Representatives. It has started.   People in this body knew which Members have made anti-Semitic  feelings known in the past, so it is kind of hard to imagine that  anybody would put someone who has espoused very strong anti-Semitic  feelings in the past, put them on the committee where they can do the  most damage to Israel and our relationship with Israel and then act  like they had no idea: Let's just say that there are problems with all  kinds of hate.   Well, there is a problem with not calling out the kind of comments  that start the ball rolling toward another Holocaust.                                time  1300    Those of us who believe in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and  believe, as it says up here, in that God we trust, that is the God it  is talking about. That is why Moses, his full face, is up here in this  body, because of the respect for the moral laws that he gave.   But there is a danger to any civilization, any country, that will not  call out anti-Semitic comments when they happen. It is not enough to  put in language so that if you accuse somebody of anti-Semitic comments  because they have actually made them, but they happen to be of a  certain race or religion, then you get condemned. They say, oh, you are  against this race, or you are against this religion, because you called  them down for their anti-Semitic remarks.   That resolution yesterday leaves that kind of ambivalence out there  and available to people who make anti-Semitic remarks.   It needs to stop. It needs to be called out before this body loses  its moral relevance to make a difference in the world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 1 minute  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday,  March 11, 2019, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
