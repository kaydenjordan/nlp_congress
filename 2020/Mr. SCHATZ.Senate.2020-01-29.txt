 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question from Senator Schatz is directed to  the House managers, and the question also is from Senator Feinstein:         If the President were acting in the interest of national       security, as he alleges, would there be documentary evidence       or testimony to substantiate his claim? If yes, has any       evidence like that been presented by the President's counsel?    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S655, January 29, 2020, second column, the following  appears: If the President were acting in the interest of national  security, as he alleges, would there be documentary evidence or  testimony to substantiate his claim? If yes, has any evidence like  that been presented by the president's counsel?      The online Record has been corrected to read: If the President  were acting in the interest of national security, as he alleges,  would there be documentary evidence or testimony to substantiate  his claim? If yes, has any evidence like that been presented by  the President's counsel?    ========================= END NOTE =========================       Mr. Manager CROW. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Thank you, Senators,  for the question.   The answer is yes. There are well-established processes, mechanisms,  and agencies in place to pursue valid and legitimate national security  interests of the United States--like the National Security Council;  like the National Security Advisor, as in Ambassador John Bolton; and  many other folks within the State Department and the Department of  Defense. And as we have well established over the last week, none of  those folks, none of those agencies, would have been involved in having  that deliberation, reviewing that evidence, having that discussion, or  incorporated into any type of interagency review process during the  vast majority of the time that we are talking about here.   From the time of the President's call on July 25 to the time the hold  was lifted, those individuals, those agencies were in the dark. They  didn't know what was happening, and, more so, not only were they in the  dark, but the President violated the law by violating the Impoundment  Control Act to execute his scheme. None of that suggests a valid,  legitimate policy objective.   More so, the President himself and his counsel are bringing at issue  the question of documents and witnesses. If over and over again, as we  have heard in the last few days, the President was simply pursuing a  valid, legitimate policy objective, if this was a specific debate about  policy, a debate about corruption, a debate about burden-sharing, then,  let's have the documents that would show that. Let's hear from the  witnesses that would show that. The documents and the witnesses that we  have forwarded and we have talked about show the exact opposite.   The American people in this Chamber deserve to have a fair trial. The  President deserves to have a fair trial. In fact, if he is arguing that  there is evidence, that there was a policy debate, then, I think  everybody would love to see those documents, would love to see the  witnesses and hear from them directly about what exactly was being  debated.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from South Carolina.
