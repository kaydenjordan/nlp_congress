 Madam Speaker, I rise today to praise my House colleagues  for their votes to impeach President Donald Trump last night. I know it  was not easy for many of them, but when called to make the tough  choice, they proved themselves true patriots: They chose to protect and  defend our country and our Constitution from a President who has little  regard for either.   Foreign influence in American affairs was the Founding Fathers'  biggest fear. That is why Presidents must be natural-born citizens.   But now we have a President who profits from foreign officials  staying at his hotels, who solicits foreign interference in our  elections, and who attacks everything American, including our courts,  FBI, veterans, Gold Star families, and even our citizens.   The Founding Fathers would have been extremely proud of what we did  last night. That is why I am proud to be a Member of a Congress that  fights for the public good and not personal profit.
