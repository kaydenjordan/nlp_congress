 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of a North Carolina legend, former U.S. Senator and Congressman James  T. Broyhill, who passed away on February 18 at the age of 95.   Jim Broyhill will be remembered as one of the political giants in the  history of North Carolina, especially for those of us from the western  part of the State that he so ably, with distinction, represented for  over two decades.   A native of Lenoir, Broyhill served in several executive capacities  at his family's furniture business, Broyhill Industries, prior to  entering public service.   He was first elected to the United States House of Representatives in  1962 as a long-shot candidate. Broyhill, a Republican, pulled off a  narrow 1-point victory at a time when North Carolina politics were  dominated by the Democratic Party. He quickly won the hearts of his  constituents and served the people of western North Carolina in this  House until 1986.   Broyhill liked to tell a story from his first election, an occurrence  that had an impact on him and taught him an  [[Page H882]]  important lesson in dealing with people.   Table Rock is a beautiful and distinct mountain in Burke County,  North Carolina, one that I am proud to represent and one that Broyhill  could see each day from his home in Lenoir. Out on the campaign trail  one day, he drove around to the other side of the mountain and stopped  at a small country store. He greeted the owner of that little store and  said: ``How are things on the back side of Table Rock today?'' to which  the owner replied, ``Who says this is the back side?''   He said he learned that day the importance of meeting people where  they are and that his perspective might not always be shared by someone  else, a lesson all of us here in the House and Washington would be wise  to hear and to learn.   Broyhill loved his constituents, and the feeling was mutual. He took  a personal interest, acknowledging special events with a note or a  phone call. He and his beloved wife, Louise, published ``The  Congressional Club Cook Book'' with immensely popular recipes such as  Capitol bean soup and heaven cake.   However, the real impact he made in Congress was as a landmark  legislator. In the House, he sat on the Small Business Committee and  the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, and for many years, he was  the ranking member of the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee,  which we now call the Energy and Commerce Committee.   President Reagan credited Senator Broyhill as being a key force in  the 1985 tax reform package. His 1978 legislation that allowed cable  companies to connect to existing utility poles led to the explosive  growth in cable television and communication. In the 10th Congressional  District that I am proud to represent, it led to a boom in fiber optic  manufacturing jobs that communities are still benefiting from today. It  was then coaxial cable, fiber today.   He always prioritized constituent service at home and was truly a  pioneer in that regard. At a time when district offices were deemed to  be of lesser importance to many on the Hill, then-Congressman Broyhill  kept his district offices fully staffed by trained professionals who  were always ready to help with whatever issues his constituents had  with Federal agencies.   That is something that I learned from him. His district became North  Carolina's 10th Congressional District in 1969, and I am only the third  Representative from that district since then. His successor, Cass  Ballenger, learned the art of constituent service from the Broyhill  staff. I, in turn, learned from Ballenger's staff, some of whom still  work in my Hickory district office today.    Jim Broyhill moved on to the United States Senate in the summer of  1986, serving out the unexpired term of the late Senator John East.  After his time in elective office ended, Broyhill continued to work on  behalf of the people of North Carolina. He put his extensive business  experience to use by serving as North Carolina's secretary of commerce  and the chairman of the North Carolina Economic Development Commission.  The post office in his beloved hometown of Lenoir was named after him,  a well-deserved recognition.   I could go on at length about his other accomplishments in public  life and business and, certainly, his long record in philanthropy. Let  me just say that he lived his life well, always in service to others,  and our State and our Nation are much better for it.   On behalf of my constituents, the people of North Carolina, and a  grateful Nation, I extend condolences to Senator Broyhill's family as  they mourn.                            ____________________
