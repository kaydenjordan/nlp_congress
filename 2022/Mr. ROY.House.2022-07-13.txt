 Mr. Speaker, I associate myself with the remarks of my  friend from Florida (Mr. Gaetz) a few minutes ago with respect to his  position about what this bill will do in terms of fear and its purpose  of creating fear among the people. That is the reality. That is what we  are dealing with here.   Texas has an alert system. States have alert systems. That is where  this properly resides. That is where the police power resides, in the  States.   In fact, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee even acknowledged  this reality that, well, okay, States have this, but here is a Federal  program we are going to create with $2 million. You can use it if you  want.   This is another example of Washington creating another department,  another position, spending more money that we don't have in order to  have a policy objective of continuing to advance fear among the  American people.   Remember the COVID alerts? How many alerts do we need on our phones  to create fear in the minds of the American people?   Allow the States to make a decision about when there is something  that is meritorious, whether it is a tornado alert, whether it is an  AMBER Alert. Allow the local jurisdictions to make that decision, not  bureaucrats in Washington. That is the reality.   I think it would probably be a more advantageous use of our time to  develop a congressional stupidity alert system or a congressional harm  alert system. I mean, we do it every single day. That is what this body  is actually engaged in on a regular basis, harming the American people  through either nonaction or action.   As we speak, maybe we should have an alert about the inflation  running rampant around this country because of the rampant spending, as  evidenced by this very bill with another $2 million for a position in  the Department of Justice.   Maybe we need an alert system for the literal stream of people coming  across the border in Eagle Pass right now and the fentanyl pouring  across into our communities, endangering the American people,  empowering cartels at our peril.   Maybe, perhaps, we need an alert system for more COVID mandates, more  mask mandates, and more shutdowns in our schools where our children get  harmed and where they have mental health issues because of what this  body does.   Maybe we need an alert system for the wokeism and the vax mandates at  the Department of Defense that are damaging our ability to recruit.  Just now, on the floor this week, we are going to be taking up the  National Defense Authorization Act. We can't even attain 40 percent  recruiting standards right now in our United States Army because of  wokeism and because of vaccine mandates driving our personnel away from  the Department of Defense. Maybe we need an alert system for the  American people to know what is happening at the Department of Defense.   Maybe we need an alert on our failures to vote, our proxy voting in  this very body, and our virtual voting from boats by some of our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle.   We could have so many alert systems that we could be actually  educating the American people on what they are getting here in this  august body, the people's House. That would be a more valuable alert  system than carrying out the function of the State and local police  power that is inherent in our Constitution, which this body tramples  upon on a regular and daily basis.    Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and as someone who  represents San Antonio, an inordinate number of veterans, Joint Base  San Antonio, Army Futures Command, I regret to rise in opposition to  the legislation before us.   I respect the enormous amount of work that has gone into this  legislation by the committee staff, by the ranking member, by the  chairman, by the Senate. Obviously, it is an important issue, and it is  critical. I have many friends here, particularly veterans, who support  this measure, and I understand why.   Every single one of us wants to make sure that we take care of this  issue, and frankly, it has been way too long in getting to it. I agree  with that completely. But, unfortunately, I cannot support this bill  because this bill spends about $285 billion that we don't have.                                time  1415    We have to address the issue in this body of spending money we don't  have. The chairman said: Well, why don't you raise it on other issues?  I raised it on every single issue. I raised it on a $2 million bill  about 30 minutes ago on the floor.   At some point, we have to pay for the stuff that we are spending it  on or the very things that these veterans sacrificed for will be made  completely and utterly worthless. We are destroying the Republic that  these men and women sacrificed for, and we are destroying it in this  Chamber by our incompetence and by our irresponsible refusal to  actually manage the affairs of the Republic appropriately.   Putting this bill on autopilot to the tune of $680 billion of  mandatory spending with $280 billion unpaid for, which we can pay for  right now with existing COVID funds, we could pay for it right now with  the elimination of the SALT deduction, we could pay for it right now  with any number of spending cuts and/or tax increases--if we wanted to  have that debate on the floor of the House--but we are not doing it.   We do a disservice to the veterans who are sick because of the burn  pits. We do a disservice to the veterans who laid their lives on the  line and died for this country. We do a disservice to the military that  we say that we support when we are not spending money that we actually  have, as opposed to printing money and borrowing money.   Putting it on autopilot, when 60 percent of our spending every year  is already on autopilot--when we are $30.5 trillion in debt. Instead of  the established scientific framework, we put 20 conditions in without  scientific evidence which will cause a backlog, which the VA even  acknowledges will cause a backlog. These are real concerns that we  ought to address.   Fundamentally, you have to pay for that which we are spending. We are  undermining the sacrifice of the very veterans that we say that we are  helping with this measure by not doing it with fiscal responsibility.
