 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of older Americans in  my district to call for the repeal of the windfall elimination  provision and the government pension offset.   For far too long, the WEP and GPO provisions have wrongfully  penalized our Nation's public servants who have paid into Social  Security by working second or even third jobs. That means that public  servants in my district, like Fran, a retired schoolteacher from San  Jacinto, are seeing their Social Security cut because of bureaucratic  red tape. She wrote to me and told me that her Social Security benefits  have been reduced by $500 per month. Fran deserves better.   Our Nation's retired teachers, police officers, and firefighters  deserve better, too. After a lifetime of hard work and paying into  Social Security, there is no justification for them to miss out on  their earned income in their golden years. We have an obligation, a  responsibility, to take care of them and ensure they receive the  benefits that they have earned through years of hard work.   We must pass the Social Security 2100 Act to finally eliminate the  WEP and GPO provisions, strengthen Social Security, and give our  Nation's seniors a much-needed increase in benefits. This repeal is  long overdue. Our seniors cannot afford to wait any longer for the  fairness, relief, and peace of mind that they deserve.              In Support of the Farm Workforce Modernization Act     Mr. Speaker, as chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus,  I rise today to call on the Senate to stand with our Nation's  farmworkers and pass H.R. 1603, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act,  immediately.   Yesterday, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus brought together over 20  [[Page H5829]]  key national and regional organizations that advocate for farmworkers  who, despite carrying the burden of injuries and illnesses during the  pandemic, kept our country fed.   We discussed injustices that our campesinos face when it comes to  healthcare, education, housing, workers' rights, and immigration.  Together, we are working together to craft meaningful solutions to  these challenges that will help our Nation's farmworker communities  thrive.   An immediate solution is for the Senate to pass the bipartisan Farm  Workforce Modernization Act that the House has passed. We need 10  Republican Senators to agree and pass the Farm Workforce Modernization  Act out of the Senate to make this much-needed legislation into law.   Right now, from vineyards in California to fields in the Midwest and  ranches in the South, growers are concerned about an unstable workforce  and a labor shortage. Many farmworkers toil in the fields with  uncertainty and fear of being deported and separated from their  families. The COVID-19 pandemic has only heightened these concerns.   Unfortunately, this uncertainty and these labor disruptions are  contributing to the destabilization of our farms and to higher food  prices across America.   We need the Farm Workforce Modernization Act to bring certainty and  solutions for growers, farmworkers, and their families.   Now, more than ever, we must stabilize and modernize our farm  workforce, keep families together, and secure a pathway to citizenship  for our essential and vital farmworkers.   This Congress, the CHC recognized these urgent needs and led the  charge to get this bipartisan bill passed out of the House.   Now, I repeat, we just need 10 Republican Senators to get on board so  that we can pass this out of the Senate and make it law.   To them I say, Let's get it done.   To our Nation's farmworkers, I say, We stand with you. We fight for  you. The CHC is doubling down. We will never stop fighting for our  farmworker communities. We will fight ``with strength,'' ``con puno y  fuerza,'' to ensure that their labor rights, immigration status, and  access to education, healthcare and housing are secure.   Together, we stand firm in our resolve and strong in our fight to  protect farmworkers, our vital workforce, and their access to  healthcare, education, housing rights, and citizenship.   As the proud son of farmworkers, I stand before this body today to  let our farmworkers know, ``Together, we can. Yes, we can.'' ``Juntos  podemos. Si se puede.''                            ____________________
