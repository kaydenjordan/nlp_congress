 Madam President, with regards to Rounds amendment No.  813 to S. 2226, the FY24 National Defense Authorization Act, I share  the sponsor's national security concerns, especially in reference to  the purchase of agricultural lands by companies affiliated with the  People's Republic of China, and appreciate the sponsor's effort to  improve review of these sales. However, I am also deeply concerned by  issues that have been raised with respect to civil liberties and want  to ensure that no one is discriminated against or viewed as a national  security threat simply because of where they were born.   As written, the language seems to equate individuals from the  specified countries as synonymous with their governments. Under this  provision, if an individual with a valid visa, who has no connection to  one of the governments listed, seeks to buy agricultural property above  a certain threshold, the U.S. Government would deny them the ability to  proceed with the purchase simply because of their national origin.  While the national security concerns this amendment seeks to address  are real, we must not discriminate on individuals based on national  origin, race, or ethnicity.   I voted in favor of my colleagues' amendment in order to continue the  conversation on this important issue, but will not support any final  provision that does not resolve these civil liberties concerns.                            ____________________
