 Madam Speaker, on Thursday, the  Commission on Unalienable Rights of the State Department report was  released, as reviewed by Walter Russell Mead in The Wall Street Journal  on Friday. The commission was chaired by Harvard legal scholar Mary Ann  Glendon.   ``America's founding was the most significant event in the history of  human rights. . . . Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who convened the  commission . . . doubled down on the combative and incendiary nature of  the report.''   ``Mr. Pompeo summarized their central contention about America's role  in the global fight for human rights in nine memorable words: `America  is special. America is good. America does good.' It upholds a limited  concept of  [[Page H3597]]  unalienable, God-given rights grounded in sovereign nation-states.   ``The Unalienable Rights Commission report is a thoughtful and  carefully reasoned document that may serve as an important landmark in  future debates.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
