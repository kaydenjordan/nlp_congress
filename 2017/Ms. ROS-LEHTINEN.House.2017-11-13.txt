 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the chairman  of our committee, for yielding me the time, and I rise today in support  of H. Res. 599--expressing the sense of the U.S. House of  Representatives with respect to United States policy toward Yemen.   I want to thank my other colleague from California, Mr. Khanna, and  Mr. McGovern from Massachusetts for offering this important resolution  before us.   I want to thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for always  working in a bipartisan manner in our committee, including with our  leadership, to bring this resolution before us today.   Mr. Speaker, there are approximately 2 million internally displaced  persons in Yemen right now. International aid agencies consider Yemen  to be one of the four current famine countries alongside South Sudan,  Somalia, and Nigeria. We must ensure that access and safe passage is  being given to reach the people of Yemen who desperately need this  assistance.   Saudi Arabia and the UAE have security and terror concerns in Yemen,  and they have to mitigate those, but there  [[Page H9151]]  should not be any obstacles to prevent the delivery of vital  humanitarian assistance to Yemen.   It is positive news that this morning Saudi Arabia announced that it  will begin reopening airports and seaports in Yemen; so, hopefully,  that aid will come quickly for those starving people.   Since this campaign began in 2015, the United States has been the  largest contributor of humanitarian aid to Yemen. We must ensure that  the aid is not being diverted and is actually reaching the right people  who need it the most.   A political solution is needed in Yemen where all parties can sit  down and negotiate a path forward, but that becomes increasingly more  difficult when we have to deal with the negative influence of Iran and  the Houthis.   Here are some examples. In February 2017, General Soleimani,  commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the Quds Force,  reportedly pledged to increase Iran's assistance to Houthi-Saleh  forces.   According to press reports, two incidents occurred in October 2016,  off the coast of Yemen, where missiles were fired targeting our Navy  destroyers.   After Houthi forces targeted U.S. warships near Yemen, the vice  admiral, who heads U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, said: ``We  believe that Iran is connected to this.''   Since April 2015, U.S. warships have intercepted at least five  Iranian shipments of weapons to Houthi forces. Just last week, the U.S.  Forces' central commander said that a missile fired by the Houthis at  Riyadh was manufactured by Iran.   In Yemen, we cannot forget that we need to undermine Iran's influence  over the Houthis. Last month, the White House released a new strategy  when it comes to Iran, and it stated: ``The Iranian regime has taken  advantage of regional conflicts and instability to aggressively expand  its regional influence and threaten its neighbors with little domestic  or international cost for its actions.''   I believe that targeted sanctions are needed against Iran for  providing weapons to the Houthis, weapons that are being used to  directly target U.S. soldiers in the region.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, we cannot forget about the threats emanating  from a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization, al-Qaida, in the  Arabian Peninsula, also known as AQAP. The United States must continue  to operate and conduct operations in Yemen to counter the threats from  AQAP, but we cannot do it alone.   A few months ago, the UAE and the U.S. teamed up with local Yemeni  forces to target AQAP militants. This is another positive sign in the  region where we can partner with our Gulf partners to fight extremist  elements jointly. These operations are essential to protecting our  national security interests and to help bring regional stability in the  region.   While a lot of the focus is traditionally put on Hezbollah and Hamas  in the region, we cannot forget about the dangerous malign and illicit  activities that Iran is undertaking through its proxy in Yemen, the  Houthis.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask for my colleagues'  support for the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program Act, which I  introduced along with my good friend, Congresswoman Cheri Bustos.   As a former Florida certified teacher, I know that education is the  key to unlocking long-lasting and positive change in all of our  communities. But in today's interconnected world, students must gain  foreign language skills and the ability to learn from other cultures.   Study abroad programs are an excellent way to learn these essential  skills. However, Mr. Speaker, the ability to study abroad remains just  a dream for rural, minority, and first-generation college students.   Cheri Bustos and I filed this bill to address this problem by  establishing a competitive grant program that will allow universities  to provide low-income and other underrepresented undergraduates with  the means to be able to study abroad.   Mr. Speaker, the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program Act is a  commonsense bill that will help our students gain essential skills and  empower them to thrive in a global and interconnected marketplace, and  I thank my friend, Congresswoman Bustos, for allowing me to enter this  bill with her.                            ____________________
