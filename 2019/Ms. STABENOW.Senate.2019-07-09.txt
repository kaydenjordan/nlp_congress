 Madam President, I first want to thank my friend and  colleague from Ohio for his passion and for caring so deeply, as we all  do in our caucus, fighting for people's healthcare.   It seems every week I am down on the floor saying exactly the same  thing: Healthcare is personal; it is not political. Healthcare is  personal to every single person in Michigan; it is not political.   Whether a senior is able to afford the medication she needs to treat  her chronic condition, that is personal. Whether a single dad is able  to take his children to a trusted doctor when they get sick or hurt and  keep them on his policy until age 26, that is personal. Whether a woman  is charged more for the health insurance coverage she needs to detect  cancer early enough so it can be cured, that is personal.   Unfortunately, the law that helps seniors afford their prescriptions,  ensures children can remain on their parents' insurance until age 26,  requires health insurance policies to charge women the same as a man  and to cover lifesaving, preventive care, that law is currently in the  intensive care unit on life support.   As we know, since 2010, Senate and House Republicans have voted to  repeal or undermine the Affordable Care Act more than 100 different  times--100 different times. That didn't sit right with families across  Michigan and across the country. They stood up with us, they fought  back with us, and together we won.   What Republicans couldn't do in Congress, they are trying to do  through the courts. Today, literally, the Fifth Circuit Court of  Appeals begins hearing arguments in a case brought by 18 different  Republican attorneys general and Governors.   In short, these 18 Republican attorneys general and Governors, backed  by the Trump administration and President Trump, are trying to take  away your healthcare. If they win, healthcare reform could be  completely overturned and healthcare taken away. That would take  everything away, including Medicaid expansion, which we call Healthy  Michigan. In Michigan, we have about 700,000 people getting healthcare  now who don't have to pick between working a minimum wage job and  getting healthcare. They can do both. Children staying on their  parents' insurance plans until age 26--  [[Page S4722]]  gone. More affordable drugs for seniors--gone. Protections for people  with preexisting conditions--gone.   In other words, it would put insurance companies back in charge of  your healthcare, and we all remember what that was like.   Women could once again be charged more for coverage and have to get a  rider if they want to get maternity care coverage and prenatal care  coverage. Remember when being a woman was considered a preexisting  condition? I do. Members of my family do.   Families could once again face yearly or lifetime caps on care when  they need it the most, when you think about it.   If the Affordable Care Act is repealed through the courts, the  insurance companies would once again be able to say to your doctor: You  know, I don't think she really needs 10 cancer treatments or 12 cancer  treatments, so we will pay for 5. If addiction treatment or mental  health treatment is needed, they could say: I don't think you really  need to have more than two sessions if you are an addict. Come on.  Today, the doctor decides, with you, what you need in terms of number  of treatments, and that is the way it should be.   As I mentioned, nearly 700,000 people in my State are getting  healthcare through Healthy Michigan or Medicaid expansion, and they  could lose that. In fact, they will lose that.   Our uninsured rate has fallen from 12 percent before the Affordable  Care Act to 5 percent. So 12 percent of people were not insured at all,  and now it is 5 percent. I would call that a success. Is there more  that should be done? Yes. But that is positive, not negative.   The number of people without insurance who have been treated has  fallen by 50 percent in Michigan--50 percent. And that is great for all  of us. It is certainly great for hospitals that were treating people  without insurance before. Someone walks into the emergency room and  gets care in the most expensive way, and they don't have insurance.  What happens? Everybody else's insurance rates go up. That is what  happened. When people were able to get their own insurance coverage,  insurance rates went down. In fact, we had over $400 million in  Michigan that was put into the State government as a savings as a  result of not paying for people going to the emergency room without  insurance.   A record 97 percent of Michigan children can see a doctor now when  they get sick--97 percent. I would argue that is a great success, not  something to be taken away or something to play politics with.   Michigan seniors are saving money on their prescription drugs through  the Medicare Part D Program--something called the doughnut hole, the  gap in coverage that we closed.   More than half of our families in Michigan, which includes people  with preexisting conditions, are now able to get coverage. The  insurance companies can't say no, and they can't say: When you get  sick, you are going to be dropped. They can't deny you from getting the  coverage you need if you have a preexisting condition.   One of those people in Michigan is Heidi, who lives in Cedar Springs.  She wrote to me in May. I thank Heidi for doing that. Heidi had bought  health insurance for years and almost never needed it because she was  healthy. In fact, she only used it, she said, when she gave birth to  her daughter. That all changed in 2004 when Heidi was diagnosed with  breast cancer at the age of 45. She has since had multiple tests,  multiple surgeries, and multiple rounds of chemotherapy, all at least  partially covered by insurance.   Heidi wrote this:         My fear every day is that I won't have insurance if these       changes are made. There is no way any company would insure       me. My husband has a life insurance policy that he bought       before we were married. . . . We asked about me. The salesman       nicely said that I am not insurable. So my plan B is, if I       lose my health insurance, I will take that money and save it       for my funeral (since I can't even get a life insurance       policy for enough for a funeral).    Heidi added this:         I am lucky that I thought insurance was a good thing, and,       therefore, paid for it for years through my job.    Heidi depends on protections for people with preexisting conditions.  Heidi didn't ask to get breast cancer. It could happen to any of us.  Any day, something could happen to any of us or someone in our family.  And if you have or will have what is called a preexisting condition,  your health insurance will be taken away if this court case, supported  by President Trump, his administration, and Republicans, succeeds.   A couple of months ago, I spoke at the Detroit Race for the Cure,  which raises money for breast cancer research. It is a wonderful event.  We had a beautiful, sunny day. As I stood on the stage and looked out  over a crowd of over 10,000 people, mostly women and many wearing pink,  I saw women living with preexisting conditions. I saw people like  Heidi.   One woman who was standing on the stage near me asked me a question  that I will never forget: ``Why is it that I have to worry about  whether or not I will be able to get insurance in the future? Why?''  She added: ``Why don't President Trump and other Republicans understand  that this is my life? This is my life.'' It is a very good question. It  deserves an answer.   Why don't Republicans in Congress, why don't those 18 attorneys  general and Governors, and why doesn't President Trump believe that  people like Heidi deserve to have healthcare coverage? Why don't they  believe that seniors deserve access to more affordable prescription  drugs? Why don't they believe that women should pay the same for their  health insurance as men? Why don't they believe that young people  should be able to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26? And  why don't they believe that families, not insurance companies, should  make healthcare decisions? Families, with their doctors, should be  making health decisions, medical decisions, not an insurance company.  If this lawsuit succeeds, we are going to go right back to putting your  medical decisions in the hands of the insurance companies.   Healthcare isn't political; it is personal. It is time to stop  playing politics with people's health. For each of us, it is our life.   I yield the floor.
