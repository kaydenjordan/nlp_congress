 Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the ``West  Coast Ocean Protection Act.''   This important legislation would prohibit oil or gas drilling in  federal waters off the coast of California, Oregon, and Washington.   After four years of an Administration intent on allowing drilling off  the West Coast and in waters across the United States, I am hopeful we  will finally pass this bill to ensure no drilling ever occurs in  Pacific waters.   I'm pleased to be joined today by Senators Padilla, Wyden, Merkley,  Murray, Cantwell, Menendez, Booker, Markey, and Sanders in introducing  this bill, which has been introduced in every Congress since the  Deepwater Horizon disaster in April 2010.   11 people were killed and 17 others injured when the Deepwater  Horizon well blew out. Oil and gas spewed into the Gulf of Mexico for  87 days.   Oil slicks covered the Gulf. Tar balls and toxic sludge covered  beaches and wetlands. More than one-third of federal waters in the Gulf  were closed to fishing.   While the Deepwater Horizon disaster reminded the world of the  dangers of offshore drilling, Californians never had to be convinced;  before Deepwater Horizon and Exxon Valdez, there was the tragic 1969  oil spill in Santa Barbara.   A well blowout on an offshore rig spilled more than 3 million gallons  of crude oil according to some estimates--the worst spill in U.S.  history at the time.   The spill closed local beaches--which were covered by a thick layer  of oil--and thousands of marine mammals and birds were killed.   Tourists were turned away and commercial fishing operations were  halted, hurting the local economy.   After the Santa Barbara spill, California had enough. The State  blocked all new offshore drilling in state waters--which extend three  miles from the shore--and in 1994 enacted a permanent offshore drilling  ban.   Through local ordinances, congressional opposition, and presidential  moratoria, all new drilling in federal waters off California has been  blocked since 1984.   Today, opposition to offshore drilling is higher than ever. A 2018  poll found that nearly 70% of Californians oppose new drilling off our  coast. The evidence is quite clear: Californians do not want any more  drilling.   The California coast is an economic engine of growth for the state  and the nation. A 2015 report produced by the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration found that California's 19 coastal counties  created $662 billion in wages and $1.7 trillion in GDP in 2012.   Overall, California's ocean economy supports over 1 million jobs and  generates significant growth for the U.S. Because of the unique nature  of the West Coast ocean shelf, potential drilling would occur near the  coastline and directly threaten the environment and robust economy.   It is long past time to respect the view of California and our fellow  West Coast states by passing the ``West Coast Ocean Protection Act'' to  permanently ban offshore drilling and protect the Pacific coast for  generations to come.   I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Reed, Mr. Cardin,          Mr. Merkley, and Mr. Leahy):   S. 67. A bill to support efforts by international financial  institutions to provide a robust global response to the COVID-19  pandemic; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.
