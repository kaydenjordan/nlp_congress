 I rise today to pay tribute to my friend, neighbor,  mentor, and former Kentucky Commissioner of  [[Page H5904]]  Agriculture, J. Robert Miller. Robert passed away last night at the age  of 97.   J. Robert Miller was a legend in agriculture, agriculture education,  and Kentucky politics. He served as Kentucky's Commissioner of  Agriculture from 1957 to 1971 during the Louie Nunn administration.  Before that, J. Robert was an agriculture teacher at Tompkinsville High  School and always an active, lifelong farmer.   Growing up in 4-H and FFA, my earliest memories include Robert  Miller. He was a mainstay at Monroe County area livestock shows and FFA  banquets, always helping out and offering advice to present and future  farmers.   J. Robert Miller was a great man who had a positive influence on  countless Kentuckians                            ____________________
