 Mr. President, I am here this evening to commemorate  the passing of a remarkable individual. I only met her once when I went  over to speak at a gathering of the U.S. District Court for the  District of Columbia. But on March 16, at the age of 85, Her Honor  Judge Gladys Kessler passed away.   She had been quite a trailblazer before she went on the court. She  cofounded the Women's Legal Defense Fund, now known as the National  Partnership for Women & Families, and she served as the president of  the National Association of Women Judges.   In her career, she rendered a lot of very good decisions, but the  most memorable one and the one that exemplified some of the  characteristics I admired the most about her was the decision that she  rendered exposing in detail a conspiracy by the tobacco industry to  deceive the American public about the safety of tobacco.   The Big Tobacco scheme is one that we are, I think, pretty familiar  with. You pay a lot of phony-baloney for-hire scientists to produce  studies making false claims about your product, you hire a web of PR  experts and front groups to spread doubt and critique the actual real  science that you don't like, and you have paid intermediaries to  relentlessly attack and try to smear your opponents.   In the face of this behavior, we had a remedy: the Racketeer  Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the RICO Act.   In 1999, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil RICO lawsuit  against the major tobacco companies and their associated industry  groups alleging that the companies, and I will quote the complaint  here, ``engaged in and executed--and continue to engage in and  execute--a massive 50-year scheme to defraud the public, including  consumers of cigarettes, in violation of RICO.''   The case took 7 years, but in 2006, Judge Kessler wrote one of the  most impressive opinions I have ever seen from a U.S. district court  judge. It was 1,683 pages long. She went through the evidence that the  U.S. Department of Justice had marshaled, and she organized it and laid  it out in a way that was completely compelling, that completely crushed  the defendant tobacco companies, to the point where, when it was on  appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit very powerfully  upheld it. It is one of the powers of a district judge that, with the  authority to find the facts and marshal the evidence properly, you can  make virtually bomb-proof opinions, and in 1,683 pages, Judge Gladys  Kessler did just that. She found the defendant--here is her quote:         Defendants coordinated significant aspects of their public       relations, scientific, legal, and marketing activity in       furtherance of a shared objective--to . . . maximize industry       profits by preserving and expanding the market for cigarettes       through a scheme to deceive the public.    She added:         In short, [they] have marketed and sold their lethal       product with zeal, with deception, with a single-minded focus       on their financial success, and without regard for the human       tragedy or social costs that success exacted.    It was a testament--this opinion was--to judicial diligence, and it  left a permanent, solid record for history of the campaign of fraud  that the tobacco industry had run until that point.   Of course, in order for her to be able to render that decision, there  had to be a plaintiff willing to bring the case. So kudos also to the  U.S. Department of Justice back then for being willing to take on a  defendant as powerful as the tobacco industry. We forget, now that  smoking is so much less of a thing, how enormously powerful the tobacco  industry was, how its network of suppliers gave it footholds in every  State, how its enormous revenues allowed it to cut into this building  and manipulate the politics of the U.S. Congress to the great detriment  of the health of the American people.   It goes without saying that there is an obvious parallel between the  conduct of the tobacco industry leading up to Judge Kessler's decision  and the conduct of the fossil fuel industry.   In fact, experts point out that when Judge Kessler's decision shut  down the fraud of the tobacco industry, some of the individuals and  some of the organizations that had been involved in that fraud simply  rebooted themselves as new experts in how to deny climate science.   I hope that we come to a point where today's Department of Justice  has the diligence and the fortitude to go ahead with a similar action.  But today, this is about Judge Kessler--a woman who saw something going  very badly wrong and sat down and wrote a 1600-page decision to put it  right. I think it is a pretty terrific example.
