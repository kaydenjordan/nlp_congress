 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Prohibiting Punishment of Acquitted Conduct Act.  [[Page H3882]]  I thank Mr. Cohen for introducing this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, due process is more than an ideal. It is a fundamental  right enshrined in our law. The Constitution confirms that right and  explicitly ensures procedural fairness to those accused and convicted  of crimes. Yet, the criminal justice system often grants judges with  discretion to increase the length and severity of punishment based on  conduct for which an individual was proven not guilty.   We can all agree that holding criminals accountable is essential to  law and order. However, sentencing based on acquitted conduct is an  affront to all Americans' constitutional rights. The Prohibiting  Punishment of Acquitted Conduct Act will bring an end to this unfair  practice.   This bipartisan, bicameral legislation bars judges from considering  an individual's acquitted conduct during sentencing, except for  purposes of mitigating a sentence.   This bill is a crucial step toward restoring some fairness in our  criminal justice system and commands a broad coalition of support,  including Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, the ACLU,  Americans for Prosperity, and the American Conservative Union.   I thank both Chairman Nadler and Ranking Member Jordan for moving  this bill through the Judiciary Committee.   One last thing: Judges have a range of sentences in the sentencing  guidelines. Prosecutors, after conviction, make recommendations. There  is a pretrial sentencing report. Again, the sentencing can vary very  highly up and down in that vein. There is absolutely no reason, in the  interest of justice or fairness, where acquitted conduct needs to be  used in sentencing offenders.
