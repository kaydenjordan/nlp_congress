 Madam Speaker, there is an unprecedented crisis  at the southern border. Literally, hundreds of thousands of illegal  immigrants are crossing into the United States, stretching our patrol  officers and enforcement down there to a breaking point.   In February of this year, over 100,000 illegals were apprehended.  That is a 28 percent increase from the year before. And I guarantee  you, it is only going to get worse. The projections are even more than  that this coming month.   Illegal border crossings are now five times higher than before  President Biden was inaugurated. And this is all fueled by the ``open  border'' policies of this administration promising amnesty, ending the  wall construction, halting deportations, handcuffing our law  enforcement, and undermining border security.   President Trump gave President Biden a secure southern border, and in  [[Page H1525]]  less than 3 months, it has been dismantled. This is absolute insanity.    Madam Speaker, meanwhile, here in Washington,  the Democratic majority is cheerfully pushing more legislation to  incentivize more illegals coming here. We have this bill promoting  amnesty. We are literally exalting illegals in this country over those  who have waited years to become citizens.   Madam Speaker, this is not rocket science. The Democratic party knows  this is going to create a greater crisis, and they simply don't care.  It is time to stop fueling the crisis and start solving it.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''                                time  1415     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  California for yielding.   It is stunning to me that we are still wrestling through these type  of issues. We have been watching over the last few months one radical  piece of legislation after another and our country is beginning to  suffer. We are watching gas prices go up, skyrocketing. We are still  shutting businesses down. We are still seeing schools closed. We are  watching our energy independence be reversed.   Madam Speaker, it is one horrible bill, one horrible policy after  another. And now we are watching a catastrophe on our southern border,  and my friends on the other side of the aisle appear to not care what  is happening at the southern border.   We haven't honestly called it for what it is: a disaster.   We are not willing to look at the national security issues of it. We  are not willing to look at the danger that is occurring, the cartels,  the human trafficking, the drug trafficking, the criminals who,  perhaps, are coming across our border, the terrorists who may be coming  across our border.   And now what are we doing?   We are looking at another outrageous piece of legislation that says:  if you come work on a farm, we are going to give you amnesty. It  doesn't matter what your background. It doesn't matter who you are.   At the same time, we even have here around Capitol Hill fences  guarding us, guarding the American people from the people's House, but  we are going to open up our borders for who knows who to come marching  through.   Now we have a piece of legislation that says: just come work on a  farm and we are going to give you amnesty.   Madam Speaker, 1.5 million people are going to become citizens for  working minimal time on farms.   This is going to shield criminals. They are just going to come across  the border, claim amnesty, come work on a farm, and before long, they  are legal citizens here.   We don't know who these people are. We don't know what their  intentions are, but we are going to grant them amnesty through this  bill. It is nonsense. It is frightening. It is irresponsible. It is  endangering American lives. It is encouraging even more disaster and  danger on our southern border.   It makes absolutely zero sense for us to proceed with this type of  irresponsible legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote against  this.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
