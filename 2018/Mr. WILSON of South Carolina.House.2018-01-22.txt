 Mr. Speaker, this weekend, South  Carolinians saw the damaging impacts of the Schumer shutdown: 2,200  servicemembers in the South Carolina National Guard who had drill  scheduled were forced to go home after driving across the State from  all over the Southeast. I know firsthand of the disruption, as a Guard  veteran myself and grateful dad of three sons who have served in the  Guard overseas.   Additionally, 70 soldiers who were operating on Active Duty  Operational Support orders had their orders terminated and will no  longer have insurance or income as of today. Approximately 750 Federal  technicians who handle mechanics for the South Carolina National Guard  will be laid off today.   This is not only devastating to families, it will negatively impact  the readiness of our forces, which I recognize as chairman of the  Readiness Subcommittee. The Guard has 80 soldiers who were planning to  attend necessary training this weekend, but those drills have been  canceled, resulting in soldiers not being qualified or eligible for  promotion due to missing training.   This serves as a sad example of just the impact on the South Carolina  Guard members. Senate Democrats need to stop holding military funding  hostage.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
