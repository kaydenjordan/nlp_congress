 Could the Presiding Officer let me know when 60  seconds is up so the Senator from Alaska can have 60 seconds? And then  we can go on with the colloquy people have been waiting for.    Mr. President, this is what we just heard. The Senator  from Wisconsin asked unanimous consent that the Senate approve pay for  400,000 workers who are being forced to work without pay. No Republican  objects to the Senator from Wisconsin's idea, but the Democratic leader  does. That means the Democratic leader is saying to 53,000 TSA  employees who make about $40,000 a year that he objects on behalf of  the Democratic side to paying them while they are forced to work. He is  saying to 54,000 Customs and Border Protection agents that he objects  to paying them while they are forced to work.   Senator Johnson says that on the Republican side, we want to pay  42,000 Coast Guard employees who are forced to work and aren't getting  paid. The Democratic leader says he objects to that and to 14,000 air  traffic controllers, 16,000 Bureau of Prisons corrections officers, and  35,000 IRS employees. They are being forced to work. The Republicans  are saying pay them; the Democratic leader objects.
