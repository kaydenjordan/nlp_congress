 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Holmes Norton for  organizing this Special Order. I am grateful for the comments that she  has made.   To the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green), his passionate plea to see  Austin Tice freed was moving, and I am proud to associate myself with  many of his comments.   I rise today because Austin Tice has been in captivity for 2,647  days. Those have been 2,647 days of fear and anguish for his parents,  his friends, his classmates, and his community. They have also  represented 2,647 days of Austin's remarkable life and his  determination and his will to live despite his captivity.   Austin is a journalist with a deep sense of service. He is also a  veteran. Seven years ago, he traveled to Syria to report on the plight  of Syria's children. He wanted to shed light on the consequences of a  complex and unrelenting war on the youth of Syria. And in Syria, he was  abducted. It was that 2,647 days ago that he was abducted.   He remains held in Syria, and we have every reason to believe that  Austin is still alive. He is being held in  [[Page H8780]]  Syria. In September, I joined a letter sent by Republicans and  Democrats directly to the President of the United States. In that  letter, we called on the administration to use every diplomatic tool in  our toolbox to secure Austin's safe return home.                                time  2000    Austin's parents have been among his strongest advocates. They have  made countless trips to Washington, D.C., and across the Middle East  working to secure his release. They have been pillars of strength as  they have fought to bring their son home.   I had the opportunity and the honor to meet Marc when he was in  Washington, D.C.; and to see the tenacity and strength and devotion to  his child was awe inspiring. It also makes me understand how he could  be a parent to a young man who would go out and seek adventure and seek  truth and seek information as a journalist.   It is my hope that we can come together as a body to bring Austin  Tice home. I never met Austin Tice, but I am in awe of his story as an  adventurer, as a journalist, as a veteran, as someone who has traveled  the world seeking information and stories.   I have been compelled to take part in this event tonight, and I thank  my colleagues for their tireless efforts on behalf of Austin Tice,  their work to bring him home, their work to bring a voice to his story  and knowledge of his continued capture and detainment in Syria. I thank  them for their work, and I look forward to continuing, in small part,  to work with them where I am able, where I can be of aid to bring  information and light to Austin's story and to continue to be an  advocate to bring him home.   It is my hope that in some days we will be able, here on the House  floor, to celebrate the homecoming of an American, of a veteran, of a  journalist, of a man who sought to tell the story of children in Syria.
