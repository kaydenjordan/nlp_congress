 Mr. President, I was absent when the Senate voted on vote  No. 152 to confirm Executive Calendar No. 770, Derek Kan, of  California, to be Deputy Director of the Office of Management and  Budget. On vote No. 152, had I been present, I would have voted no on  the motion to confirm Mr. Kan.                            ____________________
