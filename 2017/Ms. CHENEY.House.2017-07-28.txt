 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 481 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 481         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3180) to       authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for       intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the       United States Government, the Community Management Account,       and the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability       System, and for other purposes. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. The amendment in the       nature of a substitute recommended by the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence now printed in the bill shall be       considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; and       (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions.

Sec. 3.  On any legislative day during the period from July       31, 2017, through September 4, 2017--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.

Sec. 5.

Sec. 6.  Each day during the period addressed by section 3       of this resolution shall not constitute a legislative day for       purposes of clause 7 of rule XIII.        Sec. 7.  Each day during the period addressed by section 3       of this resolution shall not constitute a calendar or       legislative day for purposes of clause 7(c)(1) of rule XXII.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution  481, which provides a closed rule for consideration of H.R. 3180, the  Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.   Mr. Speaker, there is nothing we do in this body that is more  important than actions we take for the defense of our Nation. We now  face a more complex array of threats than we have at any time since the  end of World War II.   North Korea continues to test ballistic missiles, has successfully  tested an ICBM, and is continuing to move rapidly towards achieving the  capability to strike U.S. soil.   A resurgent Russia is imposing its will across Europe, occupies  Crimea, and is now using its military to support the Assad regime in  Syria.   China is increasingly belligerent, continues to expand the size of  its military and create bases on artificial islands in the South China  Sea.   And Iran, Mr. Speaker, continues to work on its ballistic missile  program and expand its influence as it supports terror across the  Mediterranean and the larger Middle East.   Terrorist groups like al-Qaida and ISIS continue to carry out attacks  across the West and threaten the United States.   We have seen a dramatic increase in tensions on the Temple Mount, Mr.  Speaker, in just the last few weeks, and we have men and women in  uniform deployed around the globe fighting to defend our Nation.   Our intelligence community plays a crucial role in ensuring our  decision-makers and our warfighters have the information they need to  keep our Nation secure.   H.R. 3180 provides the intelligence community with the authorization  it needs to continue working to protect and defend the United States,  supports critical national security programs, such as those protecting  Americans against terrorism, cyber attacks, and hostile foreign  nations. The bill maintains critical congressional oversight of the  activities of the intelligence community, and the bill makes no changes  to any surveillance authorities, including those set to expire, which  we will take up later this year in legislation separate from this bill.   Mr. Speaker, as you know, earlier this week, H.R. 3180 was considered  under suspension of the rules, which is not at all uncommon for bills,  like this one, that receive unanimous bipartisan support in committee.   While the bill received well over 50 percent of the votes of the  House, it did not achieve the required two-thirds majority to pass  under suspension, which is why we are here today debating this rule.   A large portion of this bill, Mr. Speaker, is understandably, as it  should be, classified, which requires Members of this body to review  the bill in the SCIF.   I want to personally thank members of the Intelligence Committee and  their staff for facilitating that process and making it so easy for  Members of this House to undertake. A bipartisan notice was sent out,  provided to Members, informing us of the availability of the text for  review. And the text, Mr. Speaker, was available for 10 days, twice as  long as last year's bill.   My staff simply had to call and inform the committee that I would  like to review the bill, and the committee asked when I would be  available, and they made sure that a member of the committee staff was  also there to answer any questions I had.   The process itself was seamless, was very easy, and was facilitated  by the members of the Intelligence Committee staff.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good and important bill. It supports the men  and women in our intelligence community and the work they do to keep us  safe. This is not an issue we should politicize or subject to partisan  debate.   The intelligence community plays a critical role in the defense of  our Nation, and we need to support them, Mr. Speaker, by supporting  this bill. Therefore, I urge support for the rule to allow  consideration of H.R. 3180.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My colleague from Florida, with whom I have had the privilege of  spending many hours in the Rules Committee debating this and a range of  other issues, raised a number of points I think that are important to  clarify.   First of all on the issue of minority recruitment, last night, in the  Rules Committee, in open session, Chairman Nunes was asked about this,  and he testified very clearly and directly that diversity is very  important, that it is mission-critical for the reasons that my  colleague from Florida stated.    I can report that there are several provisions in the classified  annex--I won't go into the details about them--with which my colleague  may or may not be familiar that support the whole notion of Centers of  Academic Excellence, which are particularly focused on recruiting young  people, recruiting minorities and young people across the board for  service in the intelligence community.   We tend, in these rule discussions, Mr. Speaker, to have a lot of  arguments and criticism of procedure. The Democrats this morning seem  to be particularly concerned about our same-day authority. But I would  just note, Mr. Speaker, I am certainly confident that my constituents  who are watching this--and, I would say, probably most Americans  watching--would understand the importance of the House of  Representatives getting its work done in a timely manner. And  certainly, when it comes to healthcare, the arguments and the criticism  from the other side of the aisle lose a little bit of their credibility  when they simultaneously attack the Republicans for moving too slowly  and then also for moving too quickly.   What I can tell you is we are debating hugely important issues and  hugely important topics. We are absolutely committed to repealing and  replacing ObamaCare. It is a system that is collapsing. It is a system  that has devastated the lives of people across this country. It is a  system that has driven premiums and deductibles through the roof. It  has absolutely limited people's choice in terms of insurance plans, in  terms of healthcare providers. It is a system that is failing.   We have seen the Democrats' fundamental approach was a government  mandate and their attempt to force people across this Nation to buy  health insurance. They thought that, through a government mandate, they  would be able to force young people into these insurance pools and,  therefore, drive the cost down. That is not what happened. It didn't  work.   We know we have got to put in place a system that will be able to  provide people the kind of care that they need, access, as well as  lowering the cost and increasing availability. So there are a whole  range of very important substantive efforts going on.   I think that it is clear that the folks on the other side of the  aisle don't support the direction we are going in, may  [[Page H6530]]  not support the policy, but the people across this Nation--certainly,  in my home State of Wyoming--spoke very clearly last November that they  wanted a change, that they wanted to see the government reduce its role  in their lives, and that they wanted to see us begin the process of  building our military, rebuilding what has been lost over the course of  the last 8 years, as well as rebuilding the facilities and the  capabilities of our intelligence community, and that is exactly what  this bill does. That is exactly what we are here doing this morning.   Mr. Speaker, I think that is why it is so important that my  colleagues support this rule, that we provide the authority that the  intelligence community needs through this bill to continue to do its  important work to keep us safe.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 481 and the underlying bill, H.R. 3180,  ensure the men and women of our intelligence community have the tools  and the resources they need to continue the vital role they play in  helping us address the threats facing our Nation.   I do want to point out, Mr. Speaker, my colleague is accusing the  Republicans of being brazen and reckless because of our same-day  rulemaking authority. I would only note that in the 111th Congress,  when they were in the majority, they enacted this process 26 times; in  the 110th Congress, 17 times.   It is an important ability for us to have when we know we might need  to move quickly on something. As a member of the Rules Committee, I am  committed to ensuring we do everything possible to make sure that we  are able to bring bills to this floor that carry out the kind of  changes and improvements that the people of this Nation sent us all  here to undertake.   I was really disappointed, Mr. Speaker, earlier this week when this  bill was defeated under suspension of the rules. There are many things  that are partisan issues in this body, and it is too bad when the  minority uses the Intelligence Authorization bill as part of a  political stunt to make what should be a bipartisan process and a  bipartisan committee appear partisan.   The bill, H.R. 3108, received unanimous support in committee, and I  certainly hope today, Mr. Speaker, that the minority members of that  committee, and frankly all on the minority side who understand the  importance of the intelligence community in keeping our Nation safe,  will put aside the partisanship, will put aside the games that the  American people are so tired of, and will join me in supporting a good,  effective, and important bill, that, frankly, the minority members in  the Intelligence Committee worked very hard to help craft.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of both the rule and H.R. 3180.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
