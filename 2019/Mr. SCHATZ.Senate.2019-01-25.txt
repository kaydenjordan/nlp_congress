 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this morning the FAA grounded planes at  [[Page S670]]  LaGuardia Airport, averaging more than 1,000 flights a day. They made  this decision because of a shortage in air traffic control staff, who  are not being paid because the President fulfilled his promise to shut  down the government 35 days ago.   The FAA's website crashed as people looked for information. Stocks  for airlines took a hit, and air traffic in other airports, including  Philadelphia and Newark, were delayed because of staffing shortages. We  will continue to see the ripple effects of this today. It is not like  if travel in and out of LaGuardia is disrupted, it will be business as  usual at other airports. More flights will be delayed. LaGuardia has  resumed operations, but what is clear is that the ATC, or the air  traffic control staff, is thin, and they are making game-time  decisions--go, no go.   Apparently, we need another reminder that this shutdown is stupid and  dangerous, that it leaves communities and commerce on the edge, because  the voices of those affected already--Native Americans, Coast Guard  servicemembers, FBI agents, IRS employees, National Park Service  workers, and domestic violence victims--weren't enough. The FAA is  unique because they have an obligation and the authority under the law  to make a go-no-go decision based on safety. They can look at their  staffing numbers and say: We can't do this safely, so stop. But the FBI  and the Coast Guard don't get to say: Hey, hold off, everybody.   TSA agents and the TSA itself does not have the authority to make a  similar call. They can raise the alarm, but they do not have the  authority to stop people from coming through checkpoints. They just  have to make do. The same goes for all of the families affected by the  shutdown. There is no ``go-no-go'' decision. They just have to try to  make it work.   The FAA decision demonstrates what is happening throughout the  government and throughout society right now. People are right on the  edge. Some of them have fallen off that edge. Today, the shutdown  became an inconvenience to the very small percentage of Americans who  fly regularly, but, more importantly, today is an indicator of what is  happening to the government, of who matters to the government.   I certainly hope, as lots of pundits, and journalists, and  politicians have mentioned, that once air traffic starts to slow, once  airports get snarled, we are at the end of this process and the  shutdown will end shortly. I don't know if that is true, but I sure  hope it is true.   On another level, it should precipitate a little shame, a little  introspection about how we got here, because to fix this now, when  airports are snarled, is to say we were OK with people not getting food  stamps, we were OK with Native American health clinics running out of  medicine, Federal workers working without two paychecks, and Coast  Guard men and women deployed without paychecks, so long as the  President can build his wall. But if flights are delayed, if the elites  are imperiled or inconvenienced in any way at the all, game over, and  shame on us if that is what it takes to shut down this shutdown.   This entire time, as funding has run out for food banks and domestic  violence shelters, everyone has been focused on whether or not Speaker  Pelosi will win the State of the Union exchange with the President, and  what are the polling numbers, and how are Democrats and Republicans  positioning this, and will these polling drops matter in 2020?   But the moment the elite of this country have a moment of  inconvenience, this thing seems to be wrapping up, and shame on us.   Everyone is focused on this slow, horrible train wreck that they can  watch with some distance. Suddenly, air travel stops and everybody  freaks out. Shame on us. It is day 35. People have gone without-- without food, medicine, gas in their car, paychecks--but delayed  flights is the straw that breaks the camel's back.   This has to end. But it should never have even started. It shouldn't  have taken a day like this to be, possibly, maybe not the end, maybe  not the beginning but the beginning of the end of this shutdown.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today, we say farewell to a member of our  Senate family: Chad Schulken. For more than 16 years, Chad has served  the U.S. Senate as a professional staff member and, most recently,  clerk on the Appropriations Committee.   He started his career on the committee working for Senator Byrd in  2003 as staff of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and  Judiciary. He specialized in budgetary and policy matters affecting the  Department of Justice and the Federal judiciary, including the FBI,  DEA, ATF, and the U.S. Marshall Service. Two years later, when the  Appropriation Committee reorganized, he joined a newly formed  subcommittee responsible for Military Construction and Veterans Affairs  matters. As the lead staff handling the Department of Veterans Affairs,  Arlington National Cemetery, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans  Claims, the American Battle Monuments Commission, and the Armed Forces  Retirement Home, Chad was charged with developing, managing, and  negotiating the policy and funding priorities for the VA. Ultimately,  it was his job to make sure that Congress kept its promise to the men,  women, and the families who have served our country.   Chad has forgotten more about the resource and management needs of  the VA than most anyone working in government will ever know, so no one  was surprised when he was promoted to be the subcommittee's clerk in  2017. As the lead Democratic staffer, Chad negotiated and helped  develop the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs appropriations  bill. He helped me in my role as the subcommittee's ranking member. He  worked with Republican staff, stewarding the interests of all  Democratic Senate offices. He managed the bill across the Senate floor  and negotiated a final conference agreement with the House.   Chad has become one of the Senate's foremost experts on budgetary  policy and appropriations law. His mastery of Senate rules and  procedure have made him a formidable legislative tactician and  negotiator. His commitment to his work--to the unique collaborative  process that fulfills the Congress's constitutional duty to appropriate  taxpayer dollars--is clear in the many weekends and holidays he missed  with family and friends to be here to negotiate appropriations bills.  It is no wonder he left an impression on many Members, including those  he served directly: Senators Byrd, Inouye, Mikulski, Leahy, Hollings,  Feinstein, Johnson, Reed, Tester, and myself.   For his professionalism and commitment to our country and the people  who have served in our military, we owe a great deal to Chad for his  service in the U.S. Senate. We thank him and wish him well as he  embarks on a new adventure, one we hope will give him more time with  his family: his wife Jessica; three daughters Abi, Bella, and Hundley;  and his son Griffin. From all of us in our Senate family, I extend a  sincere thank you to Chad and his family.                            ____________________
