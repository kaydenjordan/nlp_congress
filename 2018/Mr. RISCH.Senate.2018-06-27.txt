 Mr. President, America's entrepreneurs are known to  strive to go above and beyond by producing uniquely high-quality goods  to better serve their local communities. Our Nation's small businesses  are often led by people who are not afraid to innovate and bring new  ideas to the marketplace. Many small businesses in my home State of  Idaho harness this creative spirit and are well known for their locally  sourced, all-natural products. Today, it is my distinct pleasure to  recognize a small business from Couer d'Alene, ID, that displays such  forward thinking in the food service industry. As chairman of the  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I am proud to  recognize Abi's Artisan Ice Cream as the Small Business of the Month  for June 2018. This family-owned and operated business is dedicated to  providing fresh, wholesome, and natural products to their customers.   Previously a healthcare consultant, Maren Scoggins founded Abi's as a  way  [[Page S4505]]  to bring together her love of cooking and her desire to bring happiness  to the lives of others. She named her ice cream shop after her daughter  Abigail. Better known as Abi, she can often be found in the shop's  kitchen sampling her mother's latest flavors. Abi, who has a peanut  allergy, inspired her mother to create a selection of flavors free of  nuts and legumes, to allow as many people as possible to enjoy her  creations.   In addition to being legume and nut-free, Maren wanted to provide ice  cream that customers loved without artificial flavors or preservatives.  Abi's is technically a specialty kitchen, as everything is made by hand  and on-site. The kitchen is open and customers are invited to observe  the process of how the ice cream is made. In pursuit of her goal for  all-natural, great-tasting ice cream, Maren works hard to ensure that  her creations can be enjoyed by all. By exclusively using natural and  in-season ingredients, customers are able to enjoy healthy and seasonal  ice cream. Maren is always experimenting with new and unique flavors  for the community to enjoy. While they have a selection of staple  flavors, Abi's also creates rotating seasonal flavors to ensure that  their customers always have the opportunity to try something new and  innovative. Whether it is their ``fan favorite'' malted vanilla with  coffee and chocolate chips or just a simple ice cream sandwich, her  customers always remain confident in Maren's all-natural recipe. In  each one of her creations, Maren prides herself on using as few  ingredients as possible and believes that the simplest recipes can be  the best tasting. As a result of their hard work and dedication, Abi's  Artisan Ice Cream was named a top 10 ice cream shop in Idaho by  OnlyInYourState.   Maren's ice cream shop is also heavily involved in the Coeur d'Alene  community. Aside from being locally owned and operated, the ice cream  shop works closely with the Coeur d'Alene Downtown Association to  organize and contribute to the annual Couer d'Alene street fair. In  addition, Maren's small business supports other local businesses in the  area by making a concerted effort to procure their ingredients from  local sources. Their ice cream can also be found around Coeur d'Alene  in several coffee shops and art galleries. Art from these galleries is  displayed on the walls of Abi's, and coffee from local coffee shops are  used in Abi's creations. This is a great example of a small business  having an integral role in the community and supporting other groups  and enterprises to create the best experience possible for their local  customers.   The State of Idaho is proud to be a home for creative small  businesses like Abi's Artisan Ice Cream. Through their commitment to  providing hand-crafted, flavorful ice cream, customers are able to  enjoy an excellent product, produced in their own community. Earlier  this year, Abi's celebrated its 2-year anniversary.   I would like to congratulate them on their achievement and extend my  sincerest congratulations to Maren, Abigail, and all of the employees  at Abi's Artisan Ice Cream. I wish you nothing but the best and I look  forward to watching your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
