 Mr. President, in a few minutes we will vote on the  Sanders amendment, which I support. As vice chairman of the Senate  Appropriations Committee, I have worked with the Republican leadership  and with Chairman Shelby in recent years to strike budget agreements  that resulted in parity between defense and nondefense spending. At the  same time, amid a national and international public health crisis, the  need to infuse more resources into public health, education, and  business development programs has never been greater.   I have heard from my Republican colleagues on the floor objecting to  the Sanders amendment. I would say to them that if they feel that  strongly--  [[Page S4371]]  this is not authorized--but if they feel that strongly, they should  tell their Republican leadership to allow the appropriations bill to  come up so they can actually vote on the Defense bill. Right now, this  is just idle chatter when they object to Senator Sanders' amendment,  and yet they are unwilling themselves to actually vote up or down on  the appropriations bill for not only the Department of Defense bill but  the other Departments. The Sanders amendment, after all, maintains full  support for the personnel needs of the Department of Defense, as well  as the critical medical research supported throughout the Department.  It would also take some of the Department's sweeping budget and reserve  it for underfunded domestic needs. This is long overdue.   I again call on my Republican colleagues to stop talking about the  money you want or don't want to spend. Tell the Republican leader to  allow the appropriations bills to come to the floor and vote up or  down.                           Remembering   John Lewis    Mr. President, on another issue, I have had such an incredibly heavy  heart since I heard Friday night my dear friend and hero, John Lewis  passed away. I stand here on the Senate floor today to talk about him.   When I got a call at our home in Vermont late that night, my wife, my  son, and I just sat there and talked about John for hours and cried. We  knew America lost a genuine hero--an unwavering lodestar who, over  decades of selfless activism and public service, drew us closer to our  ideals.   I remember when he invited me in to watch actually a sit-in by  Democratic Members in the House of Representatives when the Republican  Speaker had closed down the House for them to have votes. He saw me  outside, and I asked him what is going on, and he said: You are my  brother.   He took me by the arm, brought me in, and sat me down in the well of  the House to watch what was going on. I was always humbled and honored  to be called his brother, as he often did when we were together,  including an unforgettable visit he had with us in Vermont just last  year.   I have been thinking so much of what we can say, and there aren't  enough words--there certainly aren't--in paying tribute to a man whose  life was defined by the relentless and fearless pursuit of equality.  John bled, literally, and his bones were broken, literally, for the  causes of civil rights. He came to Congress bearing those scars--a  living, breathing reminder that our society's progress on racial  equality came through the sacrifices of heroes like him.   In Congress, John Lewis stood with equal moral clarity, serving as  its conscience and reminding us that our work to build a genuinely  equal and just society remains unfinished. His thundering words just  months ago echo even more loudly today. He said:         When you see something that is not right . . . you have a       moral obligation to say something. To do something. Our       children and their children will ask us, ``What did you do?''    That is a question all of us must ask ourselves.                        Voting Rights Advancement Act    Mr. President, there is one thing I am doing today that I want to  share with my fellow Senators and Americans. Today, I am reintroducing  the Voting Rights Advancement Act, and we are renaming it the John  Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   This is bipartisan legislation. It has 47 Senate cosponsors. It would  safeguard what John fought over a lifetime to achieve: equality at the  voting booth. The bill would restore the Voting Rights Act to end the  scourge of minority voter suppression.   Now, the House already passed a companion to the John Lewis Voting  Rights Advancement Act in December. Now let's do our part. We can't  claim to honor the life of John Lewis if we refuse to carry out his  life's work. Of course, if we stand in the way of that work, that would  be the wrong thing to do.   So I would urge my fellow Senators, join me in calling on Senator  McConnell to allow a vote up or down on the John Lewis Voting Rights  Advancement Act.   Let's do that for John, but let's not do it simply because it is  named after him but because it is precisely what John would do. And if  we have a moral compass, we should do it and take action to forge a  more perfect Union, protect our democracy, and above all, do what is  right.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the Congress, our States, and the  administration talk about ways to handle the immediate consequences of  COVIV-19. We must also talk about the aftermath, and Steve Case has  written a provocative op-ed about the future.   Those of us in Congress should read and discuss it It has to be  considered in future planning.   I ask unanimous consent that the text of this article be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, July 19, 2020]    There's No Going back to the Pre-Pandemic Economy--Congress Should                            Respond Accordingly                              (By Steve Case)         This week, Congress will likely take up the next steps in       the economic response to the covid-19 pandemic. If the       package is like previous efforts, it will focus on trying to       turn back the clock to February 2020: treating the economy as       if it were Sleeping Beauty, merely needing to be awakened to       be fully restored. This strategy is a mistake: Congress needs       to stop solely backing efforts to restore the old economic       reality and focus on how to develop a new one.        Most of the $1 trillion that Congress has put into business       support so far during the pandemic has been directed to       preserving existing firms through the Paycheck Protection       Program and the Main Street Relief Fund. Helping those       businesses and their workers is vital, but that alone won't       fuel the economic recovery the country needs.        The problem is that many of the businesses backed by PPP or       Main Street are going to wind up shutting down. Even when       they aren't facing a global pandemic or economic crisis,       about 100,000 small and medium-size businesses fail in the       United States every year. New businesses will be needed to       replace the ones that permanently close. Moreover, the       failure rate is likely to be higher, as many firms were on       the wrong side of trends--such as the move to online       shopping, convenient food delivery or watching streaming       content at home--that the pandemic lockdown has accelerated.        Another consideration: The protests stirred by the killing       of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody have made clear       how many Americans were left behind in the pre-coronavirus       economy; restoring the way things were before the virus hit       won't address these needs.        Here are three ways Congress can help launch a new, more       equitable era of entrepreneurship.        First: Make it easier for the earliest-stage start-ups to       receive PPP dollars and for all start-ups to access the Main       Street Relief Fund. PPP loans go to existing businesses to       maintain jobs but not to new businesses that want to create       them. Main Street loans go only to companies that are already       profitable; most start-ups are not. That approach is       backward: Studies show that nearly all net new job creation       comes from start-ups, not established businesses.        A PPP revision should allow start-ups to obtain loans based       on their plans to create jobs--with loan forgiveness granted       only if those jobs materialize. If they don't, the start-ups       should be required to repay the loans before any other       obligations. And the barrier in the Main Street lending       program that makes businesses ineligible for aid if they were       not profitable in 2019 should be removed.        Second, the government needs to be a counterweight to       private capital that exacerbates geographic disparities in       opportunity as the country responds to the crisis. The       pandemic is a devastating tragedy, but adversity tends to be       met by the creation of new industries and new businesses.       This crisis will stir innovations in medicine, goods and       services delivered at home, remote work and learning, and       more. Where will these new firms grow? If the decision is       left to the private sector alone, almost all of them will be       in three states: New York, California and Massachusetts,       which attract 75 percent of all venture capital.        Great ideas to respond to this crisis are spread widely       across the country--but capital is not. Business assistance       programs created by Congress should have a special focus on       getting startups off the ground in places that have lacked       venture capital backing in the past. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-      Minn.) and others have already proposed such legislation;       members of Congress from these neglected areas should insist       it is part of any Phase 4 bill.        Finally, lawmakers should step in to address unintended       inequalities of opportunity for female and minority       entrepreneurs caused by the earlier relief bills. Because       these programs fund only existing businesses, they reinforce       opportunity gaps. Communities with thriving businesses get       more PPP and Main Street aid; those that have lacked capital       to get businesses off the ground in the past see little help       now.        The solution would be for Congress to direct unused PPP       funds to start-ups led by female entrepreneurs and       entrepreneurs of color, creating opportunities where they       have not existed before. The Main Street Lending program       could be modified to extend special debt options to community       development groups and minority-focused accelerators to back       a new wave of startups founded by historically       underrepresented entrepreneurs.        There's no going back to the pre-pandemic U.S. economy. Too       much has changed; too many new needs exist. This is a rare       opportunity to break with the past and create a better       future. Congress should grab it.                            ____________________
