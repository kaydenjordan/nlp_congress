 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my  deep concern with the proposal put forward by my Republican colleagues  to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   Most Americans want to increase access to health care, lower costs,  and cover more Americans; but this bill, TrumpCare, will increase  costs, limit access, and cover fewer Americans.   This plan will cut Medicaid, which has helped literally tens of  thousands of people in my State--in the Granite State--access health  insurance for the first time.   It has increased treatment and recovery services for those struggling  with substance use disorder.   We, like many States across this country, are grappling with a heroin  epidemic. People are dying in my district from heroin overdoses and the  fatal synthetic fentanyl. For the first time, they have access to  health care. They have access to drug treatment. They have access to  recovery services. And yet this bill will pull the rug out from  underneath these Granite Staters and their families.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit  at the desk.    I am opposed in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment  to the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee.  If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as  amended.   Today, our country is in an era where appropriate ethics and conduct  by elected officials is of the utmost importance.   I think we can agree that many representatives and others in  government have failed to live up to the expectations of the American  people.   We all have immense responsibility to advocate for our constituents,  and it is so important that our work and the work of those in this  administration reflect our genuine desire to do well on the part of  those we represent.   I have heard from literally thousands of my constituents in New  Hampshire who are concerned about the President's reluctance to fully  give up control of his businesses, his refusal to publicly disclose his  tax returns, and the connections between Russia and those in his  campaign and the administration. This pattern of nondisclosure and  hidden interests in the administration could put our public welfare  and, indeed, our national security at stake.   Citizens must have all the legal tools at their disposal to push back  against improper ethics and crony capitalism at all levels of  government, including the highest levels of the Federal Government.   This also includes instances in which a business could face unfair  competition because conflicts of interest in government provide unfair  support to their competitors.   Unfortunately, the bill before us today makes it harder for those who  may have been wronged by established and well-funded interests to get a  fair shot in court.   My amendment simply states that nothing in this legislation shall be  construed to apply to any civil action related to ethics in government.  Private citizens trying to hold government officials to high ethical  standards should not have barriers like this legislation thrown in  their way.   Going forward, I hope that as Republicans and Democrats we can work  together to promote legislation and efforts that increase transparency  in government, rather than making it more difficult for citizens to  hold the government accountable.   I ask that my colleagues support this important motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
