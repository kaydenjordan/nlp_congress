 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory  of Victor McElhaney, the son of my friend, Oakland City Councilwoman  Lynette McElhaney, and his father, Clarence, and to offer my deepest  condolences on behalf of the 13th Congressional District.   Victor was tragically slain in a senseless act of gun violence early  Sunday morning in Los Angeles. He was killed in a robbery attempt while  heading home from a friend's house.   Victor was just 21 years old and a senior at the University of  Southern California's Thornton School of Music, where he was pursuing  his lifelong love of music. He was a talented drummer and was often  playing at jam sessions, displaying his musical genius.   Victor was a son of Oakland, and his passing is a loss for Oakland  and the entire East Bay community. My heart is heavy for Lynette and  her family and all those who loved and cared for Victor.   Victor was killed in Los Angeles, but his murder reflects the  epidemic of gun violence in my district and all around the country,  especially communities of color. Even before Victor's tragic passing,  combating gun violence in Oakland was a priority for his mother as a  city council member.   May God comfort Victor's family as we mourn his loss. May his spirit  lead and guide us in the work that we must do to end gun violence in  his memory.   May Victor's legacy live, and may he rest in peace.                            ____________________
