 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor manufacturers across  the First District of Nebraska.   Manufacturing is Nebraska's largest industry. According to the  National Association of Manufacturers, manufacturing accounts for 11.81  percent of the total output in Nebraska, employing 9.8 percent of our  workforce.   Across the First District, these manufacturers are creating jobs.  Nucor in Norfolk, Nebraska, produced 33.6 million tons of steel over  the last 50 years. Plattsmouth is home to the first creatine  manufacturer in the United States. Blazer Athletic fabricates sports  equipment in Columbus. Kawasaki makes train cars in Lincoln that ship  to Washington, D.C., and New York City. You should also know that  Fremont is producing rotisserie chickens and other products for Costco  stores across North America.   On behalf of the people of Nebraska's First Congressional District, I  extend our sincere thanks to all the manufacturers that are helping  make our communities a great place to live, work, and raise a family.  Keep up the great work.      Congratulating Northeast Community College on Its 50th Anniversary     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Northeast Community  College as they celebrate their 50th anniversary.   Our community college system plays a critical role in educating the  next generation of Nebraska's workforce, and Northeast Community  College is leading the way.   The college started with six buildings on its main campus on the edge  of Norfolk in 1973. Today, it boasts campuses in South Sioux City, West  Point, Norfolk, and O'Neill.   Under the leadership of President Leah Barrett, the college has been  making moves. A $22 million investment at the Acklie Family College  Farm is setting the college up to become a leader in veterinary  technology.   In the spring, Northeast announced the launch of a new agriculture- diesel mechanic apprenticeship program. This fall, the college broke  ground on a new facility in South Sioux City to add welding booths and  a CDL training building.   On behalf of the people of Nebraska's First Congressional District, I  extend our sincere congratulations to Northeast Community College on  five great decades.             Marking 90th Anniversary of Columbus Sales Pavilion     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Columbus Sales  Pavilion as they celebrate their 90th anniversary.   Founded by M.H. Vanburg in 1933, it is now owned by a fourth- generation family. In a day and age when people switch jobs frequently,  the sales pavilion has a local and loyal workforce with some employees  boasting over 30 years with their team.   Nebraska is the beef State, and sale barns like the Columbus Sales  Pavilion are not only critical to our community, but they are also at  the heart of our ag community.   I recently visited the Columbus Sales Pavilion during an auction. I  can tell you that the sales pavilion is more than a market. It is a  place of connection and community for producers across the area.   This doesn't happen by accident. It happens because the owners have  made it their stated mission to make Columbus a better place.   On behalf of the people of Nebraska's First Congressional District, I  extend our sincere congratulations to the Columbus Sales Pavilion on 90  great years.                  Celebrating 100 Years of Memorial Stadium     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of the most  iconic places in Nebraska: Memorial Stadium.   This fall, the Huskers are celebrating 100 years of the stadium.  Through these gates pass the greatest fans in college football. That  has been proven for the last century.   On game days, Memorial Stadium becomes the third largest city in  Nebraska, with more than 90,000 fans gathering at every home game.  Since 1962, we have sold out every single game. That is 390 consecutive  sellouts.  [[Page H4386]]    The love for Husker athletics was shown once again at Memorial  Stadium just weeks ago when 92,003 fans attended a Husker volleyball  match on Osborne Field, setting a world record for the most attended  women's sporting event.   Some of the greatest college football coaches of all time have called  plays at Memorial Stadium, like former Congressman Tom Osborne and Bob  Devaney. This season begins with the Matt Rhule era, and he got his  first win in the stadium last week.    Congratulations to the university. Go Big Red.                      Recognizing Bellevue Women's Club     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish the Bellevue Women's  Club a happy anniversary as they approach 100 years in service.   In 1924, the Bellevue Women's Club began serving their community. By  1929, they were already taking on big projects like helping start the  first Bellevue library and the city's first swimming pool.   Through their 100 years, this nonprofit has contributed their time  and money to some of Sarpy County's most significant organizations and  events, like the Arrows to Aerospace Parade, Habitat for Humanity, and  the Ronald McDonald House.   Their club members' support for a wide array of organizations in  Sarpy County is unmatched as they give back through the senior  community center, Books for Babies, and the Bellevue Food Pantry. The  scope of their work through the years is very impressive.   On behalf of Nebraska's First Congressional District, congratulations  to the Bellevue Women's Club on their first century, and here is to the  next.                            ____________________
