 Madam Speaker, each year during the week prior to  Thanksgiving, communities across the country come together to bring  awareness to the problems of hunger and homelessness.   Today, I want to recognize the Collin County organizations that work  to end hunger and homelessness throughout our community.   Today, there are 42 million Americans facing hunger on any given  night, and more than 194,000 people will sleep on the street.   While these numbers are sobering, we are incredibly grateful for  those in our community who work to ease the suffering of others,  organizations such as the Collin County Homeless Coalition, the Family  Promise of Collin County, North Texas Food Bank, Minnie's Food Pantry,  and Hope's Door New Beginning Center, Allen Community Outreach, and  many, many others who work year-round to take care of those less  fortunate.   Through these organizations, volunteers, businesses, and faith  communities come together to provide necessities like shelter and  nutritious meals. They go above and beyond to ensure those in need have  access to basic medical care and hygiene products and even provide  training and placement resources for those struggling with  homelessness.                            ____________________
