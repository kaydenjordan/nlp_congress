 Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of the fiscal  year 2022 NDAA. I would like to start by thanking Chairman Smith;  Ranking Member Rogers; and my colleague on the subcommittee, Mr.  Lamborn; and, of course, the House Armed Services staff who have worked  many long nights putting this NDAA together. The bill that is before  the House is a good bill, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.   The jurisdiction of the Readiness Subcommittee covers a broad range  of topics from civilian personnel, sustainment, and contested logistics  to military construction, energy safety and environmental policy. With  that in mind, I would just like to highlight some of the issues we have  dealt with.   Consistent with our work over the last 2 years, the readiness  provisions continue efforts to address the climate change challenges of  extreme weather and the necessity to reduce the greenhouse gas emitted  by the U.S. military--the largest single emitter in the world. We  require each installation to develop a master plan to do these things.   The health and safety of our servicemembers will always be a top  priority of the subcommittee. The bill elevates the department's focus  on safety by establishing the Joint Safety Council and requiring the  DOD to develop a plan for the establishment of a Mishap Investigation  Review Board to provide oversight and independent review of safety and  mishap investigations.   This mark continues the subcommittee's work to improve the conditions  for the servicemembers and their quality-of-life infrastructures, such  as military family housing, barracks, and child development centers.   We also step up the military's requirement to address the PFAS  contamination on and off bases.   The bill helps advance our military's near-term readiness goals and  drives the department to plan for and take action against long-term  threats.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the fiscal year 2022  NDAA.   Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of the fiscal year 2022  National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). I would like to start by  thanking Chairman Smith, Ranking Member Rogers, and the House Armed  Services Committee staff who have worked many long nights putting  together this year's NDAA. The bill that is before the House is a good  bill, and I encourage my colleagues to support its passage.   As the Chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee, I believe the bill  upholds our responsibility to provide congressional oversight of and  support to the sustainment, logistics, infrastructure, and readiness of  our military. I'd like to take a moment and thank my staff for their  tireless work--the Readiness Subcommittee staff, Jeanine Womble,  Melanie Harris, Jay Vallario, Wendell White, Ian Bennitt, Dave  Sienicki, and Sean Falvey, and my personal staff, Betsy Thompson,  Rebecca Wolf, and Scott Bohn. I am proud of the Readiness  Subcommittee's contribution to this year's bill, and I'd like to  highlight the following provisions.   Consistent with our work from the last two years, the Readiness  provisions in the NDAA continue efforts to address the climate change  challenges of extreme weather and the necessity to reduce the  greenhouse gases emitted by the U.S. military, the largest single  entity in the world. The bill:   Requires each military department to complete installation master  plans at two of their most at-risk installations within one year of  enactment;   Requires the Department to amend DOD building codes to require  consideration of microgrids with islanding capability as part of  planned new construction, and encourages the department to renegotiate  contracts related to existing on-installation renewable energy projects  to enhance installation resiliency during power disruptions;   Requires installation commanders to consult with local governments to  ensure installation master plans include outside the fence line  resiliency considerations;   Requires the Department to assess energy and water usage at existing  data centers and set conservation goals for new data centers; and   Requires the Department to include EV charging infrastructure needs  in their planning for new domestic military construction, and requires  the Department to adopt industry standard planning considerations in  the development and rollout of charging infrastructure at military  installations.   The bill also builds on efforts to address contested logistics  challenges involving near-peer competitors by strengthening operational  energy programs:   Requires the Department to create a working group of program  planners, energy staff, joint staff, and geographic combatant commands  to enhance integration of military department energy initiatives into  operational planning and platform development to combat contested  logistics challenges;   Requires the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy,  Installations, and Environment to report on alternative fuels and  mandates the conduct of a wholistic review of the associated  production, transportation, geopolitical, commercial, and research and  development of alternative energy; and   Requires the Secretary of Defense to designate a Combatant Command as  the agency responsible for global bulk fuel storage, delivery, and  distribution, and directs the so-designated Combatant Command to  conduct a strategy on the infrastructure and programs necessary to  optimally support global bulk fuel management of the Department of  Defense.   The FY22 NDAA also builds on the Committee's previous legislative and  oversight activities to address poor conditions in barracks, child  development centers and housing:   Requires the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Energy,  Installations, and Environment to report on and provide a list of  domestic facilities and average facility childcare wait list, assess  efforts to find solutions and reduce wait times, assess the extent to  which staffing availability impacts childcare availability, and assess  whether including childcare facilities in agreements for new private  housing would be an effective solution;   Requires the military departments to conduct safety inspections and  develop 10-year facility improvement plans for child development  centers; and   Requires the Department to place higher priority on the sustainment  of quality-of-life facilities such as barracks by setting aside a  percentage of infrastructure sustainment funds for that purpose.   Additionally, the bill builds on the committee's oversight activities  to address preventable training accidents and build a culture of safety  in the military departments:   Establishes a Joint Safety Council within the Office of the Deputy  Secretary of Defense that advises on all operational safety matters,  establishes safety standards, collects and analyzes safety data, and  develops safety priorities;   Addresses concerns about the quality and objectivity of the military  department's mishap investigations by directing the Deputy Secretary of  Defense to develop a plan for the establishment of a Mishap  Investigation Review  [[Page H4801]]  Board, which would provide oversight and independent review of mishap  investigations;   Requires the Secretaries of the Army and Marine Corps to develop a  plan to address the recommendations contained in GAO's recent report on  tactical vehicle mishaps; and   Requires the Secretary of Defense to review the risks, benefits, and  plans for enhancing the protections for combat uniforms in an effort to  protect service members from flash fires.   Furthermore, the bill continues efforts to address contamination  associated with per- and polyfluorinated compounds on and around  military installations:   Requires the Department of Defense to review current practices to  prevent or mitigate AFFF spills and promulgate best practices for spill  prevention and mitigation, enterprise wide;   Increases transparency and facilitates information-sharing with  defense communities impacted by PFAS contamination; and   Places a temporary moratorium on the incineration of PFAS- contaminated materials until DOD adopts and promulgates EPA interim  guidance for disposal.   The bill continues to build on efforts to support the Department of  Defense civilian workforce:   Requires the Secretary of Defense to provide a report detailing the  number of military, civilian, and contractor personnel assigned to or  employed by OSD over the past ten years, to assess whether the number  of civilian billets in OSD-Policy has kept pace with changes in the  organization's mission over time, and to provide a recommendation as to  whether an increase to OSD's statutory personnel caps is necessary to  ensure sufficient civilian staffing and enable corrective action for  any inappropriate contracting;   Prohibits changes to the size or function of the Naval Audit Service  until the Comptroller General completes a report on the operations of  the Naval Audit Service;   Requires the Secretary of Defense to develop a plan to address the  recommendations contained in the Comptroller General of the United  States report entitled ``Sexual Harassment and Assault: Guidance Needed  to Ensure Consistent Tracking, Response, and Training for Department of  Defense Civilians;'' and   Requires that the Secretary of Defense to establish relevant metrics,  collect and report on diversity statistics, and report on the status of  diversity and inclusion efforts among the civilian work force.   The bill also continues efforts to ensure modern weapons systems are  sustainable and affordable over time and to support our industrial  base:   Requires the Comptroller General to report on organic maintenance  capability and capacity within the F-35 program including depot  standup, technical data requirements, unique tooling, and contractor  assistance in depot standup; assess the potential to transition supply- chain management from a contractor-led to a government-led function,  and; assess key field-level maintenance challenges as well as  mitigating actions.   Requires the Comptroller General to provide annual reports in the  years 2022-2025 on the F-35 program sustainment system, including an  analysis of the sustainment strategy, an analysis of the Department's  ability to reduce costs toward affordability metrics, and an analysis  of the Department's efforts to provide oversight of key contractor-led  sustainment functions.   Requires the Secretary of Defense to initiate a pilot program to  develop a digital twin of the facilities and operations of at least one  government-owned and operated military depot that is not a shipyard.   Requires the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition,  Logistics, and Technology to review efforts to digitize field-level  maintenance for ground vehicles.   The FY22 NDAA supports the missions at Travis and Beale Air Force  Bases in my district, and I'm also pleased this NDAA includes a 2.7  percent pay raise for our troops. Additional provisions that I was  instrumental in securing include:   Requiring the Secretary of Defense to continue the FireGuard program,  where the National Guard assists in detecting and monitoring wildfires,  for at least the next five years;   Including bill language that adds transparency to the Civil Reserve  Air Fleet program, and that aligns requirements for charter  transportation of both Department of Defense personnel and cargo;   Prohibiting the use of open-air burn pits during overseas contingency  operations unless an exemption is issued by the President of The United  States for a particular location. Thirty days after an exemption is  granted, the President would be required to submit a report to Congress  detailing the location, size, duration, and need of the burn pit, the  number of personnel assigned to the location, and the personal  protective equipment or other methods that will be used by those  personnel to mitigate the health effects of said pit;   Directing the Department to pay fees associated with the transfer of  adopted dogs to the adoption agency or individual and directing the  inclusion of veterinary care and services into the Joint Trauma  Education and Training Directorate;   Including significant Facilities Sustainment, Restoration, and  Modernization (FSRM) projects on DOD's online listing of military  construction projects and MILCON contracting awards; and   Authorizing the Maritime Administrator to use appropriated funds to  purchase duplicate medals authorized under the Merchant Mariners of  World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act of 2020. This awards the  Congressional Gold Medal--one of our nation's highest honors--to the  Merchant Marine Veterans of World War II.   This bill helps advance our military's near-term readiness goals and  drives the Department to plan for and take action against long-term  threats, and with that, I urge my colleagues to support the FY22 NDAA.                                time  2130
