 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I  thank the gentleman for his work and the work of his committee.   I thank Congresswoman Karen Bass--I served with her in the State  assembly--for the work as we go forward.   Today marks 1 month since George Floyd was tragically killed. As we  all agree, Mr. Floyd, Pat Underwood, and countless others should be  alive today.   Republicans have listened closely to calls for justice, and we have  responded proactively. Leading our response has been Senator Tim Scott  and Congressman Pete Stauber.   We could not ask for a better pair to work on this important issue: a  Black Senator who has personally experienced racial discrimination and  a retired law enforcement officer, wounded on the job, for more than 23  years with the State of Minnesota, who now serves in the House.   Their thoughtful efforts have produced something that is too rare in  this town: a bill that actually tries to solve a problem, not just  score political points.   It is truly a bipartisan plan, with over 80 percent of the policies  in the bill supported by Democrats. It builds on previous Republican- led civil rights efforts, such as in the majority when we did criminal  justice reform, opportunity zones, and school choice. In fact, it could  be on its way to becoming law today in a more sensible environment. It  would pass on the merits with overwhelmingly bipartisan support.   But we don't live in sensible times. When I looked George Floyd's  brother in the eye and told him that George will not have died in vain,  I meant it.   To those on the other side of the aisle, I believe you meant it, too,  but there are questions that arise:   Did you work in good faith across the aisle or did you choose to go  it alone?   Did you choose to make a point rather than make a difference, all  while putting politics before people and slandering Republicans in the  process?   First, you dismissed the JUSTICE Act as ineffective before one single  word was read. I never once said that the Democrat bill was a  nonstarter, not once. I was asked at a press conference to name one  thing that I oppose. I went back to the reporter and said, no, I will  not, because this is a moment in time the country expects us to rise to  the occasion. I am not going to point to something that I disagree with  because I believe we can get to the point together.   I had hoped that on this floor we probably would be debating  amendments. Not one single amendment was allowed. Not one single  amendment was allowed.   I listened to the Democrats on the other side because they are in the  position the Republicans are here in the minority. They were offered 20  amendments, but they felt they shouldn't go forward--not to vote on the  bill, but not even to debate it. Would it be too much to offer the  minority one vote to do a bill together?   Then you tried to diminish its author. One Senate Democrat who is  White went so far as to say on the floor of the Senate that Senator  Scott, a Black Republican, was taking the token approach.   I don't know if you have ever served with Tim, but there is no one  who has higher character than the man I know.   I don't know what it is like to walk in other people's lives, but Tim  is a good friend. He has told me the stories. Tim did not start working  on this bill a month ago. He has been working on it his entire life,  like others, as well.   Tim did not ask to do the bill on the Senate side with no input from  the other side of the aisle. Tim offered amendments and others, but it  can't even move the bill forward.   Now you are defaming its supporters saying, as Speaker Pelosi  absurdly claims, that we are trying to get away with murder, the murder  of George Floyd. She knows she should have apologized, but she doubled  down on her remarks yesterday. That was a very sad state of affairs.   Think for one moment. The Speaker of the House is second in line to  the President of the United States. That job is too big for words so  small, especially in this moment and in this opportunity.   So much for meeting the moment and working together to solve a  problem. We have reached a new low in this body, and it is not one that  I want to be a part of.   Democrats in the Senate had the opportunity to add 20 amendments to  address their concerns about the JUSTICE Act, but they chose to walk  away. Meanwhile, Democrats in the House haven't given the Republicans  the opportunity to offer a single amendment on the floor.   I have been in the position of being a majority leader. I understand  you let a few make a decision, but I do not believe it is the will of  the other side of the aisle to shut out voices on this side. I do not  believe that you think you have all the answers or are afraid to even  have a debate when you know this is an issue that all of America on the  streets is rising up and wants to have a voice heard.   I don't understand why anybody is afraid to have amendments. We  didn't stop participating even though we had been shut out. We have  been to every hearing. We have been to every place. We want to make  law. We don't want to make politics. I think our country deserves more.   Worse yet, Democrats are now trying to distract from the party's  failures in governing major American cities. You are complicit in the  chaos and its consequences.   While you stall serious reform, your allies in the leftwing mob are  engaging in looting, destruction, and violence, attacking people,  property, and public monuments to American heroes.   The latest incident, I guarantee you, will not be the last. It was in  the city of Madison, Wisconsin, not a Republican stronghold, but a  Democrat, for decades. There, local officials stood by as a mob tore  down several statues that are publicly owned and entirely unoffensive.    The first statue they tore down was of Lady Forward, a symbol of  progress in the women's suffrage movement. Next, they tore down a  statue of Hans Christian Heg, an abolitionist who died fighting to end  slavery during the Civil War.   But it wasn't just statues they attacked that night. The mob also  assaulted a sitting State senator, a self-described supporter of the  protestors.  [[Page H2483]]    This lawless and unjustified violence must be stopped. But their own  Wisconsin Lieutenant Governor seemed too surprised by the attacks to do  anything about them. Their fatal mistake is to assume that Democrats  will be safe because, as the Lieutenant Governor said, they are on the  ``proper'' side.   But here is the reality: Mobs don't care about your political  affiliation. Mobs won't draw any lines because they can't draw any  lines because they are mobs. They don't want peace, justice, or reform.  They want destruction, upheaval, and, most of all, control over you,  over others, and over our past, present, and future.   In this country, no one is above the law no matter how proper the  coastal elites or mainstream media deem their cause. As elected  officials, it is our responsibility to condemn these acts with passion,  force, and moral clarity.   It doesn't just happen in Wisconsin. It happens in California. It  happens in the Speaker's district.   Just a few short years ago, the Pope spoke from these Chambers. As he  left, the leadership stopped at Saint Serra and prayed together. There  was a statue in San Francisco that the mob tore down. I am not sure,  but I have not seen any comments from the individual who represents  that district.   In fact, their so-called solutions, such as dismantling and defunding  police would only make the problem worse, especially for our vulnerable  communities. By giving their leftwing allies a pass, the Democrats are  giving the mob more power, more license, and more ambition. That is a  recipe not for justice, but for more chaos.   Mr. Speaker, Abraham Lincoln knew riots, mob rule, and defunding the  police present serious threats to the American way of life. As a young  man, he warned that ``lawlessness in spirit'' quickly becomes  ``lawlessness in practice.'' He knew, if it was proper and you ignored  it, it would become a practice.   Today, we are witnessing the situation that Lincoln feared: a war on  civil society that is quickly escalating. We must summon the courage to  protect law-abiding citizens against lawlessness.   Our choice is clear: civil society or chaos. Those are our only  options.   Republicans know which side we stand on. We will stand up, hold the  line, and fight until the mob is stopped. Enough is enough.   Today, on this floor, 1 month ago, I thought we would show the  country that we are worthy of the office they let us serve in. We may  be of different parties. I am proud of mine. You see, I was not born  into the Republican Party. I came from a party of Democrats.   In my office, I keep portraits. I keep a portrait of Abraham Lincoln,  the first Republican President. I love what he stood for. I love what  he stood against. Malice towards none.   I wonder what this Nation would be had he not been assassinated?  Would we ever have had Jim Crow laws or the KKK? Would we even be  standing here today? But I think George Floyd would be, and so would  Pat Underwood.   In my office, in my chambers, I have Frederick Douglass as my newest  portrait, a man born into slavery, worked his way out. Even though he  had every reason to criticize this Nation, he loved it for its bruises,  its sores, and all because he believed in a more perfect Union, adviser  to a President and believing tomorrow would be better than today.   Inside my conference room, I keep a very big portrait of Washington  crossing the Delaware. If the mob was allowed in, they would probably  tear it down. You see, that portrait is painted not by an American, but  by an immigrant who lived here because America is more than a country.  America is an idea, an idea about liberty and freedom. And he thought  if he painted this painting, he would inspire others to believe in the  freedom that we stand for.   He gets it historically incorrect. He puts Washington in a rowboat  with 13 people, but he only shows you 12 faces. You look at Washington.  He is in his ceremonial uniform with his hand on his chest, bigger than  life. You think that man had never lost a battle, but history told us  he had not won one yet.   See, that was the night we surprised the Hessians with our first  victory. But if you look at the portrait and see who is in it, you look  at the second rower, it is a Black American. The one next to him is  Scottish. You come down, and the woman in the very back is a Native  American.   I do not know if they were in the boat that night, but to this young  immigrant, that is who he believed, having lived in America, would be  there.   To the back you see this man, a farmer, with his hand across his  face. The hand of the 13th person nobody sees. You see, to this young  artist, he said here we are not even a nation but an idea, an idea  based upon that we are all equal.   Having never won a battle, we are willing to risk everything, where  people would say on the holiest of nights, of Christmas: We will go to  a challenge in a rough water and cross that we have never won before.  Here is a hand. Would you get in and join us?   That is as true today as it was then. You see, in that portrait, they  didn't say only one party to join; they wanted all. They didn't say one  had all the ideas; they said we were collective. And they were willing  to do things they hadn't done before. They knew they were not perfect,  but they strived to become a more perfect Union.   I had hoped that that is what we would see today. Today, that will  not be the answer, but that can also not be the end. I would hope both  of us would rise up on both sides and ask us to go to conference.   Let's not miss this window of opportunity to show that we are worthy  of the cause we strive and the responsibility people give us. Let's not  call each other names of murderers and others. Let's believe in the  goodness of one another, and let's understand that we can solve this  problem once and for all.                                time  1815
