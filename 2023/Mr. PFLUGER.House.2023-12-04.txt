 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 992 to officially  designate the Texas and New Mexico portions of the future Interstate- designated segments of the Ports-to-Plains Corridor as Interstate Route  27.   The Ports-to-Plains Corridor is a significant north-south  transportation corridor that will unlock transportation capabilities  for the energy industry in the Permian Basin and enhance Texas' key  economic engines of international trade, energy, and the largest  agricultural production in the country.   This is a big deal for this part of the United States, specifically  for Texas. Madam Speaker, when you think about energy security being  national security, Interstate 27 is going to play a massive role in  allowing the delivery of that energy not just to our country but also  throughout the rest of the world.                                time  1515    In addition, food security is national security, and Interstate 27  will play a massive role in allowing the delivery of food to our own  country.   This new designation literally paves the way for safer roads in West  Texas, and clearly marks Midland and Odessa as the energy hub of our  Nation.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Jodey Arrington and Senator Ted  [[Page H6086]]  Cruz for their hard work and partnership on this important issue. I  encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  legislation to make sure that we can continue to deliver energy and  food throughout the United States.
