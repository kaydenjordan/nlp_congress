 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, tragic flooding continues to devastate  [[Page S3875]]  Eastern Kentucky. In the last few days, I have spoken to State  legislators and county judge-executives who represent our hardest hit  counties.   The Governor reports that Knott County has seen the largest loss of  life so far. County Judge Dobson tells me the toll may keep rising in  the coming days.   State Representative Chris Fugate represents Breathitt, Owsley, and  Perry Counties. He tells me he is housing about 85 people in his  church. And the need for shelter for displaced residents will only  grow.   State Senator Johnnie Turner represents five counties, including  Knott and Letcher. He plans to use his own equipment to help clear  debris from the roads.   All across Eastern Kentucky, emergency crews are making a herculean  effort to restore access to power, roads, and running water. The  Kentucky National Guard has been on the ground and in the air since the  outset of this emergency, performing breathtaking rescues and rendering  aid.   Some of their amazing work was captured on video. Residents stranded  on the roofs of submerged houses were pulled hundreds of feet into the  air on a cable and into a helicopter--just extraordinary work.   I am deeply grateful for the brave men and women of the Kentucky  National Guard and their service to our State.   As professional first responders work around the clock, families,  friends, and neighbors are stepping up as well. One man's actions have  attracted national attention. On Thursday, an anonymous neighbor helped  a family of three escape their flooded home. Video footage showed a 98- year-old grandmother sitting on a bed fully submerged in water. This  anonymous rescuer whisked that woman, her son, and her grandson to  safety. All three are now recovering.   Federal, State, and local officials will continue to do everything  possible and coordinate rescue and relief efforts. All these courageous  acts from professionals and ordinary Kentuckians alike will continue to  provide a hopeful glimmer of humanity in this dark, dark disaster.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on an entirely different matter  today, the Senate will approve ratification protocols to welcome  Finland and Sweden as the two newest members of NATO.    I appreciate Leader Schumer working with me to ensure the Senate  takes this vote before the August recess. And for the reasons I have  explained for months now, the vote this afternoon will be as decisive-- as decisive--as it is bipartisan.   There is just no question that admitting these robust democratic  countries, with modern economies and capable, interoperable militaries,  will only strengthen the most successful military alive in human  history.   Both countries already participate in NATO and American-led missions.  Finland already meets NATO's 2 percent spending target, and Sweden is  making significant investments in modernizing its military.   Even with the capabilities these militaries already have, they will  bring meaningful, interoperable military capabilities into the alliance  on day 1 and improve burden-sharing across the alliance.   There is also no question that their entry is specifically in our  interest. These are longstanding defense partners of the United States.  The Finns have been flying F-18s and buying sophisticated American  munitions since the 1990s. The Swedish defense industry cooperates  closely with ours and incorporates American components into modern  systems like their fighter aircraft.   Even closer cooperation with these partners will help us counter  Russia and China. Their accession will make NATO stronger and America  more secure.   If any Senator is looking for a defensible excuse to vote no, I wish  them good luck. This is a slam dunk for national security that deserves  unanimous bipartisan support.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on one final matter, Democrats want  to pass huge, job-killing tax hikes in the middle of a recession that  they themselves created--hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes  on American jobs, American manufacturing, American electricity, and  American investment.   Nonpartisan experts have proven these tax hikes will break President  Biden's promise not to raise taxes on the middle class. The working  class and the middle class will shoulder huge--huge--new burdens.   And all these tax hikes would buy American families no relief  whatsoever from inflation. Nonpartisan experts say Democrats' bill  would make inflation actually even worse until 2024 and then do  basically nothing--nothing--to inflation thereafter. In the teeth of  the inflation crisis, Democrats' bill would make inflation even worse  over the next 2 years.   Even the most optimistic estimate, the best figures for Democrats,  say it would take their legislation--listen to this--9 years--9 years-- to unwind as much inflation as the country added every week in the  month of June--9 years of runaway taxing and spending in order to  subtract 1 week's worth of inflation. And that is an optimistic  projection.   Obviously, the point of this bill is not to reduce inflation.  Clearly, this taxing-and-spending spree has a different purpose. And  when you look at the legislation, the real purpose is absolutely clear:  This bill is a massive goodie bag of far-left environmental activists  at the expense of working families.   Democrats want to use their own inflation as a pretext to dump  hundreds of billions of dollars into Green New Deal nonsense. This bill  declares war on American energy independence and affordability. It will  push working families' bills higher in order to send cash kickbacks to  rich elites if they buy fancy cars and redo their kitchens.   Democrats literally want to increase working families' gas bill,  electricity bill, and heating bill so they can send rebates to rich  people who buy $80,000 luxury electric cars.   I am not making this up. They have come up with a huge new tax on  American natural gas, which millions of Americans use to heat their  homes, cook their food, and dry their clothes. On top of that, natural  gas is the Nation's largest source of electricity. So Democrats want to  add new taxes on top of two of the major bills that millions of  American working families pay every month.   That is not all. There is also a new per-barrel tax on American oil  and new royalties and fees to drive up the cost of oil and gas  production on Federal lands.   With all the money they collect from shaking down American families,  Democrats want to finance new credits for people who can afford to buy  fancy new cars, stoves, and clothes dryers. Why? Because that is really  ``green''--subsidizing retail therapy for liberal elites to rip out  working appliances, throw them away, and replace them with the latest  fashions.   We have the worst inflation in 40 years right now. Working families  can barely afford gas and groceries right now. And Democrats' answer is  to offer them a mail-in rebate if they buy an $80,000 car or remodel  their kitchen? A specific subsidy for electric car buyers that the  senior Senator from West Virginia once called ludicrous is in this bill  which he has now authored.   Oh, and the bill tries to skirt a Supreme Court victory that West  Virginia just won to stop Democrats' illegal regulations from crushing  the State's economy. The legislation intentionally--intentionally-- flouts the victory that people of West Virginia just won a few weeks  ago at the Supreme Court.   There are billions of dollars for environmental and climate justice  block grants to directly enrich far-left nonprofits, including explicit  language that would send taxpayer funding to political activism.   Democrats literally want to raise your electric bill in order to pay  off their own protesters. I guess the people who stand in the middle of  highways during rush hour to make some protest gesture now want to  receive taxpayer money for their trouble. Oh--oh--and their bill would  send billions of dollars to the Secretary of Transportation to tear up  highways instead of building more highways.  [[Page S3876]]    If that is not enough, here is the kicker. All of this expensive  nonsense adds up to no--no--meaningful impact whatsoever. All of these  hundreds of billions of dollars to bankroll new appliances for rich  people will not put so much as a dent--a dent--in worldwide emissions  or temperatures.   The Washington Post admitted on Monday this legislation ``can  scarcely be expected to have an immediate, measurable impact on the  warming planet.''   Huge developing countries like China and India are dramatically  increasing their emissions every year. Even according to liberals' own  modeling, this bill that is supposedly worth looting--looting--the  American people would have basically no measurable impact on global  warming whatsoever.   Liberal waste, subsidies for the rich, and, according to their very  own models, no meaningful impact on the climate--I guess Democrats  think their 30 percent approval rating on the economy is actually still  too high.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate this  year's winners of the Congressional Award. Established by Congress in  1979, the award recognizes the achievements of young Americans between  the ages of 14 and 23 years old and celebrates their accomplishment in  four program areas: voluntary public service, personal development,  physical fitness, and expedition/exploration.   The award challenges participants to set goals in an area that  interests them, encourages them to pursue new interests, and helps them  grow along the way. If they are successful in their pursuit, they earn  bronze, silver, and gold certificates and medals. Through this long- running program, generations of young Americans have learned new  skills, earned greater confidence, and positioned themselves for future  success.   On Friday, August 5, Gold Medal recipients will gather for a virtual  ceremony to receive their Congressional Award. On behalf of the U.S.  Senate, I would like to congratulate all of the winners for their  accomplishments and for the example they set for their peers. Among  this impressive group, my State of Kentucky is home to nine gold  medalists.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of this year's  recipients of the Congressional Award Gold Medal be printed in the  Record.
