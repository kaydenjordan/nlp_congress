 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 635.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on nominations, in a few moments, we are  going to begin confirming a slew of nominees to serve in the Biden  administration that, up until now, have been needlessly obstructed by a  handful--just a handful--of Senate Republicans. But under the rules,  they can do that.   Confirming these nominees is one of the most basic constitutional  responsibilities of the U.S. Senate. It is bigger than the interests of  any one Senator. It is about ensuring our government is able to  effectively serve the American people here at home and advance the  American interests overseas.   For decades, both sides--both sides--have understood that each  President, regardless of party, deserves to have their administration  filled, and we have worked together to make that happen, particularly  for noncontroversial and less senior nominees. But today's blockade is  a beast of a different nature.   Right now, over 150--150--of President Biden's nominees are stalled  by a handful of Republican Senators who have hijacked the rules of the  Senate for no other reason than obstruction for its own sake. Many  received bipartisan support in committee.   These aren't low-priority nominees--whatever that means. Many of  these men and women would deal with matters of diplomacy and national  security. That is what Republicans are blocking. Some of them would  help implement the bipartisan infrastructure bill. That is what  Republicans are blocking.   From fighting inflation to relieving supply chains, to advancing U.S.  national security, many of the men and women who are nominated would be  the ones who would actually do this work. Let me repeat that. For all  the howling and hollering we hear from Republicans about inflation,  national security, and economic recovery, they are blocking the very  same people whose jobs it would be to tackle these issues. It is  ``Alice in Wonderland'' logic.   There are no justifications for their delay--none. Listening to the  other side twist themselves into pretzels, it is clear that their game  is simple, cynical, self-interested obstruction. And I thank my  colleagues on this side of the aisle for coming to the floor day after  day to shine a spotlight on the real-world impact of Republicans'  obstruction.   This is the consequence of Republican obstruction. We are going to  keep voting in this Chamber as we work to get these nominees confirmed.    Madam President, just after the clock struck 12  midnight, we have a wonderful announcement: Senator Leahy has just cast  his 17,000th vote.   (Applause, Senators rising.)   Madam President, I would note one more thing. Robert C. Byrd is the  only Senator who has cast more votes than Senator Leahy in the history  of the United States.  [[Page S9295]]    (Applause.)   So we will have a 2-hour recess to celebrate. No, we are not doing  that.   (Laughter.)    Madam President, for the information of the Senators, I  am going to read a list of UCs for Ambassadors. Then we will have three  votes, one on an ambassador and two on cloture for court of appeals  judges.   So, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be  determined by the majority leader, following consultation with the  Republican leader, no later than January 14, 2022, the Senate proceed  to the consideration of S. 3436 introduced earlier today by Senator  Cruz; that there be 2 hours of debate, equally divided between the two  leaders or their designees on the bill; that upon the use or yielding  back of that time, the bill be considered read a third time and the  Senate vote on passage of the Cruz bill, with 60-affirmative votes  required for passage, with no amendments in order and without  intervening action or debate; further, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, if applicable, that PN605 Elizabeth  Rosenberg to be Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing, Department  of Treasury, be discharged from the Banking Committee and the Senate  consider the following nominations en bloc: Executive Calendar Nos.  233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 318, 319, 403, 431, 432, 433, 434,  435, 436, 439, 448, 449, 450, 455, 516, 517, 518, 520, 522, 523, 524,  617, 618, 620, 621, 623, 624, 625, and PN605; that the Senate vote on  the nominations en bloc without intervening action or debate; that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate; that any statements related to the  nominations be printed in the Record; and, finally, I ask unanimous  consent that the bill in the agreement be placed on the Calendar of  Business.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw all  of the filed cloture motions, with the exception of the Sanchez and  Thomas nominations; that the Senate proceed to the consideration of  Calendar Nos. 519, 526, 446, 442, 454, 447, 440, 323, 317, and 320, en  bloc, and that the Senate vote on the nominations in the order listed;  that upon disposition of the Gifford nomination, the Senate vote on the  cloture motions on the Sanchez and Thomas nominations; further, that if  cloture is invoked, all postcloture time be considered expired and the  Senate vote on confirmation of the Sanchez nomination at 5:30 p.m. on  Monday, January 3, and on confirmation of the Thomas nomination at a  time to be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the  Republican leader; further, that if any of the nominations are  confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  actions.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that with  respect to the previous order, the remaining nominations be considered  en bloc.   I further ask that the mandatory quorum call with respect to the  cloture vote on the Thomas nomination be waived.    Now, Madam President, it has been a long day of voting.  We are not quite done yet, but we are close.   At the end of the day, we will have invoked cloture on 2 circuit  judges, confirmed 9 district court judges, confirmed 41 Ambassadors,  and confirmed 5 other members of President Biden's team. It has been a  long day but a good day's work. I thank my colleagues.                            ____________________
