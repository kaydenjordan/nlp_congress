 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the urgent need to stand  up for democracy at home and abroad.   Yesterday, Members of Congress heard from our Secretary of State, our  Secretary of Defense, and other senior leaders from the administration  on the dire situation in Ukraine and Israel.   While they said the right things, the sense of urgency, the sense of  passion is missing from all of this right now. It is missing from this  debate, Mr. Speaker.   If we leave next week for the holidays with inaction, Russian will  win, and we will begin to hand over Ukraine to Russia and Vladimir  Putin.   Mr. Speaker, the world is watching the actions of this Chamber right  now in the next 10 days, and the silence is deafening.   Let's be clear: Both Russia and Hamas seek to destroy democracy, and  we must stand with our allies and pass a supplemental aid package now.   Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about Ukraine. Right now, we risk Ukraine  literally running out of bullets if we go 10 days with inaction here in  Congress.   If we do nothing by the end of the month, Russia will begin to win in  Ukraine. If we abandon Ukraine, Russia will win.   We need to be clear: The silence and inaction we are seeing play out  here on the floor of the House means strong support for Russia and  their invasion of Ukraine. That is the choice we are making by doing  nothing.   Mr. Speaker, Ronald Reagan is rolling over in his grave right now as  he watches far-right extremist Republicans standing with Russia and  Vladimir Putin. How has the Republican Party become the party of  Vladimir Putin?   Mr. Speaker, this place is broken. I want to be clear in what I am  saying. We are witnessing a minority of the Republican Conference  calling the shots in this Chamber.   A majority of the Republican Conference supports standing with  Ukraine, but they have been cowed by the minority in their party, and  we continue to see the tail wagging the dog.   To my Republican colleagues who remain silent, the time for action is  now. Allow a clean vote on the supplemental funding package for Ukraine  and for Israel. We must stand strong with Ukraine today.   Let's talk about the cost because that has been brought up over and  over. If we gift wrap Ukraine for Vladimir Putin over this holiday  season, we will spend 100 times more money around the globe containing  an aggressive Russia. Moldova and Georgia are next.   This is a national security issue for the American people, and  support for Ukraine is in our national interest.   Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about Israel as well. We must stand with  Israel and support its right to defend itself.   We must immediately pass humanitarian aid and security aid for Israel  so that we can disarm and dismantle Hamas.   Mr. Speaker, 400 Members of this Chamber would easily support a clean  security and humanitarian assistance package for Israel. It is shameful  that our new Speaker chose to play partisan political games with  support for Israel.   For the American people watching, the bill that passed out of this  Chamber says we will stand with Israel, absolutely, only if we defund  the police for billionaires and wealthy tax cheats. That is the choice  that this body had, and it is shameful.   When someone's house is on fire, we don't say, hey, we will put out  the fire as long as you let us not pay for a bunch of IRS agents to go  after billionaires and wealthy tax cheats. You help them when their  house is burning down.   Right now, that is what we are watching in Israel with Israel  security assistance and humanitarian aid that we need to provide to the  Palestinian people in Gaza.   An overwhelming majority of Members support standing with Ukraine and  standing with Israel. If we could get a clean vote on this bill on the  floor, it would pass, but it is time for action.                                time  1030    Let me say that House Democrats, Senate Democrats, and Senate  Republicans all agree on the need to support Israel and Ukraine, and I  would even say a majority of the Republican Conference agrees. However,  we can't get a vote on this as long as the far-right extremists of the  Republican Conference continue to wag the tail of the dog in this  House.   Mr. Speaker, this is about the future of democracy for the world. The  defining question for our great experiment in self-governance is  whether we can defend democracy at home and abroad. We will face that  question about defending democracy at home in November, but right now,  we need to stand and be counted.   Authoritarianism is on the rise around the globe. We can either stand  with democracies like Israel and Ukraine or we can bend the knee to  Putin, terrorists, and other authoritarian regimes around the world.   As I voted for Speaker 19 times now, I have learned how incredibly  fragile our democracy is. We must act now to pass a supplemental aid  package and stand with Ukraine and Israel.   The world is watching, Mr. Speaker. Bring a clean bill to the floor  now. The time for action is now.                            ____________________
