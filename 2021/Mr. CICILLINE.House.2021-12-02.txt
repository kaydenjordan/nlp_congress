 Madam Speaker, I first want to say thank you to the  Appropriations chair and to the members of the Appropriations Committee  for their extraordinary work.   Let's be clear about one thing. A continuing resolution is not a way  to proceed, but it is the only way we can proceed in the face of  Republican obstruction, and when you vote ``no'' on the continuing  resolution, you are voting to defund the government and shut it down.   That means veterans can't access healthcare at the VA.   It means Native American Tribes can't have access to healthcare and  schools.   It means our troops won't get the pay they deserve.   You are voting to shut the government down, and at the same time you  are unwilling to be part of a process to pass appropriations bills for  an entire year. You are here to govern. You have a responsibility to  make sure this appropriation process works. And I am grateful for the  service of the members of the Appropriations Committee that have worked  on this in a painstaking way.   We have Republicans in the Senate who are obstructing this process,  but I am glad that I am part of the process that makes sure government  remains open, that we take care of our responsibilities, that we ensure  that the economic recovery that is underway is not hampered. I thank  the chair of the Appropriations Committee for the hard work in bringing  us to this moment.   I urge everyone to support the continuing resolution. Be responsible.
