 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the America  COMPETES Act.   No piece of legislation is more important to this Nation's future. It  is about our national security. It is about our economic well-being.   This bill is about regaining our independence in semiconductor chip  manufacturing.   This bill is about keeping our factories open and about American  jobs.   The America COMPETES Act also includes my legislation, the HOPR Act,  that says uniforms worn by our frontline DHS personnel must be made in  America by Americans.   Let's get busy and remind the rest of the world what made in America  is all about. It is about making the best.   I urge my colleagues to support the America COMPETES Act.                            ____________________
