 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Madam President, in the early hours of Saturday morning,  under the cover of darkness, the Republican majority rushed through one  of the worst, most hastily considered pieces of major legislation I  have seen in my time in the Senate.   The bill will cause one of the greatest transfers of wealth to  corporate America and the already wealthy, while working America picks  up the tab. Millions of middle-class families will pay higher taxes  under the Republican plan in only a few short years. Because the bill  is unpaid for, the deficit will skyrocket, cannibalizing resources for  education, scientific research, infrastructure, and our military,  endangering Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.  [[Page S7811]]  As I said last week, I have not seen a more regressive piece of  legislation so devoid of a rationale, so ill suited for the condition  of the country, so removed from the reality of what the American people  need.   The text of the bill itself was released in the early evening, only  several hours before a final vote took place. Lobbyists had a chance to  read and change the bill before Members of the U.S. Senate. When we  received the bill, there were sections of text handwritten in the  margins concerning some of the most complex tax provisions. The Joint  Committee on Taxation was not even able to produce an analysis of the  bill until after the final vote took place at around 2 or 3 in the  morning.   Amid such haste, the Republican majority likely made drafting errors  and inclusions that will have unintended consequences, even severe  ones. Amid such secrecy, such cloak-and-dagger legislating, the  majority slipped in several additional goodies for big corporations and  the very wealthy that are already being uncovered. I am sure even more  will come to light in the coming days.    The appalling process we all witnessed led Bloomberg News--a middle- of-the-road, business-oriented publication--to write the following in  an editorial today:         In their rush to pass something, anything, that they can       call ``tax reform,'' congressional Republicans have achieved       the impossible: They have made an awful plan even worse. The       end result is sheer absurdity: a reform that actually       complicates the tax code further, and that must contradict       itself and partially self-destruct to attain some semblance       of the fiscal discipline Republicans claim to value. It's       hard to imagine a more egregious waste of time and energy, or       a worse outcome for taxpayers and the broader economy.    That is Bloomberg News, not some leftwing publication. It is a  business publication. If they can say that, imagine what average  Americans are saying. What a condemnation from a publication that would  be inclined to favor tax reform. In short, my Republican friends ought  to be ashamed of the process and the product that emerged from the  Senate last week.   As the two Houses of Congress prepare to go to conference, I suggest  that my Republican colleagues reconsider their efforts and think again  on how much better of a product we could produce through a bipartisan,  open, and transparent process. Regardless, with so much left to do  before the end of the year, the Republicans should not be devoting  their energies toward the conference on tax reform because this bill,  in both the House and Senate, needs dramatic repair.
