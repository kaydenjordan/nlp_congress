 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   As we speak here today, conflicts are raging around the globe, and  the American people have told us exactly what they want us to do.  Democracy is under siege. Putin is salivating at the prospect that  Republicans might abandon Ukraine. Seventy thousand childcare centers  are on the verge of shutting down because the GOP let vital funding  expire. We don't even have a budget, despite the fact that we voted for  those top-line numbers back in June.   This ridiculous censure is how the Republicans are spending the time  of this Chamber and the time of the American people. The MAGA majority  should be embarrassed if they are still capable of shame. Republicans  filed this censure the same day they decided to shield the identities  of January 6 rioters.   I do have to hand it to the majority. They have managed to both push  an extreme agenda and be a do-nothing majority. They have done nothing  to make families freer, safer, or more confident in their future.  Instead, they have voted against lowering the cost of insulin,  affordable housing, and gun safety. They have done nothing to promote  freedom, but they do not miss an opportunity to vote for abortion bans,  book bans, and tax cheats.   Just last week, the majority's leadership said no to holding George  Santos accountable after a motion to expel was made by the Republican  chairman of the Ethics Committee, but today they bring this to the  floor? A censure isn't a substitute for a policy agenda. It isn't  filler when you have nothing to offer the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this sham resolution.
