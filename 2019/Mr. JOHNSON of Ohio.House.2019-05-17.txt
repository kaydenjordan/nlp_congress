 Mr. Speaker, I was absent during this morning's  vote on final passage of H.R. 5 due to travel for an unavoidable  medical appointment back in Ohio. Had I been present for this vote on  H.R. 5, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 215, ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 216, and ``nay'' on rollcall No. 217.                            ____________________
