 Mr. Chairman, energy is the most important element of a  prosperous society. Nothing else functions without it.   Reliable electricity allows us to work at night, keep our sick and  injured on life support, heat our homes in freezing weather,  manufacture the materials that we use to build our homes, and powers  the systems that allow the public to watch these remarks right here on  this House floor.   Energy is connected to everything. The price of energy affects the  price of everything else, and the world devolves into the Dark Ages  without it.   This might explain why Republicans think an energy bill should be  labeled H.R. 1--because it is our number one priority, as it should be.   We have to introduce this bill because, bewilderingly, energy  security has been under relentless attack by radical leftists and the  Biden administration. They don't believe in energy security. They don't  believe in reliable, affordable energy. They seem to think that the  only energy worth pursuing is so-called renewables, solar and wind.   This is not sound policy or science. This has become a religion, and  it has become an irrational pursuit of intermittent, weather-dependent  energy sources that take up vast amounts of land, vast amounts  of resources to make, and vast amounts of critical minerals to be  mined. Still, it doesn't deliver the energy security the American  people need.    I am not against these things. It would be fine to pursue these  technologies if it didn't also come with a simultaneous attack on the  sources of energy that actually work--namely, oil and gas.   Every good thing you have in this world, Mr. Chairman, is because of  petroleum products--every single thing. Your shoes, your cars, your  iPhones, your Netflix, your Patagonia jackets, medical devices that  save your life, your heating, your cooling--literally everything comes  from petroleum products.   The attack on oil and gas has been relentless, and it has been deeply  foolish. It started with day one of the Biden administration and the  Keystone pipeline, then executive orders banning new leases on Federal  lands, and then refusal to permit pipelines. Then they turn around and  attack the suppliers and producers for higher prices. It is pure  gaslighting.   They have drained our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, all while  prioritizing the same crazy climate policies that have caused Europe to  enter an energy crisis and that are now causing developing nations to  be priced out of gas markets and turn to coal production.   This gets me to quite the irony here. The administration's policies  are more likely to increase global carbon emissions as a result, and  for one simple reason. I really want everyone to understand this. By  refusing to push for increased natural gas exports, we are shelving the  best tool for displacing coal power around the world.   Coal burned in foreign countries accounts for about 50 percent of  global power emissions. Natural gas is an easy substitute with half the  emissions. American natural gas could easily be leveraged to increase  prosperity for all and reduce emissions.   This is not rocket science. It is common sense. It is just math.  Promoting American natural gas is better for energy security, better  for our own affordability, and better for reducing global emissions.  There is no logical counterargument to what I just said. There is not  one.   Maybe--I believe this--the Biden administration actually knows this.  That is why they prefer oil production in foreign countries and beg  them to drill so that we can pretend we care about the climate while  allowing other countries to do the dirty work for us.                                time  1300     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I really hope this amendment can be  bipartisan. I see no reason why it wouldn't be. It simply provides  predictability for States applying for primacy of class 6 carbon  capture wells. It is very straight forward. When a State submits a  primacy application to the EPA, the EPA has 270 days to either approve  or deny the application.   If the EPA is unable to do so within that generous time window, we  give them another 30 days to explain why. If, for whatever reason, the  EPA fails to make a determination after 300 days, then the State can  move forward.   Importantly, we preserve EPA's ability to deny the application or  revoke the approval using emergency measures under the Safe Drinking  Water Act.   Why is this needed?   Unfortunately, when States submit primacy applications for these  wells, it can take years for the EPA to even bother to review the  application. There is a lot more demand for carbon capture projects.  They are ramping up around the country, especially in Houston. The need  for expanded permitting capacity has greatly increased.   The EPA should not be the roadblock to projects that are designed to  reduce carbon emissions. Let me say that again: Reduce carbon  emissions.   The International Energy Agency said carbon capture is necessary to  meet national, regional, and even corporate emissions reductions goals.  Even EPA administrator Michael Regan called carbon capture a priority  [[Page H1586]]  for the Biden administration. It is a bipartisan issue.   States like Texas have already proven they can manage these wells and  giving them primacy will be a game changer for speeding up carbon  capture projects. Giving States regulatory certainty is critical to  successful carbon capture projects moving forward in their States. That  is all this amendment does.   Mr. Chair, there is no reason why this should not be bipartisan, and  I encourage my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have a brief response to the gentleman's  remarks. This does not change at all the Safe Drinking Water Act that  the EPA regulates. All it says is there is a timeline for that primacy  application. It can always be denied within that timeline.   By the way, the entire point of this is to reduce carbon emissions.  It should be bipartisan.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Pfluger).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Again, opposing this amendment would mean that you want more carbon  emissions in the air, that you don't want carbon sequestration. I am  pretty sure that is not what you all want. We all want the same thing  here.   This is a commonsense amendment that simply expedites the permitting  process, which is well established. Everyone knows it is safe. It  doesn't change any regulations. It doesn't circumvent any EPA  regulations or standards for drinking water at all.   This is a commonsense amendment. If we can't agree on things like  this, it just tells me that we are looking for disagreement for the  sake of disagreement. That makes me sad. It really does.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
