 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the Mifflinburg Hose Company No. 1 for their 125 years of service. Over  the weekend, the community gathered to celebrate this monumental  anniversary.   The fire company was established in 1898 with 40 members. David L.  Grover was the first president and H.O. Bower was the first fire chief.   For generations, these firefighters have protected the community and  provided essential services. Since its founding in 1898 with 40  members, the company has grown to 125 members and 75 active  firefighters.   The Mifflinburg Hose Company's coverage area includes parts of the  Bald Eagle State Forest, Raymond B. Winter State Park and numerous  other smaller State parks and natural areas, and parts of the  Appalachian Mountains. This is some of the roughest terrain in the Mid- Atlantic area. The department responds to structure fires, silo fires,  vehicle accidents, farm accidents, search and rescue, wildfires, and  more.   As a former volunteer firefighter, I know firsthand the value that  they play in our community. I thank all the members of the Mifflinburg  Hose Company No. 1 for their service and congratulations on this  significant achievement.                            ____________________
