 Mr. Speaker, once again, I am proud to stand  in the well of the Congress of the United States of America. I am not  proud to stand here today for the reasons that I shall articulate.   Mr. Speaker, we live in a world where it is not enough for things to  be right; they must also look right. Mr. Speaker, when the Federal  Government separates children from their parents, indeed, mothers from  their babies, it does not look right.   Some may argue that it is right because of various laws and  legislation that might exist, but it doesn't look right for this  country, the country that believes in liberty and justice for all. It  doesn't look right for the United States of America to separate babies  from their mothers.   Where is the moral compass?   There ought to be an inner voice within us that says there is  something wrong here. We are taking a baby from the baby's mother, and  we are going to put the baby in a location separate and apart from the  mother. The baby needs the mother. The mother is there to nurture the  baby.   How can we do this in good conscience?   We live in a world where it is not enough for things to be right;  they must also look right. And this doesn't look right to the world.   I have gone to visit these children. I went to Brownsville. I saw the  children. They are caring for the children, but the missing element,  the most important thing that these children need, was not there: their  parents.   I went to three other sites before going to Brownsville and, Mr.  Speaker, I, as a Member of the Congress of the United States of  America, went to a site in my congressional district, and I went to  other sites. I could not see the children, and I was asked to leave the  premises. I behaved in an orderly fashion. I had two forms of  identification. But not only could I not see the children, I was asked  to leave the property.   There is no transparency. This is the Federal Government holding  children and not allowing open access to these children by Members of  Congress.   It is not enough for things to be right; they must also look right.  When the Members of the Congress of the United States of America cannot  see the children who have been secreted in various locations around the  country and separated from their parents, not only does this not look  right, it isn't right.   At some point on this infinite continuum that we call time, we will  all have to account for our time. At some point, when the omnipotent,  the omnipresent, and omniscient are one, we will have to answer to what  is happening to these children today. These children belong to all of  us in the sense that they are children of our world, and we must answer  and account for what is happening today.   So I stand here in the well, a proud Member of Congress and proud to  be an American, but sad to know that we have not done enough to reunite  these children with their parents.   Mr. Speaker, if you separate children from their parents, if you take  babies from their mothers, then you must have a plan to reunite them.  When you do not, you are failing not only those parents, but you are  failing the future of a great country, because it gives us the  appearance of not caring for people who are in harm's way who have come  asking for help. It gives us the appearance of not being that Good  Samaritan who not only helped the person who was in harm's way who had  been beset upon by thieves, it gives us the appearance of not being  that Good Samaritan who said: I am going to help you. I am going to  take you to the inn. I am going to leave; I am coming back; and I will  pay more if you need more.   This is the United States of America. We can do better.                            ____________________
