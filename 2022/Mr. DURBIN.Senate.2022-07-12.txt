 I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr.  Blumenthal), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the Senator from New  Mexico (Mr. Lujan), and the Senator from New York (Mr. Schumer) are  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr.  Blumenthal), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the Senator from New  Mexico (Mr. Lujan), and the Senator from New York (Mr. Schumer) are  necessarily absent.    Madam President, today, the Senate will vote on Steve  Dettelbach's nomination to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,  Firearms, and Explosives--better known as ATF.   As I said on the floor yesterday, after describing in horrifying  detail the mass shooting in Highland Park on the Fourth of July, we  need a confirmed ATF Director now more than ever.   When a mass shooter tears apart a community like Highland Park, IL-- or Buffalo, NY--ATF agents are among the first to arrive on scene. In  fact, in the hours following the attack in Highland Park, it was ATF  agents who traced the firearm belonging to the confessed shooter. Their  investigate work was described by local authorities in Lake County as  ``phenomenal.'' I couldn't agree more.   The least we can do to support these heroic agents is confirm a  proven leader to head the ATF, which has gone 7 years without a Senate- confirmed Director.   Our country and our communities deserve better. They deserve an ATF  that is fully equipped to respond on our Nation's darkest days--and to  enforce the laws on the books to prevent these tragedies in the first  place.   And Steve Dettelbach is exactly the right leader for this challenge.  He is a career prosecutor with decades of experience fighting crime,  religion-motivated violence, gun trafficking, and he is a proven  consensus-builder with bipartisan support.   The vote on Mr. Dettelbach's nomination is not about a new policy or  regulation; it is about enforcing the laws that already exist, and  respecting the men and women of ATF who deserve Senate-confirmed  leadership. This vote is a pragmatic step all of us can take toward  making our communities safer.   Guns are now the leading cause of death for American children. And we  have more than one mass shooting per day in America. In the wake of  Highland Park, Uvalde, Buffalo, and too many tragedies across America,  it is clear that we need experienced and dedicated law enforcement  leadership in agencies like ATF. I hope my colleagues will join me in  supporting Mr. Dettelbach.    I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr.  Blumenthal), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the Senator from New  Mexico (Mr. Lujan), and the Senator from New York (Mr. Schumer) are  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr.  Blumenthal), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the Senator from New  Mexico (Mr. Lujan), and the Senator from New York (Mr. Schumer) are  necessarily absent.    I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    I ask unanimous consent that all postcloture time on the  Barr nomination be considered expired at 11:30 a.m. tomorrow,  Wednesday, July 13.    Mr. President, last month the Supreme Court completed one  of its most consequential and, in many ways, disastrous terms in  American history, issuing a flurry of decisions that have upended our  constitutional landscape.   In the scope of just a few weeks, the Supreme Court's radical new  supermajority trampled over decades of longstanding precedent and  usurped the power that has been traditionally left to Congress, State  legislatures, and even individual Americans.   In fact, for the first time in the history of the United States of  America, the Supreme Court revoked a constitutional right: the right to  reproductive healthcare.   What we have seen from this Supreme Court is not guided by any  coherent philosophy. It is judicial activism, plain and simple. The  Court's radical majority is cherry-picking its way across text and  history to impose their own ideological agenda on the American people,  and, in so doing, the majority is not only damaging the Court's  constitutional integrity. They are undermining the health and safety of  the American people.   Let me explain, starting with one ruling that will severely limit the  Government's ability to address what could be the greatest challenge of  our time--the climate crisis. The case was West Virginia v. the EPA.  The conservative majority on the Court misconstrued the law passed by  Congress to side with the fossil fuel industry over the health of the  American people.   When Congress enacted the Clean Air Act more than a half century ago,  it charged the Environmental Protection Agency with protecting our air  from harmful pollution, including greenhouse gases, which are causing  catastrophic and irreversible damage to our planet. As Justice Kagan  emphasized in her dissent, if the current rate of emissions continues,  children born this year could live to see parts of the eastern seaboard  of the United States swallowed by the ocean. Rising waters, scorching  heat, and other severe weather events can force mass migration, civil  unrest, and, in some parts of the world, even failure of state  government. And, of course, Black, Brown, indigenous, and other  communities bear the largest burden of environmental disaster.   With the Clean Air Act, Congress rightfully recognized that  scientists--not politicians or judges--should be the authority on  deciding the best methods to reduce emissions from powerplants. It was  under that authority that in 2014 the EPA proposed the Clean Power  Plan. That plan would have markedly reduced greenhouse gas emissions,  but it never went into effect.   That is important because article III of the Constitution requires  that there be an actual case in controversy in order for the Supreme  Court to issue a ruling. Because the Clean Power Plan never went into  effect, there was no case or controversy to refer to, but the Supreme  Court still went out of its way to reject the plan and toss it aside in  West Virginia v. EPA. Worse yet, the Court claimed it had the authority  to do so by relying on something the conservative majority calls ``the  major questions doctrine.''   Listen to what Justice Kagan said about this in her dissent:         The current Court is textualist only when being so suits       it. When that method would frustrate broader goals, special       canons like the ``major questions doctrine'' magically appear       as get-out-of-text-free cards.    The ``major questions doctrine'' might sound like a legal word salad,  but it will have serious consequences on America. In short, the radical  majority on the Court declared it has the authority to veto any Federal  regulation it doesn't care for; that is, unless Congress spells out  every single detail decades in advance.   Here is the deal. As good as we are in the Senate and the House,  lawmakers are not clairvoyant. We write laws like the Clean Air Act to  address evolving unforeseen challenges like the climate crisis, and we  grant Agencies the power to create regulations to address these  challenges based on their singular expertise.   In West Virginia v. EPA, the Supreme Court's radical majority decided  that their own ideological goals on the Court were more important than  the expertise of the world's top scientists. And with this ruling,  the Court has made it clear that they are coming after public Agencies  responsible for protecting our public health. They  [[Page S3235]]  want to weaken the government's ability to work upon behalf of the  American people.    Just days before issuing a decision on West Virginia v. EPA, the  Court issued another ideologically driven ruling in New York State  Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. With this decision, the Court  struck down a New York gun safety law that had been on the books for  more than a century. That law placed limits on who is allowed to carry  a concealed handgun in public. As a result of the law being struck  down, it is all but certain that we will see more guns on the streets  of America at a time when gun violence has become so bad that the  leading cause of death among children in America would be guns.   The Supreme Court's decision to wipe away a century-old gun safety  law was troubling enough, but even worse is the new test it laid out  for considering constitutional challenges to other gun laws. Justice  Clarence Thomas' majority opinion rejected the legal test that lower  courts had applied after the legendary Heller case, which sensibly  combined historic analysis with present-day public safety  considerations. Instead, under Clarence Thomas's reasoning, the  majority claims that the only test for whether a gun law is  constitutional is historical analysis; that is, whether the current law  has a historical analogue.   There is a problem with that in two respects. First, it invites  judicial cherry-picking of historical sources, which is exactly what  the Clarence Thomas majority did in striking down the New York law.  Second, it ignores modern public safety threats posed by firearms which  are nothing like the guns that the Framers of the Constitution had in  their day.   Think about it. The gun that was fired in the Highland Park Fourth of  July parade crowd discharged 90 rounds in just a matter of seconds. No  musket in the time of the Founding Fathers was ever used to fire 90  rounds per minute into a crowd watching a Fourth of July parade. There  is just no analogue. The Bruen decision was not a triumph of  originalism. It was a classic example of runaway judicial activism in  furtherance of the far-right ideological agenda, and we have to live in  the America that it leaves.   That is not the only ruling in the past term that made America less  safe. Earlier today, my Judiciary Committee heard a hearing on the  Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization which  revoked the constitutional right to reproductive healthcare for every  woman in America.   This decision is one of the most irresponsible rulings in American  history. By overturning Roe v. Wade, the majority not only violated  five decades of longstanding precedent; they created a healthcare  crisis across the country.   Do you realize that every one of these Supreme Court nominees came  before this Judiciary Committee and made it clear that they would  respect this precedent? And now look at what has happened. Whatever  your thoughts on Roe may be, the fact is that it put a profound and  personal decision exactly where it should be--in the hands of an  individual. Now that the right has been ripped from the American people  and handed over to the Government, your constitutional freedoms depend  on what State you live in. Your ZIP Code will decide your  constitutional right.   You know, for decades, anti-choice activists claimed that overturning  Roe would finally settle the controversy surrounding abortion. Instead,  this Supreme Court has invited chaos. Pregnant women in America are  scrambling at this very moment trying to figure out if they can make it  to the nearest clinic to receive lifesaving care as they experience  complications during pregnancy. And once again, like the Bruen decision  on firearms, the Dobbs decision on abortion is littered with inaccurate  historical analysis.   Justice Alito claims that abortion is not constitutionally protected  because it is not ``deeply rooted in the Nation's history and  tradition.''    I am not sure what history his law clerks have been reading. As the  dissenters in the Dobbs case said:         [E]mbarrassingly for the majority--early law in fact does       provide some support for abortion rights. Common-law       authorities did not treat abortion as a crime before       ``quickening''--the point when the fetus moved in the womb.       And early American law followed the common-law rule. So the       criminal law of that time might be taken as roughly consonant       with Roe's and Casey's different treatment of early and late       abortions.    Just look at one of our Founding Fathers, Benjamin Franklin, who  actually published a textbook that included an at-home abortion recipe.   So the Dobbs decision is not based on any originalist interpretation  of the Constitution or any precedent. It is an ideologically motivated  outcome in search of a legal rationale.   This assault on our fundamental freedoms won't end there. The Supreme  Court has already signaled they are just getting started. During  today's hearing on the overturning of Roe v. Wade, we discussed Justice  Clarence Thomas' concurring opinion in Dobbs, in which he argues that  the constitutional right to privacy is a fiction.   In that opinion, he declares that the Court should ``eliminate'' the  line of cases guaranteeing the constitutional rights to birth control,  marriage equality, and consensual relations between LGBTQ people. There  is good reason to take this threat seriously.   Based on the cases the Court has agreed to hear in its next term,  which begins in October, it is clear that the majority is once again  seeking opportunities to impose its far-right agenda on the American  people.   The Court is considering one case that could allow individuals and  businesses to openly discriminate against LGBTQ people. Another case  will revisit the question of affirmative action in higher education,  and, most concerning, this Court will consider a case that could  threaten American democracy as we know it. They will decide whether a  State legislature can disregard the will of the voters in their State  to appoint a slate of electors who support the losing Presidential  candidate. The Presiding Officer knows this issue well from the State  of Michigan's experience just a few months ago.   There is a reason why a record number of Americans say they have lost  faith in the Supreme Court based on what happened in this term that  just concluded. And now they are living in fear that their most  cherished rights--basic human rights in America--are on the  conservative chopping block.   The tragic irony is that it was Chief Justice Roberts who once said  that ``justices . . . are like umpires. . . . They make sure everybody  plays by the rules, but it is a limited role.''   I remember that quote, as I was sitting in the Judiciary Committee  when he made it, and I thought the limitation that he suggested for the  Supreme Court was an indication of his moderation.   The Court that he has joined, in many of these opinions, is not a  Court of limited or moderate means. I wish I could say that that, in  fact, were true today. It is not. This radical majority is not  comprised of umpires calling balls and strikes. They are, in fact,  judicial activists--unelected judges--who are actively undermining the  rule of law in America, and there is more to come.   I yield the floor.
