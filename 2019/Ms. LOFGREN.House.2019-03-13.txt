 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution today.   We have a responsibility to the American people to uphold the  Constitution and rule of law, and we also have an obligation, as a  separate and equal branch of government, to act as a check on the  executive branch.   Without access to necessary information, we can't fulfill our  constitutionally prescribed duties. We must have not only this report,  but the evidence collected to support the report.   If the President has nothing to hide, then he would also support this  resolution by tweet or verbal approval.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation. It is  very important for our country.
