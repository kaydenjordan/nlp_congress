 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 40th  anniversary of New Ventures Maine, NVM. NVM is a nonprofit that  provides adults with the tools they need to succeed in a changing  economy. Through free classes and individualized coaching, NVM has  helped thousands of Maine people find jobs, start their own businesses,  and manage their finances.   In 1978, Merle Nelson, a representative from Portland, ME, and  Barbara Trafton, a senator from Lewiston, ME, spearheaded a bill that  established what was then called the ``Displaced Homemakers Project.''  The program was designed to support Maine women transitioning into the  workforce after focusing on raising their families. Since its  inception, Gilda Nardone has served as executive director and she,  along with her skillful team, have steadfastly executed the vision of  its founders while seamlessly addressing the changing needs of the  community around them for the last four decades.   Fueled by the successes and tenacity of the people they serve, the  organization has expanded its mission, adding courses on business  management, financial literacy, and leadership. Other initiatives have  been introduced as well, including innovative mini-grant programs, loan  funding, and matched savings accounts. In 2015, the project officially  became New Ventures Maine and rededicated itself to serving all Maine  adults, men and women alike.   Throughout its history, NVM has committed to providing access to the  organization's services, regardless of wealth or status, and has always  prioritized serving the historically disadvantaged and those with  limited resources. There are NVM offices and opportunities in all 16  counties in Maine, and they continued to expand access to their  resources with the adoption of online courses.   I am not the first to stand up and applaud NVM's contributions to the  State. In 1993, Ms. Nardone was inducted into the Maine Women's Hall of  Fame for her work with the organization. In 2004, Representative Nelson  was given the first annual Women Making a Difference Award, named in  her honor, for her pioneering role in creating New Ventures Maine.  These are some of the public accolades but there are countless Maine  people who quietly praise the work of NVM because of the difference  this remarkable organization has made in their lives. A tribute to  their advocacy that has lifted so many out of uncertainty and into the  light of strength and courage.   I am proud to recognize the great work of New Ventures Maine over the  last 40 years. Their team of professionals, and the paths they have  cleared, truly exemplify Maine's motto of ``Dirigo,'' I Lead.                            ____________________
