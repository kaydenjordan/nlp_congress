 Madam President, this amendment is an amendment I  believe almost every Senator will want to vote for because this is an  amendment that guarantees that when you walk into the local drugstore,  your medicine is safe because you know that it has been approved by the  Food and Drug Administration.   This amendment clarifies the current law, which says that if you sell  a prescription drug in the United States, it has to be approved by the  Food and Drug Administration. It may be made overseas--and many are,  and they are sold here--but they are approved by the Food and Drug  Administration.   I have the privilege of being the chairman of the HELP Committee, and  I can't tell you the number of impassioned speeches I have heard from  my Democratic friends about the importance of drug safety and the gold  standard for the Food and Drug Administration. So if you are for the  gold standard of the Food and Drug Administration, if you are for  making prescription drugs approved by the FDA, vote yes. If you are  against it, vote no.    Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 174 and  ask unanimous consent that it be reported by number.    Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that act and applicable budget resolutions for the purposes of the  pending Alexander amendment No. 174, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
