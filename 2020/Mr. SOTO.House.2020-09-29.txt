For nearly 20 years, Cuauhtemoc ``Temo'' Juarez and his wife,  Alejandra Juarez, worked together to build and sustain their American  Dream in Polk County, Florida.   Mr. Juarez, a naturalized U.S. citizen, grew up in Osceola County and  enlisted in the United States Marine Corps right after graduating from  high school. He would later reenlist in the United States Army Reserve.   After his honorable discharge from the Marines, he came home, started  his own flooring business, and met and married Mrs. Alejandra Juarez.  Together, they worked hard to make their business a success. They built  a home, joined a church, volunteered to help the less fortunate, and  had two beautiful daughters, Pamela and Estela.   Two years ago, their dreams were shattered when Mrs. Juarez was  deported under the current administration's zero-tolerance policy.  Despite the roots she set up, despite her husband's brave and honorable  service, despite the fact that her husband and two  [[Page H5041]]  daughters are U.S. citizens, she was forced to return to Mexico in  August of 2018.   Pamela is now 18. She recently graduated from high school with  honors, has started online college classes, and plans to become a  social worker. She has campaigned to build grassroots support for the  families of military veterans who, like hers, have lost a family member  to a cruel immigration policy. This November, she will vote for the  first time.    Estela, 11 years old, lived with her mom in Mexico but is now back in  Florida, where she just started the sixth grade. She is following in  the footsteps of civil rights leader John Lewis, whose book ``March''  inspired her. Estela is now working on a picture book about her  struggle to reunite her family.   Both young women have suffered enormously because of the trauma their  family has endured. They and their family have been working hard to  bring their mother home and will continue to do so until they are  united again.   For that, Pamela and Estela Juarez, we honor you.    In Support of the Digital Taxonomy Act and the Blockchain Innovation                                    Act     Madam Speaker, today, I am pleased that the House passed,  as part of the Consumer Safety Inspection Enhancement Act, two pieces  of legislation that we were able to offer in the Energy and Commerce  Committee, the Digital Taxonomy Act, H.R. 2154, and the Blockchain  Innovation Act, H.R. 8153.   We were very pleased to work in a bipartisan fashion to secure the  inclusion of these two bills. Both bills will study and highlight the  consumer protection aspects of blockchain technology and digital  assets. They are the first blockchain bills to pass the House.   H.R. 8153, the Blockchain Innovation Act, directs the Department of  Commerce, in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission, to conduct  a study and submit to the Congress a report on the state of blockchain  technology in commerce, including its use to reduce fraud and increase  security. It is setting up a larger long-term goal that we have to  establish a blockchain center of excellence within the Commerce  Department.   Blockchain has enormous potential for innovation and economic growth.  I believe, as government officials, we need to support that growth and  enable its appropriate use for government business and consumers. We  will continue to push until we have these policy objectives put into  law with proper regulations so we can best position ourselves to be  leaders in this space, especially when we see rivals like China and  Russia pushing in these technologies.   The Digital Taxonomy Act requires the FCC to submit a report to  Congress about recommendations on unfair and deceptive trade practices  and other practices related to digital tokens.                                time  2045    Specifically, the report asked the FTC to make legislative  recommendations for how to further protect consumers and promotion and  innovation in the global digital token sector.   I look forward to continuing to work with our colleagues, both in the  Energy and Commerce Committee and throughout the Congress, to help make  sure we keep a competitive edge in blockchain for both digital security  and for cryptocurrency and to enhance the use of artificial  intelligence in the future.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Pallone, Chairwoman  Schakowsky, Representative McNerney, and the committee for allowing me  to incorporate these two bills.   We appreciate Representative Rodgers, Representative Guthrie, and  Representative Matsui, as well as our original cosponsor,  Representative Davidson, for all of their hard work.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
