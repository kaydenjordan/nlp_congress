 Mr. Speaker, make no mistake about it,  extremists in this Congress are trying to hold us hostage. Republicans  have given us a ransom note: choose between wrecking our economy or  wrecking our families; lose jobs and retirement funds or inflict cruel  pain on American families.   More children will go to bed hungry. More women will die during  childbirth. More parents will be without childcare. More neighborhoods  will be without police. There will be more evictions, more drug  overdoses, more veteran suicides, and more carbon in the air. There  will be more misery.   Make no mistake, Republicans are willing to sacrifice Americans in  order to protect tax cuts for the very wealthy and for big  corporations.
