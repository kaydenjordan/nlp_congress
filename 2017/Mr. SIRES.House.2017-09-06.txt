 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the cruel and  indefensible termination of the DACA program.   Since its launch in 2012, DACA has helped hundreds of thousands of  young people come out of the shadows without the fear of being  separated from  [[Page H6658]]  their loved ones and sent away from the only country they call home.  Many of these children came as infants, growing up in the same  playgrounds, schools, and neighborhoods as our own kids.   The President's decision targets millions of young people who  contribute to our society, economy, and national identity every day. In  New Jersey alone, there are over 22,000 DACA recipients who pay $66  million in State and local taxes every year.   The emotional and economic impact of their deportation will be  devastating, and New Jersey could lose $1.58 billion annually in GDP.   America was built on the hard work of immigrants and our diversity is  part of the foundation of our Nation.   It is long past due for Congress to step up and protect the millions  of families that will be torn apart because of this inhumane decision.  We must protect DACA and pass legislation to fix our broken immigration  system.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, our country is reeling from a natural  disaster that has left dozens dead, caused billions of dollars in  damage, and forced thousands out of their homes. Hurricane Harvey has  wrought a level of devastation and suffering that is nearly  unparalleled in our country.   It is now our duty as America's representatives to live up to our  role and help our neighbors when they are in need. This body cannot  afford to delay providing disaster assistance in the wake of this  storm, as Congress did when my own state was recovering from Superstorm  Sandy in 2012.   Month after month, funding was withheld from our cities by political  quarrels that came at New Jersey's expense. For five months, our  communities were forced to wait for the federal assistance they needed  to rebuild critical infrastructure.   Cleaning up the damage caused by Hurricane Harvey is a task that is  beyond any single state's resources and I will not stand by quietly if  Congress fails to provide swift relief for Harvey's victims.   I hope that this body has learned from its mistakes, will stand  together, set aside its differences, and immediately provide the  communities affected by Hurricane Harvey with the necessary assistance  to recover and rebuild.
