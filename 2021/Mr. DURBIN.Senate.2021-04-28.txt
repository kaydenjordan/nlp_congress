Madam Prescient, this week, the Senate has the  opportunity to take a major step on an issue that affects all  Americans: infrastructure.   Senator Duckworth, my friend and fellow Illinois Senator, is leading  a bipartisan effort to finance critical water infrastructure  improvements across the country.   The Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act authorizes $35  billion in funding to improve access to safe drinking water, fortify  our water infrastructure against extreme weather, lower the cost of  utility bills, and rebuild aging water systems across America.   More than 40 percent of authorized funds will go to small, rural, and  disadvantaged communities, many of which have not seen water  infrastructure improvements in decades. And believe me, our water  infrastructure is in desperate need of improvement.   My home State of Illinois has the most lead service lines of any  State. Recent reports indicate that 8 in 10 Illinoisans live in a  community where lead has been found in the drinking water in the last 6  years. Chicago alone has more than 380,000 lead service lines, the most  of any city in the country. My hometown of Springfield has more than  10,000 lead service lines. These numbers are tragic and unacceptable.  Every day, millions of my constituents risk exposure to lead, which can  impair brain development in children and harm pregnant mothers. The  people of Illinois, like many others across the country, sorely need  these pipes replaced.   Thankfully, this bipartisan bill would begin to tackle the epidemic  of lead in our Nation's drinking water. It would authorize $100 million  per year for lead service line removal and a further $40 million per  year for lead testing in schools. Just imagine what that kind of  funding could do to protect vulnerable people and children in Chicago,  Springfield, and across our country.   But unfortunately, lead is not the only water infrastructure problem  facing our communities. A few weeks ago, I visited a small, rural town  in Illinois called Centreville. Near my birthplace of East St. Louis, I  have known this community all my life. Centreville's population is  mostly elderly, Black, lifelong residents. They have faced chronic  wastewater and storm water issues for decades. Ordinary rainfall can  overflow the town's broken sewer systems and flood residents' basements  and lawns with raw sewage. No one risks taking a sip of water from the  tap.   I have heard from residents about the horror of stepping out of their  front door in the morning to discover pools of sewage seeping up  through the grass in their front yards. This is a tragic and dangerous  situation and one that deserves significant Federal attention. And yet  the problem has persisted for decades. Why?   Centreville is one of the poorest towns in Illinois and has struggled  to attract financial help. The town cannot meet the cost-share  requirements of grant programs or qualify for the loans it so  desperately needs.   Well, the residents of Centreville have spoken up, they are fed up  with officials looking the other way. They have every right to feel  frustrated. They have every right to demand more of us. For decades our  water policy has overlooked their needs and left them to fend for  themselves. This cannot continue.   That is why I am glad this bill offers towns like Centreville a  chance to fix their broken pumps, shore up their drainage ditches, and  begin addressing water issues that have been overlooked for far too  long. The bill would waive many of the cost-share requirements for  small, rural towns like Centreville, giving them a path to the funding  they deserve. It also would give on-the-ground technical assistance to  disadvantaged communities struggling with their water systems, and  provide grants for repairing broken and outdated water infrastructure.   To help ensure that this expertise reaches places like Centreville, I  offered an amendment to the bill to focus it even further. I want to  thank the EPW Committee for including my amendment to require the EPA  to prioritize distressed communities like Centreville, that have  struggled to attract funds and face the cumulative burden of wastewater  and storm water issues. Flooding, lead, drinking water access--none of  these problems are new.   My colleagues on both sides of the aisle have spent years decrying  the state of American infrastructure, and our water is no exception.  Despite all the complaining, we have struggled to sit down together and  actually address these issues. But for the first time in many years, we  not only have a President willing to pursue bold and necessary  infrastructure policy, but a majority in the Senate willing to work  with him to get it done.   While President Biden's American Jobs Plan includes billions more in  funding to replace the Nation's lead pipes, this bill is a good-faith,  down payment on the President's plan, and importantly, it has  bipartisan support. The Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure  Act is the first step towards new, meaningful infrastructure policy.   I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill, so we  can put a bipartisan down payment on the infrastructure every American  needs.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
