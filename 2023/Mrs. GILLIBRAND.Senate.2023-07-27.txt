 Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Schumer for  his unbelievable conviction and persistence in helping our 9/11 first  responders.   I also want to thank my Republican colleagues who helped us write  this bill--Senator Braun, Senator Lummis, and Senator Cotton.   I am just going to give you a vignette of what this is about.   Mariama, a New Yorker, came home after 9/11 to find her apartment  covered in a thick coat of ash. Her children have all developed life- changing respiratory conditions.   Jamie, a 19-year-old, was a volunteer with the Sayville Ambulance  that day. He spent weeks cleaning up at Ground Zero. He developed a  rare 9/11 cancer as well.   Another amazing person is Nate, who responded to the attack at the  Pentagon. He spent weeks climbing in and out of the wreckage, searching  for remains. He is now a disabled veteran who is suffering from PTSD  and another rare, life-threatening disease.   It has been over two decades since 9/11, but, still, thousands of  people like Mariama, Jamie, and Nate suffer from these terrible cancers  and conditions.   In 2011, when Congress created the World Trade Center Health Program,  which provided medical treatment and monitoring for the survivors, it  was not fully funded then, and we are hoping to get closer to fully  funding it with this addition. My amendment brings us one step closer  to this funding gap, and it includes the Pentagon and Shanksville  responders.   9/11 was a horrible day for everyone, but one thing I can say is that  this body has stood with those responders every single year since then,  and this body has never given up in making sure they have the  healthcare they need to survive.                              Amendment No. 1065    (Purpose: To amend title XXXIII of the Public Health Service Act with  respect to funding for the World Trade Center Health Program.)    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1065, and  I ask that the Gillibrand amendment be reported by number.
