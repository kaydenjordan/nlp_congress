 Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 50th  anniversary of Intercessors for America--IFA--a ministry that has  faithfully served believers by encouraging effective prayer and fasting  for the Church, our Nation, and our elected leaders, including those of  us elected to Congress. At the time of IFA's founding, the Watergate  scandal, the Vietnam war, pervasive drug use, and the Supreme Court's  tragic decision to legalize abortion on demand in Roe v. Wade had  shaken the moral foundations of our Nation. In the 50 years since,  IFA's ministry has been important in rebuilding a society that once  again respects the Judeo-Christian principles and moral values that lie  at the heart of America.   The founding leaders of IFA, including Derek Prince and John Beckett,  began their first activities at a large dining table where John Talcott  and his wife Roselyn wrote a prayer letter, which was mailed to a group  of like-minded people who recognized the need for God to intervene to  heal our Nation. Over the past 50 years, IFA has grown from these  beginnings to inform, connect, and mobilize intercessors across  America, in churches and communities nationwide, to pray for our Nation  and our leaders.   In its work, IFA follows the teaching of the Apostle Paul in 1  Timothy 2:1-3: ``I urge you, first of all, to pray for all people. Ask  God to help them; intercede on their behalf, and give thanks for them.  Pray this way for kings and all who are in authority so that we can  live peaceful and quiet lives marked by godliness and dignity. This is  good and pleases God our Savior, who wants everyone to be saved and to  understand the truth.''   Nowhere could this impact of the power of prayer, including the  prayers of many IFA intercessors, be better seen than the Supreme  Court's historic decision in 2022 in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health  Organization to overturn the moral stain of Roe v. Wade. This moment  was a testament to God's faithfulness, and underscores the importance  of the work we have ahead of us to rebuild a culture where God's gift  of life is respected and cherished.   It is an honor to recognize Intercessors for America and to celebrate  its 50-year anniversary, in gratitude for its work, through prayer and  intercession for public officials, to restore our moral values, protect  the right to life and the family, and to bring about a renewal of  faith, so that God may continue to bless our Nation.                            ____________________
