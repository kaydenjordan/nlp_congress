 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Emily  Reese, a cherished Nevadan, a loving mother of three, and a fearless  healthcare advocate who worked tirelessly to put others before herself.   Emily devoted her last year of life to fighting for what she believed  in: protecting access to quality, affordable healthcare for those who  need it most. Her work touched many lives, including my own.   Emily's compassion and determination knew no boundaries, and it is  those qualities that made her a powerful voice in our community.   As we pay tribute to her life, let us never forget to find strength  in her words: live life, love life, and impact others.                            ____________________
