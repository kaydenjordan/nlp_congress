 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss Speaker McCarthy's  [[Page H2612]]  irresponsibility with the debt ceiling negotiations. It is very  dangerous to play games with the American economy.   While Speaker McCarthy haggles over the debt ceiling, millions of  Americans are wondering if they are going to have a job after next  week. The stock market is wondering if this is going to lead to a  recession or a depression.   Speaker McCarthy does not feel these concerns are important. He  thinks they can wait. They cannot wait.   America's bills are coming due, and now we need to pay them and pay  them now. This is not the time to relax and enjoy the weekend like  Speaker McCarthy wants to do.   This is the time to roll up our sleeves and do the work we were  elected to do and increase the debt ceiling to help Americans  nationwide.   Madam Speaker, I hope the American public is watching this because  this will be the moment when your benefits will be cut, and veterans'  benefits will be cut. Remember who was not here on this day.                            ____________________
