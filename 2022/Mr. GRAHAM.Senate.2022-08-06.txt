 Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes from the bill.   So where to start? Well, I thought long and hard about how to explain  this to the American people, and the only thing I can tell you is  ``insanity'' is defined as doing the same thing and expecting a  different outcome.   So here we are with the same people coming up with a plan to help  you. How well did that work out the last time these 50 people were  going to save you and your family? You will eventually come to the  conclusion, I hope, they generally don't know what they are doing.   The best way to stop a drunk driver is to take the keys away before  they  [[Page S4150]]  get in the car. The best way to stop this tax-and-spend and  inflationary madness is to fire some of the 50 so they can't keep doing  this to your family.   In March of 2021, we had a debate. Senator Sanders--very good man.  And everybody over there told us that if we pass the American Rescue  Plan, your life will be dramatically better. As $1.9 trillion passed  with Democratic votes alone in March of 2021, not one Republican voted  for it.   Since then, we have been able to pass an infrastructure bill in a  bipartisan manner. We passed legislation trying to keep guns out of the  hands of mentally unstable people and generally help with that problem.  We have come together around Ukraine to help them beat the Russians. We  have come together to designate Russia as a state sponsor of terrorism.  My oligarch friend up there--the guy who hates oligarchs more than  anybody--we have come together to try to go after the assets of the  Putin cronies. So it is not like we can't work together. But what you  are not going to get from our side is buy-in on really bad ideas.   So to the American people, the same people telling you what this bill  is going to do are the same people who told you the American Rescue  Plan would work.   Let's go down memory lane here for a second. Here is what the Vice  President said about the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan passed in  March of 2021 with Democratic votes alone:         Help has arrived for the families that have struggled to       put food on their table, for the small businesses that have       struggled to keep their doors open. Help has arrived,       America.    This was said in 2021. She promised you help was on the way if you  pass the Democratic American Rescue Plan.   Here is what Senator Schumer said:         We have heard a lot about how the American Rescue Plan will       prime the American economy to come roaring back. Economists       are already projecting that economic growth could double as a       result of the American Rescue Plan.    March 16, 2021. I don't know where their economists are today, but I  hope they are not in the economy business because they sure as hell  didn't know what they were talking about.   So what has happened from those statements to now? Instead of help  being on the way, helping you put food on the table--see if that makes  sense to you. The American Rescue Plan has helped put food on the  table. Help is on the way for business.   In March of 2021, before the American Rescue Plan, inflation was at  2.6 percent. Today, it is at 9.1. Do you think it is an accident this  has happened? If you do, you probably shouldn't be driving. You are a  danger to yourself or others.   We told you--and by God, God knows the Republicans are by no means  perfect--but we told you what was going to happen, that we had a  struggling economy because of COVID, and this tax-and-spend, growing  the government, throwing money at everything, is going to come back to  bite us in the ass, and it did. Take a hundred bucks and go to the  grocery store and see what you get for it. You have to get a mortgage  on your house to fill up your car.   This is no accident. And the same people who told you then they had  it figured out for you are telling you something now that I think is  throwing gasoline on the fire that you are living with. That is why  every Republican will vote no. Senator Sanders is reluctantly going to  vote yes. I am going to enthusiastically vote no. I don't mind working  with Democrats when it matters and it helps, but this, to me, is  insane.    So here is where we find ourselves as a nation. We find ourselves as  a nation in a recession. If a Republican would be President, I doubt if  most of the media would doubt we are in a recession. It is defined as a  period of temporary economic decline during which trade and industrial  activity are reduced, generally identified by falling GDP in two  successive quarters. The first quarter was 1.6 negative growth; the  second quarter was 0.9. Over time, unfortunately, it is probably going  to get worse because we are going to have to raise interest rates to  control rampant inflation, and that is going to make it harder to  borrow money and invest in the economy.   On top of that, they are about to pass a bill without one Republican  vote that will take every problem they created in March and make it  dramatically worse.   Let's go down sort of what life is like in America right now. They  told you that help would be on the way, that the economy would double  if we passed their bill in March of 2021. It didn't quite work out that  way, did it? Gasoline has gone up 59.9 percent--it will eventually come  down because the economy is coming to a halt; 34 percent increase in  airfare, if you can get a plane to leave in the same month you schedule  it; electricity rates, 13.7; food, 10.4; chicken, 18.6; cereal, 14.2-- this is sort of what I eat; bacon--I love bacon--10.8 percent increase.   The bottom line is, the American Rescue Plan did not help your  family. It is not helping your business. It has taken every problem we  had from COVID and made it worse. And what is their solution? To do the  same thing all over again in a different way.   What is in this bill that makes me say that? When you ask people:  Does the Inflation Reduction Act reduce inflation--I mean, not me; not  any of the 50 of us; but just ask somebody who sort of like is supposed  to know what they are talking about, and they will tell you it does  not. The whole bill is a lie.   The American Rescue Plan should be called the American Recession  Plan, and this Inflation Reduction Act is a lie. It is not going to  reduce inflation in any meaningful way. We have the highest inflation  in 40 years. And here is what the Penn Wharton School of Business says:  that it has a negligible impact. The Manchin-Schumer bill is going to  make inflation worse.   Here is what Penn Wharton, University of Pennsylvania Business  School, said: ``Low confidence that legislation will have any impact on  inflation.'' Bill would actually cause inflation to rise until 2024.   These people could give a damn. Nobody is going to convince them to  stop taxing and spending as long as they have the ability to do it.   Penn Wharton--it was sort of the bible for Senator Manchin when he  stopped Build Back Better, and I am glad he did. But they are telling  him that what he and others are saying doesn't actually work.   CBO--supposed to be the bible, according to Senator Manchin--has a  negligible--I can't say that word--very little effect on inflation.  They said it would not reduce inflation in 2022 and inflation would go  up or down 0.1 percent in 2023.   These are the people who wrote the budget bible telling all of you  that what you are saying is not true, but you don't care. You could  care less.   So here is what the bill does. Here is why none of us are going to  vote for it.   How many of you think now is a good time to create a new gas tax? It  is not. So let me tell you what is in this bill. This bill has a 16.4  cents-per-barrel new gas tax on all imported oil and petroleum products  and all domestic crude refined in America, which will create billions  of dollars of new gas taxes at a time we need to have less gas taxes,  in my view.   So in the name of climate change, this bill increases gas taxes. It  brought back from the dead a 1995 tax that was 9.7 cents per barrel on  imported oil, increased it to 16.4 cents at a time of high gas prices,  and included domestic crude refined in America. Pennies become dimes,  and dimes become dollars.   So if you are looking to increase gas taxes, your ship has come in;  vote for this bill. If you think it is dumb as dirt to have a new gas  tax with this economy, vote for my amendment that comes up later.   What else does the bill do? It increases taxes. You have to be  shocked about that. It increases taxes by billions--hundreds of  billions--and they say it won't affect you. Well, the CBO analysis and  Penn Wharton said that the effect of the tax increases on business will  be passed down to people who make below $100,000 a year. Just think  about--does that make sense to you? You increase taxes on a business.  They pass it along to their customers. That is just sort of the way the  economy works.   The 15-percent minimum tax--how does that work? The tax eliminates  expensing for equipment and other items a business may purchase to grow  their business, which we created in 2017, in the same year you buy it.  So what does  [[Page S4151]]  CBO say about that? CBO says this bill will deincentivize purchasing  equipment and building factories.   Think about what I just said. You are about to push on the American  people another bill that will raise gas taxes and deincentivize  investment in the private sector in the area of equipment and factory  expansion at a time we need it the most.   What does this bill do on the healthcare front? ObamaCare subsidies  under this proposal will go to people making $304,100 as a couple for a  family of four. Let me ask you, is now the time to subsidize ObamaCare  for people making $304,000 a year? That is what is in this bill.   Now, here is my favorite part.   This bill has a plan to hire 87,000 new IRS agents--new ones. That is  enough to fill up the Rose Bowl. That is bigger than the British Army.  They are going to propose hiring 87,000 new IRS agents and they promise  you this is only going to go after the rich. You should not believe  that. This is an army of IRS agents who are going to go after everybody  about everything to fill the insatiable desire of our friends on the  other side to take money from you to spend up here.   There will be more new IRS agents than the British Army, the German  Army, the entire combined military of Canada, the French Air Force and  Navy--literally an army of new IRS agents, and you should worry about  what these people may do.   As I tried to tell people last time, the American Rescue Plan wasn't  going to rescue you; it was going to make your life worse. And it did.  We have 9.1 percent inflation, the highest in 40 years.   Senator Sanders is right. People are hurting out there. Let's work  together to help. But you are not helping anybody. At the time you  promised us help was on the way, inflation was at 2.6 percent. Because  of the help you gave the economy, it is at 9.1 percent.   Here is what we are trying to tell you over here. If this bill  passes, the problems you face today are going to get worse. And we will  remind you in November.   Prescription drugs--in this bill, they identify 15 drugs they are  going to have price controls on. They talk about the price in Canada.  Most new drugs come from this country, not Canada. So let's make Canada  pay more for the research and development done in our country to help  the world. That makes some sense to me. But price fixing is a socialist  idea that has never worked anywhere. Even Richard Nixon tried it. It  didn't work.   And during COVID, we should have learned one thing: The private  sector developed drugs to keep a lot of people alive and out of the  hospital, and I am glad they were able to do it. Operation Warp Speed  was a tremendous success, and it was done by the American  pharmaceutical industry.   After this exercise is over, the idea of new drugs coming online is  going to go down, and the socialist model that Senator Sanders embraces  is going to hurt innovation. He is a fine man, but he is a Democratic  socialist. This bill doesn't go far enough for him, but it goes way too  far for you.   As I am hoping and praying that one of you over there would agree  with me, let's don't raise gas taxes now; let's don't raise taxes on  business so they can invest in buying new equipment now; let's don't  spend a bunch of money subsidizing ObamaCare for people who make over  $300,000 now.   But that is probably what we are going to do unless we can convince  one person over there to reject this madness. I am telling you, ladies  and gentlemen throughout the country, this is madness. Our Democratic  friends, wherever too big, there is some plan to tax and spend on  something. They are nice people, but they consistently have a view  about what to do for the economy that is not working.   I beg and plead with one Democrat: Listen and learn from what you did  last time. Senator Manchin has been strong at times, but he voted for  the American Rescue Plan. He is telling us this will reduce inflation  when CBO says it will not. He is telling us that this will improve the  economy when Penn Wharton says it won't. No matter what anybody says,  they are hell-bent on doing this because they can. I hope after this  election, they can't do this anymore.   Here is what I think it is going to take: one Democrat admitting  maybe the American Rescue Plan didn't work and this won't work. Maybe  there is one among you. But if there is not, to the American people: In  November, I hope you will remember this. Help is not coming by passing  this bill. Help was not on the way by passing the American Rescue Plan.  Misery came from that massive tax-and-spend bill, and we are about to  pile misery on top of misery. We are about to increase gas taxes at a  time you can't afford it.   To my Republican colleagues: You should enthusiastically vote no. To  my Democratic colleagues: Apparently, you haven't learned a damn thing  about what you did last time.   I yield the floor.    Well, Madam President, we are off to the races, so I am  going to make this easy.   I raise a point of order that the pending amendment violates section  313(b)(1)(C) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 5301 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, to the Members of the body, if you think  America needs a new gas tax, then your ship has come in. Vote for the  Democratic bill because, believe it or not, these people over there  want to raise gas taxes right now.   The last time they tried to help you was the American rescue act. And  here is what the Vice President said: Help has arrived for the families  who have struggled to put food on their table, for the small businesses  that have struggled to keep their doors open. Help has arrived.   She said that in March. Inflation was 2.6 percent. Help has arrived.  It is 9.1 percent.   This bill will increase gas taxes 16.4 cents on every barrel of  imported oil and petroleum, and every barrel of crude oil found in  America, to be refined in America, will have an additional 16.4 cents- per-barrel-tax increase.   This is insane. This is stupid. If you like high gas prices, vote for  them. If you want to lower prices at the pump, vote for my amendment.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Thank you very much.   This gives phony and cynical a bad name. They wouldn't let you do  this in professional wrestling. If you think people are this dumb, you  are going to be sadly mistaken.   What she is doing is trying to strike the provisions that she just  voted against, but it requires 60 votes. So she can vote for repealing  a gas tax she just voted against so she will look good for the voters.   If you really wanted to repeal the gas tax, the new one indexed for  inflation, you should have voted for my amendment. What you are doing  is deceitful, dishonest, and we are going to call you out.    Mr. President, yes, I would urge a ``no'' vote simply  because we are living in a world where it is hard to get by. Growing  the government, I think, will create more inflation. Everything can't  be free because we all--it gets to be so free that you can't afford it.   So you are the same people that told us if we passed the American  Rescue Plan, all would be well. We are at 9.1 percent inflation. You  are increasing gas taxes. Now you want to expand Medicare. This is  going to hurt the American people. Stop the madness. Vote no.                     Vote on Amendment 5211, As Modified     Mr. President, I would urge a no. This has been tried  before by my colleague Senator Sanders. This would give hundreds of  thousands of people enlisting free housing, free food, transportation,  educational costs.   We have a weak economy. Every time I rise to speak, we ruin the  government in a different way. If you really want to help the American  people, secure their border. If you want to hire anybody new, hire a  Border Patrol agent, not 87,000 IRS agents, not a climate corps.   I know these are well-intentioned, but we are living in a very  tenuous time for the American people, and their needs are not being met  tonight. Every problem they have is being made worse. We don't need a  climate corps right now, quite frankly. We need to secure a broken  border before terrorists come across and kill a bunch of us.   Vote no.                          Vote on Amendment No. 5209     I don't want to get in the middle off you all's fight  over here, but am I supposed to read this or not?    The pending amendment No. 5262 offered by Senator Warnock  contains matters outside the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee.  Therefore, the amendment is extraneous, and I raise a point of order  against this amendment pursuant to Section 313(b)(1)(C) of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974.                               Motion to Waive     Mr. President, in the night or day--or whatever we have  been doing as the night has turned into day--of extremes, this is the  most extreme idea yet, and that is saying a lot.   Senator Sanders wants to destroy fossil fuel exploration at a time  you have got to get a mortgage on your house to fill up your car. So I  want you to understand what is being proposed: Shutting down American  fossil fuel exploration will make us more dependent on fossil fuels  that are in the hands of the bad guys. Gas is $4.08 a gallon right now.   This is the most dangerous idea tonight, today, for the American  consumer. If you are tired of paying high gas prices, then vote  Republican.                          Vote on Amendment No. 5281     Mr. President, I believe this violates the rules of  reconciliation. I make a point of order against page 744, line 7,  through page 755, line 4, in the substitute. This language violates  313(b)(1)(D) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.    Mr. President, I ask consent to make the following four  points of order en bloc.   The first point of order concerns page 43, lines 3 through 8. This  language violates section 313(b)(1)(A).   The second point concerns page 1, lines 3 through 5. This language  violates 313(b)(1)(A).   The third point concerns page 547, line 18, through page 548, line  25. This language violates section 313(b)(1)(A).   And the fourth point of order concerns page 689, lines 8 through 16.  This language violates section 313(b)(1)(D).
