 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of former  Knoxville City Council Member Larry Cox who passed away on October 18  at the age of 81.   Larry grew up in North Knoxville where he attended Fulton High School  and went on to serve for five terms on the city council.   Larry cared deeply about his community, the young and the old alike.  He led the Knoxville Falcons Youth Sports Organization and ended up  having the Larry Cox Senior Center named after him for his  contributions to our great community and to our senior citizens.   He was a dear friend to me and my predecessor, Representative Jimmy  Duncan. While I was in the Tennessee State Legislature and when I was  county mayor, Larry would always call on behalf of the constituents or  folks that he no longer represented, and they just needed some help.   He never called about anything for himself. He was always advocating  for those around him and his community. He gave back to his community  in every way he could, and he made such a positive impact on those  around him.   Larry is survived by his beautiful wife, Brenda; his daughter,  Brooke; his son, Shane; and his three grandchildren.   He will be deeply missed by his family and friends and missed by me,  as well, Mr. Speaker. Our community loved him very much, and he will be  very missed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
