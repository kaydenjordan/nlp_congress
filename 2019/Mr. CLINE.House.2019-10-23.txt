 Madam Speaker, Debbie Smith's courage to share her story  with the world has changed the lives of millions, and the law bearing  her name has helped countless victims of sexual assault see their  attackers face the justice they deserve.   The importance of DNA evidence in criminal investigations and  prosecutions is unquestionable. Since this program was first enacted,  incredible progress has been made to reduce DNA backlogs. In my home  State of Virginia, the FBI's National DNA Index contains more than  447,000 offender profiles and has aided in more than 11,000 criminal  investigations.   This legislation will reauthorize this vital program and will  continue to support State and local law enforcement agencies' efforts  to reduce DNA backlogs and analyze DNA evidence collected from crimes.   As a former prosecutor, I know all too well how critical DNA evidence  is to achieving justice for victims of sexual violence. I have been a  strong advocate to reauthorize this program. I signed the discharge  petition and spoke on this bill last month.   With passage of this bill today, we move a step closer to protecting  people from violent sexual predators and allow justice to be served  through our legal system.   It would have been better if we had taken up the Senate bill instead  of pointing fingers and casting blame, but I hope that we will pass  legislation quickly to get this grant money to the States and to those  agencies that need it to make sure that justice is served.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
