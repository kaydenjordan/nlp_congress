 Mr. President, I recognize the 10-year anniversary  of the Tampa Veterans Treatment Court and Veteran Mentors Program.   Among the largest veteran treatment courts in the nation, the Tampa  Veterans Treatment Court and Mentors Program was established in 2013  thanks to the efforts of retired U.S. Army COL DJ Reyes. The purpose of  the program is to help identify and provide the necessary U.S.  Department of Veterans Affairs treatments and counselling to veterans  whose involvement in the criminal justice system is often connected to  a condition or disorder incurred during their military service.   At the height of the program, the Tampa Veterans Treatment Court and  Mentors Program grew to more than 225 veteran defendants and more than  100 volunteer veteran mentors. The program currently enjoys a 90- percent graduation rate and is nationally recognized as the model for  newly formed veteran treatment courts.   In June 2019, Colonel Reyes was invited to both the White House and  Capitol Hill to brief policymakers on the success of the Tampa Veterans  Treatment Court and Mentors Program and in support of Federal  legislation to support State veteran treatment courts. This bill, the  Veteran Treatment Court Coordination Act of 2019, which I cosponsored,  was signed into law by President Trump in August 2020.   I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Colonel Reyes and  everyone associated with the Tampa Veteran Treatment Court and Mentors  Program for their work assisting our veterans and wish them many years  of continued success.                            ____________________
