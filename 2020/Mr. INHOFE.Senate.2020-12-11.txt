 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is my understanding that the minority  leader was going to be here, but we are getting very close to the time  we actually cast our vote at 10:30--just 20 more minutes. In the event  that the minority leader comes, I will dispense with my remarks and  defer to him.   It is my honor to present the 60th annual National Defense  Authorization Act. For 59 straight years--you can't say this about any  other piece of legislation, all year or anytime, except the Defense  authorization bill--we have passed this bill. We have passed this bill  every year for 59 years, and this will be 60 years, and I anticipate  that we will pass it now.   There isn't much that happens around the Capitol that has a track  record like that. Maybe I am biased, and maybe in some people's minds I  am wrong, but I think this is the most important bill of the year. I  really believe that. I have believed that since 1987, and this is  something that we have to do.   There is an old document nobody reads anymore called the  Constitution. In there it tells us what we need to be doing, and that  is exactly what we are going to be doing today: providing for our  defense.   So it is simple what this bill does. It makes our country more  secure. It supports our troops who defend it.   Right now this couldn't be more important. As President Trump's  national defense strategy tells us, we are up against the most serious  threats we have seen maybe forever. This is coming from China and  Russia, these countries who stand against everything America stands  for.   It bothers me that we went through the last 5 years of the Obama  administration--that would have been from 2010 through 2015--where he  criticized the military. We didn't have to have the military, he felt.   At this time, I would suspend with my remarks.    Let me know, and I will be glad to suspend.    Anyway, during that time, during the Obama  administration, during those 5 years, he reduced the funding for the  military by 25 percent. Now, this has not happened, in my memory. It  hasn't happened since World War II that we have gone through a 5-year  period of doing that.   And the tragedy is that during that same time, China was increasing  theirs by 83 percent. Stop and think about that--83 percent--when you  realize that we were reducing our expenditures by 25 percent while they  are increasing theirs by 83 percent. Now, that is serious enough, and  that is something that is very much a concern to many of us.   So we know that they were increasing, we were decreasing, and, as a  result, things happened. There are some things that they did-- hypersonics, for example. That is one of the most recent exercises that  is out there. They are actually, today, as we speak--they are ahead of  us. Both China and Russia are ahead of the United States of America in  hypersonics and that type of technology that is out there.   This President came along--and I know there is a lot of controversy  about this bill. I know that the President wanted to have something in  there that was having to do with language that had nothing to do with  the military. I agree wholeheartedly with him, but you can't. You have  got to have a defense authorization bill. Our kids in the field demand  it.   With the NDAA, we are implementing the policies and programs to make  sure that this doesn't happen, to ensure that America is able to  prevent and, if necessary, win wars of today and tomorrow.   At this point, I would like to defer to the minority leader, and I do  ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of his remarks that I be  recognized to make my remarks.    Mr. President, first of all, I did want to get some final  comments. I mentioned a minute ago and, of course, it is the right of  the leaders--Democratic and Republican leaders--to have the first time.  It is fine with me, but I just want to make one comment about it.   The minority leader was talking about what is going on right now and  who would be favored and all that. I think one of the things we don't  talk about, we should talk about. You know, I know the media doesn't  like our President, and a lot of things he has done he didn't get  credit for it.   One of the major things--and this is all going to come out-- unfortunately, this didn't come out before the election, but it should  have because there is--what do they call that? Warp speed? Is that  right? Yes, this Operation Warp Speed. This was back in June. The  President came out with this. General Perna was put in charge of it.   I wasn't prepared to talk about this, but I think it is important  right now that we do because I want to follow up with what the minority  leader talked about because everyone is concerned about it. They are  all concerned about the coronavirus and those things. This has never  happened in this country before. But it has happened. It had nothing to  do with this administration. They did a great job. And to demonstrate  what a great job they did, they had the Operation Warp Speed--this was  back in June of this year--and they put General Perna in charge of it.   I chair the Senate Armed Services Committee. They wanted us to have a  hearing on this. I was so excited. No one could have sat through that  hearing last June without coming to the conclusion that this thing is  going to be behind us. We are winning this thing. And you come to the  conclusion that we are going to have the virus under control. We are  going to have this system. We all know that is happening today, right  now, as we are speaking. We have several companies--five companies--who  have come so close, and they are now distributing the necessary  equipment so that people become immune to this thing. That is happening  right now.   It happens that even though this was last June--it was last June that  we had the hearing in my committee. Everything that they predicted,  that General Perna predicted at that time, is happening. They said by  December we would have it. Well, here it is, December, and we have got  it. And then we said it is going to take about 3 months to be able to  make the distribution around the country. And that time is coming up.  It is getting close to that time, and that is going to happen. I mean,  we are looking right now at April as the time that we have got this  thing defeated. And right now, this administration--I want to give them  credit for this. They have got this distribution system set up so it is  going to be going around the country, and this thing is going to come  to an end.   I have to tell you that the President is responsible for putting this  in place, and it is, right now, on schedule.   I don't want to take a lot of time. I see that Senator Reed has come  in. Senator Jack Reed is the ranking member on the Senate Armed  Services Committee. Let me just tell you, I can't think of anyone I  would rather have as a partner in putting together the Defense  authorization bill--the most important bill of all year--than Senator  Jack Reed. He has been there by my side, with me, working together.   We had a Big 4 meeting. We always end up with a Big 4 meeting. To  tell you what that is, that is the ranking Democrat and Republican in  the House, the Democrat and Republican in the Senate; and the four of  us get together and decide what are we going do, what is this going to  look like. And then we pass it. We passed this bill. It is a good bill.  It is one that we have the opportunity to vote on today, the most  important bill of the year. And if voting against it, you have to stop  and think about those kids who are out there in harm's way and the  threats that they are facing on a regular basis. This is a problem.  This is a serious thing that is out there. I can't imagine wanting to  have to face these people in the field, in harm's way, and say: Well,  we didn't pass the Defense authorization bill.   We are going to pass it. These kids are going to get the right  treatment that they need. They are going to get the resources they  need. I did mention just a few minutes ago about the previous  administration. I don't want people to misunderstand what I am saying.  [[Page S7437]]  I am not saying this critically of the Obama administration. I am  saying he didn't have the same priorities that many of us have. His top  priority was not defending America, in spite of what the Constitution  tells us what should be the top priority. And so we went through that  time with--as I mentioned, between the years of 2010 and 2015, 5 years,  reduced the funding for the military by 25 percent. At the same time,  China was increasing their funding for their military by 83 percent.  This is what we looked at, and that is what our President was faced  with. And that is why--I don't know who is ill-advising the President  to be concerned about an issue that has nothing to do with the  military. And I know that the President has been the strongest--I don't  know if there has ever been a President who has been a stronger  supporter of our military and our kids in harm's way than President  Trump. I am just looking at this now, and I am thinking, we are now 1  minute away from passing a bill that is the most significant bill.   At this time, I ask if the minority would like to make any comments  at all because I will tell you right now, I mentioned the names of all  the people who worked on this bill for the last year, and side by side  have been Senator Jack Reed and I in the leadership of this bill.   It is going to be a reality.   I want to thank you and give you an opportunity to get a last word in  here because we are going to vote on this in less than a minute.    Thank you, Senator Reed.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to waive the  mandatory quorum call.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  postcloture time on the conference report to accompany H.R. 6395 expire  at 12:30 today.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
