 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the National  Day of Silence this Friday, April 23.   It is a day when people around the country and in my community on the  central coast of California take a vow of silence to raise awareness  surrounding the many hurdles that LGBTQ youth face.   One of those students will be Lucia Umeki-Martinez. Lucia is a gay  woman of color and a student leader at Watsonville High School. As co- class president and member of the Sexuality and Gender Acceptance Club,  Lucia works to build bridges between her classmates and community.   She told me that taking the vow of silence for 1 day was her way of  paying tribute to those who have been silenced by homophobia and  hatred. It also is a way to show solidarity to those, like Lucia, who  have ever felt unwelcome or  [[Page H2034]]  unsafe in an environment where they are supposed to thrive.   Countless students across this country will take the vow of silence  on Friday for the same reasons as Lucia. That is why we as leaders must  continue to step up every day to ensure that all Americans, whoever  they are, are accepted and respected.                            ____________________
