 Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful that Representative Chris  Smith is a Member of the United States Congress because of his  leadership, because of his enormous heart, and his enormous caring.   It is amazing--those of us who believe in God--the way our lives  develop. I was a guy that grew up; I never liked to hug anybody. But  when we had three beautiful incredible girls added to my wife's and my  life, I became a hugger. Fox has a show named ``Outnumbered,'' but that  has been my life for years now.   I know there are so many people that say you are a man and you have  no right to speak about this. I guess, when I was a judge, there were  those who thought, since I was not a person that had been on both sides  of a civil lawsuit or had been a defendant in a case, maybe I should  not be able to say anything about or pass sentence. But we have laws,  and laws are there to protect people.   I do believe, as our Founders did, in nature's God, that we have a  Creator who provided us inalienable rights. But in this world, you have  to fight for any inheritance, including your inalienable rights.   It does appear that nature gave a greater percentage of women a  nurturing greater sense of loving and caring than most men. That gets  changed for some of us when you have a house full of girls.                                time  1800    But I could identify with the doctor who had performed, I think he  said, over 1,000 abortions, who came before our Judiciary Committee and  testified about how it was just a procedure, how it was nothing to him,  and how he would go into the uterus.   Of course, the pregnant mom was not dilated and not going to be able  to deliver a baby that had begun forming, had a heartbeat. But that is  why he would go in with his instrument, feel around with his clamps for  something that felt long, and when he found it, he knew that it was  either a leg or an arm, and he would grab it and pull it out from the  baby's body, and continue till he did that four times, and then reach  in and find something that felt bulbous, and he would--he knew the head  could not come out in a bulbous form, and so he would crush it and pull  out the baby's head. And that was the way he went about beginning the  abortion of a child that had begun developing like that.   He never thought a thing about it until his daughter died, and then  he became nauseated, and he was never able to do another abortion like  that, and it became such a burden that he had done what he had done.   I know from my years on the bench as a judge, I know from my years as  an attorney helping people, if something is built on a lie, the chances  are that the outcome will not be good for a majority of people. I also  know that if someone encourages and perpetuates a lie within some other  person's life, they are not that person's friend.   So I would like to quickly reference an article published by WND  called ``The Real `Jane Roe' '' and just hit some of the highlights  about the real Jane Roe, the woman.   I was talking with my friend, Chris Smith, about Norma McCorvey. He  is quite familiar with her, and I believe he said he had talked to her  and had come to know her. Being the Christian that Chris Smith is, he  cares deeply about people, and that included Norma McCorvey.   But this article says: ``At the age of 21, McCorvey was pregnant with  her third child. She had given her other two children up for adoption  and McCorvey did not want to say good-bye to her offspring a third  time. So she decided to have an illegal abortion, but the Dallas clinic  she went to had been recently raided and shut down. So McCorvey made up  a story--she had been raped, she told her doctor and two lawyers. She  signed an affidavit on condition of anonymity, and the lawsuit began.''   And she told WorldNetDaily: `` `I considered abortion and, because of  this, I was put in touch with two attorneys, Sarah Weddington and Linda  Coffee. They had just recently graduated from law school and were  interested in challenging the Texas abortion statute.' ''   She says: `` `Plain and simple, I was used.' '' This is Norma  McCorvey. `` `I was a nobody to them. They only needed a pregnant woman  to use for their case, and that's it. They cared, not about me, but  only about legalizing abortion. Even after the case, I was never  respected--probably because I was not an ivy-league educated, liberal  feminist like they were.' ''   But she goes on and says--well, this was from a New York Times  interview: ``McCorvey describes her meeting the two young attorneys. .  . .   `` `Sarah Weddington sat right across the table from me at Columbo's  pizza parlor, and I didn't know then that she had had an abortion  herself. When I told her then how desperately I needed one, she could  have told me where to go for it. But she wouldn't because she needed me  to be pregnant for her case. I set Sarah Weddington up on a pedestal  like a rose petal. But when it came to my turn, well, Sarah saw these  cuts on my wrists, my swollen eyes from crying, the miserable person  sitting across from her, and she knew she had a patsy. She knew I  wouldn't go outside of the realm of her and Linda. I was too scared. It  was one of the most hideous times of my life.' ''   She says: `` `My experience with pro-abortion leaders is that they  are snobs. They claim they care about women and their rights but, in my  experience, they care for nothing, not even themselves in a way,' ''  McCorvey said.   ``McCorvey said in a 1990 New York Times interview that the rape lie  caused her to be `terribly depressed.' ''   `` `I was brought up not to lie and, because of this story, I had to  lie all the time. And the depression periods got deeper and longer  until the night I cut my wrists.' ''   Well, it is one of the difficulties that attorneys have: when you  represent someone and you are sworn to do the best job you can, it  should be more than simply about getting the legal result that a lawyer  wants. It ought to be about helping the client. You can't always do  that.   But it is rather tragic that Jane Roe, Norma McCorvey, now looks back  on that as the most hideous time of her life, and that she was taken  advantage of by people that didn't care about her. They had an agenda.   I heard someone here on the floor talking about the Women's March and  how that was for all women, except the hypocrisy of that march was it  was not about all women because there were pro-life women that tried to  march. It was about women that think exactly like they do, and nobody  else gets to participate.   It is the same kind of mentality that would--when in the majority  here in this body say: We want everybody to participate in debate,  except we are  [[Page H672]]  going to have a record-setting number of closed rules so nobody can  debate. We don't want your input on ObamaCare. We don't care that you  support what we do on preexisting conditions and on kids living with  their parents.   Heck, some of us said 30 would be a better number than 26. They  didn't care. They could pass it without our votes. They didn't want our  input.   So then to hear people who treated us like that say we care about  open debate, knowing that some of those same people came down here and  grabbed microphones and, for the first time we can find in  congressional hearing, prevented the majority from starting into  session; and then they want to lecture us on openness and kindness and  open debate? Really?   Let's go back to the Norma McCorveys of the world. Let's minister to  them individually, as my church, as a number of ministries with which I  am greatly familiar do. Let's help the real person. Let's help that  child so that that little boy or that little girl doesn't have its arms  and legs jerked out of the uterus. Let's help that child have a life  that will be so full they will never think about slitting their wrists,  as Norma McCorvey did. Let's vote for life.
