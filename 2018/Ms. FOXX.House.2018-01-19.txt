 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mrs. Roby, for being a  leader in this area.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 4712, the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This is commonsense legislation to  strengthen, under penalty of law, the protection of infants who enter  the world alive after attempted abortions.   We agree, as my colleagues on the other side have pointed out, that  an infant born alive rightly has protection under the law and is, in  fact, a person. This was established by the Born-Alive Infants  Protection Act, signed into law by President Bush in 2002 after it was  passed by voice vote in this Chamber and by unanimous consent in the  Senate.   We need this bill because, in practice, babies fighting for their  lives after an attempted abortion are being denied treatment at the  hands of so-called physicians.   This law affirms and protects the survivors of abortions and ensures  that, just like every other baby who is born, these persons become  hospital patients and receive the same medical care as any other child  born in the United States, not left in the very hands of those who  sought to terminate their life.   Mr. Speaker, this is an unfortunately necessary bill to ensure  healthcare professionals comply with the Born-Alive Infants Protection  Act, and I urge my colleagues to vote to protect our Nation's most  vulnerable children and to affirm life by voting to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 2 minutes  a.m.), the House adjourned until today, Saturday, January 20, 2018, at  9 a.m.                            ____________________
