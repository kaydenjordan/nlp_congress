 Mr. President, I rise to offer my amendment noting that as  a result of Iran's recent ballistic missile strike against U.S. air  bases in Iraq, over 100 servicemembers have sustained traumatic brain  injuries, or TBIs, as a result of their proximity to the blasts.   It is vitally important that all U.S. Government personnel--military  and civilian--who incur such injuries be given the care they deserve  and that their medical records be properly annotated to ensure they  receive the care they are entitled to in the future.   My amendment recognizes the seriousness of these injuries and honors  those who will now have to deal with these wounds, possibly for the  rest of their lives.   I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.   I ask for the yeas and nays.
