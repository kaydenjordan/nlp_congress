 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening in strong support of H.R. 1123, the  Understanding Cybersecurity of Mobile Networks Act. It is bipartisan  legislation, and I am proud to have authored it.   Every single day Americans make calls, they send texts, and they  access data on 2G, 3G, and 4G networks.   Yet, we lack a comprehensive assessment of what vulnerabilities exist  on these networks, what issues have been resolved, and where mobile  cybersecurity policymaking should be focused.   That is what this legislation addresses. It requires the NTIA, as the  chairman said, in consultation with the Department of Homeland  Security, to  [[Page H1130]]  conduct a comprehensive study on the cybersecurity vulnerabilities of  these networks and report those findings to Congress.   Americans need to trust the networks that they use and know that  Congress is working to ensure that these networks are safe. This bill  will help us accomplish that.   I thank Congresswoman Kat Cammack for her partnership, and I urge all  of my colleagues to support the passage of H.R. 1123.   Mr. Speaker, I don't believe I have anyone on this side that wishes  to speak, and I yield back the balance of my time.
