 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend yielding time.   Mr. Speaker, this is a horror show today, this is a horror show  debate, and this is a horror show process, but it is a disaster for the  American people.   The tax bill we are debating today will abandon millions of American  families. It showers the wealthy and corporations with massive tax  cuts, and it adds $1.5 trillion to our deficits. The top 1 percent get  this massive payout in the neighborhood of $500 billion; hardworking  families get pocket change.   But millions don't even get that. In fact, 36 million middle class  families will pay more in taxes because of this bill. Our Republican  colleagues will be taking money out of the pockets of these families to  give more tax cuts to the rich.   But it doesn't stop there. It never does. This is part of a dangerous  three-step process that we have seen, unfortunately, far too often:   The first step, Republicans enact massive tax cuts for the rich,  claiming they will generate enough growth to pay for themselves. I know  my Republican colleagues desperately want the American people to  believe that this is what will happen. But the record is clear. It  failed in the 1980s, and it failed in the 2000s. It was an epic failure  in Kansas.   This is about politics, not reality, for them, which brings us to  step two. Once these cuts fail to produce the growth that they promise,  Republicans will shriek about the impending doom of high deficits and  debt. Then they will quickly move to step three, demanding cuts in  vital programs that benefit working families throughout our country.   We have seen this act before. As I said before, it is a horror show.  There is a reason why a lot of people are looking at this and saying  this is the great tax scam of 2017--because it is the great tax scam of  2017.
