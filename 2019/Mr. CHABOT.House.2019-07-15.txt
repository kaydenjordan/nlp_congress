 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Cambodia Democracy  Act introduced by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), and I would  note that I happen to be the co-chair of the Congressional Cambodian  Caucus, along with the gentleman from California, Alan Lowenthal. He  and I, a Republican and a Democrat, have worked on this particular  issue for many years now.   So, I certainly thank the committee for moving forward with this very  good and helpful piece of legislation.   The people of Cambodia have been living under the iron-fisted rule of  Hun Sen, as the chairman mentioned, for, literally, decades. Under his  reign, he has denied Cambodians almost all of their political rights  and prevented free and fair elections from taking place.   In recent years, Hun Sen has resorted to violence and attacked  peaceful protesters many times. He has undermined any sense of  democracy by dismantling the country's only viable opposition party.   The work of NGOs has also been dramatically limited, and critical  media outlets have been virtually shut down.   Like many other dictators, he fears the day when he will no longer be  in power.                                time  1630    As the beacon of hope and freedom to the rest of the world, a key  pillar of our foreign policy must be to support the expansion of  democracy in other countries. That is why I am very, very proud to  support and cosponsor the Cambodian Democracy Act.   This bill pushes back on Hun Sen's regime by applying asset-blocking  sanctions on any government officials or security forces who undermine  the democratic process or take part in human rights abuses. This  legislation also codifies visa restrictions for these individuals.   This is a strong, bipartisan bill that will allow us to show our  support for the people of Cambodia and their desire for democratic  governance. Members of both parties should support this important piece  of legislation. I would fully expect them to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman Yoho; I want to thank  Mr. Engel and Mr. McCaul as well, for introducing this bill, and for  all of their work on behalf of the Cambodian people. I certainly  appreciate their support on this.   Supporting democracy abroad is very important, really a critical  endeavor. The world will be a more peaceful and prosperous place with  the expansion of free markets and free people.   I would urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am glad that we  were there Friday night and not Saturday night. I know you had some  electrical difficulties in the city the following evening. I am glad we  weren't there then.  [[Page H5805]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 277, the Access to Sufficient Capital for  Everyone in Natural Disaster Areas Act of 2019, as also known as the  ASCEND Act.   I want to thank the gentleman from New York, as well as the  chairwoman of the committee, Ms. Velazquez, for their bipartisan  cooperation on the committee. It is probably one of the most, if not  the most, bipartisan committee in Congress. We really do work together  on behalf of small business; so I would like to thank the gentleman  and, as always, Ms. Velazquez.   When natural disasters strike the Nation, the U.S. SBA, the Small  Business Administration, leads the government's long-term recovery  efforts through its Disaster Loan Program. This program, which offers  low-interest and fixed-rate financing to individuals and businesses,  helps communities and neighborhoods as they recover and rebuild.   To assist disaster victims quickly and efficiently, the SBA offers an  initial unsecured loan disbursement of $25,000 to qualified victims.  However, after November, that was going to drop to 14,000, and this  reduced loan level would conflict with the disbursement levels  attributed to all other declared disasters.   Immediately after a catastrophe, and when victims need help the most,  loan levels across the SBA's Disaster Loan Program should be clear and  consistent. So H.R. 277, this bill, codifies the $25,000 unsecured loan  limit for Physical Damage Loans under an SBA Agency disaster  declaration.   I would, again, like to thank my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle for their cooperation in attaining this effort, and I urge my  colleagues to support the ASCEND Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5806]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This commonsense legislation passed out of our committee unanimously  and will allow the SBA to be nimbler and more responsive to survivors  of a natura disaster, so I would urge my colleagues to support it.    I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 2142. This legislation offered by committee  members Mr. Delgado of New York and Dr. Joyce of Pennsylvania make  important changes to the SBA Office of the National Ombudsman that will  make it easier for small businesses to comply with Federal regulations.   Congress established the Office of the National Ombudsman in 1996 to  assist small businesses, small government entities, and small  nonprofits when they are subject to excessive enforcement by a Federal  agency. Excessive enforcement may include repetitive audits or  investigations, excessive fines, penalties, threats, retaliation, or  other unfair enforcement action.   This simple and commonsense bill would require the ombudsman to  create a public website to provide the compliance guides required by  section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act,  or SBREFA. Mr. Speaker, these compliance guides help small firms better  understand how to comply with the most onerous Federal regulations.  Housing them at one spot on the ombudsman's website is an easy way to  save a small business a significant amount of time.   It is a good bill. I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Joyce), the ranking member of our  Rural Development, Agriculture, Trade, and Entrepreneurship  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, this is yet another example of how our  committee continues to work across the aisle for the benefit of  America's small businesses. We do it in a bipartisan manner, and I want  to thank Mr. Delgado and the doctor, as well, for their leadership on  this.   I urge the bill's adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2331, the SBA Cyber Awareness  Act.   In June 2015, the Office of Personnel Management, or OPM, discovered  that background investigation records of current, former, and  prospective Federal employees and contractors had been stolen from  their system. That data breach affected 21.5 million individuals.  Earlier in 2015, OPM discovered that the personal data of 4.2 million  current and former Federal Government employees had also been stolen.  This is absolutely unacceptable, and we must hold agencies accountable  to secure their networks.   While a much smaller agency, the SBA maintains important and  sensitive data about loan recipients, government contractor  information, and various other forms of personally identifiable  information that hackers covet. That is why I am happy to support Mr.  Crow's and Mr. Balderson's legislation, H.R. 2331, the SBA Cyber  Awareness Act. This legislation mirrors legislation introduced in the  last Congress by Senators Rubio and Cardin.   The bill directs the SBA to issue reports that assess its  cybersecurity infrastructure, including determining the country of  origin of its IT components, and report cyber threats, breaches, and  cyberattacks.   This is a commonsense, bipartisan bill, and I urge my colleagues to  support the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I just want to thank Mr.  Balderson and Mr. Crow for working together in a bipartisan manner on  this very important legislation.   I know Mr. Balderson wanted to be here today to speak on this.  Unfortunately, I believe he had some airline issues, but I believe he  will be submitting a statement for the Record.   But again, we appreciate both Mr. Balderson and Mr. Crow's leadership  on this.                                time  1700    We have seen a large increase in cybersecurity threats against not  only the private sector, but also the public sector. We must remain  vigilant to ensure the public's data does not end up in the wrong  hands.   This bipartisan legislation ensures that the SBA is better equipped  to protect American citizens' data.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1649, the Small Business  Development Center Cyber Training Act of 2019.   Information technology is a necessity for small businesses, because  it arms them with the tools they need to be competitive in the global  economy.   Unfortunately, small businesses are increasingly popular targets for  cybercriminals. The average cost of a cyberattack on a small business  is over $30,000, which can destroy, literally, a small business.   That is exactly why Ms. Velazquez, Mr. Evans, and I introduced H.R.  1649, the Small Business Development Center Cyber Training Act of 2019.   This bipartisan legislation establishes a cyber counseling  certification program in lead SBDCs to better assist small businesses  with planning and implementing cybersecurity measures to defend against  cyberattacks.   The cyber assistance offered by trained staff at SBDCs would be  provided at no or low cost to small businesses.   Cyber planning assistance will encourage small businesses to take a  more proactive approach to defending themselves from cyberattacks by  leveraging the expertise from SBDCs and their partner agencies and  institutions. This bill utilizes existing Federal resources to cover  the reimbursement costs.   We recognize cyber threats are ever-evolving and will continue to  work with industry to ensure that appropriate staffing needs are met.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers, so I would be  happy to close at this time if it is acceptable to the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard from small business owners, cybersecurity  experts, and government officials, and there is no question that  improving cybersecurity for America's small businesses should be an  urgent priority for small firms.   Over the past few years, the Federal Government has stepped up its  efforts to both prevent and mitigate cyberattacks by coordinating and  distributing cybersecurity resources directly to small businesses.   This commonsense legislation would continue our efforts to ensure  small firms can access needed information from SBDCs to help prevent  and respond to cyberattacks.   Mr. Speaker, I urge this bill's adoption. I want to again thank the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans) for his leadership on this, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2345, the Clarifying the Small  Business Runway Extension Act.   This important bipartisan legislation holds the SBA accountable for  implementing the will of Congress.   In the previous Congress, this committee undertook a deep-dive  examination of the effects of entering the middle market on small  contractors, and the Runway Extension Act of 2018 was the direct result  of these actions.   It was clear, under no uncertain terms, that the intent of the bill  was to apply to the SBA's own calculation of its receipts-based size  standards to small firms. However, the SBA took an opposing view, which  resulted in a conflict between law and regulation.                                time  1715    H.R. 2345 is critical in that it mitigates this confusion and  restates the original intent of the Small Business Runway Extension Act  of 2018 to make clear that the law does, in fact, apply to the Small  Business Administration.   Additionally, H.R. 2345 responds to concerns raised by small  businesses and stakeholders after the bill's passage, such as its  effect on declining-revenue businesses and the need to provide the  executive branch and small businesses time to adjust to the new rule.  The transition plan offered by this bill will make significant strides  in easing the path for small businesses and Federal agencies alike.   I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber) and the gentleman  from Maine (Mr. Golden) for their leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber), the ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Contracting and Infrastructure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to reiterate that H.R. 2345 is important  not only to help small contractors once they graduate, but it also  holds the SBA accountable to the will of the people through an act of  Congress.   Small businesses have told us they need a runway to grow and they  need that runway now. We need to ensure that this is done, that the SBA  takes swift action. H.R. 2345 gets us there.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
