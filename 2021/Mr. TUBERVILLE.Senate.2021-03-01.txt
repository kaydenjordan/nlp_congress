 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today to speak on the Senate  floor for the first time as a U.S. Senator from the great State of  Alabama.   I want to share some thoughts on how we can work together as a team  to improve the lives of our constituents and to provide more  opportunity for the next generation of Americans, but before I begin, I  want to take a moment to thank the people of Alabama.   For the last 2 years, I have traveled the State, from Mobile to  Muscle Shoals, from the Wiregrass to Lake Guntersville, and many places  in between. I talked to folks from all walks of life. Mostly, I  listened, which is something we can all do better. I listened to  people's hopes, and I listened to their concerns. I heard what they  thought was going right in our country and State and what they thought  was going wrong, and even after being a football coach my entire  career, working day and night, running for the Senate was still the  hardest thing I have ever done, but I enjoyed every minute.   In the end, I asked the people of Alabama to trust me with the  responsibility of representing them here in Washington, and they did.  It is humbling. It is an opportunity to serve my country that I  respect, cherish, and will always honor. My staff and I will work hard  every day to live up to that trust.   Like the Presiding Officer, my constituents sent me to Washington to  represent them and to help make their lives better. I recognize we all  have our differences, but we are all on the same team. We have got an  offense and a defense, but at the end of the day, we are still on the  same team. One of the things we can do together as a team is to create  more opportunity for more people. In my view, that starts with  education.   I have been an educator, a coach, and a mentor to young people for 40  years. I recruited 18- to 19-year-olds from all over the country and  all walks of life. I saw how they lived. I was a father figure to  hundreds of young men who had one or no parents. I coached young people  from all backgrounds--rich, poor, and everybody in between. I mentored  young people of all races, religions, and economic backgrounds.   As someone who has had a chance to travel across the country and this  globe for my career, I have seen how other people live. One thing I  have learned is that education is the key to freedom--the key to  freedom--the freedom to live the life you want. I have seen firsthand  how education can give you a leg up and a way out. It is a way to  achieve the American dream. When we empower our young people with a  quality education, we give them the gift of an opportunity, the  greatest gift our country can give our citizens. And what I found out  as a coach is that, when people are given an opportunity to better  themselves, they usually take it.   I think I can safely say I have been in more public schools than any  Senator ever. Too often, I have found that we are failing our young  people by not providing the quality education they deserve. It is not  about money; it is about people; it is about what we value and what we  teach. Improving education in this country should be one of the, if not  the top, priorities we have. That is why I am proud to be a new member  of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. On the  HELP Committee, we need to work together as a team to do three things.   First, we need to recognize that parents and teachers know how to  best educate our young people in their communities because we are all  different. The Federal Government does not need to tell parents in  Alabama how to teach their kids. We don't need a one-size-fits-all  education curriculum. What works in San Francisco will not necessarily  work in Scottsboro, AL.   Second, we should recognize that education takes many forms. Not  every student in America needs to go to a 4-year college or university.  To ensure our country remains competitive in the 21st century, we need  to promote STEM education to those students who have an interest in  math and science, but to remain strong, this country also needs  welders, plumbers, nurses, equipment operators, electricians, and  craftsmen. These are jobs that have excellent pay and great futures. If  the Democrats want to pass a massive infrastructure bill, they need to  first ask: Who is going to build it? That is why I will be looking for  any opportunity to support career technical programs that prepare a  skilled workforce. Our goal should be to restore America to a country  that makes things again.   No. 3, we have got to start teaching our young people moral values  again. That starts with putting God and prayer back in our schools. Our  kids need structure, and they need to learn right from wrong. I have  watched everything that has happened in education over the past few  decades from a front-row seat on my sideline as a coach. It is  embarrassing. As a person who chooses to spend their career in  education, I now have the opportunity to say something as a U.S.  Senator.   Our young people are our No. 1 hope for this country's future. If we  don't recognize that, we are going to lose our country as we know it.  As of 2018, the United States is 13th in the world for reading, 18th  for science, and we are 36th in the world for math. That is  unacceptable.   This country was built on hard work. It was built on competition,  whether it is business or individual. Education and athletics teach you  how to compete, how to have grit, determination, and to work together  as a team. Now, you can learn everything you want from books, but if  you don't learn to persevere and compete, it is hard to succeed.   Some people in this country think that you are owed something simply  because you live in the United States of America. This country doesn't  owe you a job or a paycheck. This country only owes you one thing, and  that is an opportunity, but what is great about this country is that it  also gives you the opportunity to fail. That might sound a little funny  coming from a football coach who spent his entire career trying to win,  but here, if you fail, this country will give you a chance to get back  on your feet and try to succeed again and again. You don't get that  opportunity in most countries on God's green Earth.   That being said, I appreciate the opportunity to serve with  Chairwoman Murray and Ranking Member Burr, and I look forward to  getting down to work and returning education to one of our top  priorities.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
