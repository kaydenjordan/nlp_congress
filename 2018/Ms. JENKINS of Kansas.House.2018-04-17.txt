 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5440) to require notice from the Secretary of the  Treasury in the case of any closure of a Taxpayer Assistance Center, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5440         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. NOTICE FROM IRS REGARDING CLOSURE OF TAXPAYER                     ASSISTANCE CENTERS.         Not later than 90 days before the date that a proposed       closure of a Taxpayer Assistance Center would take effect,       the Secretary of the Treasury (or the Secretary's delegate)       shall--        (1) make publicly available (including by non-electronic       means) a notice which--        (A) identifies the Taxpayer Assistance Center proposed for       closure and the date of such proposed closure, and        (B) identifies the relevant alternative sources of taxpayer       assistance which may be utilized by taxpayers affected by       such proposed closure, and        (2) submit to Congress a written report that includes--        (A) the information included in the notice described in       paragraph (1),        (B) the reasons for such proposed closure, and        (C) such other information as the Secretary may determine       appropriate.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5440, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Taxpayer Assistance Centers, or TACs, are taxpayer  service facilities operated by the IRS across the country. In 2017,  more than 350 TAC locations provided face-to-face services to more than  3.2 million taxpayers.   TACs can assist taxpayers in making payments, answering questions  about their account, and other services. These offices provide valuable  services for taxpayers to assist them in fulfilling their tax  responsibilities. TAC employees are often the only face taxpayers see  in their routine interactions with the IRS.   As the IRS has moved more services online, the agency has made  numerous changes to the operations of TACs. Last year, all TACs  nationwide moved to an appointment system that drastically cut down on  wait times.   H.R. 5440 provides important improvements and transparency for the  millions of taxpayers who visit TACs every year. This important bill  ensures that impacted communities are provided at least 90 days notice  prior to the closure of a TAC.   Late last year, the TAC in Huntsville, Alabama, closed suddenly. This  closure created problems for taxpayers right at the start of filing  season.                                time  1330    Local taxpayers did not know that the office had closed, with some  driving 50 miles to the TAC, only to find a sign on the door directing  them to another office 70 miles away. As you can imagine, this can be  incredibly disruptive for all taxpayers, but particularly those in  rural areas. Fortunately, last month, the office recently reopened,  albeit at significantly reduced hours.   The requisite 90 days' advance public notice under this bill is  required to be both through online means, but also nonelectronic means  as well. This can be accomplished through the use of local news or  radio, posting notice at the local library, or other methods. This  notice must provide information on alternative ways for taxpayers to  obtain assistance.   Today, ensuring the IRS can address the needs of taxpayers wherever  they are is critically important, while the IRS needs flexibility to  allocate scarce resources. This bill marks an important step to  providing transparency for those impacted.   I would like to thank my colleagues, Congresswoman Karen Handel and  Congressman  Tom O'Halleran, for their time and attention on this  important issue.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. Handel), who has provided great  leadership on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, having no further speakers, I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H3366]]    I want to again thank Congresswoman Karen Handel and Congressman  Tom  O'Halleran for their leadership on this issue.   H.R. 5440 provides important transparency regarding closure of TACs  to ensure that the public is notified and provided with information on  how they can get the help they need from the IRS.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5446) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to  restrict the immediate sale of seized property by the Secretary of the  Treasury to perishable goods, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5446         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. RULES FOR SEIZURE AND SALE OF PERISHABLE GOODS                     RESTRICTED TO ONLY PERISHABLE GOODS.         (a) In General.--Section 6336 of the Internal Revenue Code       of 1986 is amended by striking ``or become greatly reduced in       price or value by keeping, or that such property cannot be       kept without great expense''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section       shall apply to property seized after the date of the       enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 5446, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, as most of us are aware, the IRS has the ability to  seize and sell a taxpayer's property to satisfy unpaid taxes.   However, given the profound impact of such a move on the taxpayer's  livelihood, well-defined safeguards govern these seizures.   Nonetheless, the Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee discovered  last year that there are ways for the IRS to legally circumvent these  protections.   While IRS auctions typically require a 10-day advance notice and the  establishment of minimum bid requirements to ensure profits sufficient  to cover the unpaid taxes, the IRS can forego these requirements by  deeming seized goods as perishable.   Under current law, perishable goods are defined as those that are  likely to go bad, become greatly reduced in price or value by keeping,  or cannot be kept without great expense to the IRS.   If the IRS deems the goods seized to be perishable, it can sell them  on the same day without any minimum bid requirements. This streamlined  process can lead to seized goods being sold for significantly less than  a normal auction would allow.   H.R. 5446, the bill before us, puts in place much-needed safeguards  on the same-day seizure and sale of a taxpayer's property.   While we are discussing this bill today, I would like to talk a  little bit about the Oversight Subcommittee's findings that led us to  this point.   Last year, the subcommittee first became aware of this issue after  local news reports from Dallas, Texas, brought to light the 2015  seizure of a bridal shop, including dresses and sewing machines.   These goods were then sold immediately at auction within hours of  their seizure. This left the owners with no means of earning an income  going forward, while not fully satisfying their tax debts.   Now, common sense would tell us that this sale was not in the best  interest of the couple, whose livelihood was ruined, or the IRS, who  did not fully collect the amount owed.   Further investigation by the subcommittee also found that there were  at least eight other instances of small businesses being liquidated  using the perishable goods designation in the past few years.   In only two of the cases did there appear to be any foods offered as  part of the sale.   The subcommittee concluded that while the IRS' use of this authority  is limited, when it is used, the goods sold under this designation are  typically the contents of a small business and are almost never in  danger of immediately going bad.   To give you an idea of what I am talking about, the IRS designated  things such as sporting goods, artwork, scrapbooking materials,  automotive supplies, and workout equipment as perishable.   Now, I don't know about you, but when I think of things that are  likely to go bad, I think of things that we produce in my home State of  Kansas, like meat or dairy products.   As a result, this commonsense bipartisan bill limits the IRS' ability  to seize and immediately sell a taxpayer's property to only cases where  the seized goods are actually likely to go bad.   I would like to thank the bill's sponsors, Congressman Ferguson and  Congressman Crowley, for all of their hard work on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bipartisan bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Ferguson), one of the leaders on this  issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank Congressman Drew Ferguson and  Congressman Joe Crowley for their leadership on this issue.   H.R. 5446 further strengthens the safeguards in place to ensure that  goods being sold immediately are limited to those that are likely to go  bad.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
