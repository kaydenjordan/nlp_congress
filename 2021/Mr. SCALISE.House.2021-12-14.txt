 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the underlying legislation that we  are trying to bring to the floor which, if we defeat the previous  question, would actually come up to confront a major problem facing  families.   If you look over the last few weeks, Mr. Speaker, this Congress has  done a lot of things. It has spent a lot of money. There was a bill  just 2 weeks ago to raise over $4.5 trillion in taxes and new spending,  which would fuel inflation even higher.   What families across America are telling us is: Why doesn't Congress  work for those families who are struggling?   Why doesn't Congress work to confront the challenges they are facing  every single day?   It seems as if this majority is tone-deaf to the real problems that  are hurting families today. It is inflation, and it is the spending in  Washington that is driving that inflation. And one of those leading  indicators is the high price of gasoline because it is something that  maybe multiple times a week families have to go fill up their car. They  pay over $150 to do it, and they can't afford it.   So we have a bill to actually do something about that, something we  haven't seen on this floor for weeks. It is a bill to actually confront  a crisis that was created by this President. Unfortunately, there are  crises after crises that have been created by President Biden.   One of those is an energy crisis self-created by President Biden.  When he walked in the door prices were 40 to 60 percent less for  gasoline. When you go to the grocery store everything is more  expensive, Mr. Speaker; and if you are shopping for Christmas, things  are more expensive if you can even find those gifts that you want to  put under the tree.   So here we bring a bill, if we are able to defeat this previous  question, to confront one of these challenges. And that is how this  President has abused the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve is not supposed to be a piggy bank to cover  up for the failed policies of the Biden administration. Yet that is  what they have done.   Mr. Speaker, when you saw the President raid the SPR the other day,  we actually had an increase in prices because people recognize this  President isn't serious about addressing the problem.   This bill by Republican Leader McMorris Rodgers of the Energy and  Commerce Committee, as well as Fred Upton, myself, and others would  force the Departments of the Interior and Energy to confront this  crisis.   By the way, when President Biden goes and begs OPEC and Russia to  produce more oil, how about we start here at home where we have  actually got a surplus?                                time  1345    We were exporting oil to our friends all around the world, helping  our friends geopolitically. And that was undermined when President  Biden cut off the Keystone pipeline, cut off production on Federal  lands, but he greenlighted the Russian pipeline. He begged OPEC to  produce more oil, which, by the way, emits more carbon if that is what  you are concerned about.   Mr. Speaker, why don't we focus on those things that will help  American jobs and help lower carbon emissions? That is producing more  American energy, and do you know what else it does? It lowers the price  of gasoline. I urge rejection of the previous question.
