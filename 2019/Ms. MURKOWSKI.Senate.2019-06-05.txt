 Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak in  strong support of the nomination of Ms. Susan Combs, of Texas, to be  Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management, and Budget at the  Department of the Interior.   This is one of five Assistant Secretary positions at Interior, and,  as the title suggests, it is critical to the Department's ability to  function. The individual who holds this position is responsible for  overseeing everything from the annual budget request to financial  management, procurement, and policy and program analysis.   The President's nominee, Susan Combs, is very well qualified. She has  previously served as a State representative, as agriculture  commissioner, and as comptroller in her home State of Texas. Over the  years, Ms. Combs has worked extensively with the Department of the  Interior, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which has  helped her gain substantive expertise about a range of issues that she  will face in her new role.   My only wish is that we could have confirmed Ms. Combs long ago.  Instead, due to holds and delays here on the Senate floor, she  ultimately had to be reported from the Energy and Natural Resources  committee on three separate occasions--in 2017, in 2018, and again this  year. She is not controversial. Each time, we reported her with  bipartisan support. But she has now been forced to wait for a total of  nearly 700 days for confirmation, meaning she will have held up for  longer than she will be able to serve, at least in the current term.   I appreciate Ms. Combs' willingness to serve our country. I  appreciate her patience over the course of nearly 2 full years, which  is testament to just how broken the nominations process had become, and  her commitment to see this through. I also thank Leader McConnell for  scheduling this vote and encourage every Member of this Chamber to vote  in favor of confirmation.
