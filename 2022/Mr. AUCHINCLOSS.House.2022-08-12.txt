 Mr. Speaker, the Inflation Reduction Act represents  the biggest climate action in history and rightfully boosts offshore  wind production to meet our renewable energy goals.   First, the bill provides a $10 billion investment tax credit for  clean energy manufacturing facilities. This will benefit wind turbine  manufacturers, propelling a nascent industry that will create jobs and  clean energy both in Massachusetts and across the country.   Further, the bill provides additional tax support to manufacturing  projects located in energy communities, including those that previously  housed coal power plants, like Brayton Point in my district. Offshore  wind farms that connect to wholesale electric grids in such communities  should be eligible for this additional support, as well, to maximize  these credits' impact.   The Inflation Reduction Act is a generational step forward in taking  on Big Oil and Gas and driving our Nation toward a clean energy future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to join me in passing this bill.
