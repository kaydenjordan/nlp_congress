 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  4521, the America COMPETES Act.   We stand at a defining moment for the future of American  manufacturing and our global competitiveness. If we fail to act, we put  both our economic security and our national security at risk.   This bold, comprehensive package, which includes several of my  bipartisan bills, will create good-paying American jobs through  investments to boost American manufacturing, bring our supply chain  home, and keep America at the forefront of innovation and technology.   The bill includes $52 billion in funding, including $2 billion for  legacy automotive chips, to address the semiconductor chip shortage  that has crippled the auto industry and shut down plants in my  district. It invests in domestic production of critical medicines and  PPE and meaningfully addresses rising prices for everyday goods.   In Michigan and across the Nation, too many Americans have been  impacted and are counting on our fixing this. By passing the America  COMPETES Act, we will solidify our future leadership around the globe  and strengthen our workforce here at home.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.
