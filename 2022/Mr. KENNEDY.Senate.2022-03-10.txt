 Madam President, I call up my amendment number--and  Senator Cassidy's amendment No. 4983 and ask that it be reported by  number.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be  recognized for up to 2 minutes of debate; Senator Cassidy for 1 minute  of debate; and Senator Schatz for 2 minutes of debate prior to the  vote.    Madam President, in 2020, Hurricane Laura hit Louisiana,  [[Page S1110]]  then Hurricane Marco hit us, then Hurricane Delta hit us, then  Hurricane Zeta, then Hurricane Ida--all in a period of 2 years.   Those storms caused $150 billion in damage. My amendment and Senator  Cassidy's amendment will appropriate $2.5 billion in disaster aid to  Louisiana. That would include $600 million for housing aid for  Hurricanes Laura and Delta and $1.4 billion in housing aid for  Hurricane Ida. The amendment would also provide for $500 million in  funding to rebuild Louisiana ports.   I am mindful of the fact that we should make sure this aid is paid  for. I would remind everyone that through the heroic efforts of Senator  Schatz and Senator Cantwell, in which I played a small part, that we  forced our FCC not to give away the C-band to our telecommunications  industry and, instead, auctioned it out, in which case it brought in  $81 billion.   And I think we can spare a little bit of that for people who lost  their homes and businesses through no fault of their own.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
