 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, with the Christmas  season upon us, a favorite tradition in my family every year is to sit  around the television and watch one of our favorite movies, ``It's a  Wonderful Life.'' Like most people, it is hard not to get a lump in  your throat at the end as George Bailey and his family prove  triumphant.   But it occurred to me this week in reading the Republican tax plan  that I guess not everyone roots for George Bailey when watching that  movie. There are a few people pulling for Mr. Potter.   Well, here we have a tax plan that is written for and to the benefit  of Mr. Potter and the rest like him: the wealthiest one-tenth of 1  percent. The richest 1 percent in our country are going to get 83  percent of the money in this tax plan, and the wealthiest one-tenth of  1 percent will get the majority of the money in this plan.   Today, do you know how much you have to make in order to be in the  wealthiest one-tenth of 1 percent in our country? $5 million a year or  more.   So the Mr. Potter we have in the White House these days is going to  be pretty happy, and his family is going to make out. But the working  people of Pennsylvania and the working people of America are getting  stiffed.   Income inequality is higher today than at any point in American  history. Many Americans haven't received a pay raise in decades, in  real terms, and here we have a tax plan that is going to take that  existing problem and make it much worse.   This is wrong. This is unfair. It does nothing for the hard-pressed,  hardworking middle class of our country who deserve a pay raise.   Let's give them a Christmas gift. Let's give them the happy ending  that they deserve, the Hollywood movie ending. Let's say that the Mr.  Potters of this country have had it damn good for the last 20 years,  and let's help out the George Baileys, especially at this  Christmastime.   Let's say ``no'' to this tax bill.
