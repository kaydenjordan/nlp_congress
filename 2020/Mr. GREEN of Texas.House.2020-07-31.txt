 And still I rise, Mr. Speaker.   It is my honor to stand here in the House of Representatives. It is  my honor to be a Member of this Congress, and I am grateful to the many  persons who made great sacrifices so that I would have this  opportunity.   Today I would like to use this opportunity to make an appeal to my  colleagues, to my friends, and to people who are within the sound of my  voice. I want to make an appeal to persons to please take the  coronavirus seriously. I ask that you take it seriously because it is  not a joke. It is not a laughing matter. People are dying. We have had  over 150,000 deaths in this country. It is not a laughing matter. We  have had over 4 million cases in this country. It is not a hoax. It is  real.   I am asking my friends, my colleagues, and those who are within the  sound of my voice, please, let's do what we can to protect ourselves  and others. I beg that we would please wear the face mask. Let us wash  our hands. Let us maintain the distancing.   I know that it won't happen all of the time. We can have a memory  lapse. We might just rush out of the house and not have our mask on.  But let's not, with intentionality, leave home without it. Let's not,  with intentionality, mix and mingle with the persons around us without  a mask on. Let us, with intentionality, do all that we can to protect  ourselves and others.   This virus is not relenting at this time. It is relentless. Hospital  ICU beds in many places in hot spots around the country are at  capacity.   We see evidence that this virus is going to continue for a while  longer. I don't know how long. I am not sure anybody does. But I do  know that we ought not take it lightly, that we ought not allow persons  who are within our space, our personal space, if you will, to catch it  from us. I don't want to give it to someone, and I would trust that no  one would want to give it to me.   So let's be sensible. Let's be responsible. Let's honor the protocols  that we have set here in the House of Representatives. Let's honor the  protocols to social distance.   I know it is difficult. I won't pretend that I keep the social  distancing as properly as I should. I understand. I make mistakes. But  I don't do it intentionally. I am not going to intentionally take off  my mask and communicate with persons.   I am not going to try in any way to demonstrate that somehow I am  invulnerable, I am invincible, this is a joke, this is a hoax, and that  we need not try to protect ourselves from this virus. I am not going to  do it, and I am going to ask that others would not do it.   Let's love each other and protect each other. This is a matter of  life and death.   Finally, on this topic of the virus, we have had some persons who  contract the virus who are associated with the House. I want you to  know, Mr. Speaker, that I care about them. I pray for them. And I want  you to know that I am asking that we all make sure that this doesn't  become a means by which we distance ourselves from other people simply  because they have had the virus.   My hope is that persons who contract it will heal and they will be  back at work and we will treat them with the same love and respect that  we have always treated them, show them that they are welcome back to  the House of Representatives. This is something that we can do to show  each other how much we appreciate the persons who have survived this  virus.   I hope that every person who contracts it will survive it. I don't  want to see anybody lose life or become chronically injured in some way  because of this virus. It ought not be that way, and my hope is that we  won't allow it to happen in the sense that people will contract it and  we will find ourselves distancing ourselves from them.   As I am about to leave now, I want to mention one additional item  that is important. I am still concerned about invidious discrimination,  and I am concerned that we are reaching a plateau now as it relates to  the movement that had as a part of its genesis the death of George  Floyd.   I am concerned that I don't see the movement continuing with the  amount of momentum that it richly and justly deserves. I am concerned  that we are slowly getting back to bigotry as usual, we are slowly  getting back to a point where we will do more talking about bigotry and  discrimination than acting on the elimination of bigotry and  discrimination.   It really is a major issue in the country, and we should not allow  ourselves to slip back into making it more about what we think ought to  happen than doing what we can do to prevent this sort of discrimination  from continuing to happen.    So I am concerned, and because I am concerned, when we return, I hope  to take some measures, some steps, if you will, to help us to remember  that it doesn't just go away because we don't have a front-page issue.  The front-page issues heighten our awareness, but it is still there  after it is no longer on the front page, this invidious discrimination,  this homophobia, Islamophobia, and xenophobia, all of the various  phobias that harm people--that other people produce to harm people, I  might add. So I am concerned, and I refuse to allow this issue to  simply become another incident and we get back to bigotry as usual.   At some point, we do need a department of reconciliation in this  country so that people can depend on our government doing all that it  can to eliminate discrimination and hate in the country.   At some point, we need to have this department functioning at the  highest level, with a secretary who reports to the President of the  United States and that is funded properly so that we don't find  ourselves siloing each circumstance that involves invidious  discrimination and dealing with each one individually as opposed to  dealing with all of this collectively.   We have come a long way in this country, no question about it, but we  dearly and truly have a long way that we have to go. What better way to  get there than to say to the world that we are drawing this line, a  bright line, and that we are going to have a department that is  dedicated to the elimination of segregation to the extent that it  exists--and it does exist in some places in our country--but also to  eliminate this invidious discrimination wherever it exists in our  country and against whomever it is perpetrated.   Is it systemic? Yes, it is systemic.  [[Page H4208]]    Just recently, a very prominent person in our country, the Attorney  General, had some problem acknowledging that systemic racism exists. It  does. I have no problems acknowledging it, nor should anyone else,  because the empirical evidence is there to support the fact that it  exists.   So my hope is that we won't get back to bigotry as usual, and when we  come back from this opportunity to work in our districts that we will  take up issues associated with racism and invidious discrimination here  in the Congress of the United States of America.   This is where people expect us to act. And if we act, we can lead the  Nation as opposed to reacting to what the Nation is doing. It is time  for us to take a lead and get rid of this scourge on our society.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
