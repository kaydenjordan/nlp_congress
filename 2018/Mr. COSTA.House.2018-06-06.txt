 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  want to also thank the ranking member and the chair of the committee  for allowing us to work with the committee for what is an important  amendment.   The Denham-Costa amendment would make permanent the existing  authority for utility companies to contribute to funds to expedite  permit reviews for the Army Corps of Engineers.                                time  1545    Expedited permit review reduces project costs and enhances public  safety by ensuring that projects are completed faster. It just makes  good sense.   Projects could benefit from this permanent authority include work to  stabilize aging transmission line towers in the San Francisco Bay,  replacing natural gas transmission lines over and under waterways, and  restoring water delivery systems associated with hydroelectric  facilities.   A lot of good has come from this amendment. It has broad support from  the utility industry and labor unions. I thank the author of this  amendment for his good cooperation, and I urge my colleagues to support  this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chair of the committee  and the ranking member and all of the staff for their support and work  on this important amendment. It is a simple amendment to the Water  Resources Development Act.   Today, as a result of action taken by the Congress in the previous  WRDA bills, the Army Corps of Engineers has the authority to accept  funds from non-Federal interests to update rules that govern the  operations of reservoirs owned and operated by the Corps.  Unfortunately, there are a number of facilities that are regulated but  not owned by the Corps of Engineers, and previous WRDA bills have  failed to provide similar authority to accept funds to update the  operations manuals. These manuals are very important as it relates to  flood control issues.   Although the Corps regulations specify that water operations manuals,  including flood-control curves, should be reviewed and updated  regularly, the reality is the Corps does not do this because they have  got budget constraints.   A Government Accountability Office report released in July 2016 found  that the Corps-owned projects for revisions to water control manuals  are often a lower priority than other operations and maintenance  activities, such as equipment repairs, sediment removal, or levee  repairs. As a result, the Corps oftentimes does not get to funding  these revised water control manuals. This is important. We have floods  all across the country, and it is important that these get updated.   Non-Corps section 7 projects have an even lower budget priority. The  Merced Irrigation District in central California, which I have the  honor to represent, is the owner of such a facility called New  Exchequer Dam, an important reservoir that has served for decades and  decades to provide water supply, flood control benefits for the people  of the San Joaquin Valley.   The Merced Irrigation District wants to improve the spillway and  water storage of Exchequer Dam and Reservoir, and it is going to fund  all of the improvements. But it has been prevented from doing so for  years because the Corps doesn't have the funding to review and to  revise the project's water control manual. As a matter of fact, the  last time it was updated was over 30 years ago, which is of concern.   So Merced offered--guess what--to pay for the process, but the Corps  said, well, they can't do that because they are not legally able to  accept the funds.   That doesn't make any sense. So this amendment would resolve this by  giving the Corps the authority to accept funds to update operation  manuals from the owners of all of section 7 private facilities that  are, in fact, regulated by the Army Corps of Engineers.   So, for the good folks of eastern Merced County, this amendment will  provide an opportunity for the Merced Irrigation District to explore  the raising of the spillway gates at New Exchequer Dam, therefore  increasing flood control protection and, at the same time, increasing  the storage capacity of this reservoir that I said has existed for  decades to, in some years, another 57,000 acre-feet of water.   57,000 acre-feet of water is an important addition. It is a  lifeline--can be--to our way of life in areas like the valley where  drought, as many as you have heard about, is an ever-present threat.  Every drop of water counts.   So I want to thank the cosponsors of my amendment--Representative  Denham, Representative Garamendi, and Representative McClintock--for  their working together on a bipartisan basis to provide not only tools  for the Merced Irrigation District, but all other facilities, entities,  local water agencies that have a similar type of project.   This is a good, commonsense amendment. I know of no opposition to it.  Not seeing anyone else who would like to speak on it, I yield back the  balance of my time.
