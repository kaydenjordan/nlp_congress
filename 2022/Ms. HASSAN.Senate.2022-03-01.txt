 Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Caitlyn  Knowles and Bella Donohue of Exeter and Emma Sughrue of Brentwood as  February's Granite Staters of the Month. This trio led the Exeter High  School girl's hockey team in organizing this year's ``Stick it to  Stigma'' game, an initiative to promote discussions around student  mental health and show teenagers that they are not alone.   Exeter High School's first ``Stick it to Stigma'' game was in 2017  and is now an annual tradition for the community to raise awareness  about students' mental health. The event is in partnership with  Connor's Climb, an organization that provides suicide prevention  education to young people in New Hampshire.   After last year's event was downsized due to COVID-19, team captains  Caitlyn, Emma, and Bella wanted this year's event to bring the  community together in a big way and to help reduce the stigma around  mental health.   The trio promoted the event to their classmates and shared the word  both in school and over social media. The incredible size of the crowd  on game day was evidence of their hard work in bringing people together  and raising awareness about mental health.   Spectators participated in a Chuck-a-Puck fundraiser to compete for  raffle prize money, mingled with new and old friends, and cheered on  the teams. Parents, students, and former players also wore buttons and  t-shirts with messages of support to raise awareness around mental  health, and shared information with one another about mental health  resources.   Caitlyn, Emma, and Bella are working to address mental health  challenges and share the message that ``it's okay to not be okay,'' a  phrase that their coach often tells them. These young women showed  enormous leadership in organizing an event that helped bring their  community together, all the while shining a spotlight on one of the  most important issues facing young people today. They exemplify the  Granite State spirit of tackling an issue head on to help others, and I  commend them for their efforts.                            ____________________
