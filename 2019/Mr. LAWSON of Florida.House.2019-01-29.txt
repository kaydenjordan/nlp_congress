 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 77.  This resolution expresses the sense that financial institutions should  do everything within their power to ensure that their customers who  were impacted by the Trump shutdown receive the resources they need to  get back on track.   Nearly 800,000 Federal workers across this Nation were impacted by  the shutdown, 13,000 of which are in my district. Throughout my  district in Florida, from Quincy, Tallahassee, Jacksonville, and even  in the rural areas, constituents expressed to me the challenges of not  receiving their paychecks. This meant not paying their mortgage or  rent, not paying for childcare, hardships purchasing gas and groceries,  or having to miss a car note. Some of these individuals even relied on  their banks for loans.    These are hardworking Americans who did not ask for the shutdown,  should not have had to suffer as a pawn in the shutdown, or did not  deserve to be furloughed because of a shutdown. That is unacceptable.   Because of the shutdown, these employees made difficult financial  decisions. That is why it is necessary for our financial institutions  to step up and provide relief to those impacted. That means extending  payment deadlines, reducing the interest rate on short-term loans, and  providing financial and customer education that will help Federal  employees prepare for the potential of other financial hardships.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud Congresswoman Waters for introducing this  resolution and for standing up for Federal workers, and I ask that all  of my colleagues in this House vote in favor.
