 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this morning, the Appropriations  Committee considered a first partial batch of government funding bills  for next year.   I want the Senate to secure bipartisan appropriations through the  regular process. I want us to fund the government in an orderly fashion  just like the successful Appropriations Committee work we saw  throughout Republicans' recent years in the majority.   We accomplished that because we built a truly bipartisan process.  Importantly, it began at the beginning. Early in the calendar year, we  convened bipartisan talks to produce top-line numbers so the  appropriators would have actual targets. That let good-faith bipartisan  conversations happen at the subcommittee and committee levels  throughout the spring and summer, and we got results on a bipartisan  basis.   Unfortunately, this year, our Democratic colleagues haven't done  anything like that. Either our colleagues don't have any big-picture  plan or they are privately working off the President's partisan budget  request. There has been no big-picture, bipartisan conversation. The  Democrats didn't even let the committee vote on top-line allocations,  which normally happens at the start of a markup.   Our colleagues' fixation on far-left shiny objects is distracting  them from basic governance. They are more focused on ramming through  another reckless, inflationary taxing-and-spending spree than ensuring  we avoid a stalemate over government funding.   Now, look, I understand and I appreciate that Senators on both sides  have worked hard to develop appropriations titles with a lot of good  content. The problem is bigger picture. When it comes to floor  consideration, we cannot and will not start planting individual trees  before we have bipartisan consensus on the shape of the forest.   Here is what it will take to get a Senate appropriations process back  on track, two--two--simple things.   No. 1, Democrats will need to honor the longstanding bipartisan truce  that provides parity for defense and nondefense spending growth--parity  for defense and nondefense spending growth--and at a responsible  overall number that we can all accept. Our men and women in uniform and  the Nation they defend deserve better than a budget that cuts our  national defense after inflation and allows adversaries to get an edge.   No. 2, we must have agreement that we are going to keep longstanding  bipartisan policy riders in and new poison pill riders out. We need to  keep foundational mainstays, like the Hyde amendment, right where they  are, and neither side should throw new wrenches into the process.   Parity for national and border security and a bipartisan deal on  policy riders--this is not rocket science; it is a roadmap. We all know  it very, very well. That is what it will take to move bipartisan  appropriations bills across this floor, but the majority is behind on  the homework.                                 Afghanistan    Now, Mr. President, on a totally different matter, in April, when  President Biden announced his intention to pull U.S. forces out of  Afghanistan, he said it was ``time to end the forever wars''--``time to  end the forever wars,'' said President Biden, but at every stage of the  rushed and rudderless retreat that has followed, the Biden  administration's wishful thinking hasn't come within a country mile of  reality. By any account, the situation in Afghanistan has become worse  as we have headed to the exits, and we will live with the security,  humanitarian, and moral consequences for years to come.   This whole debacle was not only foreseeable; it was, in fact,  foreseen. Remember what top national security experts were saying  around the time the President announced his decisions:         The Taliban is likely to make gains on the battlefield, and       the Afghan Government will struggle to hold the Taliban at       bay if the coalition withdraws support.    Administration officials shrugged it off. They downplayed the chances  that Afghanistan's pro-American government would fall to the pro- terrorist Taliban, but now that outcome appears all but inevitable.   The administration literally glossed over the risk of an al-Qaida  resurgence, but now Secretary Austin is acknowledging al-Qaida could  reestablish a safe haven and threaten the homeland in less than 2  years--that is the Secretary of Defense--and even that could be  optimistic.   They insisted that over-the-horizon operations would be enough to  keep terrorists in check, but now, just as the CIA Director warned from  the start, intelligence gathering is already suffering.   The administration claimed that resources tied up in the fight  against terrorists were more urgently needed to counter Chinese  aggression, but now the manpower demands of this over-the-horizon  approach have required redeployment of forces to the Middle East and  pulled an entire carrier group away--away--from China's backyard so it  can conduct costlier, less-efficient, long-range missions over  Afghanistan from the Gulf.   Much of the rhetoric from the President's team has sounded almost  laughingly--laughingly--naive. The Secretary of State publically  suggested he thinks he can bribe the Taliban into being a responsible,  peaceful regime with diplomatic carrots. So that is where we are.   In 6 months, this administration has taken us from helping local  partners fight the Taliban to abandoning our partners and pretending  that a future Taliban government will care about foreign assistance and  being accepted by the so-called international community.   The Taliban have already begun paving their way to Kabul with  innocent blood. Al-Qaida is already rebuilding capabilities to strike  at our homeland.   So what on Earth are we doing here? What are we doing?   Surely, the administration would not consider the fall of Kabul a  success. Surely, it will not look at the fate awaiting Afghan women and  girls and say: Mission accomplished. Surely, a terrorist resurgence or  the assassination of our Afghan partners cannot look to President  Biden's team like a ``deliberate'' or ``responsible'' exit from  Afghanistan.   But these are the predictable results of these terrible decisions:  the consequences of making enormous changes with no real plan to  mitigate the risk; the failure to learn from similar mistakes, like the  disastrous withdrawal from Iraq back in 2011.   Here in the Senate, it is curious to see that some of our colleagues  who are the most exercised--the most exercised--about trying to undo  authorizations for the use of military force are somehow also among the  quietest--the quietest--when it comes to the unfolding disaster in  Afghanistan and oversight of ongoing conflicts.   Make no mistake, whether America is on the ground or over the  horizon, the war in Afghanistan will continue, and Americans will not  be safer with the Taliban ruling from Kabul.   We will not be safer when al-Qaida regains a safe haven and inspires  a new generation of global jihadists. And we won't be safer when  coalition partners doubt they can trust our word.   A strategic disaster is what we are witnessing from top to bottom,  and a growing risk that this war will end in a victory--a victory--for  the Taliban and al-Qaida and become a greater threat to the United  States.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
