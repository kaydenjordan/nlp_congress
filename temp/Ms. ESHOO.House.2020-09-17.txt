 Mr. Speaker, it is wonderful to see the gentleman in the  Chair.   Mr. Speaker and colleagues, a month ago yesterday, a siege of  lightning strikes ignited the CZU Lightning Complex fire in my  congressional district, and it is now the 10th most destructive  wildlife in California's history.   Over the past month, the fire has destroyed nearly a thousand homes  in my district and forced 77,000 of my constituents to evacuate. Thanks  to the extraordinary--and I mean, extraordinary work--of thousands of  first responders, the fire is now over 90 percent contained.   As we work toward recovery, much of the Bay Area and the entire  western United States is still breathing the toxic smoke from these  fires, which can have lasting effects and worsen chronic heart and lung  diseases and have a terrible impact on children whose lungs are still  developing.   Congress should immediately pass my legislation, the Smoke Planning  and Research Act to help local governments address this public health  crisis.   I am also calling on Congress to pass the WIRED Act to allow States  to require wireless companies to deploy infrastructure that is  resilient enough to support cell phone networks during disasters.                            ____________________
