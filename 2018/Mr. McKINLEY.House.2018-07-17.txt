 Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for taking this  amendment on.   When you think about it, we are only funding about 300 to 400  projects a year. But in testimony before our committee, there are  450,000 contaminated sites across America; and if we are only  renovating 400 sites, you can imagine how many thousands of years it  will take assuming no additional brownfield sites are developed as a  result of this.   So this idea of grasping just $7 million I think is a fundamental way  of trying to say: We need to do more in this effort; we need to put  more funds in it.   I agree with the gentlewoman's remark. If $250 million was  authorized, then we need to put more money in this if we are serious  about brownfields and removing the stigma across our community.   Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment.
