 Mr. Speaker, House Democrats have shown up every day  during the 117th Congress with one goal in mind: helping the American  people.   This week, we have been considering critical funding legislation,  which gives us a chance to invest boldly in American families and  America's future.   With the funding bills put forth by House Democrats, we are investing  in: job training, apprenticeship programs, and worker protection.   Research, infrastructure, and technologies of the future.   Childcare, education, healthcare, and housing.   The bills we are considering would authorize 10 critical community  projects in my district, providing more than $8.4 million in Federal  funding to address some of the most pressing needs in our region,  economic development, climate resilience, treatment for opioid use  disorder, and expanding mental health resources.   House Democrats have made our priorities clear: American jobs,  opportunities, and working families.   Budgets reflect values, and I am proud to see my community's values  reflected in the fiscal year 2022 funding bills.   We cannot go wrong by investing in America.                            ____________________
