 Mr. President, I want to join with the leader and my  colleagues in thanking and recognizing Laura Dove, who is leaving us  and the Senate at the end of the week. I don't think there is anybody  else more identified with the U.S. Senate by Senators and their staffs  than Laura.   When the leader was arriving here as a freshman Senator, I was  arriving as a young 24-year-old staffer and happened to, I think,  overlap, as well, when Laura was a page here. So she has been here;  this has been her life; and many of us have had the opportunity through  the years to observe her in action and to realize not only how talented  and gifted she is but what a person of incredible integrity and  character as well.   She spent more than two decades serving in the Senate and three weeks  serving as my seatmate during the impeachment trial, which I am hoping  wasn't the last straw in convincing her to retire.   For the last 7 years, she has been the Secretary of the Minority and  Majority, a role that involves managing the Republican cloakroom,  helping develop the floor schedule, keeping Members informed about  votes, and providing Members with legislative and parliamentary  counsel.   Laura has done all that and more over the past 7 years and has done  it with distinction. All of us on this side of the aisle rely on her  counsel, and there is no way we would have been able to accomplish all  that we have accomplished in the past few years without her wisdom and  expertise. She has the rare ability to tell Senators no--always with a  smile--and actually have them listen.   I have sought Laura's advice many times, especially since becoming  whip last year, and I will greatly miss her counsel, although I am  hopeful she will be leaving a forwarding address for future questions.   As the leader pointed out, you might say Laura was raised on the  Senate. Her father Robert ``Bob'' Dove twice served as Senate  Parliamentarian and had a Senate career that spanned nearly 40 years,  so Laura grew up steeped in Senate procedure and tradition.   But her own career began as a Senate page, and I think perhaps her  proudest accomplishment in the Senate has been mentoring literally the  scores of pages who have passed through the Republican cloakroom on her  watch. I know she has made their experience a richer and more  meaningful one.   So, Laura, we thank you for your tireless work, the long days and the  nights you put in. Your wisdom, patience, and unfailing good humor will  be sorely missed by Senators and staff of both parties. We wish you all  the very best in your future endeavors, and I hope that your next job  will involve fewer late nights and more time for leisure, including  loading up the RV and making another trip to the Black Hills of South  Dakota.                                      5G     Mr. President, most of us think that today's internet is  pretty fast. We receive traffic updates basically in realtime, get  emails within a second or two, and stream our favorite shows whenever  and wherever we want. But as advanced as today's internet is, the next  generation of internet 5G will make 4G look like dial-up.   For instance, 5G mobile broadband technology will deliver speeds up  to 100 times faster than what today's technology can deliver. It will  be vastly more responsive than 4G technology, and it will be able to  connect 100 times--100 times--the number of devices that can be  connected with 4G.   While that will make it even easier to do the things we do today,  like check our email or stream our favorite shows, the biggest benefits  of 5G will lie in the other technologies it will enable--precision  agriculture, medical and surgical innovation, safer vehicles, and much  more.   The technology for 5G is already here, but there is more work to be  done to get to nationwide 5G deployment. A key part of getting to that  point is developing the workforce that will be required to install and  maintain the 5G network.   Current internet technology relies on cell phone towers, but 5G  technology will require not just traditional cell phone towers but  small antennas called small cells that can often be attached to  existing infrastructure like utility poles or buildings.   Wireless providers will have to install nearly 800,000 small cells  around the Nation to support a nationwide 5G network. Of course, after  installation, every one of those small cells will have to be monitored  and maintained. That will require a substantial increase in the  telecommunications workforce.   It is estimated that deploying the necessary infrastructure for 5G  will create approximately 50,000 new construction jobs each year over  the build-out period, and that is just for construction. Right now  there simply aren't enough workers with the necessary training to meet  the needs of nationwide 5G.   Industry and community colleges have stepped forward to provide  training opportunities, but more work needs to be done if the United  States wants to step forward into the 5G future.   As past chairman of the Commerce Committee and the current chairman  of the Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation and the  Internet, 5G has long been a priority of mine. I have spent a lot of  time focused on advancing 5G deployment, especially to rural States  like my home State of South Dakota. I was very proud to be in Sioux  Falls a few months ago when the city unveiled one of the first 5G  networks in the country.   In 2018, the President signed into law legislation that I developed  to increase access to critical spectrum, and I have also introduced  legislation to facilitate small cell deployment, especially in rural  areas.   Today, I am introducing legislation to address the other part of the  5G equation--creating a large enough workforce to deploy and maintain  all those small cells. As I said, industry and community colleges have  both stepped forward to provide programs to train workers. Places like  VIKOR Teleconstruction and Southeast Tech in Sioux Falls, SD, are  already helping to train the 5G workforce of the future. But more work  needs to be done.   My Telecommunications Skilled Workforce Act would help increase the  number of workers enrolled in 5G training programs and identify ways to  grow the telecommunications workforce to meet the demands of 5G. My  bill would require the Department of Labor to bring together our  Federal partners, as well as individuals on the ground, deploying next- generation telecommunications services. The resulting working group  would be required to identify any current laws or regulations that are  making it difficult for educational institutions and businesses to  establish programs to help meet the workforce needs of the telecom  industry.   It would also be required to identify existing Federal programs to  help address workforce shortages, as well as ways the Federal  Government could encourage or incentivize growth in the  telecommunications workforce, including the deployment of fixed  broadband in our rural areas. My bill would also direct the Department  of Labor and the Federal Communications Commission to issue guidance  for States to help them leverage existing Federal resources for growing  their telecommunications workforces and to help them improve  recruitment for industry-led telecommunications development programs  like the Wireless Infrastructure Association's Telecommunications  Industry Registered Apprenticeship Program.   I appreciate my colleagues, Senators Tester, Moran, and Peters, for  partnering with me on this bill.   Getting to 5G in the near future is important for our whole country-- both economically and for the advances it will bring in fields like  medicine and  [[Page S1164]]  auto safety--which is why it has been a major priority of mine over the  past few years.   I am particularly motivated by the benefits that 5G could bring to my  home State of South Dakota. The ability to deploy precision agriculture  on a wide scale would have huge benefits for South Dakota farmers.  Better access to telemedicine could bring better healthcare to  thousands of residents in my home State and other rural areas. To get  to these benefits, we have to ensure the telecommunications companies  are able to find the workers they need.    I hope we can quickly advance this legislation so the United States  can continue her march into the 5G future.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from Texas (Mr. Cruz), the  Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr.  Perdue).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Alexander) would have voted ``yea'' and the Senator from Kansas (Mr.  Moran) would have voted ``yea.''
