 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2213, the Anti-Border  Corruption Reauthorization Act of 2017.   I have forcefully rejected the President's mass deportation efforts  from the beginning, and I will continue to do so.   Many of us have appropriately criticized our President for wrongfully  attributing the criminal actions of a few undocumented individuals to  the entire undocumented population. Equally here, it would be  hypocritical to attribute the criminal actions of a few rogue agents to  the hardworking men and women that protect our Nation every day and who  uphold the ethical standards that we should expect.   The Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization Act of 2017 will assist  CBP in fulfilling its mission to facilitate legitimate trade and travel  at our ports of entry.   According to the Joint Economic Committee, the volume of commerce  crossing our borders has more than tripled in the last 25 years.  Currently, 1.1 million people and $5.9 billion in goods enter and exit  the U.S. at 328 U.S. ports of entry every day.   In fiscal year 2016, CBP officers and agents seized and/or disrupted  more than 3.3 million pounds of narcotics across the country, including  approximately 46,000 pounds of methamphetamine, 48,000 pounds of  heroin, and 440 pounds of fentanyl, keeping these harmful drugs off of  our streets.   CBP has struggled with recruiting the officers and agents to fill its  frontline ranks at our Nation's air, land, and seaports. Currently,  there are 1,400 unfilled positions within the CBP workforce at our  Nation's ports of entry. Delays and short staffing at our ports of  entry costs the United States economy up to $5.8 billion each year.   Under this bill, the CBP Commissioner may, on a case-by-case basis,  exempt certain veterans and State and local law enforcement officers  who meet specific standards, such as holding a security clearance and  previously passing a polygraph, from having to take the CBP polygraph  as a part of the hiring process. All other vetting requirements in the  12-step hiring process for these applicants will still apply.   This bill simply grants CBP limited authority to waive a single step  in its robust vetting process for qualifying applicants who hold  security clearances or who have successfully completed polygraphs.   I would like to thank Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson, and  Chairwoman McSally for their work on this bill. I also thank Chairman  McCaul and Chairwoman McSally by accepting changes offered by the  minority to improve this bill.  [[Page H4678]]    Ranking Member Thompson offered an amendment in committee to require  CBP to report to Congress how many of these waivers are requested,  granted, and denied; the reasons for these denials; as well as whether  these applicants are ultimately hired or not.                                time  1515    Additionally, it requires CBP to inform Congress on the number of  applicants who are granted a waiver but undergo a polygraph examination  anyway based on information discovered during their background  investigation. Congress must remain vigilant about how the waiver  authority is used, and this amendment will ensure we have the  information to do so.   Mr. Speaker, in short, the men and women on the front lines of CBP  need our help. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally), the sponsor of the bill and  the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security.   Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill,  H.R. 2213, the Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization Act of 2017.   U.S. Customs and Border Protection has two key missions: securing the  border and facilitating cross-border commerce that powers the Nation's  economic growth. In order to accomplish those missions, they need  enough agents and officers to be able to make arrests, interdict drug  loads, screen cargo from countries of concern, or move legitimate  commerce and passengers through an air, land, and sea port of entry.   U.S. Border Patrol agents and CBP officers are, at the end of the  day, the most important border security and trade resource we have.  Unfortunately, they are in short supply these days, which has created a  national security and economic vulnerability that this Congress must  address.   CBP is critically understaffed and remains well below its  congressionally mandated staffing levels by more than 1,000 CBP  officers and 1,800 border patrol agents. The manpower shortage is  getting worse. We are losing ground every single month, and there is no  end in sight as we continue to lose experienced agents and officers  through attrition without the ability to efficiently hire new ones. For  example, CBP has invested $200 million in a port of entry  infrastructure in Arizona, alone, over the last 8 years, but there is  simply not enough staff to open up every lane that is available.   I want to emphasize this point: officer and agent shortages did not  happen overnight. The U.S. Border Patrol has not met its  congressionally mandated hiring numbers since fiscal year 2014, and CBP  has been losing officers to man our ports since early in fiscal year  2016.   At the current hiring rate, approximately 113 applicants go through  the process in order to hire a single officer or agent. That means CBP  needs to have hundreds of thousands of people apply just to meet their  current needs. We need more manpower to properly secure our border,  screen passengers at our Nation's airports who arrive from overseas,  and facilitate cross-border commerce that powers our economy.   There are several underlying issues that are responsible for these  current staffing woes. For starters, it takes more than 292 days for  these 12 distinct steps, on average, to hire a new officer or agent.  And even with the newer expedited system that is supposed to condense  these steps into just several days, it still takes an average of 160  days to complete the process. Very few people can wait somewhere  between 6 months to a year for a job. We are losing very experienced  and already vetted applicants.   Several years ago, the committee began working directly with the  previous administration to find solutions to these staffing problems  and the hiring process. The bill under consideration today represents  the fruits of that bipartisan work and, as a result, was passed out of  the Homeland Security Committee unanimously last month.   My bill allows the Commissioner of CBP to waive the polygraph  requirement for current State and local law enforcement officers who  have already passed a polygraph examination, Federal law enforcement  officers who have already passed a stringent background investigation,  and veterans with at least 3 consecutive years in the military who have  held a security clearance and passed a background check.   These exemptions are purely discretionary, not mandatory. If there is  something in an applicant's history or background that causes CBP  concern, they can still use the polygraph exam to resolve those  questions.   These small changes will provide CBP with immediate relief so they  are able to quickly, yet judiciously, hire officers and agents from a  pool of qualified applicants who already maintain the public's trust  and put their lives on the line for our security and our safety on a  daily basis.   I want to make my position very clear. Everyone who applies to be a  CBP officer or Border Patrol agent should be thoroughly vetted to  ensure there are no integrity issues in their background and they are  not at risk for corruption. That is how the current system operates,  and nothing in this bill would change that. That is why Congress  required polygraph examinations and stringent background checks for  agents in the first place.   I fully support the use of polygraph examinations to weed out people  who are unfit to wear the badge or carry a gun, but we can and should  make these very narrow, sensible, and straightforward allowances to  permit CBP to hire those who have already been vetted and proven by  their service in uniform that they are suitable to become agents and  officers.   The National Treasury Employees Union, who represent the officers who  are stationed at the ports of entry; the Non Commissioned Officers  Association, who represent many of our veterans; the Fraternal Order of  Police; the Border Trade Alliance; the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; and  the Department of Homeland Security all support this bill. Indeed, this  is a rare bill that has united both management and labor.   I include these letters of support in the Record.                                               The National Treasury                                                 Employees Union,                                                       June 5, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the Customs and Border       Protection (CBP) Officers at the Department of Homeland       Security who are stationed at 328 land, sea and air ports of       entry represented by the National Treasury Employees Union       (NTEU), I ask you to vote YES on H.R. 2213, the Anti-Border       Corruption Reauthorization Act of 2017. This legislation       would expand the applicant pool for vacant CBP Officer       positions by allowing the CBP Commissioner to waive polygraph       requirements for certain categories of job applicants.        NTEU continues to have significant concerns about the slow       pace of hiring at CBP. CBP has struggled to fill 2,000       Officer positions that Congress authorized in 2014. A major       impediment to fulfilling CBP's hiring goal is that CBP is the       only federal agency with a congressional mandate that all       front-line officer applicants receive a polygraph test. Two       out of three applicants fail its polygraph--about 65       percent--more than double the average rate of eight law       enforcement agencies according to data provided to the       Associated Press. The eight law enforcement agencies that       supplied this information showed an average failure rate of       28 percent. As an example, the U.S. Drug Enforcement       Administration failed 36 percent of applicants in the past       two years.        NTEU does not seek to reduce the standards used by CBP in       their hiring process, but believes that there is a problem       with how the polygraph is currently administered. We have       asked CBP to review its current polygraph policy to       understand why CBP is failing applicants at a much higher       rate than individuals applying to work at other federal law       enforcement agencies. H.R. 2213 expands the authority to       waive polygraph examinations for certain veterans and law       enforcement officers, while also safeguarding CBP's right to       administer the polygraph for these exempted applicants if a       need arises.        Improving the current polygraph program should help in       expediting the CBP Officer hiring process so that the       existing 1,400 vacancies can be filled allowing CBP to move       forward with funding and hiring the 2,107 additional Officers       required by CBP's Workforce Staffing Model. NTEU also       recommends that CBP allow immediate polygraph re-testing       opportunities to those with a No Opinion or Inconclusive       result, including those with a No Opinion Counter Measures       finding.        NTEU asks you to vote YES on H.R. 2213.            Sincerely,                                                Anthony M. Reardon,                                                National President.  [[Page H4679]]                                          ____                                          Non Commissioned Officers                                                     Association,                                                       June 6, 2017.      Hon. Ron Johnson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental           Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Johnson: On behalf of the Non-Commissioned       Officers Association (NCOA), a Veteran Service Organization       of over 55,000 members, I am writing to offer support for the       ``Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization Act of 2017,'' which       was ordered reported as S. 595 by the Senate Homeland       Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on May 17, 2017,       and reported as H.R. 2213 by the House Homeland Security       Committee on May 16, 2017. NCOA supports the goal of       increasing border security through easing polygraph       requirements for Veterans who have already taken a polygraph       and are interested in serving the border security mission.        NCOA has been working with CBP to help fulfill its hiring       and recruiting mission. CBP is faced with numerous       challenges--many of which can be assisted by looking to our       nation's transitioning Veterans. NCOA has had an extensive       and national transition program for our NCOs for decades and       believe that our Veterans are qualified, trained, and       committed to the mission of protecting our nation.        NCOA supports amendments to the Anti-Border Corruption Act       of 2010 (Pub. L. No. 111-376), which fosters integrity in the       workplace by requiring that all CBP applicants for law       enforcement positions receive a polygraph examination before       being offered employment. The amendments proposed by S. 595       and H.R. 2213 would enable CBP to develop a risk-based       approach to extend polygraph waiver eligibility to an       applicant who falls under one of three categories and       satisfies specific criteria including but not limited to:        1. A Current State or Local Law Enforcement Officer with a       successfully completed polygraph examination with the       applicant's law enforcement agency, at least three       consecutive years employed as a fully authorized law       enforcement officer, and no history of criminal activity or       serious misconduct;        2. A Current Federal Law Enforcement Officer with at least       three consecutive years employed as a fully authorized       federal law enforcement officer, a current/in-scope Tier 4       Background Investigation or a Tier 5 Single Scope Background       Investigation, and no history of criminal activity or serious       misconduct; or        3. A Transitioning Military Service Member, Veteran, or       Member of the Reserves or National Guard who has at least       four years of service in the military, no history of criminal       activity or serious misconduct, and who holds or has held       (within the past five years) a Secret, Top Secret, or Top       Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information clearance and was       not granted any waivers to obtain that clearance.        NCOA believes the flexibility to waive the polygraph for       the Veteran categories outlined in the amendment makes sense       and would potentially expedite their onboarding to a position       in border patrol. Currently, the onboarding process simply       takes too long and CBP loses great candidates, and Veterans       go elsewhere.        We also strongly disagree with objections to this small       alteration to the polygraph policies--we are talking about       Veterans and others who have already committed their lives to       protecting the nation and its citizens and to say otherwise       is pure fallacy and dirty politics.        Thank you for your attention and for your efforts to help       secure our borders and enable transitioning Veterans to find       meaningful employment.            Respectfully,                                                  Jon Ostrowski,                                       BMCS (ret.) U.S. Coast Guard,      Executive Director, NCOA.                                   ____                                            National Fraternal Order                                                       of Police,                                       Washington, DC, June 7, 2017.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Kevin O. McCarthy,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy P. Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steny H. Hoyer,      Minority Whip, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker and Representatives McCarthy, Pelosi and       Hoyer: I am writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal       Order of Police to advise you of our support for H.R. 2213,       the ``Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization Act,'' and to       urge the House to pass it.        The pace of hiring at the Customs and Border Protection in       the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has been problematic       for several years. This legislation would expand the       applicant front line officers pool to fill vacant officer       positions at CBP by allowing the Commissioner to waive the       polygraph requirements in certain cases. The CBP is one of       the few Federal agencies that requires all its front-line       officers to pass a polygraph--a test that two of three       applicants will fail. This rate of failure is considerably       higher than other Federal law enforcement agencies and the       FOP strongly recommends that how these tests are administered       be reviewed to determine why this is the case.        The bill will give the CBP greater flexibility by allowing       the polygraph test to be waived for certain veterans and law       enforcement officers. This will enable the CBP to fill its       positions without compromising the integrity of their hiring       process.        On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, we are pleased to support this legislation       and look forward to its passage in the House. If I can be of       any further assistance on this or any other issue, please do       not hesitate to contact me or my Senior Advisor Jim Pasco in       my Washington, D.C. office.            Sincerely,                                                  Chuck Canterbury,      National President.                                   ____                                            Border Trade Alliance,                                       Washington, DC, June 7, 2017.      Hon. Martha McSally,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative McSally: The Border Trade Alliance       (BTA) supports your legislation, H.R. 2213, The Anti-Border       Corruption Reauthorization Act of 2017, which contains       important reforms to the polygraph examination process       employed in the recruitment of Customs and Border Protection       officers.        For over 30 years, the BTA has sought to support public       policies that encourage robust cross-border trade while       ensuring our ports of entry have the resources necessary to       process that trade securely and efficiently. Adequate port       staffing is critical to realizing those goals.        We share your belief that CBP's ability to recruit new       officers into its ranks is hamstrung by a polygraph screening       that is overly burdensome and not properly aligned with the       needs of today's CBP.        CBP's failure to meet Congress' calls for hiring 2,000 new       officers must be addressed swiftly, or our borders will       continue to be characterized by long delays and congestion.        Your bill wisely seeks to streamline the recruitment       process by waving the existing polygraph exam process for       current state or local law enforcement officers in good       standing if they have already completed a polygraph       examination as a condition of their employment or, in the       case of federal law enforcement officials, have already       completed a Tier 4 or 5 background investigation. In the case       of members of the military or veterans, your bill allows the       polygraph exam to be waived for individuals who have received       high level security clearances. Finally, your legislation       contains an added level of security by permitting CBP to       administer a polygraph exam in those cases where a background       investigation indicates a polygraph examination is necessary       to make a final determination regarding an applicant's       suitability for employment or an employee's continued       employment.        The reforms contained in your legislation are important as       we seek new ways to attract talented, qualified individuals       into CBP careers with as few redundant, bureaucratic hurdles       as possible, while still strengthening border security and       ensuring the highest degree of confidence in new recruits.        The Border Trade Alliance is proud to support your       legislation and we commend you for working in a bipartisan       fashion. Our organization stands ready to assist you in your       efforts to advance this bill through to passage.            Sincerely,      Russell L. Jones,        Chairman.      Britton Clarke,        President.                                   ____                                          Chamber of Commerce of the                                        United States of America,                                        Washington, DC, May 4, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bennie Thompson,      Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson: The U.S.       Chamber of Commerce supports H.R. 2213, the ``Anti-Border       Corruption Reauthorization Act of 2017.'' This legislation is       a positive development for national security, veterans'       employment, and facilitating trade and travel as it addresses       the shortage of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)       officers at our borders.        Over the past several years, attempts have been made to       increase the ranks of CBP officers. It is clear from CBP's       own staffing model that additional resources are needed to       adequately secure the homeland and facilitate legitimate       trade and travel. This legislation would provide the       flexibility to expedite the hiring process for qualified       individuals who have already proven themselves through       service in local law enforcement or the military.        To meet the staffing levels set by Congress, this       legislation is critical and would help on both the national       security and economic fronts. A recent study found that every       batch of 33 CBP officers hired could lead to an increase in       GDP of $61.8 million and employment gains of 1,053 jobs in       the U.S.        The Chamber appreciates the Committee's continued       engagement to ensure that our borders have the appropriate       resources and looks forward to advancing this bipartisan       legislation.            Sincerely,                                                   Neil L. Bradley.  [[Page H4680]]                                          ____                                                 U.S. Department of                                               Homeland Security,                                       Washington, DC, June 2, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: On behalf of the Department of       Homeland Security (DHS), I am writing to offer support for       the ``Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization Act of 2017,''       which was ordered reported as S. 595 by the Senate Homeland       Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on May 17, 2017,       and reported as H.R. 2213 by the House Homeland Security       Committee on May 16, 2017. DHS supports the goal of       increasing border security through balanced investments in       infrastructure, technology, and personnel.        CBP has worked aggressively during the past two years to       implement its multifaceted recruitment strategy and execute       large-scale improvements to its frontline hiring process.       While these efforts have led to considerable progress in many       areas, CBP is examining every aspect of its pre-employment       hiring process to identify areas in which additional       improvements can be made. CBP's challenges in recruitment       are, to a great extent, contingent on our rigorous hiring       process, which is designed to ensure only those individuals       who meet the qualifications of CBP's frontline positions and       have the highest degree of integrity are recruited to serve       as agents and officers safeguarding our borders and ports of       entry. While many modifications to streamline the pre-      employment hiring process are being considered, CBP will not       lower its high standards for any of its frontline personnel.        DHS supports amendments to the Anti-Border Corruption Act       of 2010 (Pub. L. No. 111-376), which fosters integrity in the       workplace by requiring that all CBP applicants for law       enforcement positions receive a polygraph examination before       being offered employment. The amendments proposed by S. 595       and H.R. 2213 would enable CBP to develop a risk-based       approach to extend polygraph waiver eligibility to an       applicant who falls under one of three categories and       satisfies specific criteria including but not limited to:        1. A Current State or Local Law Enforcement Officer with a       successfully completed polygraph examination with the       applicant's law enforcement agency, at least three       consecutive years employed as a fully authorized law       enforcement officer, and no history of criminal activity or       serious misconduct;        2. A Current Federal Law Enforcement Officer with at least       three consecutive years employed as a fully authorized       federal law enforcement officer, a current/in-scope Tier 4       Background Investigation or a Tier 5 Single Scope Background       Investigation, and no history of criminal activity or serious       misconduct; or        3. A Transitioning Military Service Member, Veteran, or       Member of the Reserves or National Guard who has at least       four years of service in the military, no history of criminal       activity or serious misconduct, and who holds or has held       (within the past five years) a Secret, Top Secret, or Top       Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information clearance and was       not granted any waivers to obtain that clearance.        DHS values the demonstrated commitment and trustworthiness       that these applicants bring to the mission, and the quality       of vetting already performed at the state, local and Federal       levels for these individuals in sensitive positions. Waivers       will not be granted lightly as each criterion will be       carefully vetted and reviewed to ensure verification.        DHS believes the flexibility to waive the polygraph for       individuals in these limited populations would potentially       expedite their onboarding and allow CBP to direct more       resources toward the processing of other groups of       applicants, preventing potential bottlenecks in the hiring       pipeline. Additionally, the bills would retain the       requirement for these specific applicants, like all CBP law       enforcement applicants, to undergo a Tier 5 background       investigation. Should derogatory information be detected       during an applicant's background investigation, CBP may then       choose to administer a polygraph examination.        DHS believes this approach enables CBP to weigh pre-      employment risks and implement mitigation measures in order       to improve its hiring capacity without lowering standards. By       affording CBP the flexibility to waive the polygraph       examination for eligible individuals in one of these       categories, DHS believes CBP will be able to boost applicant       numbers and the number of persons entering the academy to       begin training. Additionally, retaining the requirement for       all law enforcement applicants to undergo a Tier 5 background       investigation (the highest level), coupled with random drug       testing, periodic reinvestigation, and the continuous       evaluation of employees for criminal conduct, will assist in       mitigating any potential risk.        The Office of Management and Budget advises that, from the       standpoint of the Administration's program, there is no       objection to the presentation of this letter to Congress.        I appreciate your support of DHS, and I look forward to       working with you on this polygraph waiver legislation and       future homeland security issues. I have sent identical       letters of support to the Ranking Member of the Senate       Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, the       Chair and Ranking Members of the House Committee on Homeland       Security and its Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee,       whose Chairwoman introduced H.R. 2213, and Senator Flake who       introduced S. 595.            Respectfully,                                                  Benjamin Cassidy,                       Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs.    Ms. McSALLY. Let me close with just this example.   I served in the Air Force for 26 years. In that time, I held a Top  Secret/SCI clearance with access to compartmentalized programs as well,  some of the most sensitive information that our government possesses. I  was entrusted to fly a $12 million aircraft, command a squadron, run  counterterrorism operations and combat search and rescue operations,  retiring as a colonel, yet I have never taken a polygraph exam like the  one required if I wanted to be a Border Patrol line agent after I  retired, but I was subjected to periodic, very detailed background  checks, background investigations, now called a tier 5 investigation,  which is one that every single one of these agents and officers will  also have to go through. It is a very invasive and thorough  investigation. They talk to your neighbors, your coworkers, look in  your financial records, your employers, you name it, to make sure that  you are qualified.   So this example is a mismatch of public trust and it doesn't make any  sense, and we need to give the CBP Commissioner discretion on a narrow  case-by-case basis to fully vet applicants in the way that makes the  most sense to fill these positions while preventing corruption.   I would like to thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson,  and especially my ranking member, Mr. Vela, for his support and work  with us on this important bill.

Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I had the  benefit, of course, of hearing my colleague, Congresswoman Lofgren, and  I appreciate my colleagues on the other side because, agreed, we all  want there to be the right sort of national security protections at the  border, but we want to make sure that we are maximizing those  opportunities and recognize that there has been an issue of being able  to address the shortage of officers. But to address a workforce  shortage by minimizing the very requirements that not only preserve our  national security and protect the men and women at our border, I would  agree, is not the way that we should be proceeding.   Mr. Speaker, in fact, I rise in opposition to the Anti-Border  Corruption Reauthorization Act. As a Member from a border State that  heavily trades with Mexico, I certainly understand the value of having  sufficient customs officials manning our ports of entry and agents  protecting our border; but eliminating the critical polygraph  requirements for certain CBP applicants only undermines our Nation's  safety, given this agency's historic connection to organized crime,  drug cartels, and corruption.    The DHS inspector general has warned that weakening CBP polygraph  requirements would make our southern border more vulnerable and that we  should, instead, identify ways to make hiring more efficient without  sacrificing integrity and effectiveness.   Mr. Speaker, in fact, I live in a community that the FBI has now  identified as one of the most dangerous cities in the country,  Albuquerque, New Mexico, primarily because of the drug cartel. The drug  trade in our city and in our State is significant, so we understand  having sufficient officers.   While I strongly oppose this bill, I am committed to working with my  colleagues and CBP to identify solutions that won't jeopardize national  security.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Gonzalez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Gonzalez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Cuellar).    I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.    I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2213, the Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization  Act of 2017, aims to bring some relief to the tremendous staffing  shortages at our ports of entry by providing CBP with limited authority  to waive its polygraph requirement on a case-by-case basis for certain  veterans and State and local law enforcement officers in its hiring  process.   H.R. 2213 is endorsed by the NTEU, the union that represents  frontline CBP officers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in concluding this debate, it is important to note this  bill is a bipartisan effort, passing unanimously out of my committee.  It is supported by Ranking Member Thompson, Congressman Vela, and we  thank you for that, and others. Again, it passed out unanimously.    I was pleased to see also a Dear Colleague letter sent by my  Democratic counterparts on the Homeland Security Committee urging the  passage of this bill. This only further underscores the bipartisan  nature of this effort.   It is also supported, Mr. Speaker, by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,  the Border Trade Alliance, the CBP officers' union, and the Fraternal  Order of Police, among others.   The issue is very clear. Not passing this bill will continue to keep  American families at risk from dangers of human traffickers, drug  smugglers, and international terrorists. Right now, we simply don't  have an adequate number of Border Patrol agents and CBP officers to  safeguard our Nation's border. We need to fix that. That is what this  legislation does. It will allow us to bolster our forces with talented  law enforcement officials and military personnel who have been  previously vetted and have already demonstrated their commitment and  patriotism to their fellow Americans.                                time  1545    As I have stated before, while new infrastructure and technology will  be important in protecting this Nation, the brave men and women who  confront threats to our homeland are our greatest assets.   Once again, I thank Congresswoman McSally, Ranking Members Vela and  [[Page H4683]]  Thompson, and all those who supported this bill. It will help  strengthen our borders.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I will be unable to vote today on H.R.  2213, the Anti-Border Corruption Reauthorization Act. If I would be  present, I would vote against the bill.   While this bill purports to fast track the hiring of Customs and  Border Patrol (CBP) agents in order to ensure our national security, it  would actually water down hiring practices and allow potential  vulnerabilities in the country's largest law enforcement agency. H.R.  2213 would allow certain CBP applicants to bypass polygraph testing.   In 2010 Congress passed the Anti-Border Corruption Act, which  mandated CBP applicants pass a polygraph test as part of their hiring  process. This bill was an essential step after an influx of corruption  cases were revealed within the agency--ranging from drug trafficking to  accepting bribes. Decreasing hiring standards as proposed by H.R. 2213  would do exactly what the Anti-Border Corruption Act of 2010 fixed.   Instead of finding common-sense ways to expedite the hiring process  without compromising the integrity of the agency, H.R. 2213  irresponsibly cuts corners in an attempt to keep President Trump's  campaign promises of quickly increasing border patrol agents.   I am absolutely committed to regaining control of our country's  borders and have continually fought to restrict individuals who would  do our citizens harm--both through terrorist attacks or drug  smuggling--from entering the United States. This ill-conceived  legislation does nothing to ensure increased border security.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.     Amendment No. 1 Offered by Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico    Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I have an  amendment at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 9, after line 4, insert the following:       SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.         This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take       effect on the later of the following dates:        (1) The date on which all of the following have been       completed:        (A) The Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection       has conducted an evaluation and pilot program of the Test for       Espionage, Sabotage, and Corruption (TES-C).        (B) The Inspector General of the Department of Homeland       Security has certified such evaluation and pilot program.        (C) The Commissioner submits to Congress a report on such       evaluation and pilot program.        (2) The date on which the Inspector General of the       Department of Homeland Security completes a risk assessment       of the population of individuals who could receive waivers       under section 3(b) of the Anti-Border Corruption Act of 2010,       as amended by this Act, and submits to Congress certification       that providing waivers to such individuals would not endanger       national security, undermine workforce integrity, or increase       corruption.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 374, the  gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham) and a Member  opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Mexico.   Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, this is, in  fact, a national security issue. No other Federal law enforcement  agency in the country--not the FBI, DEA, ATF, or Secret Service--makes  any exceptions to their polygraph exam.   I understand that the CBP has a staffing shortage, but watering down  vetting standards is dangerous and could lead to more corruption at the  largest law enforcement agency in the country. In fact, 2,170 CBP  personnel were arrested for sexual assault, excessive force, conspiring  with international drug trafficking organizations, and other offenses  between 2005 and 2012.   In response, Congress enacted legislation to require every applicant  to undergo a polygraph exam--no exceptions. DHS' own Integrity Advisory  Panel and the GAO have both recommended that the current polygraph  testing be expanded, not reduced, given the higher rates of corruption  at CBP than any other Federal law enforcement agency.   This bill takes us backward, and some current and former DHS  officials have expressed concerns that the bill could expose the agency  to corrupt individuals who could undermine the integrity of the  workforce.   DHS Inspector General John Roth warned that the proposed legislation  ``could put CBP at significant risk and that while it may sound  reasonable to say you could waive requirements from former military  personnel because they have passed a polygraph, Border Patrol agents  work in a different environment that is not as controlled as the  military.''   Former CBP head of Internal Affairs has stated that ``very few  members of the military take polygraphs or have comprehensive  background checks, and the quality of State or local law enforcement  polygraphs varies widely.''   My amendment would delay the implementation of the bill until, one,  CBP completes its ongoing pilot program of an alternative polygraph  test that may help speed up hiring while maintaining vetting standards;  and, two, the DHS inspector general determines that the bill would not  endanger our national security, undermine workforce integrity, or, in  fact, increase corruption.   I recognize that CBP is managing hiring and staffing issues. Passing  this bill without knowing its potential risks or consequences is not  only shortsighted, but I think it is irresponsible. We shouldn't  blindly experiment with our Nation's security given that drugs,  weapons, and human trafficking, as well as terrorism, are all threats  we are facing at the border.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' for my amendment to  help safeguard national security and protect the integrity of the CBP  and its officers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Schneider), my friend and colleague.
