 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 4894, the Congressional Budget  Justification Transparency Act.   The Congressional Budget Justification Transparency Act is a long  overdue reform to ensure that the Congress and the public can  understand the full scope of the Federal budget.   This bipartisan bill will make it possible for the public and every  Member of Congress to readily find and compare the annual budget  justification and supporting materials that each agency prepares and  sends to Congress.   Taxpayers should know how agencies plan to spend their hard-earned  money.   Last year, the Federal Government spent more than $4.4 trillion.   We have transparency tools like USAspending.gov to track Federal  spending after Congress appropriates taxpayer dollars.   However, the annual Federal agency budget justifications provide  detailed and plain-language explanations of how agencies plan to spend  congressionally appropriated funds.   In other words, an agency Congressional Budget Justification provides  the necessary details in context to actually understand how agency  missions connect to eventual Federal spending.   Currently, agencies send these plans directly to congressional  appropriators.   However, if the rest of us wish to review these valuable government  budget materials, we are left to manually search through hundreds of  individual agency websites.   H.R. 4894 solves this problem by requiring the budget justifications  of every agency be publicly available at a central, single website.   The bill would require the Office of Management and Budget to provide  a comprehensive list of each agency's budget justification with a  stable link to where the documents are published on agency websites.   This way Congress and the public can know that they are looking at  the complete picture of the budget request materials.   Each agency would also be required to publish their materials at a  consistently named web address to further simplify the public's  discovery of these budget documents.   The bill would also require the U.S. Treasury to centrally publish  all materials themselves on USAspending.gov as open data.   USAspending is a current one-stop shop for the public to find  information on how the government is using their tax dollars.   It tracks all Federal spending activity, as required by the 2014 DATA  Act, which is an example of the strong bipartisan work the House  Committee on Oversight and Reform and Congress has accomplished in the  past.   Adding congressional budget justifications to USAspending.gov for  future generations will provide greater context to Federal spending  information.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bipartisan  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H4350]]         Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss without mentioning another interesting  benefit of the Congressional Budget Justification Transparency Act.   Thanks to another law that the House Oversight and Reform Committee  has previously produced in the last Congress, the 2018 Good Accounting  Obligation in Government Act, congressional budget justifications also  list unimplemented inspector general audit and GAO report  recommendations.    Therefore, H.R. 4894 will also centralize documents containing  valuable IG and GAO recommendations for the public and Congress to  easily find.   This will empower better oversight over a sprawling and complicated  Federal Government. I hope we can continue to find ways to continue  building on such good government reforms in a bipartisan fashion.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  commonsense legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of S. 2193, the Charging Helps Agencies Realize  General Efficiencies Act, or CHARGE Act.   The CHARGE Act would direct the General Services Administration to  allow Federal employees to use official Federal travel charge cards to  pay for electric vehicle recharging at commercial charging stations.   This simple change would help Federal Government employees take  greater advantage of Federal electric motor vehicle fleet vehicles  while traveling for official business.   By ensuring the government can utilize expanding commercial charging  stations, we can help drive down costs to the taxpayer and avoid the  need for the government to buy and maintain more electric vehicle  charging stations.   If Federal employees must use their travel charge cards to refuel  their traditional vehicles, they should also be allowed to use these  same cards to refuel or charge their electric vehicles.   This is a commonsense and easy step toward modernizing the Federal  Government and granting more flexibility to Federal employees.  [[Page H4351]]    As an added benefit, according to the Congressional Budget Office,  this new policy will not cost the American taxpayers anything to  implement.   Further, this new flexibility for the Federal Government and its  employees to utilize electric vehicles could help bolster the American  market for electric vehicles.   As we have learned throughout the coronavirus pandemic, American  manufacturing is vitally important to our success as a Nation. By  allowing the increased use of electric vehicles in America, we can  secure all the American ingenuity and innovation that comes with the  vehicles of the future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1668, the Internet of things, or IoT,  Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2019.   Our Nation's use of technology has shifted dramatically in recent  years. Internet of Things, or IoT, devices have found a way into nearly  every aspect of our lives, work, and now government.   A recent Congressional Research Service report cites market estimates  that, by 2025, there will be more than 21.5 billion internet-connected  devices.   IoT devices, such as smart TVs and appliances, home security systems,  thermostats, and many other home and work devices, are now connected to  the internet. This offers ever-increasing gateways into our most  valuable networks through our weakest technology devices.   We traditionally think of computing devices such as computers,  smartphones, and tablets as our primary interface with the internet.  These computing devices have securely designed, mature, and powerful  operating systems. However, IoT devices normally have less computing  power and, therefore, security capabilities than traditional computing  devices.   As our economy has embraced the convenience of IoT devices, we have  also created more entry points to the internet and our networks for  malicious actors to exploit. For example, building elevators, HVAC,  lighting, audio-video, fire suppression, and even security systems are  now capable of being monitored and updated remotely through networks.   IoT devices play an integral role with industrial and manufacturing  infrastructure as well. These systems can be potentially manipulated in  a manner that can put our security at risk.   With new technology capabilities come new cyber vulnerabilities that  can be taken advantage of in unpredictable ways.   But why are we talking about IoT devices here in Congress? Well,  Congress, and the House Oversight and Reform Committee, in particular,  have the responsibility to ensure appropriate oversight of the  technology that our Federal Government procures and the security of our  Federal networks.   The IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act will ensure that any security  gaps in Internet of Things devices are properly and transparently  identified by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.   It then requires that the Office of Management and Budget develop and  the Department of Homeland Security implement policies requiring  Federal agencies to only procure IoT devices that can be securely  incorporated into an agency's information systems.   It does this while ensuring that leading private-sector security  standards are adopted and improved upon by the Federal Government. Such  government and private-sector partnership is key to developing widely  useful and effective security standards.   Lastly, H.R. 1668 would ensure that proper disclosure mechanisms  exist to report and fix newly discovered security vulnerabilities  related to the government's use of IoT devices.   In summary, this bill will help improve the mechanisms protecting the  Nation's valuable cybersecurity infrastructure as new technology  devices are increasingly used by Federal agencies.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Hurd).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We often talk about the need for government to be a responsible  steward of taxpayer dollars. This responsibility of stewardship extends  to safeguarding the public's data and government systems.   With H.R. 1668, we can take positive steps to secure the devices that  connect to and interact with our valuable Federal Government networks.  These same networks enable critical government missions and protect  America's valuable information.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
