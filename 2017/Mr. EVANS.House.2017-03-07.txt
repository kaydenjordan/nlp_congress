 Madam Speaker, last night House Republicans released their  plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans and the Trump  administration say that they want a healthcare plan that cuts costs and  covers more Americans; yet they introduced a plan that takes away from  millions of Americans and puts the poorest Americans, our seniors, our  people with preexisting conditions, and working class families at  greater risk of getting sick.   According to the Philadelphia Department of Public Health,  approximately 220,000 Philadelphians would lose their health insurance  if the Affordable Care Act is repealed without adequate replacement.   We cannot take this risk. The new plan is an insult to the millions  of Americans who have fought hard to try to get ahead. Now is the time  to resist.                            ____________________
