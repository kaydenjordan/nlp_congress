 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  career of Scott Bennett, who is retiring as director of the Arkansas  Department of Transportation after nearly 32 years of service and  dedication to the State.   Scott assumed his current post as director in 2011; however, he has  been an asset to ARDOT since his summers as an engineering intern.  Scott's hard work, passion, and knowledge allowed him to build a  celebrated career that has greatly benefited the State and its  citizens. He received a bachelor's degree in civil engineering from the  University of Arkansas in 1989 and became a full-time employee of the  Planning and Research Division. He also earned a master's degree in  civil engineering in 1994 while working for ARDOT.   During the past 9 years, his effective and influential leadership has  been indisputable. Scott led ARDOT's efforts to implement significant  highway rehabilitation efforts, including the 2011 Interstate  Rehabilitation Program and the 2012 Connecting Arkansas Program, both  of which were approved by voters.   Scott is an active leader in the transportation and engineering  communities in the State and at the national level. He was appointed to  the Arkansas Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers and  Professional Land Surveyors in 2015, where he currently serves as  president. In 2017, Scott was elected secretary-treasurer of the  American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials,  after previously serving as a member of the board of directors. Scott  has served on other various organizations to support the transportation  industry and improve roadways for all Americans.   Scott has earned many accolades over the course of his career. The  American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials  presented him with the Thomas H. MacDonald Memorial Award, which  recognizes top engineers in the transportation profession. In 2005, he  received the University of Arkansas Young Engineer Alumni of the Year  Award, and in 2019 he was honored with the University of Arkansas  College of Engineering's Distinguished Alumni Award. In 2010, Scott was  inducted into the Arkansas Academy of Civil Engineering.   I applaud Scott for his accomplished career with the Arkansas  Department  [[Page S1475]]  of Transportation. He has displayed his commitment to improving the  quality of life for Arkansans, and he leaves behind a legacy that will  continue to be felt across the State. I appreciate his friendship and  am grateful for his years of devoted service to the Natural  State.                            ____________________
