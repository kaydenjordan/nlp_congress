 Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of  Dr. Kevin Hassett to be Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.  Kevin is exceptionally qualified to be Chairman of the CEA, where he  will play an integral role in tax reform and shaping this  administration's progrowth economic policies.   I have known Kevin for quite some--beginning when he served as the  chief economic adviser to my Presidential campaign in 2000. The only  time I have doubted his intellect was when he agreed to return to  advise for my 2008 Presidential campaign.   He has an extensive economic career spanning multiple  administrations, including those of Presidents Clinton and George H.W.  Bush. Currently, Kevin works at the American Enterprise Institute, AEI,  as the State Farm James Q. Wilson Chair in American Politics and  Culture and director of Research for Domestic Policy. Before joining  AEI, Kevin served as a senior economist at the Federal Reserve and did  a stint at Columbia Business School teaching economics and finance.   To understand fully how smart he is, Kevin's former colleague told me  the story of how he printed out a 400-plus page technical paper at the  request of Kevin, only to realize he had printed out the original  German version rather than an English translation. Without batting an  eye, Kevin said ``no problem'' and went about reading the scholarly  report in German.   Kevin's nomination has received support from an ideologically diverse  group of notable economists, including past CEA Chairmen. Additionally,  the Senate Banking Committee approved his nomination by voice vote.   I am pleased to support Kevin's nomination today. I wish him, his  lovely wife, Kristie, and their sons, John and Jamie, all of the best  in this new chapter of their lives.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to ask my  colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. Sarkis Tatigian, who will  achieve the extraordinary milestone of 75 years of combined military  and civilian service to the United States on September 26, 2017.  Eligible for retirement since 1973, Mr. Tatigian has continued to honor  America through his faithful service. Currently the associate director  of the Small Business Programs Office at Naval Sea Systems Command,  NAVSEA, Mr. Tatigian is a champion for our Navy, our small business  community, and our country.   Mr. Tatigian began his civilian career with the Navy in July 1942 as  a junior radio inspector at the naval aircraft factory in the  Philadelphia Navy Yard and the Navy Office of Inspector of Naval  Aircraft in Linden, NJ. He left his position as an inspector in March  1943 and entered the uniformed Navy as an Active-Duty sailor in April  1943. In June 1944, as an aviation electronics technician's mate, he  aided in the development of the Navy's first guided antiship munition,  the ASM-N-2 ``BAT'' glide bomb, which later became an operational  weapon in January 1945.   In 1943, Mr. Tatigian began his Federal civil service with NAVSEA,  where he still works today. Throughout his long career, he has received  numerous awards, including the Navy's Superior Civilian Service Award  in 2007. In recognition of his exceptional accomplishments in service,  the Navy has even named an award after him, the Sarkis Tatigian Small  Business Award, which recognizes outstanding performance through  organizational culture and command climate.   At 95 years young, Mr. Tatigian's dedication and resolve are  inspirational. We can all learn a great deal about service to country  and the American spirit from his great example. On behalf of a grateful  nation, thank you, Mr. Sarkis Tatigian, for all you have done for our  people, our government, and our Navy.                            ____________________
