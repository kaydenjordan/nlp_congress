 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  15 minutes.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to honor  an Iowa teacher who has clearly had a major impact on his students and  his community because I was contacted by a number of Iowans regarding  their desire to find some way to recognize him. The following is what  they told me.   A teacher of 39 years at Columbus High School in Waterloo, IA, Gary  Schneiders has been awarded the  [[Page S487]]  McElroy Trust Gold Star Teacher of the Year in the Cedar Valley and  Teacher of the Year at Columbus High School.   During his time at Columbus, Gary Schneiders has taught world  history, applied economics, current world history and advanced  placement European history. Through his world history and European  history classes, Mr. Schneiders has taken it upon himself to educate  his students about the many sacrifices our military men and women have  endured throughout history.   This February, Gary Schneiders will be leading his 12th group of  students to France and Belgium for a 12-day trip ``To Experience, To  Learn, To Honor, To Remember.'' This is the theme each year for his AP  Euro trip. Mr. Schneiders leads the students along World War I's  Western Front starting in Verdun, France. His students experience the  battlefields and trenches of the First World War. They visit some of  the great museums and monuments honoring the soldiers who fought in the  war. Most importantly, they go to many of the cemeteries and memorials  to the many soldiers who fought for the various countries in that Great  War. At the American memorials and cemeteries like Flanders Field and  the Meuse Argonne, the largest American cemetery in Europe, the  students lay flags and roses at each Iowa soldier's headstone. They  also lay a wreath at the memorial itself, where Taps and the National  Anthem are played. Because World War I is little remembered these days,  the American cemeteries see very few visitors from the United States.  The administrators of these memorials and cemeteries are excited to see  Mr. Schneiders each year with his fresh class of students.   During the latter part of the AP Euro trip, Mr. Schneiders takes his  students to the beaches of Normandy. He shows the students firsthand  what difficulties our soldiers had in taking the beaches. On their last  day in Europe, Mr. Schnieders takes his students to Omaha Beach and the  Normandy American Cemetery. Mr. Schneiders takes his students down to  Omaha Beach so they can see the distance our soldiers had to cover  while carrying heavy packs and under constant fire. The students then  go up to the top of the beach where the Normandy American Cemetery and  Memorial is located. The students again put American flags and roses at  each soldier from Iowa. They also take the sand they brought from Omaha  Beach and wipe it over the name on each headstone so the name of the  soldier and the State of Iowa becomes easily visible. The students  again lay a wreath and Taps and National Anthem are played throughout  the cemetery.   Two weeks after returning home, Gary Schneiders and his students put  on a presentation for the local veterans and community. The students  set up various multimedia exhibits to share the experiences from their  trip. This has become a great event each year for local veterans and  the community.   To conclude, I was told that Gary Schneiders' dedication to his  school, veterans, and his students has been invaluable to his  community. If Gary Schneiders has anything to do with it, his students  will continue ``To Experience, To Learn, To Honor, To Remember'' our  veterans. So I congratulate Gary Schneiders on his dedication to his  school, students, veterans, and community.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the resolution of disapproval I am  introducing today via the Congressional Review Act repeals a Social  Security regulation that unfairly stigmatizes people with disabilities.  It also violates the fundamental nature of the Second Amendment.   The Second Amendment recognizes the God-given right to self-defense.  In order to take away that right, the government must have a compelling  interest. Furthermore, the law of regulation to achieve that compelling  interest must be narrowly tailored. In other words, the government  better have one heck of a good reason for going against the Second  Amendment.   The Justice Department, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the  Social Security Administration have not protected Second Amendment  rights adequately under the previous administration. Our fundamental  Second Amendment rights were constantly under attack.   For example, hundreds of thousands of veterans have been reported to  the National Instant Criminal Background Check System without due  process. Of course, that system amounts to a national gun ban list for  those reported erroneously. Veterans were reported without first having  a neutral authority find them to be a danger to self or others and thus  have a legitimate right to deny them their Second Amendment rights.  According to the government, the veterans needed a fiduciary to manage  benefit payments. That is not a sufficient reason under the law.  Needing help with your finances--simply needing that help--should not  mean you have surrendered your fundamental right of self-defense, and  it doesn't mean that you are a danger to the public.   On May 17, 2016, Senator Durbin and I debated my amendment that would  require the Department of Veterans Affairs to first find veterans to be  a danger before reporting their name to the  [[Page S495]]  gun ban list. During the course of that debate, Senator Durbin admitted  that the list was broader than it should have been. Senator Durbin  said: ``Let me just concede at the outset, reporting 174,000 names goes  too far, but eliminating 174,000 names goes too far.''   For the record, there were 260,381 names from the Veterans'  Administration sent to the gun ban list for allegedly being in the  ``mental defective'' category. Now, it just happens that this was 98.8  percent of all the names in that category. So the Veterans'  Administration reported more names by far than any other agency.   Senator Durbin's staff and mine have met over these issues since that  debate. I appreciate and thank Senator Durbin for that outreach, and I  want to work together with him to solve these problems for the VA. But  now, the Social Security Administration is about to make the same  mistake as the Veterans' Administration; that is, unless we stop them  right here and right now with this resolution of disapproval. If we  don't stop this, it could lead to hundreds of thousands of Social  Security recipients being improperly reported to the gun ban list.   At its core, Social Security's new regulation allows the agency to  report people to the gun ban list under two circumstances. First, the  beneficiary needs to have someone designated to help manage benefit  payments. That sounds like the VA; right?   Two, the beneficiary has an affliction based on a broad ``disorders  list.'' But the process for designating someone to help a recipient  manage Social Security benefits is not a process that is very  objective. But the process for designating someone to help a recipient  manage their Social Security benefit should be objective.   The former Social Security Administration inspector general said the  following last year in testimony about this process that offends us  here in the Senate and is the reason of this resolution: ``It's not a  scientific decision, it's more of a personal opinion.''   This ``personal opinion'' of a bureaucrat cannot be the basis for  taking away a person's fundamental Second Amendment right to bear arms.   Further, the second element--the so-called ``disorders list''--is a  convoluted mess of afflictions that may or may not cause someone to be  considered dangerous. Many of the listed disorders also do not impact  gun safety at all. For example, some afflictions deal with anxiety  disorders, fear of large crowds, or a lack of self-esteem. The list is  complex, the list is long, and the list is not designed to regulate  firearms. Rather, the list is designed to regulate whether a person can  manage his or her beneficiary payments--in other words, can they handle  money.   But here is the essential question that the Federal Government is  incapable of answering. If they aren't dangerous, why does the Social  Security Administration, like the VA, want to take away their guns?   The National Council on Disability, a nonpartisan and independent  Federal agency, has come out against the Social Security  Administration's rule and in favor of the repeal that this resolution  of disapproval will accomplish. The Council has repeatedly stated its  concerns about the agency failing to determine that people are  dangerous before reporting their names to the gun ban list.   It has been the National Council on Disability's ``long-held position  that restrictions on gun possession and ownership based on psychiatric  or intellectual disability must be based on a verifiable concern as to  whether the individual poses a heightened risk of danger to themselves  or others.''   The Council has also stated that the rule ``unnecessarily and  unreasonably deprives individuals with disabilities of a constitutional  right, it increases the stigma for those who, due to their  disabilities, may need a representative payee.''   Another organization, the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities,  a coalition of 100 national disability groups, shares the same concerns  about the regulation about which we are having this resolution of  disapproval: ``The current public dialogue is replete with inaccurate  stereotyping of people with mental disabilities as violent and  dangerous, and there is a real concern that the kind of policy change  encompassed by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions.''   With that being said, even the ACLU wrote a letter in opposition to  the agency regulation. I ask unanimous consent that these letters, as  well as others, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my  remarks.   Simply stated, the agency rule uses a massive regulatory net that  captures innocent individuals who should be left alone. Just because a  person is assigned a fiduciary does not make that person or those  persons dangerous. Whenever the government tries to eliminate  fundamental constitutional rights, it is required to narrowly tailor  its regulatory action so that innocent people are not impacted. The  Social Security regulation fails in that regard.   That is why both the National Council on Disability and the  Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities have called specifically for  using the Congressional Review Act to repeal the final rule. That is  what our introduction of resolution will accomplish.   Constitutional due process is wholly lacking. For example, the agency  does not afford a beneficiary a formal hearing before his or her name  is reported to the gun ban list.   Now, think about that. The Second Amendment, which recognizes a  fundamental constitutional right, is being simply ripped away without a  formal dispute process to initially challenge the action. Instead, the  beneficiary must wait until their name is already on the gun ban list,  and only then can the beneficiary appeal the decision by the grace of  the government. This process effectively reverses what should be a  burden on the government. The government should not be able to strip a  fundamental constitutional right without due process and then place the  burden on the citizen to try to restore it.   A hearing should be afforded before the infringement of a fundamental  right, not afterward. The burden must be on the government to prove its  case. That simply is the American way--our Constitution's way.   The Social Security Administration regulation falsely claims that it  requires an adjudication before reporting names to the gun ban list,  but there is no hearing afforded to the Social Security recipient  before placing a name on the gun ban list. Of course, without a  hearing, that process cannot honestly be called an adjudication. In  other words, the Social Security Administration is blowing blue smoke  when they say that. Without an adjudication, the process violates  Federal law.   Here is the kicker. In order for beneficiaries to remove their names  from the gun ban list, they have to prove they are not dangerous.  Guilty until proven innocent, and the burden is on you to prove your  innocence. Any way you look at it, that is totally unfair, a violation  of the Constitution, but common sense ought to tell everybody it is  just plain wrong.   The Federal Government, under the Obama administration, treated  Social Security recipients with contempt and disregard when this rule  was put out. With our resolution of disapproval, we can effectively  terminate this unconstitutional government regulation, which the new  Trump Administration supports. I encourage all of my colleagues to  support our efforts.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                 National Council on Disability,                                   Washington, DC, January 24, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan: I write on       behalf of the National Council on Disability (NCD) regarding       the final rule the Social Security Administration (SSA)       released on December 19th, 2016, implementing provisions of       the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)       Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, 81 FR 91702. In       accordance with our mandate to advise the President,       Congress, and other federal agencies regarding policies,       programs, practices, and procedures that affect people with       disabilities, NCD submitted comments to SSA on the proposed       rule on June 30th, 2016. In our comments, we cautioned       against implementation of the proposed rule because:        [t]here is, simply put, no nexus between the inability to       manage money and the ability to safely and responsibly own,       possess or use a firearm. This arbitrary linkage not  [[Page S496]]       only unnecessarily and unreasonably deprives individuals with       disabilities of a constitutional right, it increases the       stigma for those who, due to their disabilities, may need a       representative payee[.]        Despite our objections and that of many other individuals       and organizations received by SSA regarding the proposed       rule, the final rule released in late December was largely       unchanged. Because of the importance of the constitutional       right at stake and the very real stigma that this rule       legitimizes, NCD recommends that Congress consider utilizing       the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal this rule.        NCD is a nonpartisan, independent federal agency with no       stated position with respect to gun-ownership or gun-control       other than our long-held position that restrictions on gun       possession or ownership based on psychiatric or intellectual       disability must be based on a verifiable concern as to       whether the individual poses a heightened risk of danger to       themselves or others if they are in possession of a weapon.       Additionally, it is critically important that any restriction       on gun possession or ownership on this basis is imposed only       after the individual has been afforded due process and given       an opportunity to respond to allegations that they are not       able to safely possess or own a firearm due to his or her       disability. NCD believes that SSA's final rule falls far       short of meeting these criteria.        Additionally, as NCD also cautioned SSA in our comments on       the proposed rule, we have concerns regarding the ability of       SSA to fairly and effectively implement this rule--assuming       it would be possible to do so--given the long-standing issues       SSA already has regarding long delays in adjudication and       difficulty in providing consistent, prompt service to       beneficiaries with respect to its core mission. This rule       creates an entirely new function for an agency that has long       noted that it has not been given sufficient resources to do       the important work it is already charged with doing. With all       due respect to SSA, our federal partner, this rule is simply       a bridge too far. In fact, it is conceivable that attempts to       implement this rule may strain the already scarce       administrative resources available to the agency, further       impairing its ability to carry out its core mission.        The CRA is a powerful mechanism for controlling regulatory       overreach, and NCD urges its use advisedly and cautiously. In       this particular case, the potential for real harm to the       constitutional rights of people with psychiatric and       intellectual disabilities is grave as is the potential to       undermine the essential mission of an agency that millions of       people with and without disabilities rely upon to meet their       basic needs. Therefore, in this instance, NCD feels that       utilizing the CRA to repeal the final rule is not only       warranted, but necessary.            Regards,                                                    Clyde E. Terry,      Chair.                                   ____                                             Consortium for Citizens                                               With Disabilities,                                                   January 26, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Senate Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:       The Co-Chairs of the Rights Task Force of the Consortium of       Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) urge you to support a       Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the       Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA)       on December 19, 2016, ``Implementation of the NICS       Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.'' This rule would require       the Social Security Administration to forward the names of       all Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and       Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who use       a representative payee to help manage their benefits due to a       mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal Background       Check System (NICS).        The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) is the       largest coalition of national organizations working together       to advocate for Federal public policy that ensures the self-      determination, independence, empowerment, integration and       inclusion of children and adults with disabilities in all       aspects of society.        Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, the CCD Rights       Task Force conveyed its opposition to the rule through a       letter to the Obama Administration and through the public       comment process. We--and many other members of CCD--opposed       the rule for a number of reasons, including:        The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy       change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive       assistance from representative payees in managing their       benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public       dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people       with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there       is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed       by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions.        The absence of any data suggesting that there is any       connection between the need for a representative payee to       manage one's Social Security disability benefits and a       propensity toward gun violence.        The absence of any meaningful due process protections prior       to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.       Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to       transmit the names of individuals who have been       ``adjudicated'' to lack the capacity to manage their own       affairs, SSA's process does not constitute an adjudication       and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly       unable to manage their own affairs.        Based on similar concerns, the National Council on       Disability an independent federal agency charged with       advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies       regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the       Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule.        We urge Congress to act, through the CRA process, to       disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage that it       inflicts on the disability community.

Mark Richert,        American Foundation for the Blind.                                   ____           The Judge David L. Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law,                                                  January 30, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Senate Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:       The Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law urges you to support       a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the       Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA)       on December 19, 2016, ``Implementation of the NICS       Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.'' The Center is a       national legal advocacy organization that protects and       advances the rights of adults and children with mental       disabilities.        This rule would require the Social Security Administration       to forward the names of Social Security Disability Insurance       (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit       recipients who use a representative payee to help manage       their benefits due to a mental impairment to the National       Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).        The rule is inconsistent with the statute it implements,       has no evidentiary justification, would wrongly perpetuate       inaccurate stereotypes of individuals with mental       disabilities as dangerous, and would divert already too-      scarce SSA resources away from efforts to address the       agency's longstanding backlog of unprocessed benefits       applications toward a mission in which the agency has little       expertise.        First, there is no statutory basis for the rule. The       National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)       statute authorizes the reporting of an individual to the NICS       database on the basis of a determination that the person       ``lacks the capacity to contract or manage his own affairs''       as a result of ``marked subnormal intelligence, or mental       illness, incompetency, condition or disease.'' The       appointment of a representative payee simply does not meet       this standard. It indicates only that the individual needs       help managing benefits received from SSA.        Second, the rule puts in place an ineffective strategy to       address gun violence, devoid of any evidentiary basis,       targeting individuals with representative payees and mental       impairments as potential perpetrators of gun violence. In       doing so, it also creates a false sense that meaningful       action has been taken to address gun violence and detracts       from potential prevention efforts targeting actual risks for       gun violence.        Third, the rule perpetuates the prevalent false association       of mental disabilities with violence and undermines important       efforts to promote community integration and employment of       people with disabilities. The rule may also dissuade people       with mental impairments from seeking appropriate treatment or       services, or from applying for financial and medical       assistance programs.        Finally, the rule creates enormous new burdens on SSA       without providing any additional resources. Implementation of       the rule will divert scarce resources away from the core work       of the SSA at a time when the agency is struggling to       overcome record backlogs and prospective beneficiaries are       waiting for months and years for determinations of their       benefits eligibility. Moreover, SSA lacks the expertise to       make the determinations about safety that it would be called       upon to make as part of the relief process established by the       rule.        Based on similar concerns, the National Council on       Disability, an independent federal agency charged with       advising the President,  [[Page S497]]       Congress, and other federal agencies regarding disability       policy, has urged Congress to use the Congressional Review       Act to repeal this rule. We urge Congress to act, through the       CRA process, to disapprove this new rule and prevent the       damage that it inflicts on the disability community.            Sincerely,                                                   Jennifer Mathis,      Director of Policy and Legal Advocacy.                                   ____                                                             AAPD,                                                   January 26, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Office of the Democratic Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Democratic Leader Pelosi: The       American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD) urges       you to support a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to       disapprove the Final Rule issued by the Social Security       Administration (SSA) on December 19, 2016, ``Implementation       of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.'' This rule       would require the Social Security Administration to forward       the names of all Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)       and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who       use a representative payee to help manage their benefits due       to a mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal       Background Check System (NICS).        AAPD is a national disability rights organization that       works to improve the lives of people with disabilities by       acting as a convener, connector, and catalyst for change,       increasing the economic and political power of people with       disabilities.        Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, AAPD conveyed its       opposition to the rule to the Obama Administration. We, and       many other disability rights organizations, opposed the rule       for a number of reasons, including:        The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy       change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive       assistance from representative payees in managing their       benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public       dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people       with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there       is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed       by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions.        The absence of any data suggesting that there is any       connection between the need for a representative payee to       manage one's Social Security disability benefits and a       propensity toward gun violence.        The absence of any meaningful due process protections prior       to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.       Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to       transmit the names of individuals who have been       ``adjudicated'' to lack the capacity to manage their own       affairs, SSA's process does not constitute an adjudication       and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly       unable to manage their own affairs.        AAPD urges Congress to act, through the CRA process, to       disapprove this new rule to prevent the damage that it       inflicts on the disability community and the extraordinarily       damaging message it sends to society that people with mental       impairments could should be feared and shunned.        Thank you for taking our position into consideration. If       you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to       contact me at (202) 521-4315 or at [email protected].            Yours truly,                                                  Helena R. Berger,      President & CEO.                            ____________________
