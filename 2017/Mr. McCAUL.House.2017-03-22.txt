 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the cost estimate on  H.R. 1365:                                                     March 22, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has       prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 1365, the       Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Innovation Act.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Mark       Grabowicz.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall.        Enclosure.                                 H.R. 1365          Department of Homeland Security Acquisition Innovation Act    As ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland Security on                               March 8, 2017         H.R. 1365 would authorize the Department of Homeland       Security (DHS) to promote the use of innovation in its       acquisition programs. The legislation would direct DHS to       provide information annually to the Congress on activities       related to innovative acquisition practices. Based on       information from DHS, CBO estimates that implementing H.R.       1365 would cost less than $500,000 annually; such spending       would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds.        Enacting the legislation would not affect direct spending       or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not       apply. CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1365 would not       increase net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of       the four consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028.        H.R. 1365 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector       mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and       would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal       governments.        The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Mark Grabowicz.       The estimate was approved by H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy       Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.
