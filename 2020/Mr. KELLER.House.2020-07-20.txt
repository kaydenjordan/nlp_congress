 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment 198  to the National Defense Authorization Act.   For too long, our supply chain, including critical defense materials,  has been overly reliant on resources located and produced within the  People's Republic of China under the absolute control of the Chinese  Communist Party.   One area of supply crucial to the United States is tungsten. These  materials are used in critical defense products like penetrators,  artillery shells, projectiles, and tank shells.   The fiscal year 2019 NDAA prohibited certain materials from being  acquired from China and other non-allied nations, including some  tungsten materials. While this was a step in the right direction, we  need to do more to support tungsten manufacturing right here at home.   At latest count, China controls over 80 percent of tungsten mining in  the world and remains by far the world's leading producer of tungsten.  As it does with other things, China uses its supply dominance to  manipulate the global market.   Given what has been exposed about China's intentions during COVID-19,  and with China's growing military influence throughout the world, it is  clear that we need to ensure domestic production of this critical  material.   Mr. Speaker, that is why, going forward, the United States and our  allies will no longer have to rely on foreign sources, especially  China, for any of our tungsten supply.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment would direct the Secretary to  prioritize domestic procurement of this critical material so we can  strengthen our vital industrial base and improve American national  security.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support my amendment.
