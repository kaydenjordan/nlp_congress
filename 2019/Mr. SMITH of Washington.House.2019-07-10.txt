 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and insert extraneous material on H.R. 2500.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 5 minutes.   Mr. Chair, this, as always, is an incredibly important piece of  legislation. This is a piece of legislation by which we provide for the  national security of this country, and every little bit, as  importantly, we provide for the men and women who put their lives on  the line to provide for the national security of this country.   For 58 years, we have passed the National Defense Authorization Act.  It is the one piece of legislation that has not failed to pass in that  timeframe, and there is a very good reason for that: It is enormously  important, and it is our opportunity to show those men and women who  serve in the military that we support them, we support what they do,  and we are going to make sure that they have all that they need to  carry out the missions that we ask them to do.   One of the reasons that we have always been able to be successful on  this is because of the very strong bipartisan tradition of our  committee. We have worked with various chairmen and ranking members  across the aisle for all of those years and really made sure that we  worked together, regardless of who was in the majority, to produce a  product that we can be proud of--and we have.   On that measure, as we have moved in the majority this year, my staff  and I have worked very hard with the ranking member and with all the  members of the committee and their staffs to maintain that bipartisan  tradition.   When we had the bill in committee, we had a large number of  proposals, which I will read to you.   There were 736 proposals from Republicans, 889 from Democrats. We put  into our bill 53 percent of the Republican requests and 52 percent of  the Democratic requests   In amendments, there were more Democratic amendments in committee,  266 to 248 for the Republicans, but, still, we accepted 57 percent of  the Republican amendments.   On the floor, there were a lot more amendments from Democrats, 480 to  201, but, again, we accepted 50 percent of the Republican amendments.   My staff and I and other members, personally, on a large number of  issues, most notably on nuclear issues--Mr. Turner, who is the ranking  member on the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, was concerned that we  weren't working together properly on a number of nuclear issues. There  were 10 or 12 or more. I reached out to him. We worked together, and we  resolved half of them, because that is what we do. This is a very  strong bill that everybody on this floor should feel proud to vote for.   Now, there are a couple of issues, but the biggest thing is remember  what is in this bill. Once again, we give a very high pay raise to the  men and women who serve, 3.1 percent pay raise.   We have also, through the amendment process, included a priority that  has over 300 cosponsors in the House, and that is   Joe Wilson's bill  to finally eliminate the offset that cuts the amount of money that goes  to widows of men and women who have passed away in the military. This  is the bill to eliminate that offset. There is a lot in this bill that  we can be proud of.   Now, the issues that we have had disagreement on, I understand, but  we always have disagreements. It is a large bill. I don't like  everything in this bill. I don't think anybody does, but we cannot  forget the central mission of this bill: to support the men and women  who serve the military and to make sure that we have a strong national  security.   The number one issue is how much money we spend.   Let me just say--and I think there is bipartisan agreement on this-- we need a budget caps deal. A continuing resolution is unacceptable.   It is unacceptable for the entire discretionary budget, and it is  certainly unacceptable for the Department of Defense, which can't  simply keep doing what it has been doing. There are always programs  they need to get rid of and new programs they need to create. We need  to get a deal on that. But the number that we marked to, $733 billion,  was the number that the Pentagon planned for for over a year.   After we got the last budget deal to get $716 billion, the Pentagon  planned on what their next year's budget would be, and the President  and the Pentagon put together a $733 billion budget for over a year.  But then, at the end of last year, the President felt that number was  too high.   By the way, I think I might agree with him. I think there are greater  efficiencies to get out of the Pentagon.   So he said it ought to be cut by 5 percent; it ought to be $700  billion. A number of people protested that, went to the Pentagon and  said: You can't cut it to 700.  [[Page H5338]]    So the President said it can't be 733; it has got to be 700. And then  he agreed to 750. That doesn't make a lot of sense. The 733 number is  the number that we planned to.   Now, I will agree that there is a robust debate that can be had about  that: Should it be 750 or 733? I very strongly support the 733 number.  I don't think giving the Pentagon an additional $17 billion at the last  minute is fiscally responsible.   I agree with the ranking member, who has said, in the years when we  were cutting the defense budget by 20 percent, that wasn't responsible  either. I think 733 is responsible, but I can hear arguments for the  other side.   What doesn't make sense is to say that, if you don't get 750, somehow  733 is so bad that we have to vote against it. That simply doesn't make  sense. 733 is the largest amount of money we have ever spent on the  Pentagon. It more than funds our national security needs.   I believe this is a very strong bill. We will debate many other  issues. When we get done, I hope we can uphold that bipartisan  tradition and show that we support national security and we support the  men and women who are putting their lives on the line for our country.   I reserve the balance of my time.

Dear Chairman Smith: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       2500, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2020. There are certain provisions in the legislation which       fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on House       Administration.

Hon. Adam Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: I am writing to you concerning the       bill H.R. 2500, the ``National Defense Authorization Act for       Fiscal Year 2020''. Certain provisions in the legislation       fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce. In the interest of permitting your committee to       proceed expeditiously to floor consideration of this       important bill, the Committee will not request a sequential       referral and is waiving its right to said referral.        The Committee takes this action with the understanding that       it is not waiving any jurisdictional claim over this and       similar legislation or the subject matters contained in the       bill, that it will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this legislation moves forward, and that its jurisdictional       interests over this and similar legislation are in no way       diminished or altered. I request that you urge the Speaker to       name members of this committee to any conference committee       that is named to consider such provisions. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment to any House-Senate       conference on such legislation and requests your support in       the event the Committee makes such a request.        Finally, I would appreciate a response to this letter       confirming this understanding and that you would place our       exchange of letters into the committee report on H.R. 2500       and the Congressional Record during consideration of the       measure on the House floor. Thank you for the cooperative       spirit in which you have worked with this committee regarding       this matter.

Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.       2500, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2020. I agree that the Committee on Energy and Commerce has       valid jurisdictional claims to certain provisions in this       important legislation, and I am most appreciative of your       decision not to request a referral in the interest of       expediting consideration of the bill. I agree that by       foregoing a sequential referral, the Committee on Energy and       Commerce is not waiving its jurisdiction. Further, this       exchange of letters will be included in the committee report       on the bill.

Hon. Adam Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning the bill       H.R. 2500, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal       Year 2020. There are certain provisions in the legislation       which fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on       Financial Services.        In the interest of permitting your Committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of H.R. 2500, I am       willing to waive this Committee's right to sequential       referral and forego formal consideration of H.R. 2500 at this       time. I do so with the understanding that by waiving       consideration of the bill, the Committee on Financial       Services does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over       the subject matters contained in H.R. 2500 which fall within       the Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. I also do so under the       mutual understanding that the Committee on Financial Services       will be appropriately consulted and involved as this or       similar legislation moves forward. The Committee reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving H.R. 2500,       and I request that you urge the Speaker to name members of       this committee to any conference committee which is named to       consider such provisions.        Please place this letter into the Committee report on H.R.       2500 and into the Congressional Record during consideration       of the measure on the House Floor. Thank you for the       cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this       matter between our respective committees.

Hon. Adam Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       2500, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2020. Certain provisions in the legislation fall within the       jurisdiction of the House Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence (HPSCI), as set forth in Rule X of the House of       Representatives for the 116th1Congress.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill,       I am willing to waive this committee's right to sequential       referral. By waiving consideration of H.R. 2500, HP SCI does       not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the subjects       contained in the bill which fall within HPSCl's Rule       Xjurisdiction. I further request that you urge the Speaker to       appoint members of HPSCI to any conference committee which is       named to consider provisions addressing such subjects.        Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R.       2500 and into the Congressional Record during consideration       of the measure on the House floor. Thank you for the       cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this       matter and others between our respective committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Adam B. Schiff,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Armed Services,                                      Washington, DC, June 18, 2019.      Hon. Adam Schiff,      Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.       2500, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year       2020. I agree thatthe Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence has valid jurisdictional claims to certain       provisions in this important legislation, and I am most       appreciative of your decision riot to request a referral in       the interest of expediting consideration of the bill. I agree       that by foregoing a sequential referral, the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence is not waiving its jurisdiction.       Further, this exchange of letters will be included in the       committee report on the bill.            Sincerely,                                                        Adam Smith,                                                          Chairman,     Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I will just say quickly that I completely agree with the  ranking member. The question is, does this bill adequately support our  national security?   I don't think that is even debatable. There is no question that at  $733 billion, with all the bipartisan provisions that we put in there,  this bill more than adequately supports our troops and supports our  national security.   That is why I think it is so wrong that even in committee, the  Republicans have decided to oppose it. It does more than adequately  support.   Now, there are things we disagree with, certainly, but I totally  agree with that formulation. If you believe this bill at least  adequately, I think more than adequately, supports it, you ought to  vote for it.   The only comment I will make on the floor amendments is we submitted  480 on the Democratic side, the Republicans submitted 201. So, yes,  there are going to be more Democratic amendments, because we, I guess,  are a little bit more prolific in that regard, but there is not a  partisan effort in that.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Norcross), the chairman of the Tactical Air and Land Forces  Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), who is the chair of the  Intelligence and Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cooper), chairman of the  Subcommittee on Strategic Forces.    Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces.    Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi), the chairman of the  Readiness Subcommittee.   (Mr. GARAMENDI asked and was given permission to revise and extend  his remarks.)    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I would simply note that, in last year's NDAA, when the Republicans  were in charge, they cut $751 million from the personnel account, and  then the President, 6 months after that, took another $1 billion out of  the personnel account to fund his wall.   So, in last year's NDAA, which all of them enthusiastically  supported, the personnel account was cut by $1.7 billion. We do not  simply rubber-stamp the President's request and never have. What we are  doing this year is perfectly in keeping with past history.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier),  the chair of the Military Personnel Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   It is a unique way of looking at the world to describe a nation that  has literally thousands of nuclear weapons as unilaterally disarming. I  assure the public, we are not doing that.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Brown), a member of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1\1/2\  minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Slotkin), a member of the  Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Escobar), who is a member of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is the majority  leader.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time  each side has remaining.    Mr. Chair, I am the only remaining speaker  at this point, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have one more speaker, and  then I will be prepared to close.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Chair, I would start on a note of agreement. I stand by the  comments I made in 2016: Voting against the defense bill doesn't mean  you don't support the troops.   Now, it is interesting, as we go back to the transcript from 2016,  the number of folks on their side of the aisle who said the exact  opposite, who rather passionately said we were betraying our country by  not supporting the bill. I didn't agree with that then, and I don't  agree with it now.   But the only partisanship that is going on on this floor is coming  100 percent from the Republican Party. I appreciate the gentleman's  words, and I worked very well with him as the ranking member. I  continue to work well with him. But on the statement about how the  Republican side of the aisle stands ready to work with us to make this  bill better, I have seen no evidence of that.   Talking about amendments on the floor, the decision to oppose this  bill was made in committee before we even got to the floor, and what we  are hearing is a whole series of excuses for why they are opposing the  bill.   It is very simple and straightforward why they are opposing the bill:  pure partisanship. They keep talking about the number of times the  Democrats voted with them and how this is different, yet the difference  is the Republican Party has decided that, if it is not their defense  bill 100 percent, they will not vote for it, and then they will stand  up and accuse us of being partisan.   The reason I cite all of those numbers is that all of the outreach  and effort we did to make this bill bipartisan, they did not reach  back. This is pure partisanship: If we are in charge, they are not  going to support it to try to make us look bad.   And the to-ing and fro-ing matters, because that is what guts the  bipartisanship. If they will not even try to work with us if they are  not in charge, that is the definition of partisanship, and it  jeopardizes 58 years of history.   I am not going to give up; I am going to keep trying to reach out and  keep trying to work with them. But, please, for those of you watching  this, understand the only partisan thing going on here is, if the  Republicans aren't in charge, they are not going to vote for it. And I  will pick just a couple of examples.   We heard that we have taken a hatchet to the nuclear budget, so I am  sure you are wondering how much we have cut the nuclear budget by.  Well, we have increased it by 4 percent. That is taking a hatchet to  it?   We are engaged, believe it or not, in unilateral disarmament on the  floor of this House as we increase the amount of money that we spend on  nuclear weapons by 4 percent, as we fully fund the B-21 bomber, the  Columbia-class nuclear submarine, the LRSO, and the modernization of  our nuclear weapons force. All of these arguments are nonsense.   Going back to the personnel argument, they cut the personnel account  by more than we did because they didn't agree with the President.   All of these arguments are pure partisanship, and nothing drives this  point home more clearly than the $733 billion.   Now, I can't say it any better than the majority leader said it, but  the quote from General Dunford in January of 2017. Well, if that is the  case, why did Chairman Thornberry--I am sorry; that is the way I always  think of him--write an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in November of  2018 insisting that we had to have $733 billion?   If we had said $750 billion, they would be on the floor saying, ``Not  enough. It has got to be $775 billion,'' because that is the  partisanship.   This is a really important policy point. These numbers also matter,  because accountability at the Pentagon matters. I would submit to you  that this bill doesn't just maintain the bipartisan tradition; with  Democrats working on this bill, this bill is better for national  security because we don't believe in sending a blank check to the  Pentagon, and sending a blank check to the Pentagon is not in the best  interest of our troops or our national security.   Now, Mr. Thornberry is the best person working on reforming our  procurement system to try and increase efficiency, and I support him in  that effort. But if you try to reform a system and make it more  efficient but then say, ``You know what,'' at the last minute, ``here  is another $17 billion,'' the people are not going to get the message.  They are going to say, ``Accountability? You don't want accountability.  You are going to give us more money no matter what we do,'' which is  what we have done for far too long.   So, yes, we have accountability in this bill, but you have not heard  a single good reason to oppose this, other than pure partisanship. And  it is a brilliant way of doing things.   As a friend of mine said a long time ago, when you are in an argument  with someone who is unreasonable, it is hard not to sound unreasonable.   It is brilliant. Just vote against the bill and say it is partisan;  okay?   Partisan is when you ignore the other side. And, my goodness, the  people behind me, I mean, I have worked on it, but nobody has worked on  it more than my staff and, frankly, the minority party staff. If you  could see the hours that we spent working with Republicans to get to  ``good'' on a variety of different amendments, you would laugh out loud  at the partisanship claim.   And I think this is important. I think if the minority party, if the  Republican Party, cannot work with us unless they are in charge, then  we are not going to get to a bipartisan place.   And again, we talk about how we cut the President's budget. It was  the President who tweeted out in November that $733 billion was too  much. That is what the President said.   So as the majority leader said, we took your number, and after we  took your number, you said we are being partisan. That is absurd.   This is a good bill that protects our country. Every Member of this  body should be proud to vote for it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.   This is an amendment that was actually adopted at the committee  level, but there was a technical problem with it which we couldn't get  corrected by UC, so we are re-debating it on the House floor. I think  it is appropriate.   Last year, the Trump administration decided to stop reporting on  civilian casualties that were caused by our raids. This amendment  reinstates that and requires the Director of National Intelligence to  report to us on civilian casualties that have resulted in raids that we  have done outside of existing combat zones.   We are engaged in many military operations, which we have read about,  in places like Somalia, Libya, and Yemen. We think it is appropriate to  keep statistics on how effective those raids have been, and one of  those measures of effectiveness is the number of civilian casualties  that are included in that.   That is what this amendment does. We have gotten the support of the  chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Mr. Schiff, to do this for both  DOD operations and intelligence operations.   I think it is an important transparency measure that will help us  better understand the effects of our military policy.   And, I guess, the final thing I would say on this is it is part of an  underlying theme. One of the other things that the minority party  doesn't like about our bill is that, again, we want to hold the  Pentagon accountable. We think Congress actually has a role in defense  policy and we shouldn't simply turn it over to the Pentagon.   For us to know what is going on with this will inform our decisions  as we attempt to exercise legitimate and effective oversight of  Pentagon operations.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would simply say that there are  reporting requirements; there are not comprehensive reporting  requirements. And that is the purpose of this amendment, to make sure  we report everything and so that we have all of the information that is  available to us.   And, I guess, to a certain extent, if the opposition feels like it is  already being done, then why not do it effectively and efficiently.  Regrettably, DOD is not in charge of all of the operations involved  here.   The Director of National Intelligence would take into account  everything we are doing and make sure that we have an accurate picture  of that.   Again, I urge support, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Just a couple of quick points: First of all, we did not bypass the  committee of jurisdiction. We were in constant consultation with the  Intelligence Committee, with their staff, and we had that conversation  and worked with them to get this result.   We did not bypass them. In fact, we got a waiver from the  Intelligence Committee to have this amendment before our committee.   Our committee takes jurisdiction that this bill has a number of  provisions in it, including one on which I worked very closely with the  gentlewoman from New York, that has jurisdiction within the  intelligence community. We include in this bill items that have their  jurisdiction, but we worked with them and in careful consultation.   I really don't think it is a lot to ask of our national intelligence  to look at the very important issue of how our military action,  regardless of who is doing it, impacting casualties, both civilian and  otherwise.   That is all this amendment does. I think that it is something that we  should be doing, regardless, and it is information that will be  valuable to this House.   Mr. Chair, I would urge adoption of this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 476,  I offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), chairman of the House Foreign  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Chair, I have no further speakers on  this first en bloc. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an additional speaker. I  yield 2  [[Page H5546]]  minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume to say that I urge support for the en bloc package.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, this is a very important issue  and something that our committee worked on over a long stretch of time  on export controls. We made very carefully thought-out reforms in that  process.   The process was a nightmare. Dual-use was the big problem. We could  have, just as an example, a bolt that happened to go into a piece of  military equipment. If it was to be put in something else, it was  subject to this far more aggressive export control thing. But we fixed  all of that.   What the gentlewoman is trying to prevent is stepping way over the  line here and allowing the export of things that really are clearly  within the military use concern. We covered what wasn't. This goes  beyond that and undermines our ability to make sure that we are not  giving potential adversaries access to weapons that can jeopardize our  national security.   I do think we need to take this step to make sure that the Trump  administration doesn't go beyond what we worked out. I realize this  word is being overused, but we did work this out in a bipartisan way.  With the chairman's help, we included this in the National Defense Act  a few years ago. That was helpful.   This goes too far by the President. I think this amendment is  perfectly appropriate.    Madam Chair, I strongly support this  amendment.   The documents that the gentleman just pointed to don't even begin to  scratch the surface of addressing the issue that the gentlewoman is  raising. Those are very broad documents about where the Defense  Department spends its money.   And I am sure they mention in there--actually, I am not sure. They  might mention in there exactly how much money they spend on overseas  bases.   Actually, I would be surprised if they outline all the overseas bases  we have and what their purpose is, and that is what this amendment  calls for. Not the broad strategy, but really how many bases do we  have, how much money are we spending, and what do they all contribute  to that national security policy.   I have read through those documents. They do not have that type of  detail. Yes, they point out, for instance, here is why we are in all  the places that we are--in Asia, for instance--as we are trying to  defend it, but they don't go through all the bases and say why this  particular place, that particular place.   We are overseas in a lot of places that many people are not aware of.  It is not just the big ones that we are all aware of that would be  contained in that. There are a lot of other places where we own  property and maintain bases.   And the gentlewoman is also correct that the inability of the  Pentagon to audit--in fact, one of the things that the audit found is  that the Pentagon doesn't actually know all of the property that they  own--or they can't document it, at any rate.   So getting this piece of it documented would be helpful and would  begin to answer the question: Is that money well spent? Is that even  advancing the policy that is outlined in all of those documents?   So I think this is necessary, appropriate, and will be helpful in  getting us to a more efficient defense budget.   And, again, that is a major difference in our approach from the  minority. We don't want to just give the Pentagon money. We want to  make sure that they are accountable and spending it well.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk, which I am offering as the designee for the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).    Madam Chair, this amendment is very  straightforward.   Currently, all Members of Congress are prohibited from having  contracts with the Federal Government, either way. In other words, if  you are a Member of Congress, you own something, you can't lease it to  the government, rent it to the government.   Similarly, you cannot rent or lease something from the government  for, I think, obvious reasons. As Members of Congress, we could  potentially have undue influence. We could get a deal that other  Members of the public could not get. Therefore, we would have an unfair  advantage and be using our position as elected officials to enrich  ourselves, which is supposed to be prohibited.   This amendment is very straightforward. It adds the President, the  Vice President, and Cabinet members to that list of people who cannot  contract with the Federal Government, again, either the Federal  Government leasing something to us or we leasing something back to the  Federal Government that is owned, in this case, by the President, the  Vice President, and members of the Cabinet.   Because, again, particularly in the executive branch, they would  actually have, in many ways, more control over this than a Member of  Congress, who does not have the power over the assets that the  President, the Vice President, and Cabinet members would.   It prohibits them from doing that so that there are no ethical  problems, so the President, Vice President, and Cabinet members cannot  profit off of being in the office that they are in. This is part of the  way we maintain a transparent and ethical government.   I think it is a good amendment that will improve the ethics of our  government, and I urge all Members to vote in favor.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   This doesn't require someone to commit a crime. It requires you to  divest of your interest if you move into this position, something  which, by the way, all Members of Congress have to do.   We are not permitted to have outside income over what we have as a  Member of Congress. So if you are elected to Congress and you have  another job, you have to leave that job; you have to let go of a  particular business interest. That is part of public service.   It does not require them to be criminalized. That is like saying  having a law against taking bribes is criminalizing the elected  official. Now, there is actually something you can do: Don't take the  bribe, and you will be okay.   As far as our ``obsession'' with the President, I couldn't help but  laugh at the statement, ``instead of doing the hard work of  governing.''   I am counting how many hours I have slept over the course of the last  month-and-a-half as we have worked to put together a nearly 2200-page  bill that fully funds the Defense Department--sorry, in my opinion,  fully funds the Defense Department--and all the amendments.   Let me assure you, we are capable of doing both. We are capable of  doing the hard work of government and actually trying to make sure that  our elected officials are at least passingly ethical so that the  American public doesn't think what they already think, which  [[Page H5558]]  is that too many people get elected simply to enrich themselves.   This is not something new. We have a long list of ethics laws that  restrict what you can do as an elected official or a member of  government. I would hope that the gentleman is not suggesting that we  shouldn't have that because it is somehow inconvenient.                                time  2030    I think it is incredibly important that we have ethical standards,  that we make sure that elected officials are not able to enrich  themselves based on being in the elected position that they are in.   That is all this amendment does. It is targeting good government,  which is part of our job.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   I don't know where the gentleman was over the course of the last  month when we passed 10 appropriations bills and took hundreds of votes  on the substantive business of funding the government. That is not a  waste of time.   I realize the Senate has decided that they are not going to do it,  but it is our job to pass appropriations bills. That is what we did for  the last month-plus.   We are now working on the defense bill. I would trust the gentleman  wouldn't think of that as a waste of time. It is incredibly important.   We have passed an entire rewrite of the ethics laws for the United  States House of Representatives. Whether you support it or not, it is  certainly not a waste of time.   We have passed countless other bills and important pieces of  legislation.   The Senate hasn't been doing much. I understand its rules are more  complicated, so I am sympathetic, but we are working on the substantive  ability to govern. We are doing it, even if the gentleman doesn't agree  with the bills.   This is where bipartisanship becomes difficult because as we do that,  to have someone stand up and say that is not what government is  supposed to be doing, I mean, what are we doing here? That is what we  have been doing.   Part of that should also be to have an ethical government; ethical  elected Members of Congress; and ethical Presidents, Vice Presidents,  and Cabinet members.   As I have said, there are a bunch of rules governing that. This is  one more that I think would help to make it appropriate.   Madam Chair, I urge support for the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, pursuant to House Resolution  476, I offer amendments en bloc.    Madam Chair, I don't have any speakers, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I ask for a ``yes'' vote on the  en bloc package, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, pursuant to House Resolution  476, I offer amendments en bloc.    Madam Chair, I don't have any speakers. We  have been doing so many votes on the House floor that it appears we  have worn down the Members of Congress. We don't have as many people  over here to speak as we normally do on our en bloc packages.   Madam Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the en bloc package, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, pursuant to House Resolution  476, I offer amendments en bloc.    Madam Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes  to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar).    Madam Chair, I have no further requests for  time. I urge a ``yes'' vote on en bloc package No. 4, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do  now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Cuellar) having assumed the chair, Ms. Moore, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2500) to  authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2020 for military activities  of the Department of Defense and for military construction, to  prescribe military personnel  [[Page H5576]]  strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________
