 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to a provision in  the Coast Guard reauthorization that would decimate the offshore wind  industry and prevent the United States from reaching President Biden's  clean energy goals.   If passed, all offshore wind installation vessels will be required to  be U.S.-flagged and crewed, but there aren't any existing vessels that  meet these requirements. We must support our domestic shipbuilding and  mariner capacity, but this provision would constrict offshore wind  construction in the short term and would sacrifice union jobs and  energy independence in the long term.   We will not reach the President's goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore  wind by 2030 if this provision passes, and halting offshore wind  production would jeopardize the creation of up to 83,000 domestic jobs  by 2030.   In committee, I offered a solution that would ensure offshore wind  can thrive in the short term and create a pathway to more American  offshore wind jobs. A prevailing wage requirement ensures that American  mariners are not being passed up for jobs that we have the ships and  workforce to perform ourselves.  [[Page H3219]]    I support the intent of the crewing requirement language and am eager  to support the development of our domestic shipbuilding and crewing  capacity, but I cannot support the Coast Guard reauthorization with  this language included.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Larsen for his commitment to  working to resolve this issue, but I urge my colleagues to oppose this  language in any legislative vehicle.                            ____________________
