 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of our  Postal Service and in support of its mission to serve our people, in  support of its role in our democracy, in our elections, in support of  its role in delivering vital goods and services critical to the health  and well-being of our people and our economy and in support of the men  and women of the Postal Service who have added the pandemic to the list  of barriers they cast aside each day in their daily rounds.   Mr. Speaker, I note that we do not require that our government  departments and agencies show a ``profit.'' That is not their purpose.  We do not defend our country for a ``profit.'' We do not educate our  children for a ``profit.'' We do not protect our environment for a  ``profit.''   Mr. Speaker, we long ago rejected the Luddite movement which  advocated breaking machines in a futile effort to turn back scientific  and technological progress. Breaking and discarding postal sorting  machines is sabotage today, just as it was in the 1800s.   Mr. Speaker, I am deeply troubled by the alarming delays in First- Class, marketing, and Priority Mail documented by the Postal Service's  own briefing packet for the Postmaster General from last week. I have  seen evidence of these delays in the pictures sent and the stories told  to me by postal employees.   Mr. Speaker, I proudly cast my vote in support of the request from  the Postal Board of Governors for $25 billion in aid and in support of  H.R. 8015, the Delivering for America Act.
