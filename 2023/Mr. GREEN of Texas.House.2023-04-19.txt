 Mr. Chair, and I still I rise with but 30 seconds  to take a position.   It is impossible in the time allotted to give a proper recitation. I  can but say this: I don't believe that this is the place for this  decision to be made, regardless as to what your position is. I stand  against the legislation because I don't think it ought to be before the  House of Representatives.
