 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Arizona. He and I hold a deep, common conviction that Arizona is the  most important and best State in the Union, and I don't think anyone  here would debate that.   Mr. Speaker, last Monday, October 30, we were delivered the over- hyped ``bombshell'' story that Special Counsel Robert Mueller would  introduce some damning evidence about President Trump's collusion with  Russia via indictments.    On Friday, October 27, someone involved in the grand jury  investigation--now, don't forget, Mr. Speaker, that the purpose of a  grand jury is secrecy, but someone in that organization leaked  information to the press, specifically CNN, with no reasonable person  being able to count as a friend to the President of the United States;  and it caused every political pundit in the country to begin surmising  who would be the first to fall.   Reporters were assigned the story, revisiting campaign notes and  combing through stacks of research and fact sheets about so-called  evidence of Russia collusion.   Then the big reveal: Paul Manafort and Rick Gates were indicted for  crimes related to their business dealings with a Ukrainian politician  clinging to power in a country undergoing a revolution, back in 2014.  The FBI had been trying to indict them ever since. There was no mention  of the Trump campaign, not any whatsoever in the 12-count indictment.   In other words, Mr. Speaker the announcement amounted to what many  have called a ``nothing burger.''   Mainstream media members, who had spent all weekend promising the  viewers and their readers some new damning evidence about Trump, were  aghast.                                time  1915    Mueller had let them down. How could they face their audience now  with nothing to show? But wait, another indictment snuck in in the last  few hours, only a few hours later, right in the nick of time. George  Papadopoulos--now, here is our guy. This is the guy. He actually went  to Russia, and he proposed Trump meet with Putin. We have got him now.   Well, no. It turns out Papadopoulos was an unpaid intern who  possessed a background in researching Russia. When he suggested Trump  meet with the Russians, he was shot down quickly and firmly. The  indictment against Papadopoulos didn't even have to do with his work on  the campaign. He was indicted because he had lied to the FBI--again, no  collusion with the Trump campaign found whatsoever.   But that didn't stop the media from sensationalizing the news. After  all, they have a job to do. But the American people didn't fall for it,  Mr. Speaker. The New Yorker's legal writer, Jeffrey Toobin, and the  liberal vox.com have suggested Mueller seems to be conducting his  investigation like he is going after a mafia mob boss.   The problem with treating the Trump campaign as an organized crime  organization, clearly, is it presumes Trump's guilt. No matter how  well-intentioned and full of integrity Mr. Mueller might be, if he is  treating Trump like Al Capone, his tactics are wrong.   When trying to pursue charges on a mafia boss, the FBI pulls in the  street guys, threatens them with life in jail or some other steep  charge, unless they spill the beans on their superior. Once they crack,  they bring in the next level, all the way to the top. This is a well- known tactic, and it incentivizes those arrested to invent some  spurious testimony against their superiors.   Could Mr. Mueller be acting with vengeance or to vindicate his good  friend and colleague, James Comey, who had a very public feud with the  President? Well, we don't know, Mr. Speaker, but it is hard to take any  charges with this investigation seriously when they are going about it  in this fashion.   The main point is this, Mr. Speaker: at least James Comey, the media,  and the Democrats desperately want collusion to exist between Trump and  Russia. And when you want something that bad, you might even begin to  believe it is true, even if it is not.   But there is good news. Anyone sincerely looking for the drama of  American officials actually colluding with the Kremlin, need look no  further now than the emerging scandal concerning the sale of American  uranium reserves to Russia during Hillary Clinton's time at the State  Department.   The FBI, in 2009, under the Obama administration, began investigating  Russia's use of bribery, kickbacks, and extortion to gain a bigger  foothold in the American atomic energy industry. They knew this was  happening. The record is clear. Of course, Mr. Speaker, American  nuclear resources are a critical component of America's national  security. So any detail between Russian companies and U.S. atomic  energy resources would require a signoff from the State Department.   After all, Russia is a hostile foreign government. Correct? Democrats  certainly seem to believe so now, even though, in past years, most of  them couldn't find Russia on a map.   So when Rosatom, a Russian energy group, took control of the Canadian  Uranium One, which had control of mining and uranium stakes stretching  [[Page H8587]]  from Central Asia to the American West, that deal needed U.S. State  Department approval. After all, this meant that Russia, a hostile  foreign power, would control 20 percent of America's uranium industry.  And, of course, as Obama's FBI was investigating Russia for bribes and  extortion related to atomic energy, this deal should have raised a red  flag for the State Department.   Vladimir Putin really wanted the deal to go through because, per The  New York Times, it would allow him to realize his goal of becoming one  of the world's major atomic energy players. The only thing standing in  his way was Hillary Clinton's State Department. The month the deal was  approved by Hillary Clinton's State Department, Bill Clinton received  $500,000 from a Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin for a  ``speaking engagement'' in Moscow. Then, Mr. Speaker, Uranium One's  chairman used his family foundation to make a series of donations to  the Clinton Foundation, totaling $2.35 million.   Now, being under agreement to disclose all of their foundation  contributions publicly, the Clintons neglected still to reveal the  Uranium One donations. That is pretty convenient, Mr. Speaker. Are we  paying attention here?   Now, since the media seems to have an insatiable appetite for Russian  collusion, let's take a look at the Uranium One deal. That is a story  worth looking into, Mr. Speaker. And I would bet the biggest stake in  Washington, with anyone in this place, that if a special counsel was  appointed to look into it, that investigation would bring some truly  legitimate results.
