 Mr. Chair, I want to thank the Gentleman from Ohio for  your partnership on this amendment.   My team and I have loved working with you and your team on this issue  and appreciate your commitment to making this a bipartisan effort.   Right now, an existing data broker loophole allows our government to  make an end-run around our 4th amendment rights to access our personal  information without a warrant, court order, or subpoena.   How? Because they're buying it.   Cash doesn't hold the same legitimacy and authority as a warrant--but  right now, it's treated like it does.   This is wrong.   I'm sure that many of my colleagues don't want the Department of  Defense to see what they're looking at online. . . . but there's  nothing right now to prevent that.   Our search and browsing history, location data, health information-- all of this should be off-limits unless a court order says otherwise.   And that's why I'm so proud to lead this bipartisan amendment to  prevent the Department of Defense from purchasing data that would  otherwise require a warrant, court order, or subpoena.   Our amendment would rein in unauthorized surveillance practices and  take a big step forward to protect Americans' privacy.   I urge my colleagues to support it.
