 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, we have a short time left before  appropriations expire on Friday. Yesterday, we made some progress.   Thankfully, President Trump appears to have backed down from his  position for billions in direct appropriations for a border wall. For  the past several weeks, the President's insistence on $5 billion for a  wall has been the biggest obstacle to keeping the government open past  Friday.   The President's spokesperson has claimed that the administration can  build the full wall from reprogrammed funds given to other areas of the  government. Let me be very clear. Without our assent, the  administration cannot reprogram funds proposed by Congress for the full  wall. To do so would violate Congress's article I powers. They cannot  do it on their own, and the House and Senate will not approve a wall  from reprogrammed funds or anything else. It will not happen.   We Democrats have opposed massive appropriations for a border wall  for five reasons. It is not effective compared to other border security  measures. Expert after expert has said that. There is no plan to build  it. The President asked for $5 billion, but there are no plans of where  the wall would be, how much it would cost, what each part would be made  of. There is no plan to deal with eminent domain. There are lots of  people on the Texas border and on other borders who don't want to give  up their land. They have said they will fight it in court. It will take  years. We have not heard a peep out of the administration on how to  deal with that. Above all, the President promised that Mexico would pay  for it, not the American taxpayer. Was it a campaign issue? Yes. Yet,  throughout, the President said Mexico would pay for it. He never  campaigned on having Americans pay for a massive border wall,  ineffective as it would be.   The Democrats have been perfectly clear. We want smart, effective  border security, but that is not a wall. The President and, just this  morning, the Republican leader have suggested repeatedly that Democrats  are against all border security. Of course, we are not. Every expert  has looked at that and said it is a total lie. Frankly, the reason our  colleagues, the President, Leader McConnell, and others do it is that  they have no defense of the wall. Instead of defending the wall, they  say the Democrats are not for border security. Nothing could be further  from the truth, as shown by what we have supported in the past and  today.   This morning, the President also tweeted that Mexico could somehow  pay for the wall through a new trade deal. This is a huge turnaround  for a President who once insisted: Mark my words. Mexico will pay for  the wall 100 percent. Of course, there have been multiple fact checks  to show a new NAFTA could not possibly fund the wall directly or  indirectly. There is nothing in the new agreement that stipulates  Mexico must devote any resources to the United States, and any savings  from a trade deal, if there are any savings, don't go to the Treasury;  they go to American businesses and American taxpayers. Ultimately, the  President would have to tax the American people to fund his wall.  Mexico ain't footing the bill.   All that said, it is good news that the President has retreated from  his demand that Congress fund the wall. Now, we Democrats in the Senate  and in the House have made two reasonable  [[Page S7828]]  offers that, I believe, would glide through the House and Senate: No.  1, pass the six bipartisan appropriations bills and a 1-year CR for DHS  or, No. 2, pass a 1-year CR for all seven remaining appropriations  bills.   Leader McConnell proposed a short-term CR just a few minutes ago. We  would have preferred one of our two options, but I am glad the leader  thinks the government should not shut down over the President's demand  for a wall, and the Democrats will support this CR. The President and  the House should follow that lead because shutting down the government  over Christmas is a terrible idea--one of the worst to come down the  pike in a very long time.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on the CJR, criminal justice reform, I am  really deeply heartfelt in thanking everyone who was involved in the  criminal justice reform legislation.   I thank Senator Durbin, for whom this issue was a year's-long  passion. When Senator Durbin gets his teeth into an issue, he does not  let go until he achieves it, and he is great at getting it done. It was  a real victory for him.   Senator Booker felt this issue so passionately from his residents in  Newark and in seeing what had happened to friends of his and people he  had known. He was a brilliant legislative tactician in knowing just how  far to push and in getting the most he could from a Congress that was  not from our side of the aisle.   Senator Whitehouse carried the mantle of making sure that while  people are in prison, they are given adequate preparation so when they  come out, they don't become recidivists again--free from drugs, with  job training--and so they can become useful and productive members of  society.   Senator Harris also added her passion and experience as attorney  general to the great arguments for this bill.   I don't want to leave out colleagues on the other side of the aisle.  Senator Grassley played a real role as a statesman. Senator Lee did  tremendous work on this bill. Again, like with Senator Booker but from  an opposite point of view, he knew when to hold and knew when to fold.   I thank all of them because this bill will make an extraordinary  difference in countless lives by making our sentencing laws fairer and  smarter, by giving judges more discretion so low-level, nonviolent drug  offenses will not always be subject to arbitrary mandatory minimums; by  giving prisoners with good behavior and who work hard to rehabilitate  themselves better opportunities to prepare for their integration back  into society as productive citizens who can contribute to their  communities; and by ending the most abusive practices of our criminal  justice system, like juvenile solitary confinement and the shackling of  pregnant prisoners.   The bill got 87 votes. Those 87 votes are an entreaty to the new  Congress to do more. It is called FIRST STEP for a lot of reasons, one  being that many of us feel we have to go further and do more. Next  year, hopefully, we can, and the resounding support from both sides of  the aisle that this bill got should help us. It should importune us not  to let this be the last proposal but the first in this area. The law  will bring more justice to our justice system. I was proud to vote for  it and so grateful for the work of my colleagues who pulled a diverse  coalition together to get it across the line.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on China, negotiations are ongoing  between the Trump administration and Chinese officials about a  potential detente in our trading relationship. Of import to the Chinese  is the recent arrest of Huawei's CFO on charges of violating U.S.  sanctions law, which is only one area of concern when it comes to  Huawei's technology.   Let me be very clear. The United States should not make any--any-- concessions until and unless China makes credible and enforceable  commitments to end all forms of theft and extortion of American  intellectual property.   As Ambassador Lighthizer recently pointed out--and I cannot commend  him enough for the good job he is doing--during the Obama  administration alone, China made no fewer than 10 independent  commitments to get rid of forced technology transfers and cyber theft  policies.   As we know, China cyber espionage continues unabated. Just last week,  it was confirmed that China was behind the data breach of Marriott  hotels, and we know that they continue to require any company that  sells things--and there are so many companies that sell things in  China--to transfer their technology.   If we continue on this path that we have for the last 10 or 15 years,  we will no longer be the leading economy in the world. All the great  ideas Americans have because of our free and open and entrepreneurial  system will be stolen, purloined, and China will dominate.   We are there for fair competition. China doesn't compete fairly. I  have to say, neither the Bush nor the Obama administration stood up  strongly to China. This administration shows signs of doing it.   My message to President Trump: Don't back off. Follow Mr. Lighthizer,  not those in your administration, as reported, the Senate, Mr. Mnuchin,  Mr. Ross, and others, who want to settle for next to nothing. That  would be a disgrace.   President Trump has tried the conciliatory approach. He let ZTE off  the hook in hopes of gaining concessions from China on North Korea and  got none. North Korea continues to expand its nuclear capabilities.   Mr. President, do not make the same mistake again by interfering in  the case of Huawei's CFO. Mr. President, do not capitulate on U.S.  trade policy without meaningful, ironclad commitments from China to end  its predatory trade practices, its theft of our intellectual property,  and until China allows U.S. companies to compete freely in its markets  without technology transfer or other coercions. To do otherwise would  put the future of this great Nation at great risk.                            ____________________     Finally, Mr. President, I have come here to speak about  a dear friend and a wonderful colleague, the senior Senator from  Florida, Bill Nelson.   A Floridian born and bred, Bill Nelson didn't grow up with a silver  spoon in his mouth. Everything he has achieved in life, he achieved  because he worked for it. Hard work is one of his credos.   In high school, Bill raised cattle in his spare time. That is not  every teenager's idea of a good time, and that is something we never  did in Brooklyn, but it led to a lifetime association with Florida's 4- H Program, which continues to support Florida's agricultural community  today.   Just as important, Bill's extracurricular animal husbandry allowed  him to save up the $10,000 he needed to attend college at the  University of Florida. Even then, public service was never far from  this generous man's thoughts. He gave his first political speech as a  candidate for junior high school president--a race he won. In college,  he interned for Florida's Senator George Smathers, whose son Bruce  happened to be his roommate.   That internship turned out to be the lesser contribution of Bill's  friendship with Bruce because a few years after law school, Bruce would  introduce Bill to Grace Cavert, who became Grace Nelson, the love of  Bill's life.   For those of us who know Bill, we know he loves Grace more than  anything in the world. They are truly a dream team. Just to watch them  together, caring about each other so, brings joy to anyone's heart-- certainly mine. Many of my colleagues, of course, know Grace as well  and have worked closely with her, not the least reason being that she  is the authority in that household today.   With Grace by his side, Senator Nelson embarked on what would be a  distinguished career in public service in Florida as Congressman, tax  commissioner, and eventually Senator. Of course, along the way, Senator  Nelson would also earn the title of ``payload specialist'' abroad the  Space Shuttle Columbia. As most folks know, then-Congressman Nelson,  who was chair of  [[Page S7829]]  the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, participated in a  weeklong space flight on the Columbia. What most folks don't know,  however, is that the launch for the mission was aborted not once, not  twice, but three times. Eventually, though, the liftoff was achieved,  and Bill became only the second sitting Member of Congress to leave  Earth's atmosphere, where, in his words, he saw ``the blue brilliance  of the earth from the edge of the heavens.''   There is a name given to the shift in perspective experienced by  astronauts called the overview effect. Seeing the Earth from the window  of a space shuttle--that pale-blue marble in the vast emptiness of  space--makes you realize how fragile and also how beautiful our planet  truly is. Senator Nelson experienced something of an overview effect,  and although he already cared about the environment, he became a  lifelong champion of environmental causes.   Bill Nelson protected and preserved the Everglades, Florida's  beaches, and offshore waters by standing against offshore drilling.  There is none in Florida, and I have to a say that the reason is  sitting right to my left--Bill Nelson. Time and again, when rapacious  companies and others wanted to drill and risk the beauty of Florida's  coastline and its economic vitality, there was Bill Nelson, like  Horatio at the bridge, preventing it from happening. After the BP  oilspill, Bill Nelson made sure Florida's gulf communities got the  restitution they deserved from BP's settlement.   Senator Nelson has always been a loud voice speaking about the need  for action on climate change, as his beloved State of Florida gets hit  by ever more powerful storms and the low-lying areas, like Miami, get  flooded regularly.   Of course, seeing the Earth from space didn't just focus Bill's eyes  downward. This man is capable of doing many things at once. He kept  them firmly fixed on the horizons as well. It will be a long time  before the Senate sees a champion for NASA and space exploration like  Bill Nelson. It may never see one as committed again.   The Senate, the State of Florida, and the country will miss Bill  Nelson, as will Iris and I. He was even-tempered even in tempestuous  times. He was always civil in the midst of such incivility. When so  many of us are prone to looking backward, trying to figure out what we  did wrong or what we could have done differently, Bill was always  looking forward and upward.   I have had the pleasure not only of being Bill's colleague but being  his friend. What a fine human being. One of my greatest regrets here is  that some fine human beings are not going to be with us next time, and  this Chamber and this country will show they are missed.   There is nothing Bill is now looking forward to more than spending  time with his beloved Grace and visiting his children, Bill Junior and  Nan Ellen.   Every one of us salutes the great senior Senator from Florida,  everything he has accomplished in his distinguished career in the  Senate, and just the great man that he is.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I return to the floor to conclude saying  good-bye to Members of our caucus who will not be returning to this  Chamber next year. Last, but certainly not least, to me and to so many  of us, is my dear, dear friend, the Senator from Missouri--as she says  it--Claire McCaskill.   It should come as no surprise to anyone that the Senator from  Missouri found her way into politics. She got her start early. Growing  up in a family that was actively involved in government and politics,  Claire was not given the option to avoid subjects of national debate.  When Claire was 7 years old, she was sent door to door on Halloween,  saying: Trick or treat; vote for JFK.   Soon, politics wasn't just a passion passed down but a passion of her  own. In high school, Claire launched a stealth campaign to become  homecoming queen. In the tradition of her school, the football team  picked the winner. So Claire befriended all the linemen--doing small  favors, arranging dates--knowing there would be more of them than any  other position. Guess what. She won, not because she skated by on  popularity--although she was always popular--but because she put in the  work. She was tenacious and tactical, qualities she would take from  high school politics into the politics of the wider and older world.   That is how, as a Democrat in a State already becoming more  conservative during her youth, Claire would go on to represent Missouri  at nearly every level of government. As a prosecutor, in the State  house, as State auditor, and, eventually, for 12 amazingly wonderful  and productive years as Senator.   I was chair of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee in 2005.  Claire was just coming off a difficult loss in the Governor's race,  after which she ``drank a lot of red wine and ate too many cookies,''  by her own typical frank admission. I had heard so much about her that  I flew to London to meet with Claire and her dear husband Joe about a  possible Senate race. Almost immediately, I was struck by the force of  her personality.   She is a whirlwind. As Claire's mother, Betty Anne, said of her,  ``Integrity, independence, and guts--that's what Claire McCaskill is  made of.'' Everyone who meets Claire can see that from the get-go. By  the end of dinner, I was so eager for Claire to run that I did  something I almost never do. I paid for dinner. I have never been more  glad that I did because Claire became an exceptional Senator and one of  my closest friends, not just here in the Senate but in life. A moderate  at heart, Claire had a knack for finding compromise between our two  parties--a theme among many of our departing Members.   She worked across the aisle with Senator Collins to protect seniors  from financial scams. She worked to fight for victims of opioid  addiction, working with Republicans on taking on the big pharmaceutical  companies that were funneling money to organizations to promote their  own dangerous products.   In the tradition of her political idol, Harry Truman, she took a seat  on the Armed Services Committee and fought fiercely for our veterans  and our military.   Her hearings on the waste, fraud, and abuse of military contractors  ushered in long-overdue reforms to military contracting, increasing  transparency and accountability.   Almost every issue that Claire got her teeth into, she never let go  and always succeeded. She was amazing as a Senator.   Of course, Claire wasn't just pragmatic. One of the reasons we love  her is that she is both pragmatic and principled and combines those two  in a unique way.   I will never forget the vote on the Dreamers. Claire was seated in a  seat  [[Page S7852]]  back there. She was a more junior Member. She knew that voting to bring  the Dreamers home--a pathway to citizenship and living here in  America--could mean the end of her election. She said that to me. But  she said: I cannot vote against them. And we walked down the aisle  together, tears streaming down her cheeks, and, of course, she voted  yes.   The Senate has its fair share of dealmakers. It has its fair share of  principled fighters as well. But rarely, rarely, rarely is a Senator so  adept at both. That is our Claire McCaskill.   We will miss far more, of course, than Claire the Senator. So many of  us will miss Claire the person. When she has something to say to you,  she does not hold back. Believe me--I know. I have been called just  about every name in the book by Claire McCaskill, and each time, it  rang true, but I didn't mind it because I know it was done with both  affection and a desire to make me better and do a better job. And I can  say this: Whatever job I am doing here as leader is in significant part  because of Claire McCaskill's loving but pointed criticisms. I will  miss them so much.   She is amazing. I am not the only one she criticized, and I am not  the only one she criticized using the words that came right to her  mouth. They say they used to keep a swear jar on her desk in the  Missouri Legislature. I would be surprised if they didn't keep a few  lined up along the whole desk.   But as much as Claire can sometimes criticize you in a pointed way,  she can also make you laugh. She said her father insisted on two  things: that she learn the rules of football and how to tell a good  joke. That, she did. And more than that, she can tell a good joke at  her own expense. That is just one of many reasons she was so well liked  in this Chamber by Democrats and Republicans.   It is rare you can find someone who speaks her mind so directly and  yet be so loved. That is one of the many uniquenesses of this wonderful  lady, Claire McCaskill. And I am not the only one who felt that way.  After a farewell address in this Chamber, the line of Senators to say a  few words about Claire was long, and it wasn't just on our side of the  aisle.   I could go on about Senator McCaskill for quite a while, but I am  sure she is already telling me that I am getting longwinded. So let me  close with this: When Claire was 9 years old, her father took her to  the annual Jackson Day dinner in Springfield, MO, to hear the big  political speeches on offer that year. After all, this was a famous  venue that had hosted the giants of American politics--William Jennings  Bryan, Harry Truman, JFK.   Well, guess who delivered the closing address at the Jackson Day  dinner this year. Claire McCaskill, whose impact on her State and her  country, as well as on the Senate and on so many of us, belongs in the  same category as those distinguished names and will live on just as  long.   Claire, we are going to miss you so. I will, the Senate will,  Missouri will, and America will. I wish you and Joe and your wonderful  family all the happiness in your next endeavors.   I yield the floor.
