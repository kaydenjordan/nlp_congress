 Mr. Chair, I want to thank the chairman for his  long work on this issue, and I want to thank a couple of the  cosponsors--this is a bipartisan bill--Congressman Peters,  Congresswoman Speier, and Mr. Ken Calvert, who have worked on this for  years. I appreciate the words of the gentleman who just spoke, a great  leader in civil rights movement, but as he probably knows, title VII of  the Civil Rights Act does require notice, as well as this legislation  hopefully will do.   And let me be clear. This legislation makes the ADA better because it  requires that businesses be told and be given a chance to fix the  problem if there is a problem.   Under current law, that is not the case. The goal of this bill, the  ADA legislation that we have, is to have accommodations for the  disabled and to make sure businesses comply with that accommodation.   When a lawsuit is filed, many times the business is never told what  the problem is, and it may be a year or longer before that lawsuit ends  up in a Federal court. Under this legislation, businesses, once they  are put on notice, they have 180 days to fix the problem or make  substantial progress.   If the goal of the ADA is to get problems fixed, the legislation we  have here helps that. But what is taking place in our country, Mr.  Chair, because of the legislation that we currently have under the law,  some lawyers, as mentioned earlier, use the legislation and abuse the  legislation under current ADA to the disadvantage of the disabled to  make a profit for themselves.   And here is the way it works, Mr. Chair. A litigant, a plaintiff,  will send a letter or sometimes file a lawsuit against a small  business. We are not talking about the big businesses--we are talking  about small mom-and-pop stores--and telling them they have an ADA  violation. The letter--the lawsuit--may not even state what the  violation is. And the letter says: ``You pay or we will continue the  lawsuit.''   These businesses don't have the money to hire a lawyer to represent  them, so what do they do? They pay the $3,000, $5,000, the extortion,  so that those lawsuits are dismissed.   The problem that may be alleged in that lawsuit is never required to  be fixed for two reasons: one, the lawsuit doesn't require it; and  second, these lawsuits may not state what the problem is.   So, if the goal of the ADA is to make businesses comply, these serial  plaintiffs that are filing multiple lawsuits still don't require that  the businesses, even if they get the money, have to comply with the  alleged violation. This is happening throughout the United States.   Let me mention just a few of these. In Florida, a plaintiff named  Howard Cohan filed 529 of these lawsuits; California, a person named  Vogel filed 124; Pennsylvania, a plaintiff named Mielo brought 21  lawsuits; and even in New York, a plaintiff named Hirsch brought 24  lawsuits.   What are they doing?   These plaintiffs may not even live in the State where the violation  is supposed to occur. These plaintiffs may not even be disabled  themselves, but they will file the lawsuit against these businesses,  sometimes using Google Maps to find a violation in the parking lot,  send a letter from a law firm saying, ``You comply with paying us, or  this lawsuit''--or paying us this shakedown is what it amounts to--``or  we will continue the lawsuit,'' and many businesses file or pay the  extortion. It has become a profit industry.   It doesn't help the disabled. Contrary to what the other side has  said, these lawsuits do not help the disabled. In fact, I think these  lawsuits are being filed on behalf of serial plaintiffs who want  nothing else except to receive extortion money.   Before my time is completed, I want to mention some of the Federal  judges. One Federal judge from New York has taken notice of these  cases.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Chair, Federal judges have said that there are  issues with these drive-by lawsuits.   Judge Brian Cogan of the Eastern District of New York, in 2016, in  his decision, said that these cases, ``are brought against small bars  and grills, restaurants, or bodegas or occasionally corner grocery  stores (and sometimes their landlords), which are likely ill-equipped  financially to vigorously defend these violations, and it is to  intimidate businesses to settle before the trial takes place.''   I have parents that are in their 90s. I am concerned about access for  all disabled people, and the thought that this bill makes it worse for  the disabled is wrong. This bill makes businesses comply and puts them  on notice. If they don't comply within the time period, then file the  lawsuit, go after them, but businesses should be able to have the  notice of what the problem is so that they can fix it, which is the  goal of the ADA: to make businesses comply.   And that is just the way it is.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Yes, the gentleman from Georgia is absolutely  correct, I am aware of this matter.   Also, I am aware that the gentleman joined Chairman Goodlatte and  about 60 Members of this Chamber last year to urge the Justice  Department to finalize a regulation in this area with the intent of  providing certainty. Even still, it is not clear that there is a  statutory obligation under the ADA for the Department of Justice to  act, which is why H.R. 620 doesn't address that issue specifically.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman is aware, this  legislation makes it better for the disabled to have access under the  notice and cure requirement.   The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.    The Judiciary Committee will continue to work with  the Department of Justice and stakeholders on this. In fact, for  jurisdictions where courts have held the ADA does apply to websites, we  believe protections in H.R. 620 will be applicable as well.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman and I thank Mr.  Denham for offering this amendment and letting us all know some of the  drive-by lawsuit problems in California.   Mr. Chairman, the Department of Justice, for example, has come up  with 250 pages of regulations recently about the ADA. These regulations  are sent out to the businesses. It is important, as the gentleman from  California has mentioned, that these businesses be able to understand  what those regulations are because many of these businesses that are  being targeted by unscrupulous lawyers are minority-owned businesses,  some first-generation Americans who have come into our country trying  to make ends meet.   So the amendment is a good idea. I support the amendment, and I urge  all Members of this body to vote for it as well.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.   The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment because it  would defeat the whole purpose of the bill, which is to resolve access  issues under title III without the need for expensive litigation. The  private enforcement provisions provided in title III of the ADA are  already a powerful tool to achieve greater accessibility through  injunctive relief.   Importantly, the ADA does not provide for damages in private  lawsuits; it never has. This amendment would then, for the first time,  allow such damages, which will drive up litigation costs and provide  even more fodder for trial lawyers to abuse the law. Businesses should  use their resources to fix access to problems, not to pay unnecessary  and wasteful litigation costs.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his comment  about having faith in judges. As a former judge, I appreciate that  comment.   When the ADA legislation was debated here on this House floor in  1990, there was discussion about this whole issue. The purpose of the  ADA legislation that passed Congress was to fix the problems that  businesses had in accessibility for the disabled. It was not designed  for punitive damages at all. It was designed to fix the problem. That  is why the underlying legislation that we are sponsoring today makes  businesses move in a timely manner if there is a violation.   So this would change the whole concept of the ADA. Mr. Chairman, I  oppose this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Foster).   The amendment was rejected.                    Amendment No. 4 Offered by Ms. Speier    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in  part A of House Report 115-559.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for offering  this amendment and being the original sponsor of this legislation. I  support the amendment. The substantial progress provision in H.R. 620  provides needed flexibility in cases in which removing a barrier is  halted for reasons beyond the business' control.   For example, a business may not be able to pour concrete in Alaska  during the winter to fix a ramp. Likewise, a business may find that  getting a building permit from their local government is taking longer  than expected.   In these cases, as well as other unexpected events, the substantial  progress provision provides judges with a discretionary standard to  determine whether the improvements and progress by the business are  both material and meaningful.   This clarifying amendment further defines the term ``substantial  progress'' to make clear that circumstances beyond the business'  control--owner--are the only allowable justifications for not making  substantial progress within the required time.   The amendment will help provide more access for the disabled. I  support it because it makes this legislation better.    Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment.   The goal of the bill is to provide more access for Americans more  quickly. Absent circumstances beyond a business' control, 120 days is  sufficient time to remove a barrier. Under this amendment offered by  the gentleman, instead of 180 days total, a business would have up to  120 days, instead, to fix access problems.   I believe this amendment improves the bill. I urge its support, and I  thank the gentleman for offering this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of Mrs.  McMorris Rodgers, and I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:           Page 5, beginning on line 22, strike ``the specific       sections of the Americans with Disabilities Act alleged to       have been violated,''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Poe) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment will make it easier  for a disabled American to provide a business with a notice of an ADA  violation.   Violations of the ADA can be very technical. The Department of  Justice has hundreds, if not thousands, of pages of regulations and  guidance documents on complying with the public accommodation  requirements of title III of the ADA. Given that the Department of  Justice will not certify whether a business' property is ADA compliant,  these ADA requirements are often left to the interpretation of  plaintiffs' lawyers.   The notice provisions of H.R. 620 require that those who allege a  business is violating the ADA must provide the business with a  description of ``the specific sections of the Americans with  Disabilities Act alleged to have been violated.'' This provision was  designed to ensure that businesses have a clear picture of the alleged  violation with the business.   However, this requirement may go too far. Accordingly, the amendment  removes this requirement, making clear that written notices provided by  disabled individuals can be written in plain English, without legalese.   Removing this requirement will also facilitate a dialogue between the  individual and the business. Additionally, it may avoid any need for a  disabled individual to hire a lawyer.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's  comments.   I want to remind folks that notice requirement is required even under  title VII of the Civil Rights Act. It is also required under title I of  the original ADA legislation. So this is not a new phenomena.   This legislation and this amendment gives potential plaintiffs the  ability to advise and put a business on notice without even having to  hire a lawyer with the legalese requirements that are written by the  Department of Justice, which constantly updates what requirements are  under the ADA.   The intention is to simply have the violation described in a way that  is sufficient to put the business on notice of what the ADA violation  is.   Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I would ask that all Members support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe).   The amendment was agreed to.   The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 7 will not  be offered.                                time  1115     Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now  rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Mooney of West Virginia) having assumed the chair, Mr. Womack, Acting  Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,  reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 620) to amend the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to  promote compliance through education, to clarify the requirements for  demand letters, to provide for a notice and cure period before the  commencement of a private civil action, and for other purposes, had  come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, Jennifer's childhood was violently  chaotic. By her early twenties, she was living on the streets, begging  and stealing to survive.   After a local gang member suspected that she may have stolen his  money, her life became even more horrific and hellish. The gangster  beat her mercilessly with a baseball bat until she collapsed, and then  he and other gang members pistol-whipped her and burned her with  cigarettes. They tattooed their names all over her body, branding her  as property. For 6 years, they held her in slavery, forcing her to have  sex with countless men for money.   Desperate, Jennifer tried to kill herself, but when the rope broke,  she resolved to escape. Luckily for Jennifer, she found a shelter and  was able to rebuild her life. She covered up the traffickers' names  with flowers and the words ``free yourself.''   We, as a society, owe it to Jennifer and survivors like her to  protect them  [[Page H1201]]  and put the slave masters in the jailhouse, where they belong.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
