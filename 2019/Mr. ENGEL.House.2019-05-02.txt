Mr. Chairman, I want to say very strongly that on behalf  of the Foreign Affairs Committee and also the Energy and Commerce  Committee, we support this amendment. It is a very good amendment.   The Paris Agreement, signed in 2015, is the first truly universal  agreement among nations to tackle climate change. Rarely is there  consensus among nearly all nations on a single topic. But with the  Paris Agreement, leaders from around the world collectively agreed that  climate change is driven by human behavior, that it is a threat to the  environment and all of humanity, and that global action is needed to  stop it.   It also created a clear framework for all countries to make emission  reduction commitments. At present, 197 countries--every nation on  Earth, with the last signatory being war-torn Syria--have adopted the  Paris Agreement. This agreement includes a series of mandatory measures  for the monitoring, verification, and public reporting of progress  towards a country's emission reduction targets.   The emission reduction targets themselves are voluntary. Each nation  sets their own, respectful of national sovereignty, and there is no  penalty for missing the targets. The idea is to create a culture of  accountability and maybe some peer pressure to get countries to reduce  emissions.   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox), the  author of this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding, and I want  to say unequivocally, on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committee and  the Energy and Commerce Committee, we strongly support this amendment.  It is an excellent amendment. I also want to thank the gentleman for  working with the committees on this amendment.
