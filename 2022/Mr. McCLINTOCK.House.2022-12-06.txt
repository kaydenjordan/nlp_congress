 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, DHS Secretary Ali Mayorkas has repeatedly asserted,  including in sworn testimony to multiple committees of this House, that  the southern border is secure. This, of course, is a lie, and not even  a subtle one.    We know the numbers--a stunning 4.1 million encounters since  inauguration day, when Joe Biden reversed the Trump administration's  enforcement measures. In the same period, another 1 million known got- aways have entered the country while the border patrol has been  overwhelmed changing diapers and arranging for transportation for  thousands of illegal crossings each day.   So how do our Democratic colleagues react to this unprecedented  illegal immigration they have unleashed?   Do they call on the Biden administration to stop the releases?  [[Page H8766]]    Do they call on the President to actually enforce U.S. immigration  law or at least stop incentivizing this mass illegal immigration?   No. Instead, they produce this bill, that readmits immigrant veterans  who were later deported, mainly for committing criminal offenses.   This needs to be clearly understood. A noncitizen who joins the  military promising to defend our country, and instead commits crimes  against the citizens of our country is subject to deportation, and  rightly so.   This bill adds a political advisory committee, handpicked by Mr.  Mayorkas that, in effect, can override our deportation laws, and it  invites criminal offenders who have already been deported back into our  country. It presumes they are of good moral character despite their  criminal offenses simply by producing a green card. This is  astonishing.   Let's be very clear, that the vast majority of legal immigrants who  enlist in our military do so because of patriotism toward our country,  and they are exemplary citizens and exemplary members of our Armed  Forces. In recognition of their service, we offer them special avenues  for naturalization under the Immigration and Nationality Act.   That is as it should be. About 3 percent of U.S. veterans today are  foreign-born, and many of them have chosen to become U.S. citizens. But  that is not what this bill is about. This bill is about the bad apples  who have been ordered deported for breaking our laws.   Since its creation in 2002, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services  has naturalized over 148,000 members of the U.S. military.                                time  1315    If an alien servicemember or veteran is removed from this country, it  is only after that alien has had their due process in immigration court  and an immigration judge has issued a final order of removal.   Alien servicemembers and veterans are also afforded a special process  upon encounter by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, under  which, through a totality of the circumstances approach, ICE agents  determine whether arrest and placement in removal proceedings are the  appropriate actions to take.   However, in this bill, the Democrats have decided that an advisory  committee of people chosen by Secretary Mayorkas is better equipped to  determine whether an alien's actions warrant removal than a trained ICE  official.   Yesterday in the Committee on Rules, the chair of the subcommittee  even indicated that these random people chosen by the Secretary would  be better than a trained immigration judge at determining whether an  alien should be able to stay in the U.S.   During the Committee on the Judiciary markup, my Republican  colleagues offered an array of amendments aimed at ensuring alien  servicemembers, veterans, and their family members who committed  serious crimes would not be able to benefit from the provisions in this  bill that prevent removal and allow green cards to be issued.   We tried to prevent individuals with convictions for things like drug  trafficking, firearms trafficking, explosives trafficking, perjury,  domestic violence, obstruction of justice, and even illegal voting from  being able to benefit from the bill's provisions, but the Democrats  rejected nearly all such amendments.   They did reluctantly agree to exclude murderers, rapists, and child  sex abusers as beneficiaries of this bill. I suppose we can claim some  progress.   They couldn't even bring themselves to accept an amendment to  preclude aliens who have DUI convictions from benefiting from this  bill. They decided that five DUIs were too many. So, ridiculously, the  bill allows aliens to have four DUI convictions and still benefit from  this bill.   Democrats in committee also opposed an amendment to ensure that alien  veterans who benefit from the bill were honorably discharged from the  military. Right now, as the bill stands, it only requires that the  alien have been discharged under other than honorable conditions.   Democrats also rejected a Republican amendment that would have given  the victims of a crime committed by the alien servicemember a say in  whether or not the alien should face immigration consequences.   This bill once again lays bare the true objectives of the Democrats.  First, ignore the 4.1 million illegal aliens encountered by Border  Patrol and the 1 million got-aways as well, blurring the distinction  between legal immigrants who obey our laws and the millions of illegal  immigrants that the Democrats are now happily allowing to stream into  our country. Then, they introduce bills like this that blur the  distinction between the many legal immigrants who have honorably served  in our Nation's Armed Forces and the handful of bad apples who have  broken our laws and have been ordered deported for doing so.   This is the woke insanity that grips the Democratic Party today.  Thank God the voters have just broken their grip on the House of  Representatives.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Bost).    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is correct that the  legislation emanating from the Judiciary Committee doesn't have  anything to do with the border because the Democrats, having created  this monumental crisis, refused to do anything to address it.   Instead, we are left with bills like this that set distractions on  the most important question facing America today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Issa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan), the ranking member of the  Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we can now plainly see the effect of the Democrats' open  border policies on communities across our Nation; the strain on our  schools, our hospitals, our public safety, working class wages and  opportunities, and social services.   No civilization has ever survived the magnitude of illegal mass  migration that the Democrats have unleashed upon our country in the  span of just 23 months; and Gallup warns us there are another 42  million people living in poverty just in Latin America and the  Caribbean who intend to come here now that they can.   When Secretary Mayorkas appeared before the House Judiciary  Committee, he couldn't tell us how it benefits the American people to  have their classrooms packed with non-English-speaking students, their  emergency rooms flooded with illegals demanding basic care, how their  families will be safer with increased gang activity and fentanyl  inundating communities, or how working families will be made better off  by flooding the labor market with cheap illegal labor, or how taxpayers  are served by footing the bill for supporting a largely unskilled,  uneducated, and dependent population.   Now, where is this bill taking us? Well, we already know because we  have already had a taste of it. For a while, we allowed aliens on  temporary visas and even illegal immigrants here under DACA to enlist  so that they could claim a fast track to citizenship. It was called the  MAVNI program.   One MAVNI enlistment, Ji Chaoqun, was found to be a Chinese spy. A  number of foreign nationals who enlisted in our military were  subsequently deported for committing crimes. That program was such a  debacle that the Obama administration, the architects of DACA, had to  suspend it in 2016 because of the danger it posed to national security.   Now, foreign nationals who come to America legally, who obey our laws  and seek to serve our country because of a love of it and of the  principles upon which it is founded, are one of our greatest strengths.   Eleven years ago, I spoke at the funeral of Corporal Gurpreet Singh,  whose family had emigrated from India legally 11 years before.   Let me tell you a little bit about Gurpreet Singh. His father  described him this way. He said Gurpreet ``was always a very patriotic  man for the U.S. From the time he was a little boy, he knew he wanted  to serve in the U.S. military. Gurpreet was very proud of his service  with the Marines.''   Corporal Singh was wounded in combat, chose to return, overstayed his  assignment in order to relieve a friend, and was killed in action in  Helmond Province, June 22, 2011.   Yet, the Democrats are either unable or unwilling to tell the  difference between a Chinese spy like Ji Chaoqun and an American hero  like Gurpreet Singh. It appears the Democrats are attempting to equate  the heroism, devotion, and fidelity of heroes like Gurpreet Singh with  the convicted criminals that a court has ordered to be deported from  our country, or the lawless, illegal mass migration the Democrats are  not only ignoring, but actively aiding and abetting with their  policies.   Now, even if every convicted criminal the Democrats are trying to  benefit with this bill were meritorious, wrongly convicted of crimes  and exemplary in every way, we are still talking about an infinitesimal  fraction of those who are being allowed into our country every day by  the dangerous policies of this administration. That includes 120 known  terrorists we have intercepted, and God only knows how many more among  the 1 million got-aways who have entered our country on Joe Biden's  watch.   The Immigration and Citizenship Subcommittee of the Judiciary  Committee has done nothing to address this crisis; the Judiciary  Committee has done nothing to address this crisis; and the House has  done nothing to address this crisis, a crisis that literally began on  Inauguration Day when Biden reversed the policies of the Trump  administration that had finally secured our borders.   I can assure the American people that 28 days from today, all of that  is going to change.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I would remind my friend that every  alien who serves in our military has the right to naturalize; but that  does not give them a right to commit crimes against our country, and  that is what this bill does.   This amendment sets 90 days as the deadline for promulgating  regulations to implement this bill, a bill that overrides the laws  governing deportation of aliens who commit crimes in our country if  they have enlisted in the Armed Forces. It raises some disturbing  questions.   Why is it that the bill surrenders legislative prerogatives to the  executive? If you are going to write the law, then write it in its  entirety in the open.                                time  1400    Yes, we have been granting these powers to the executive branch for a  very long time. The point is that 10 times more laws are written by the  bureaucracies than by the body solely vested with lawmaking authority,  but we will save that discussion for another day.   Ninety days is an absurdly short period of time to write the  regulations, publish the regulations, allow for full public input for  the regulations, rewrite the regulations in light of public comments,  and publish the final version. It begs the question: Why?   Is it possible that the supporters of this law know exactly what they  want to do and have no interest in listening to the public? That has  been the history of the left's approach to defending the public safety  and the Nation's sovereignty, so it would not much surprise me if this  is the case.   Mr. Speaker, I would simply say that it is clear that the supporters  of the amendment are simply trying to rush a bad bill into  implementation without the public having any opportunity to see the  ramifications of this bill's provisions.   As I said earlier, we tried to get into the bill a provision that  would allow the victims of these criminal aliens to testify as to the  impact of the crimes on their lives, and the Democrats rejected it.   Notice and comment periods themselves require 30 to 60 days after the  notice of proposed rulemaking is published for the public to submit  comments about the proposed rule. After that, the agency has to comb  through and respond to all of the submitted comments. There is simply  no way to comply with Executive Order 12866's economic analysis  requirement for a significant rule, and that is certainly what this is,  within a 90-day period of enactment.   It is apparent that the Democrats are trying to rush out an interim  final rule on this bill before the American public has any opportunity  to see what they are doing. We can only conclude that the Democrats  know that the American people are not going to like what they see.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment and a ``no'' vote  on the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.                   Announcement By the Speaker Pro Tempore     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
