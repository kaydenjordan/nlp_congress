 Mr. Speaker, when it comes to bank regulation, the job of  the regulator is to balance the need for economic growth with the  safety and soundness of the financial system. With fresh memories of  the most recent financial crisis, it is natural for regulators to err  on the side of being overly cautious so they aren't blamed when  something goes wrong.   Unfortunately, this has led to a situation in which regulators are  evaluating stress tests based on subjective and unclear standards. The  stress tests are opaque; it is like asking banks to kick a field goal  when they don't even know where the goal posts are. What is more, the  regulators keep ratcheting up the standards.   For the stress tests to achieve their goal, however--the goal of  keeping the financial system safe and sound--they need to be  transparent and they need to be fair.   H.R. 4293, a bill with bipartisan support, would approve the stress  testing process for bank holding companies by repealing the ability of  regulators to reject a financial institution's stress test based on  subjective and opaque standards.   Another important improvement to the process would be the elimination  of the overly burdensome midcycle review by shifting from biannual to  annual stress testing requirements.   These reforms would make it easier for Congress, the markets, and the  public to assess both the integrity of the findings of the stress tests  and the effectiveness of the Fed's regulatory oversight.   Some critics, nonetheless, have claimed that this bill would weaken  Dodd-Frank. On the contrary, H.R. 4293 would improve the flawed  standards of Dodd-Frank and strengthen the stress testing process to  ensure that it produces the results we seek: a safer and more stable  financial system.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New York, Lee Zeldin, and  Congressman  David Scott for supporting this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.
