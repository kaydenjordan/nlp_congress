 Madam President, today I have the distinct honor  of recognizing Gabryelle Perkins of Sweet Grass County as Montanan of  the Month for her devotion to the Big Timber community and her passion  for educating and supporting young Montanans both in and out of the  classroom.   Gabby was born and raised in the great State of Montana and, like  myself, is a proud graduate of Montana State University--``Go Cats!''  Upon wrapping up her studies at MSU, Gabby earned a degree in English  education and a minor in writing. For the past 11 years, Gabby--or as  her students know her, Ms. Perkins--has taught English at Sweet Grass  County High School.   Her passion for working with students extends far beyond the  classroom. Gabby encourages her students to be involved in  extracurricular activities that have a positive impact on Big Timber  and Sweet Grass County. Every year, she works with her students to put  on a play for their community. When Gabby isn't helping her students on  the stage or serving as a student council adviser, she leads a  volunteer group for Montana students to give back. Gabby's students  involved in SAVY, also known as Serving and Volunteering Youth,  participate in local coat and food drives, leadership workshops,  recycling programs, and fundraising events. The SAVY group also  develops resources to help provide clothes or food for students in  need.   I have no doubt that Gabby's students and everyone in Big Timber are  grateful for her commitment to supporting young Montanans. It is  because of teachers like Ms. Perkins that Montana has the best and  brightest students in the Nation. It is my honor to recognize Ms.  Perkins for her devotion to supporting young Montanans in and out of  the classroom. Keep up the great work, Gabby.                            ____________________
