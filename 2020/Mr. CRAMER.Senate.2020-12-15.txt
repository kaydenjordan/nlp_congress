 Mr. President, this has been a challenging year  for millions of Americans impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many  organizations have stepped up to assist with delivering food, and I  want to recognize one North Dakota organization that continues to  expand its services to partner with other local organizations reaching  out to those in need.   The Great Plains Food Bank has served communities in North Dakota  since 1983, regularly dispatching trucks to all 53 counties across the  State. With USDA estimates that 27 percent of all food produced in the  United States never makes it to the dinner table, the Great Plains Food  Bank's mission is to get this surplus food from those who have it to  those who need it. It has joined forces with hundreds of food industry  partners to recover their surplus shelf-stable and perishable food  products. These include local, regional and national growers,  processors, manufacturers, retailers, Federal and State government food  programs, food drives, and Feeding America, the Nation's food bank  network.   The Great Plains Food Bank took a significant step forward last month  when it opened a second distribution center, this one in Bismarck, to  better facilitate the delivery of food across western and central North  Dakota, serving 100 soup kitchens, food pantries, and shelters. This  new warehouse now has room for freezers and refrigerators, office space  and facilities for volunteers.  [[Page S7499]]    Opening the Bismarck distribution center is one of the goals of the  food bank's ``Feed the Future'' campaign, which has been raising funds  since 2015 and is also hoping to expand the Fargo headquarters and  increase the total of meals it serves next year. This very timely  expansion of food services across the State comes when more and more  people are depending on these deliveries to feed themselves and their  families.   These services are possible because of a committed network of staff,  volunteers, and corporate sponsors and partners, who provide the funds  and workforce to continue the distribution every week throughout the  year.   In this holiday season during the end of a very difficult year, I  congratulate the Great Plains Food Bank on its vision and ongoing  success in delivering food across the State. On behalf of all North  Dakotans, I thank all who work for and with the Great Plains Food Bank  for their commitment to this cause. I wish them continued success and  community support for years to come.                            ____________________
