 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for making that point,  although I am somewhat sorry because I was going to make the same  point. But I am going to make another point.   First of all, let me say to those who may be watching, the gentleman  who just spoke from Arkansas is one of my best friends in the Congress.  He is a wonderful, wonderful person. He is dead flat wrong, however, in  this assertion.   His motion will not give a single cent to the National Guard, not a  single cent to the police, not a single cent to anybody.   All it will do is send the bill back to committee. It will delay this  bill to do all the other things that it does from being enacted.   It is sad that the Republicans in the Senate haven't passed a single  appropriation bill. And, golly day, it took a long time to get them to  some agreement on the supplemental, and then, when they agreed on the  supplemental, they left the money for the National Guard out.   So, I say to my friend from Arkansas, who is my dear, dear friend and  a wonderful person, your amendment, with all due respect, first of all,  as you know, is not going to go anywhere. All you will do is return the  bill to committee and slow this process down and not give a single cent  to the National Guard or policemen, either Capitol Police or any other  police. That is the reality.   Now, I wanted to rise and speak on behalf of this bill. I want to  thank the chairman, Mr. Ryan, and I want to thank my good friend, who  is also another dear friend of mine. Unfortunately, sometimes people  think everybody dislikes one another. I happen to like the gentlewoman  who is the ranking member, who is, I think, one of our best Members in  the House on your side of the aisle.   I know that this is a difficult bill in some cases for your side of  the aisle.                                time  1615    I have been here a long time. We just honored Jerry Lewis, who was  the gentleman from California who had your position and had the  chairman's position. He was back and forth. They came to this House in  a bipartisan way to say, let's build this institution into the kind of  institution that Americans want.   That is what this bill does. This bill gives us the opportunity to  hire, retain, and pay competitively our staff, who are extraordinary  people. The American people are getting more than their money's worth  with our staff, because they are extraordinarily able people, well- educated people, experienced people, who make a difference for America.  This bill seeks to compensate them, not as much as they get in the  private sector, but competitively, at least with the executive  departments, so the executive departments are not taking all of our  people. That is reason enough to be for this bill.   Now, there is something in this bill I don't like, and no other  Member probably will come to this floor and say it. Members of the  Congress of the United States have not received a cost of living  adjustment--forget about a raise--a cost of living adjustment since, I  believe, 2009, for 11 or 12 years. And this bill says, oh, we are not  going to take one this year either.   Now, let me tell you something. The result of this irresponsible  demagogic action--and I don't say any personal aspersions on anybody-- is that only rich people will be able to serve in the House of  Representatives.   Now, very frankly, I live alone. My wife died. I am in good shape. I  don't need the COLA. It will make no difference in my life. But there  are a lot of people who come to this Congress with three or four  children, and they have got to open a second residence, either rent or  buy here, and keep a residence at home, and they are struggling.   I know it doesn't sound like you are going to struggle at $174,000. I  don't blame people who are making $60,000, $80,000 who say: What do you  mean you are struggling?   But the fact of the matter is, all I ask is, keep us even. Don't give  us a raise. Just keep us even. As the cost of living goes up, just keep  us even in terms of our purchasing power.   I am going to vote for this bill, but I sure don't like that  provision. Now, we Democrats have put it in; the Republicans have put  it in. I get it. I get the politics of it.   But I will tell you, for a long period of time I worked with Trent  Lott, with Tom DeLay, with Roy Blunt, and with other Republican  leaders--I seem to be the one that has been here consistently working  on this--to make sure that at least 50 percent of us on each side voted  to give us a COLA, to keep us even, so that we did not expect people  who had their housing costs go up, their healthcare costs go up, their  educational costs for children go up, to be frozen.   It is tough on families. It is not tough on me, so I am not arguing  from a personal standpoint. Very frankly, I am just fine.   But I say this because I want the public to know that there is at  least someone who is saying: Look, the job is worth it. You may not  think we are worth it, but the job is worth at least keeping even.   But this is a good bill. I am going to vote for it. There are  provisions in other bills that I don't like, but I vote for them,  because on the whole, I think this is an excellent bill for this  institution and for the American people.   I urge everybody to vote ``yes.''
