 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the For the  People Act, which includes language from my legislation with Senator  Cory Booker, the Help Students Vote Act.   Young Americans vote at the lowest rates of any age group, and a key  factor in that are the challenges of voting on a new college campus far  away from home. My legislation has three provisions to address this  challenge.   First, it requires every college and university to email timely voter  registration information to all of its students.   Second, it requires every school to designate a campus vote  coordinator to answer students' questions about voting.   Third, it authorizes grants to colleges and universities that take  exemplary action to promote civic engagement.   I want to thank the many organizations supporting the legislation,  including Young Invincibles, and the Students Learn Students Vote  Coalition.   By helping students register and vote, we can ensure our government  better responds to the people it serves, while encouraging our next  generation of leaders.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this measure.
