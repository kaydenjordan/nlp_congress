 Madam Speaker, before I begin today, I would like  to express and begin my remarks by expressing solidarity with other  U.S. colonies, colonized people, indigenous communities, and  descendants of the enslaved.   Today represents a historic moment. While Puerto Rico is not the  United States' only colony, it is its oldest. Today, for the first time  in our Nation's history, the United States will acknowledge its role as  a colonizing force and Puerto Rico's status as an extended colony.   The Puerto Rico Status Act begins a process for Boricuas to decide  their own future.   In this bill, we have made historic and unprecedented gains. Never  before have terms for independence and free association been so clearly  defined, including ramifications for citizenship.   This bill excludes the current unsustainable colonial status. It  clarifies that U.S. birthright citizenship and transmission of  citizenship remain the same in any event of status selection.                                time  1200    It provides 10 years of compensatory finance in the event of free  association, and it also includes an agreement to international  election observers over the course of a plebiscite.   This bill has also achieved historic and unprecedented multiparty  agreement on the island, including representatives from the  Independence, Statehood, and Movimiento Victoria Parties. These gains  are critically important to codify in precedent here in this House.   I also want to acknowledge, rightfully, some of the criticisms of  what is not in this bill. It is not perfect. But we have fought  tirelessly to expand the transparency where previously there was less,  and there is still more to go. It does not address reparations. It does  not address the issues of Act 20, PROMESA, and LUMA, but I am confident  that in solidarity with movements on the island, we will solve these  issues and achieve those victories, as well.   I also want to note that decolonization is more than a vote. It  doesn't happen just with a vote. It is a social, political, cultural,  economic, and psychological process that extends far beyond the floor  of this House. That being said, the gains that are made here are a  watershed moment.   I thank, first and foremost, my incredible mentor, Representative  Nydia Velazquez, who has fought for the people of Puerto Rico for her  entire career and her entire life.   I thank our other colleagues: Chairman Grijalva for elevating this  issue, Leader Hoyer for making this a priority, as well as Resident  Commissioner Gonzalez-Colon.   I also thank grassroots advocacy organizations as well as our  partners in the Independence, Free Association, and Statehood Parties.  These gains are incredibly important, and they are a waypoint and a  stepping stone for the future of our island. I think it sends a very  strong message to all. For there to be any vote, prior to any vote, we  hope that the energy of people both in the diaspora and on the island  are here.   Lastly, but certainly not least, as we ring out a refrain that is  said among people across the world and Puerto Ricans across the world:  ``Yo si soy boricua, pa'que tu lo sepas,'' ``I am Puerto Rican, so you  know.''
