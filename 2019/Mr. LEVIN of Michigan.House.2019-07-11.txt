 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate my  constituent and Royal Oak city manager, Don Johnson, on his retirement  after 14 years with the great city of Royal Oak.   Don started as city manager right at the height of the Great  Recession. To hear him tell it, the city was flat broke. Royal Oak was  facing huge revenue shortfalls, and Michigan families were hurting.   In the years since, he has helped Royal Oak turn around and become  one of the most desirable places to live and visit. Royal Oak saw a  jump of $10 million in revenue in 10 years, truly an outstanding  accomplishment for the people of Royal Oak and a testament to Don's  hard work.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Don for his years of service and wish him the  very best in his next chapter.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Smith for giving  me these minutes to talk about two amendments that I have brought forth  that are part of this en bloc.   First is an amendment about PFAS, which we have heard a little bit  about already. It is important to understand that our military is  storing and planning to destroy millions of gallons of material that  contain PFAS, which is a class of chemicals that contaminate drinking  water and is linked to serious health problems.   These materials must be destroyed for the sake of the health of our  communities, but that needs to be done in a way that protects our  environment, not in a way that causes us yet more harm.   My amendment directs the Secretary of Defense to ensure that all  incineration of materials containing PFAS is conducted in a manner that  eliminates PFAS while also ensuring that no PFAS is emitted into the  air in the process. It also sets clear guardrails for storage,  byproducts, and appropriate facilities for disposal.   I thank Mr. Khanna for cosponsoring this measure so we can protect  our communities from further PFAS contamination.   The second amendment I wish to address will help us understand the  universe of defense contractors that have willfully violated Federal  health, safety, and labor standards that protect American workers.  American people work hard to build the infrastructure necessary to keep  our country safe. We have a responsibility to honor that work by paying  them fairly and keeping them safe, as the law requires.   We have a responsibility to make sure that contractors taking Federal  dollars are not recklessly neglecting the health, safety, and dignity  of our working people. That is why this simple amendment is so  necessary.   I thank Congresswoman Haaland for cosponsoring this amendment, and I  thank, again, Chairman Smith for all of his hard work.    Madam Chair, the amendment before us is about  our responsibility to protect the American people. It is about our  values.   Do we believe the President acting on his own should be able to put  our troops in harm's way and put us at risk of another horrific war  with zero input from the American people's elected representatives in  Congress? Or do we want to make clear that we are going to do our job,  the job our constituents elected us to do, follow the Constitution, and  prevent a reckless attack on Iran?   This isn't about being a Democrat or a Republican. As a Member of the  people's House, colleagues should support this amendment to prevent an  unauthorized attack on Iran and make it clear that this Congress has  not authorized the use of military force, in line with my bipartisan  AUMF Clarification Act.   Madam Chair, I thank Representative Khanna for yielding.
