 Mr. Speaker, today I stand before this body to remind  Congress of the following names:   Arielle Diamond Anderson, Brian Fraser, Alexandria Verner.   The lives of these three students were brutally taken from us this  month on the campus of Michigan State University. Arielle Anderson and  Brian Fraser were students at schools in my district.   Although this tragedy has personal significance for me today, it is a  sad truth that until our country recognizes the sickness of gun  violence, we will continue to have tragedies like this. These incidents  are all too common in this country. We as a Congress must ensure and  demand that these atrocities never happen again.   It is past due that we pass sensible gun laws that expand safe  storage regulations, reform red flag laws, and improve access to mental  health care.   Mr. Speaker, we can't keep living like this. We must act now.                            ____________________
