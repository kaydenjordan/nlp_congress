 Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of  World Refugee Day.   We are facing the worst refugee crisis in history, with over 65  million refugees; half of them are children.   When I served on Active Duty in the U.S. Air Force, I participated in  Operation Pacific Haven. The U.S. military went into northern Iraq. We  extracted thousands of Kurdish refugees, brought them to Andersen Air  Force Base in Guam, and then sent most of them to the United States. We  saved their lives, and, to this day, the Kurds remain one of America's  strongest allies.   Helping refugees is not only the moral thing to do; it helps our  national security. That is why I am honored to introduce bipartisan  legislation with Representative Ros-Lehtinen to promote the health,  safety, and well-being of refugees.                            ____________________
