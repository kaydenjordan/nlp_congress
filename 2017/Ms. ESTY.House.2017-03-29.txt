 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the so- called HONEST Act. Whether in its incarnation last Congress as the  Secret Science Act or in this year's incarnation as the HONEST Act, let  us be clear, this Orwellian-named bill is clearly designed to suppress  certain scientific research that has been the foundation for essential  health and environmental regulations.   In addition to hindering scientific advancement, this bill risks  violating people's privacy by exposing sensitive patient data, and it  is harmful to public health.   The clear aim of the HONEST Act is to undermine EPA's efforts to take  action in a variety of areas, such as climate and air pollution.   Let me also be clear, in my State of Connecticut, we rely on those  regulations to deal with the asthma crisis we have based on power  plants in other parts of the country blowing polluted air into my  State.   The so-called HONEST Act accomplishes this objective by excluding  legitimate, peer-reviewed research from the policy process. If this  bill were to become law, EPA would have no choice but to lean  increasingly on industry-funded studies instead.   At my recent townhall meeting in Waterbury, Connecticut, one American  after another stood up and expressed their fear and outrage at the  attempts made in this House and by the new administration to take  science out of public policy.   My constituents want genuine scientific research guiding our efforts  to protect our environment and safeguard public health. They don't want  agenda-driven studies funded by fossil fuel companies determining the  EPA's actions on climate policy.                                time  1415    While the majority attempted to alleviate some of our privacy  concerns with this bill, the reality is that any person whom EPA  Administrator Scott Pruitt deems worthy will have access to sensitive  patient information.   Why is this a problem?   Because fewer people will be willing to participate in the studies  that are necessary to understand air and water quality issues.   Who can blame them?   No one wants their medical records shared with strangers, or worse,  made public.   The result is that the EPA will have to rely on incomplete science to  issue lifesaving regulations.   Sadly, Mr. Speaker, this bill is yet another example of the political  crusade against science that we are seeing coming from both Congress  and the new administration.   We should be confronting the economic and environmental realities of  our changing climate. But just yesterday, President Trump issued an  executive order that would have us pretend that climate change does not  exist.   Only weeks earlier, the EPA Administrator himself said, without  evidence, that he disagreed with the scientific consensus that human  activity is the primary contributor to global climate change.   In my home State of Connecticut, we are downwind from these power  plants that are burning dirty coal. We see elevated rates of asthma,  higher rates of cardiopulmonary issues. If this bill is passed, many  longitudinal, scientific studies like the ones that establish the link  between air pollution and asthma, would be excluded from playing a role  in the EPA's actions.   Mr. Speaker, let's allow the EPA to do its job. I urge my colleagues  to oppose this misguided bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two letters in opposition from  the Union of Concerned Scientists and from the Environmental Defense  Fund.                                  Union of Concerned Scientists,                                                      March 9, 2017.        Dear Representative: The Union of Concerned Scientists,       with 500,000 members and supporters throughout the country,       strongly opposes H.R. 1430, the misleadingly named Honest and       Open New EPA Science Treatment Act (HONEST Act) of 2017. The       proposal shows that supporters of this legislation have a       fundamental misunderstanding of the process by which science       operates and is ultimately a solution in search of a problem.        This legislation would require that all raw data, models,       code, and other materials from scientific studies be made       available to the public before a federal agency could use it.       But, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) already is       exhaustingly transparent and the science it relies on to make       decisions is made available to the public.        The true intention of this bill is not to increase       transparency in agency use of science in policymaking, but       rather to handcuff the EPA from ever using critical       information necessary to follow through on statutorily       required rulemaking for popular legislation like the Clean       Air Act and the Clean Water Act. The additional restrictions       imposed by this proposed bill would make it almost impossible       to base public protections on the best available scientific       information. In particular, if enacted, the language appears       to indicate that the EPA would be inhibited by the following       challenges:        The EPA wouldn't be able to use most health studies. It       should be expected that any agency tasked with protecting       public health should be able to use public health data. The       confidentiality of such data is usually protected by       institutional review boards  [[Page H2541]]       (IRB) to insure the privacy of the participants; thus, the       data could not be made publicly available as demanded. Since       many EPA rules are health-based standards, this rule would       severely restrict the ability of the agency to base rules on       science.        The EPA wouldn't be able to draw from industry data       sources. The agency would be prevented from using data       provided by industry to the agency. Since information from       industry sources is often not publicly available, to protect       proprietary data from their competitors, a law requiring as       such would prevent the agency from utilizing industry data, a       source of information that often provides otherwise unknown       data to inform EPA rulemaking.        The EPA wouldn't be able to use new and innovative science.       New scientific methods and data may be restricted by       intellectual property protections or industry trade secret       exemptions. This bill doesn't include protections for       intellectual property, and it makes industry trade secrets       available upon request to anyone who signs an agreement. If       researchers and industry knew that sharing their science with       the EPA meant that their intellectual property would be       exposed to the world, they might opt out. This would limit       EPA's ability to rely on the best available science including       novel approaches that may not yet be publicly available.        Long-term and meta-analyses would be unavailable. Many of       the public health and safety issues facing the nation cannot       be measured within a small timeframe. The EPA needs long-term       exposure studies that assess the link between chronic       diseases/mortality and pollutants; or on meta-analyses that       include many different studies and locations to provide a       more robust look at the science. In H.R. 1430, the provision       that studies be conducted ``in a manner that is sufficient       for independent analysis and substantial reproduction of       research'' may prevent use of these vital studies by the EPA,       as it is unclear whether such spatially and temporally       comprehensive studies would be considered ``sufficient for       substantial reproduction.''        The CBO estimates exorbitant costs. The attempt to       implement this law would also make the EPA process much more       costly. For past iterations of this legislation, the CBO has       estimated it may take up to $250 million annually for the EPA       simply to comply, and that doesn't even account for the lost       benefits from delaying the protections themselves. Compounded       with the cuts to EPA's budget that are being proposed, this       would just further prevent the agency from being able to do       its job.        H.R. 1430 makes a token attempt to address some of the       criticisms about privacy concerns for personal medical       information and trade secrets. But in practice, the challenge       of identifying and redacting all protected and privileged       information sets up a series of hurdles and complications       that will deter agencies from using the best scientific       analysis to inform their work.        Small, cosmetic tweaks do not change the fact that this       bill is based on a flawed premise and that the authors of the       legislation do not understand the scientific process.       Furthermore, the burden imposed on the EPA to redact       documents would ultimately place limits on the amount of       actual scientific work the EPA can do. The EPA does not exist       in a world of infinite resources.        When this bill was introduced in the 114th Congress as the       ``Secret Science Reform Act,'' it received a veto threat from       the Obama administration, which noted that it would       ``interfere'' with the EPA's ability to protect public       health, safety, and the environment. The worry is that now,       with an administration that has shown zero interest in using       science to enact safeguards, this legislation could cripple       the agency.        I strongly urge you to oppose H R. 1430, the so-called       HONEST Act. The only honest thing about this legislation is       that it truly opens the window into the real intentions of       the supporters of the bill, and that is to stop the EPA from       fulfilling its science-based mission to protect public health       and the environment. H.R. 1430 is a wolf in sheep's clothing,       purporting to increase public accessibility to data used in       rulemaking, while actually crippling the EPA's ability to use       the best available scientific and technical information to       protect public health and the environment.        Agencies protecting our public health should be able to use       public health data and attempts to undermine agencies       shouldn't be cloaked in false transparency. This Trojan-horse       transparency bill would inhibit the EPA's ability to carry       out its science-based mission to protect human health and the       environment. It does not deserve your support.            Sincerely,      Andrew A. Rosenberg, Ph.D.,        Director, Center for Science and Democracy, Union of       Concerned Scientists.                                   ____                                                       EDF Action,                                                      March 8, 2017.      Hon. Lamar Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Ranking Member, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson: The       Environmental Defense Action Fund strongly opposes the       ``Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment (HONEST) Act of       2017'' and the ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of       2017''.        Despite their benign-sounding titles, these bills would       have devastating effects on public health and the       Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ability to consider       and use sound science.        The HONEST Act, a rebranded version of the ``Secret Science       Reform Act'' from prior sessions of Congress, is framed as a       measure to increase transparency by requiring that EPA only       use studies that are publicly available online and       replicable. Yet, as testimony before your Committee has made       clear, these requirements would in many cases prevent the EPA       from using the best available science for public health       decision-making.        Many epidemiological studies--for example a study on the       causes of breast cancer--rely on health data that are legally       confidential. This legislation suggests that EPA will be       given the authority to disclose confidential medical       information on breast cancer patients to anyone willing to       sign a confidentiality agreement. EPA would also be       responsible for identifying and redacting any information       that should not be made broadly publicly available in the       first place. Not only is this not an appropriate role for       EPA, it could severely restrict both the number of studies       EPA can use and the willingness of participants to be part of       vital health studies.        In addition, the Act's requirements for replicability mean       that critical longitudinal studies that follow health       outcomes of individuals or groups over years, even decades,       could not be used because--        (1) they are inherently not replicable (e.g., a study that       follows health outcomes of first responders following a       single event such as the tragic 9/11 attack); or        (2) where they are replicable, it would take years to show       that the results could be reproduced (e.g., a study that       examines the impacts on intelligence at childhood from       environmental exposures that occurred in utero).        Furthermore, even if, say, a longitudinal study that       follows a cohort of individuals over 20 years could in       principle be reproduced, there are practical and ethical       reasons why it couldn't or shouldn't be. The same goes for a       long-term environmental monitoring study, or data collected       from a one-time event like the Deepwater Horizon Spill.        The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has found that       previous iterations of this legislation would impede the       number of studies the EPA can rely on--by their estimate,       reducing the number of studies by half. Restricting EPA to       just some of the existing scientific literature will prevent       the agency from using the latest and most accurate science       when developing regulations. Moreover, the tremendous       resource burden of making data publicly available (CBO's       central estimate was $250 million a year) would create a       strong incentive to reduce the amount of scientific data and       analysis considered as part of decision-making. The net       effect would be to undermine EPA's ability to rely on the       best available science and unnecessarily put the public at       greater environmental and health risk.        Similarly, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of       2017 undermines scientific integrity of the EPA. Contrary to       longstanding practice, the bill allows individuals with       financial conflicts of interest to serve on the EPA Science       Advisory Board (SAB) so long as those conflicts are       disclosed. This would permit an infusion of special corporate       interest into what should remain an objective scientific       review of EPA work products.        Incredibly, at the same time, the bill makes it more       difficult for academic experts to participate on the SAB. The       bill considers an expert's research on a topic covered by the       Board to be a conflict of interest, when in fact the       academic's expertise would make them more, not less,       valuable. In addition, receipt of EPA research grants and       contracts, standard for universities, would be construed to       constitute a conflict of interest for a scientist or expert.       And a SAB member would be precluded from accepting any such       grant or contract for three years after serving on the board       which may deter qualified experts from serving on the SAB.        The ``Honest and Open New EPA Science Treatment (HONEST)       Act of 2017'' and the ``EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act       of 2017'' would block the use of sound science by EPA in       developing public safeguards. For these reasons, EDF Action       strongly opposes these bills.            Sincerely,                                          Elizabeth B. Thompson,                                    President, Environmental Defense                                                       Action Fund.
