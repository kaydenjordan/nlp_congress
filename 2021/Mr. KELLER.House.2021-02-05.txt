 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition of H.R. 447, the  National Apprenticeship Act of 2021.   Let's be very clear: Apprenticeship programs are a tremendous benefit  to our economy. They provide a diverse range of opportunities for  emerging workers to hone and develop skill sets while providing  competitive salaries that strengthen our economy.   I agree with my colleagues that our existing apprenticeship system is  severely outdated and it must be restructured to reflect the needs and  challenges of the current economy and the modern workforce. However,  H.R. 447 completely fails to address and expand work-based learning  programs.   Current regulations permit a special carve-out for union-sponsored  apprenticeships to ignore the mandatory ratio of apprentices to  supervisors intended to keep workers safe. This preferential treatment,  by definition, creates an uneven playing field and jeopardizes worker  safety.   I offered an amendment to this legislation that would have closed  this loophole, leveled the playing field, and ensured the safety of all  apprentices on the job. However, the majority voted to  [[Page H412]]  reject this effort to hold all apprenticeship programs to the same  standards of safety regardless of which entity sponsors the program.   Given the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our economy, now more  than ever we need an apprenticeship system that provides and protects  workers and gives them the tools and opportunities for success. The  bottom line is that this law must be updated so employees can  participate in a system that is reflective of their needs and the needs  of their workers, something this legislation in its current form fails  to do entirely.   Voting for H.R. 447 in its current form would mean doubling down on  the outdated policies and bureaucratic red tape that too often prevents  innovative and necessary improvements from taking place.   This bill should be rejected.
