 Madam Speaker, now we have a Democratic Presidential  candidate who seems to think that some things named to honor Thomas  Jefferson should be renamed, going as far as to say, ``It's the right  thing to do.'' Well, maybe he should go back to school and learn about  the stunning impact our Founding Fathers had not only on American  history but the history of the world.   To use 21st-century sensibilities to help frame the future may be a  good thing, but to use those same sensibilities to judge the past or,  worse, to erase parts of our history is simply stupid.   If we measure historical figures and places against a model of  perfection, nobody and no nation will ever meet it. We must celebrate  the achievements of the past and learn from its mistakes without  erasing or rewriting the parts that make 21st-century Americans  uncomfortable.   The story of America is the story of progress, of advancement, of  always getting better. We should embrace that history in its totality.                            ____________________
