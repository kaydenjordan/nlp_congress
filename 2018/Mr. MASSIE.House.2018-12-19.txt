 Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I request the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, point of order.    When a quorum is not present, under the rule, the yeas  and nays are automatic. Will there be a vote of the yeas and nays?    Mr. Speaker, point of order.    Mr. Speaker, when a quorum is not present and that is  noted by a Member, under the rules, the yeas and nays are automatic. Is  that correct?    All right. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.
