 Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and  honor the city of McKenzie, Tennessee's sesquicentennial anniversary.   McKenzie has come a long way since her first settlers followed the  Natchez Trace to the tall grasses and fertile soil of western  Tennessee's ``Barren Lands.'' What started as a cluster of fiercely  competitive trading posts flourished into a bustling center of commerce  with the arrival of the area's first railroads. The city withstood  family rivalry, natural disasters, and the ravages of the Civil War,  until it was finally incorporated by the State of Tennessee on January  22, 1869.   Today, the roads are paved, and cattle no longer roam the city  square, but McKenzie's residents still live and work with the same  inimitable volunteer spirit as those who fought for their homes and  livelihoods through two great fires, a yellow fever epidemic, and the  Great Depression.   Congratulations to the Honorable Jill Holland, Mayor of McKenzie, the  members of the McKenzie City Council, and most importantly, the people  of McKenzie. I ask my colleagues to join with me in wishing them 150  more years of progress and prosperity.                            ____________________
