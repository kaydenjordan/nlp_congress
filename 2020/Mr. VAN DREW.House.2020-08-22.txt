 Mr. Speaker, I recognize this year's graduating class  of firefighters in Salem County, south Jersey.   I was honored to attend and see this class in action at the Fire  Academy FF1 recruit graduation earlier this month. They are not just a  team; they are a family.   This special class was hardened and unified in the midst of a  nationwide coronavirus. I am so proud to be able to represent these men  and women in Congress and to recognize them for their feat.   They represent the resolve and the commitment that makes this great  Nation even greater. Your Nation is proud of you. Your community is  proud of you. We are all proud of you and the selfless work that you  are all beginning. God bless you all. And God bless these United States  of America.                            ____________________
