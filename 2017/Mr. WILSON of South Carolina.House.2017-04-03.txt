 Mr. Speaker, last night, the Gamecocks  women's basketball team made history, winning the NCAA National  Championship for the first time in school history. Defeating  Mississippi State 67-55, the Gamecocks dominated the all-SEC game,  leading the Bulldogs in scoring and in rebounds.   Early in the season, the Gamecocks set their sights on the  championship, themeing the season as 100, with the ``1'' reflecting  their commitment to one goal, one team, one dream, one family, and one  focus. They never gave up their goals, and their dedication clearly  paid off.   I join all of Gamecock Nation in celebrating this remarkable victory.   We are also grateful for the Gamecock men, who, in the Final Four,  were ahead of number one Gonzaga in the last 3 minutes until the  disturbing Zags pulled ahead.   Special congratulations to superstar A'ja Wilson of Heathwood Hall  and Hopkins, South Carolina, who had a great game, scoring a team high  22 points, and who was also named most outstanding player in the Final  Four.   Congratulations as well to Head Coach Dawn Staley, President Harris  Pastides, and USC First Lady Patricia Pastides.   The Gamecocks women's basketball team joins Clemson's football team  and Coastal Carolina's baseball team as the third college national  championship from South Carolina in just 1 year. Go Gamecocks.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Welcome, Timmerman School of Forest Acres, South Carolina, to the  Capitol.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I was grateful to visit  North Korea on a congressional delegation in 2003 with House Foreign  Affairs Ranking Member Eliot Engel on a delegation led by Congressman  Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania. While there, we witnessed a regime  obsessed with a Potemkin-like appearance and preservation to the  detriment of its own citizens who have been reduced to destitution and  starvation.                                time  1715    After seeing the devastation of the people at the hands of the  totalitarian regime, I have been even more invested in the need to hold  the regime in Pyongyang accountable for threatening neighbors.   In early February, I introduced this bipartisan resolution in  response to North Korea's threat to test an intercontinental ballistic.  Their threat is concerning because an ICBM has the capability of  reaching the West Coast of the United States.   The rapid pace of North Korea's growing offensive nuclear weapons  development is alarming to the United States and our allies. In just a  few short months, North Korea has appeared to successfully test an  ICBM; launched a satellite; tested four simultaneous ballistic  missiles, three of which landed in Japanese territorial waters; had a  failed missile launch; and tested a ballistic missile engine. The  regime also claims to be planning another nuclear test for later this  month.   Sadly revealing, the regime in North Korea recently released a  propaganda video depicting a missile striking a U.S. aircraft carrier  and calling for the destruction of the American people.   North Korea is rapidly advancing their capabilities, working to  miniaturize nuclear technology to deliver a nuclear weapon anywhere in  the world. Sadly, 8 years of strategic patience only enabled the  dictatorship. We cannot afford to stand by as this regime grows in  power and influence, threatening the United States and our allies.   I am grateful that President Donald Trump is taking the regime and  its threats seriously. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Secretary of  State Rex Tillerson recently visited our allies in South Korea and  Japan; and the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, has  led the efforts for strengthening international sanctions against North  Korea.   The administration has also demonstrated peace through strength by  backing up their commitments to our allies with action. We have begun  deploying the THAAD missile defense system, recently resumed the annual  military training exercises with South Korea, and deployed attack  drones to support our servicemembers stationed in the region. This  defends the extraordinary people of South Korea, who have developed one  of the most prosperous nations on Earth.   As we work to check the growing influence and missile capability of  North Korea, Congress, too, has a vital role, starting with passage of  H. Res. 92 to forcefully condemn North Korea for these actions and call  for the consideration of all available sanctions on the regime and the  individuals or businesses who sustain it. We are clear: the United  States must stand strong against North Korea for American families and  our South Korean allies.   I appreciate the consideration of H. Res. 92, with 120 bipartisan  cosponsors. I know that America is fortunate to have the leadership of  House Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce, serving in a bipartisan manner  with Ranking Member Eliot Engel.   I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the resolution.
