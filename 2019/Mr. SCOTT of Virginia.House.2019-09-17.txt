 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman  from North Carolina (Ms. Adams) and the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Walker) for their continued leadership of this bill, specifically,  and with the HBCU Caucus, generally.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation to preserve  funding for historically Black colleges and universities and other  minority-serving institutions. These institutions play a critical role  in expanding access to higher education for low-income students and  students of color.   Collectively, they educate more than one-quarter of all graduates,  nearly 6 million students, including many in our Nation's underserved  the communities. Typically, these under-resourced schools educate  first-time college attendees, many of whom hail from impoverished  communities.   The funding that supports minority-serving institutions is the only  program authorized in the Higher Education Act that expires if not  reauthorized this year. Accordingly, if Congress fails to pass this  bill by September 30, these historic institutions will suffer a $255  million shortfall, causing lost jobs, lost opportunities, and  diminished financial support for students across the country.   Members of this body often speak glowingly about the role of HBCUs  and other minority-serving institutions. And today, we have an  opportunity to back those words with action. The FUTURE Act, which is  fully paid for, preserves vital investments in minority-serving  institutions, as well as the students and communities they serve.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this  legislation.
