 Mr. Speaker, last week, I introduced  the Cybersecurity Skills Integration Act with Congresswoman and co- chair of the Career and Technical Education Caucus, Suzanne Bonamici.   In high-risk critical infrastructure sectors, like  telecommunications, agriculture, or healthcare, a workforce with basic  cyber skills is essential to our public safety. Unfortunately, many  skilled workers lack any cybersecurity training specific to the systems  they work on daily.   Our society is increasingly reliant on cyber technologies for our  most critical infrastructure. As bad actors increase cyberattacks, we  must ensure we are protecting our most sensitive data. This legislation  empowers the next generation of learners to have the most sophisticated  and comprehensive education to better protect our essential systems and  assets for years to come.   The bipartisan Cybersecurity Skills Integration Act would fund the  development of critical infrastructure CTE programs that integrate  cybersecurity. This is a bipartisan issue that both the Trump and Biden  administrations have placed increased focus on.    This legislation would align CTE programs with industry needs by  giving businesses a seat at the table with postsecondary institutions  crafting programs that ensure students are learning relevant skills,  including cybersecurity competencies.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it.                            ____________________
