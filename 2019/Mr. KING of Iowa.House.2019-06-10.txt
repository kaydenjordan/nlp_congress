 Madam Speaker, I regrettably missed the vote series  on June 10th, 2019, due to previously planned travel that prevented me  from being in Washington. Had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 242, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 243, and ``yea''  on rollcall No. 244.                            ____________________
