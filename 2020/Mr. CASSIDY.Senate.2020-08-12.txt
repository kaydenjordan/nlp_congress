 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak to a very important  piece of legislation, which quietly passed this Chamber last week. It  included several provisions I authored and offered based upon my  experience as a physician that specifically provides mental health  support to America's veterans.   We all agree, we owe the men and women who fought and fight for this  country a tremendous debt of gratitude for the sacrifices they made to  preserve our freedom. It is dangerous, and our servicemembers answer  the call. Many carry scars from injuries sustained during that service.   But there are scars that we cannot see. Service can take a physical  toll but also a mental one. Too many veterans struggle with mental  health issues and suicidal thoughts. About 17 veterans per day from all  of our wars put together take their own lives. For comparison, 22  servicemembers were killed in combat in Afghanistan throughout all of  2019. We are losing thousands more veterans at home than we are losing  fighting men and women in the field. That is something to ponder.   We must do a better job of leading the mental health needs of  veterans. Thankfully, this Chamber took a big step forward last week  when we passed the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health  Care Improvement Act.   The bill improves outreach to veterans and offers new mental  healthcare options in five major ways: First, the bill bolsters the  VA's mental health workforce to serve more veterans. It gives the VA  direct hiring authority for mental health professionals. The VA can  offer scholarships to mental health professionals to work at vet  centers, and it provides for at least one suicide prevention  coordinator at every Veterans' Administration Hospital.   It improves rural veterans' access to mental healthcare by increasing  the number of locations where veterans can access VA telehealth  services. It also offers grants to non-VA organizations that provide  mental health services or alternative treatments to veterans.   The bill strengthens support and assistance for servicemembers  transitioning out of the military by automatically giving every  servicemember a full year of VA healthcare when they leave the  military.   By the way, this came to my mind: It turns out that most suicides  occur within 6 weeks of one of our soldiers or sailors or marines  leaving the service; within 6 months of that departure is when they  tend to commit suicide. But it is about 6 months before they first  access VA services. We have to have this kind of transition point  tightened and one that makes sure they all know they have VA benefits  for that first year.   The Veterans Mental Healthcare Improvement Act also studies and  invests in innovative and alternative science-based treatment options.  It invests in research on the impact of living at high altitudes, on  veterans' suicide risk, and on identifying and treating other risk  factors for mental health illness.   It holds the VA accountable for its mental healthcare and suicide  prevention efforts. It does this by examining  [[Page S5398]]  how the VA manages suicide prevention resources and how the VA provides  care and information sharing for veterans seeking mental healthcare  from both VA and community providers.   This bill takes a strong, evidence-based approach to meeting  veterans' needs that haven't always been given priority. It is  encouraging to me that is bipartisan. At a time when we don't appear to  agree on very much, we are able to deliver for our heroes.   I am proud to have worked with my Democratic colleagues to write  bills that were included in this package. Senator Tester and I  partnered on the Promoting Coordination for Veteran Suicide Prevention  Act. This bill, this amendment, ensures that a thorough review of  veterans who die by suicide within 1 year of separation from the Armed  Services is conducted jointly by both the Department of Defense and by  the VA.   As I mentioned, most suicides occur within 6 months of separating  from service. If that is the case, then the Department of Defense can  do a review of what are those risk factors and have a warm handoff to  the Veterans' Administration Hospital. And because we made automatic  that first year of service within the VA, that warm handoff can be  taken without any impediments of is there coverage or is there not.   There is also going to be a partnership between the mental health and  suicide prevention experts in both the VA and DOD that will contribute  to improved information sharing and help further close the gap in  ensuring high-quality, seamless care between these two Departments,  focusing on the serviceperson who has now become a veteran.   Senator Tester and I also worked together on the VA Research Approval  Efficiency Act. This provision authorizes the Veterans Administration  to leverage accredited commercial institutional review boards for use  in connection with VA-sponsored clinical research. Getting the VA  commercial options for approving clinical trials will add much-needed  efficiencies and begin to reduce the disparity with academic and other  institutions that, today, lead in clinical trial administration.   If we know that our treatments for those with mental illness often  need to be improved, we want to give our veterans access to those  improved treatments as soon as possible, but we also want to make sure  that those treatments suit the needs of the veteran. You can only do  this by encouraging that research activity with full consent of the  veteran--full consent--by which she or he may participate in these  trials for her benefit, his benefit, but also for the benefit of us  all. This reform enables the VA to increase the caliber care it  delivers to veterans in a variety of clinical areas.   Senator Sinema and I introduced the Improving Mental Health Care for  Veterans Act. This provision requires VA and DOD to establish a joint  clinical practice guideline for treatment of serious mental illness.  This commonsense approach builds on an already robust library of  clinical practice guidelines that serve to standardize and reinforce  treatment procedures in other areas.   Just as a point, if someone is found to be well-controlled in a  certain medical regimen but then they transition to another different  care with a different formulary, then all the hard work to find just  the right clinical pharmaceutical treatment program to keep the person  balanced now has to be changed because the second department has a  different formulary--a different set of drugs with which they wish to  treat--all the good work done here is lost there.   We wish to eliminate that possibility by making sure there is a  common set of clinical guidelines so that somebody with stress is  passed off and it is seamless, both in terms of the clinical care, but  also the medicines which they may take.   The passage of the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health  Care Improvement Act is the culmination of a lot of hard work from both  Democratic and Republican Senators. It now goes to the House for  consideration. I urge the House to swiftly pass this legislation so  that President Trump can sign it into law.   This bill will have a direct, positive impact in the care the VA  delivers to American veterans. They answered the call to serve our  Nation; now, Congress must answer the call to better serve them.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I rise in recognition of seersucker  manufacturers and enthusiasts across the United States. I wish everyone  a Happy National Seersucker Day. This uniquely American fashion has a  storied history dating back to 1909. The first seersucker suit was  designed by Joseph Haspel at his Broad Street facility in New Orleans,  LA. Louisiana is proud to have played an important part in introducing  the country to seersucker apparel.   This lightweight cotton fabric, known for its signature pucker, has  been worn and enjoyed by Americans across the country during the hot  summer months. Mr. Haspel said it best: ``Hot is hot, no matter what  you do for a living.''   In the 1990s, Seersucker Day was established by Members of this  Chamber to honor this unique American fashion. I proudly resumed this  tradition in 2014 in the U.S. House of Representatives and continued  this tradition in the U.S. Senate. This year, I wish to designate June  13 as the seventh annual National Seersucker Day. I encourage everyone  to wear seersucker on this day to commemorate this traditionally  American clothing.                            ____________________
