 First, I would ask consent that I be able to complete my  brief remarks before the vote starts.    Mr. President, I rise today in support of the  confirmation of Baltimore City Circuit Court Judge Julie Rubin to be a  U.S. district judge for the District of Maryland. I recommended Judge  Rubin, along with Senator Van Hollen, to President Biden, and we  strongly support her nomination.   Judge Rubin has been nominated to fill the vacancy created when Judge  Ellen Hollander, appointed by President Obama in 2011, announced her  intentions to take senior status.   President Biden nominated Judge Rubin for this position on December 3  of last year, and the Judiciary Committee held her confirmation hearing  on December 15. Judge Rubin was favorably reported by the Judiciary  Committee on January 20 of this year by a bipartisan vote.   She received a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating from the American  Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, which is  the organization's highest rating. The ABA assesses the nominee's  professional competency, integrity, and judicial temperament.   Shortly after the November 2020 Presidential elections, I worked with  Senator Van Hollen to establish the judicial selection committee in  Maryland. We used an open application process with public advertisement  and communicated closely with State, local, and specialty bar  associations in Maryland. In particular, we sought out highly qualified  and diverse applicants. Our committee interviewed everyone who  submitted an application, which involved several dozen interviews.  Senator Van Hollen and I personally interviewed several finalists  before recommending names to the White House.   Born in Baltimore, Judge Rubin received her B.A. cum laude from Mount  Holyoke College in 1995 and her J.D. from the University of Maryland  School of Law in 1998.   She worked at Astrachan Gunst, handling intellectual property and  employment law matters in both Federal and State court.   Judge Rubin was appointed by the Governor of Maryland in 2012 as a  Baltimore City circuit judge and was elected in 2014 by the people of  Baltimore to a 15-year term.   The circuit court is the State trial court of general jurisdiction in  Maryland, covering both civil and criminal cases, and is the exclusive  court for jury trials, including felony trials--similar jurisdiction to  what the Federal district court handles. So she has that experience.   Judge Rubin brings tremendous experience to the courtroom as a  sitting Baltimore City circuit judge for nearly a decade. She has  handled a substantial and diverse caseload in our State court in  Baltimore, having served in the civil, family, criminal, and general  trial divisions, as well as serving on special assignments to the  asbestos docket. She previously served as a supervisory judge of  alternative dispute resolutions. She estimates that she has presided  over about 1,000 criminal and civil cases that have gone to verdict or  judgment, including both bench and jury trials.   Judge Rubin is known as a judge's judge, in terms of her excellent  temperament, work ethic, and congeniality with lawyers and litigants.  She is known to be fair in judgment to all litigants. She was selected  to serve as a faculty member of the Judicial College and tasked with  instructing newly appointed Maryland trial judges on judicial ethics  and best courtroom practices.   Judge Rubin has continued to give back to the community as an adjunct  legal professor at the Maryland Law School. She cochaired the Bench Bar  Committee of the Bar Association of Baltimore City, served on the board  of the Baltimore Metropolitan Chapter of the Simon E. Sobeloff Law  Society, and assisted the CollegeBound Foundation and the Baltimore  Education Scholarship Trust to help underprivileged or at-risk youth.  She has served as chair of the board of trustees for the Bryn Mawr  School in Baltimore. She has given back to our community and  understands the challenges in our community.   As a fellow graduate of the University of Maryland Francis King Carey  Law School, I am confident that Judge Rubin will meet the highest  standards of integrity, competence, and temperament. I know she will  uphold the rule of law for all Marylanders for this lifetime  appointment.   Finally, let me say that I know that public service is a sacrifice,  not only for the nominee but for their family. So I want to thank Judge  Rubin's husband James and her entire family for sharing Judge Rubin  with the people of Maryland.   Judge Rubin's confirmation will build on the quality and diversity of  the Maryland District Court bench. All 10 of the confirmed judges have  been recommended by me to the President for appointment as a Senator  from Maryland. I am proud of their qualifications and diversity.   In Maryland, our Federal bench is 50 percent women, 50 percent men,  40 percent people of color. We appointed the first African-American  woman, the first person of Palestinian descent. We have a diversified,  quality bench representing the people of Maryland and providing the  justice the people of Maryland deserve.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the confirmation of Judge  Julie Rubin to be a U.S. district judge for the District of Maryland.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
