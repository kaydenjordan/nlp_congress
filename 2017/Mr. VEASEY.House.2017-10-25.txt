 Mr. Speaker, middle class Americans are sick and tired;  sick and tired of footing the bill so that rich-folk millionaires and  billionaires can get another tax break.   The Republicans' proposed tax reform plan is nothing but a tax cut  for rich folks. It translates to increasing taxes for the poor and  middle class families in our country. That means that families already  struggling to make ends meet will have a tougher time making that car  note, that mortgage, and gaining nothing in return.   As a country, the GOP billionaire tax cut plan steals hundreds of  billions of dollars from the U.S. Treasury. That means that we can't  make crucial investments in infrastructure, job training, or research  and development that would help give people a good-paying job.   Reducing our tax base also translates into cuts to popular programs  like Medicare. You know how much everybody likes that.   The American people want tax reform, but not a plan that would  literally jeopardize families' livelihoods. We must put middle class  families first in this country, and the GOP tax plan fails to do that.  We can and must do better for the American people.                            ____________________
