 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the legislation before us today makes  nonprofit organizations eligible for Federal Government vouchers to  house people in recovery for drug addiction. My amendment simply makes  Tribal housing authorities also eligible to apply and receive the  vouchers.   I, like the gentlewoman from California, am concerned that this bill,  without additional funding, however well-intended, really robs Peter to  pay Paul, and it would cannibalize our local housing authorities of  funds and prioritize seeking housing solutions for those individuals  with addiction problems over other individuals who are victims of  domestic violence, who are low-income families who have been waiting in  line and need a subsidy in order to make ends meet, and other homeless  populations.   Again, I think this is a laudable goal, but I am concerned about this  bill not having any appropriations connected to it.   But, Mr. Chairman, if we, in fact, are going to take this approach, I  am sure we can all agree that Tribal housing authorities should also be  eligible. Indian Country has been devastated by drug addiction, and  Tribes from across the Nation have struggled to keep pace with treating  their addicted population and all the tertiary problems associated with  addiction, including housing problems.   The reality is that nonprofits are not really operating in Indian  Country now, and the unique geographic and cultural challenges make it  very unlikely that any nonprofit will actually be able to serve Indian  Country even if the program is successful in other areas.   Indian Tribes are making do. There are some success stories, like the  Potawatomi in Milwaukee, but the need is so overwhelming. So as we  provide aid to our States, I strongly believe that our sacred trust  obligations to Indian Country make it necessary for us to include our  Tribes in this legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have absolutely no doubt at all about the  gentleman's commitment and his sincerity to solve the problem of  housing challenges for those who are addicted.   I would just note that my own experience in my community is similar  to the gentlewoman from California. We have seen people be on the  waiting list for 10 years to get in housing. If we appear to be  skeptical about there being enough housing resources, it is only  because of that experience where we have seen people on the wait list  for 10 years.   Mr. Chairman, again, I thank the gentleman for his consideration, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as you mentioned, the Poor People's Campaign  was a national call for a moral revival.   What we are doing here now: We are reengaging the Poor People's  Campaign for the nonviolent economic reform movement that the Reverend  Dr. Martin Luther King was organizing when he was assassinated in 1968.   This resurgence is being called the most extensive wave of nonviolent  direct action in our Nation's history. What this resurgence recognizes  is that Dr. King was right, that the trifecta of racism, poverty, and  militarism are interconnected. Today they are trapping more than 140  million Americans in poverty and low wealth, and many of them are  children and veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to talk to you about one of Dr. King's  triple evils, militarism. I want to talk about it because we have a  total volunteer Army now. We don't have the draft. So the young people  who are being recruited into our military today are young people, often  from low-income households, who are seeking an opportunity, and they  are being seduced into the military with promises of technical  training, bonuses, and college.   I would like to share with you a letter from one of those people, Mr.  Brock McIntosh of Illinois. He says:         This way of injecting the poisonous drugs of hate into       veins of people, normally humane, cannot be reconciled with       wisdom, justice, and love.        I would like to tell you all about the precise moment I       realized that there was poison in me. I am the child of a       nurse and a factory worker in the heartland of Illinois, the       family of blue collar and service workers.        At the height of the Iraq war, military recruiters at my       high school attracted me with signup bonuses and college       assistance that some saw as their ticket out. For me, I hoped       it was my ticket up, providing opportunities that I once felt       were out of reach.        Two years later, when I was 20 years old, I was standing       over the body of a 16-year-old Afghan boy. A roadside bomb he       was building prematurely detonated. He was covered in       shrapnel and burns and now lay sedated after having one of       his hands amputated by our medics. His other hand had the       callused roughness of a farmer or a shepherd.        As he lay there with a peaceful expression, I studied the       details of his face and caught myself rooting for him: ``If       this boy knew me,'' I thought, ``he wouldn't want to kill       me.'' And here I am, I am supposed to want to kill him, and I       feel bad that I wanted him to live.        Now, that is the poisoned mind. That is the militarized       mind. And all the opportunities afforded me by the military       can't repay the cost of war on my soul.        It is poor folks who carry the burden of war for the elites       who send them. A working-class boy from Illinois, sent       halfway around the world to kill a young farmer--how did we       get here? How did this crazy war economy come to be?        First, there is the demand. A society that feels       perpetually threatened perpetually prepares for war, even in       the time of peace. To do this requires a military industrial       complex, a vast war economy whose charters, profits, stocks,       and jobs depend on permanent militarization and whose fortune       prospers most in times of war.        Secondly, there is the supply. A Nation that wants to       attract volunteers to its military and care for veterans       provides opportunities that will lure recruits who are       predominantly working-class folks with limited opportunities.        We need a Poor People's Campaign to amplify the voices like       this, of regular folks, above the lobby of a militarized       industry, a poisoned economy, to demand jobs in industries       other than war-making, to demand opportunities for working-      class folks that don't require killing other working-class       folks.        We need a Poor People's Campaign to demand justice for       people of color, killed by militarized police forces, a       poisoned law enforcement.        We need a Poor People's Campaign to transform a militarized       politic, a poisoned Congress, and a poisoned White House that       proves their toughness with chest beating and unites their       base with war drumming.        War always has a way of distracting our attention and       perverting our priorities. We need a Poor People's Campaign       to organize for racial, economic, and ecological justice, to       force these issues to the front and rectify our Nation's       agenda.
