 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I urge defeat of the previous question so we can  immediately consider S. 1867, the COVID-19 Origin Act of 2021.   The coronavirus pandemic has been marred by fear, confusion, and  mistrust, and it appears very possible that this virus was genetically  engineered through gain-of-function research in a lab at the Wuhan  Institute of Virology, making the virus more contagious to human  beings.   It is absolutely true that there has been political engineering,  including even speaking on the facts of its origin and its initial  spread. I am sure each and every one of us has talked to constituents  who have said they just don't know what to believe is true when it  comes to COVID. Well, we are in a position today to help, to provide  some transparency and accountability. The best disinfectant is sunlight  and that is what we can provide today.   I could stand up here for hours walking through the specific details  of the report that I helped conduct with some of my colleagues on the  Intelligence Committee, or by rehashing the findings from the hearings  that our Republican colleagues on the Select Committee conducted, but I  only have a few minutes, so here are a few key facts and pieces of  information that our bill establishes.   Right now, what we do know is that, according to the Department of  State, we have ``reason to believe that several researchers in the  Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick in the autumn of 2019 . . .  with symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal  illnesses.''   We also know Wuhan researchers, including Dr. Shi Zheng-Li, also  known colloquially as the ``bat lady,'' conducted experiments involving  a particular bat virus which showed an incredibly similar genetic  makeup to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.   We also know from publications that Dr. Shi was conducting dangerous  gain-of-function research.   Further, we know that the Wuhan Institute, which presents itself as a  civilian institution, has received U.S. taxpayer dollars through grants  to the EcoHealth Alliance. The lab has collaborated on projects for  China's military.   Finally, there is no animal intermediary found. As scientists have  stated, COVID-19 in its present form would have taken years to develop  naturally in its infectious state, yet it did not. Rather, it was  seemingly immediate.   When I was on the Cincinnati Board of Health, we investigated health  issues, and we provided our findings to the public. We never saw  anything like this pandemic, but we played a key role in keeping our  community healthy by preventing smaller outbreaks from happening again.   That is why, given these facts, the bill calls for three things. The  bill first establishes that we must identify the precise origins of  COVID-19 because it is critical for preventing a similar pandemic in  the future.   Earlier this year, CDC Director Robert Redfield stated, ``the most  likely etiology of this pathogen in Wuhan was from a laboratory.''   Even Director-General Tedros of the World Health Organization  acknowledges that COVID-19 may have originated in a lab and thought it  was worth investigating.   Second, given these scientific opinions and a whole slew of evidence,  including what I noted earlier, the bill establishes that we have  reason to believe that the COVID-19 pandemic may have originated in the  Wuhan Institute of Virology in their lab.   Finally--and this goes back to my original point about transparency-- the bill requires the Director of National Intelligence to declassify  as much evidence as possible that they can of what they know about the  origin of COVID-19; what activity the Wuhan lab was conducting; and  what we know about the researchers who reportedly fell ill back in  2019.   The bill is about accountability for Americans who want to know, who  deserve to know what caused this horrible scourge that took the lives  of so many of our families and loved ones; that destroyed our  businesses and livelihoods; that robbed them of years of their lives.  Actually, the whole world wants to know.                                time  1445    It is critical to inform Congress so we can better prepare to stave  off the next pandemic. I know some of my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle have recently asked our leaders to establish a committee  to do just that. I think it is a laudable goal, and this bill would  help those efforts.   I can't stress enough that this bill is not controversial by any  means. In fact, it passed the Senate in May with unanimous consent. Not  one Senator objected, not Senators Cruz or Rand Paul, not Bernie  Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. If those four Senators can get on board  with this bill, should not we be able to do the same?   Mr. Speaker, I urge defeat of the previous question and for immediate  consideration of S. 1867. It is for transparency. It is for  accountability. It is for truth. It is for doing the right thing on  behalf of humankind.
