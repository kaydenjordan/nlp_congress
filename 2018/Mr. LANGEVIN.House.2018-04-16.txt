 Mr. Speaker, today the National Institute of Standards  and Technology, or NIST, published its first major update to its  heralded cybersecurity framework. Since its release 4 years ago,  countless organizations have used the framework to voluntarily assess  their cybersecurity risk posture, identify gaps, and implement best  practices. This update adds timely guidance about managing supply chain  cybersecurity risks, like those Russia exploited to damaging effect  with the NotPetya malware.   Since President Obama first directed its creation, NIST has employed  a collaborative approach to developing the framework with diverse  stakeholders from government, private industry, academia, and civil  society. The revision process reflects this public-private partnership,  and I thank the NIST team for their hard work drafting this update.   I firmly believe that cybersecurity is not just an IT problem, and  the framework's approach reflects a broader risk-based decisionmaking  process. However, an understanding of the economics of controls is  essential if we expect companies to adopt them voluntarily, and I look  forward to continuing my work in this Chamber to deepen that  understanding.                            ____________________
