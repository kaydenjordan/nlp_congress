 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1280.   I spent the last week talking to law enforcement officers in Utah.  These men and women are heroes. They are good, honest officers who risk  their lives every day to keep us safe.   I asked them about H.R. 1280, and this is what they said:   ``This will destroy public safety.''   ``We haven't done anything to earn this type of distrust.''   ``This will push good law enforcement out of the business.''   ``Utah is an amazing place. We have the right people protecting us.  Let's keep them here.''   Mr. Speaker, police reform is necessary. We need to give officers the  tools they need to fairly enforce the law. But this legislation paints  a target on the back of every police officer in America.   In Salt Lake City, we saw a 38 percent increase in homicides. At the  same time, Salt Lake cut $5.3 million from the police department's  budget. It should be no surprise that voluntary resignations doubled.  This bill will make good officers flee the profession when we need them  most.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats won't say this, but this bill simply defunds  the police. Not in Utah's Fourth District; not now; not ever.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
