 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the Environmental Security Computing  Center within NOAA--the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration--utilizes high-performance computing technology to  quickly process information from weather satellites and to predict the  path of a hurricane or the extent of damage a wildfire can create. As  recent events have shown, weather events can have a devastating impact  on the lives of our fellow Americans.   In late July, northern West Virginia experienced unexpected flooding  that placed eight counties under a state of emergency. Nearly 1,000  homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed, and, tragically, two  individuals lost their lives. This was an unexpected flow of water.   Recently, Hurricanes Harvey and Irma have destroyed thousands of  homes and communities, which will require a massive influx of Federal  resources to rebuild. This Congress has the responsibility to ensure  the accuracy and viability of the weather and climate monitoring work  performed by the security center.   One of the most important systems NOAA uses to process this data is  its high-performance computing assets, such as NOAA's Environmental  Security Computer Center. My amendment provides funding to complete the  build-out for that facility that NOAA has initiated. Completing the  build-out will support the supercomputer systems that NOAA uses to  process and report this important and critical weather model data.   What we are witnessing during this hurricane season, Mr. Chairman,  demonstrates just how important passage of this amendment is to our  Nation, and we are going to have reliable information provided to us.  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
