 Mr. Speaker, may I ask my colleague from North Carolina,  the chairwoman of the Education and the Workforce Committee, to engage  in a brief colloquy.   Mr. Speaker, Wyoming has used CTE funds to pioneer innovative ways of  improving the college and career readiness of our students.   Protecting CTE funding in Wyoming for cutting-edge programs like the  Pathway Innovation Center in Casper is crucial, in part, because the  previous administration's harmful energy policies that devastated our  economy, and we must now work to address a depressed labor market and  hedge against future energy market downturns.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the chairwoman and her committee  colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their efforts to reform and  reauthorize the CTE programs. However, I have concerns that the bill,  as drafted in its current form, could negatively impact my State.  Therefore, I can't support it.   Additionally, I know some Members from West Virginia and Louisiana  share my concerns.   Therefore, I ask the gentlewoman, would she be willing to work with  us as this process moves forward to help address these concerns so we  can get a bill to the President's desk that we can all support?    I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina.
