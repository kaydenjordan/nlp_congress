 Madam Speaker, yesterday at the United Nations General  Assembly meeting, President Biden once again declared that he wants to  ensure that Iran will never get a nuclear weapon on his watch. But he  reiterated that his administration intends to do everything it can to  get back into the discredited nuclear deal with Iran.   Now, Madam Speaker, this was his only reference directly about Iran  in his remarks.   Today, I rise to remind my colleagues about the risks of this  approach. Iran is the number one state sponsor of terrorism and the  greatest threat against our ally, Israel, and to stability in the  Middle East.   In July, I joined Chairman Meeks and traveled to Israel in the first  Congressional codel since the new Israeli government has come into  power.   Despite the change in power and the coalition between the left and  right, there is no space between the parties, and the number one  national security concern in Israel continues to be Iran.   And while Republicans and Democrats agree in principle that Iran  should never have a nuclear weapon, in action, the flawed nuclear deal  of the Obama administration did not end Iran's quest. It only delayed  modestly the development of a nuclear weapon; development that  continues, Madam Speaker.   This deal kicked the can down the road in exchange for a windfall to  the Iranian mullahs and sanctions relief and pallets of cash delivered  on a tarmac.   Further, President Trump's maximum pressure campaign of economic  sanctions was working, and he took decisive action with his strike  against former IRGC head, Solemani.   So, my friends, I am afraid that we will return to the Obama-era  policy of paying cash for promises from the Iranian leadership that  will never be kept.   Iran has blood on their hands, propping up Assad in Syria, the death  of American troops in Iraq, and recently even blatantly attempting  kidnapping in New York City.   As a result, I reintroduced my legislation, the Holding Iranian  Leaders Accountable Act.   This bipartisan bill with my friend Mr. Lawson from Florida would  make public the funds obtained in an illegal or corrupt manner by  Iran's authoritarian leaders.   For more than four decades the people of Iran have lived under the  brutal dictatorship of the Ayatollahs.   The government leadership and the heads of the Islamic Revolutionary  Guard Corps have all profited, Madam Speaker, at the expense of the  struggling Iranian people.   By combining publicly available information with U.S. intelligence  that can be made public, this legislation will provide a valuable  window into the wealth making of Iran's corrupt officials and limit  their financial holdings which are used to support and sponsor  terrorism.   However, since this administration is attempting to re-enter nuclear  negotiations, we throw away a lot of leverage. This bill gives the U.S.  Government and Iranian people knowledge by knowing how corrupt their  leadership is.                          Commemorating Erma Hendrix     Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Little Rock City  Director Erma Hendrix, who sadly passed away at the age of 91 on  September 8.  [[Page H4875]]    Born and raised in Little Rock, Director Hendrix dedicated her life  to public service. From serving as a nurse, to local government, to her  philanthropic endeavors, she always put our community first.   Erma spent over 15 years representing her community as part of Little  Rock City's Board of Directors representing Ward 1. Known for her  passion, she spent her career fighting for racial equality and greater  representation in city governance.   I value having the opportunity to work alongside Director Hendrix. I  am grateful to have known her for so long and so favorably, and I know  that the city of Little Rock is better for the service and work of  Director Erma Hendrix. God rest her soul.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the committee and my  ranking member for the world-class work on this NDAA package.   This package contains two of my amendments. First, my bipartisan  bill, H.R. 3146, the SAVE Act, passed the House unanimously earlier  this year, is included as an amendment. The SAVE Act builds on the good  work of the Armed Services Committee to include important provisions to  counter China by improving the U.S. supply chain independence and  security.   Secondly, this en bloc includes my amendment to require the creation  of an interagency strategy within the United States Government to  disrupt and dismantle the production and trafficking of the drug  Captagon that is being produced by the Syrian regime led by Assad.                                time  1800    In addition to regularly committing war crimes against his own  people, the Assad regime is now becoming a narco-state.   The United States Government must do all it can to disrupt this  industrial level of production of this drug currently taking place in  Syria.   I thank my friends for their support of these amendments, and I urge  support of this en bloc.
