 Mr. Speaker, President Biden and Democrats are  pushing to pass a multitrillion-dollar socialist spending agenda that  would be the largest tax-and-spending increase in our Nation's history.  It is, frankly, money we don't have.   At a time when families and businesses are struggling to deal with  President Biden's reckless economic policies, the Democrats are pushing  to spend trillions more dollars to fund their radical, socialistic, and  costly policies.   Just a few of the Democrats' far-left socialist policies will hit  small business with a larger tax bill, impose costly Green New Deal  mandates that simply won't work, increase our energy dependency on  Russia and China, weaponize the IRS to target American families and  monitor $600 per week bank transactions.   I will continue to stand against the Democrats' socialistic tax-and- spend spree that will limit our freedoms, make our country less  competitive, and destroy Main Street America. Their agenda is anti- American.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
