 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise today to honor Rick Perry in his final days as Secretary of  the Department of Energy. It makes sense that those lined up to speak  would be from our shared home State, the great State of Texas. We have  served with him. We have benefited from Rick's leadership. We call him  friend. Much can be said and will be said of Rick Perry in these next  few weeks.   As already mentioned, Rick is a fifth generation Texan, an Aggie, Air  Force pilot, state representative, agricultural commissioner,  lieutenant governor, longest serving Texas Governor, Secretary of  Energy. He will be rightfully lauded for a life well given to public  service.   In every stage of his life, Rick Perry sought to do the best for  Texas and for the people of this Nation. As a state representative, he  was one of the most effective legislators pushing for more strict  budgeting. As Agricultural Commissioner, Perry showed his skill at  sales and started what would be a lifelong career as the number one top  salesman for the great State of Texas.   As Governor, Rick helped make Texas a destination for business and  industry and for families and people. There is a reason why we still  see an average influx of people, a thousand a day in our great State.   As Secretary of Energy, we continue to see the benefits of Rick  Perry's unabashed love of Texas and these United States. Thanks to his  leadership, the United States is now the largest energy producer in the  world with a greatly expanded footprint in the international market.   Still, my favorite story which defines the man that is Rick Perry is  one told by a former rival turned friend, and that would be Senator  Rick Santorum. Former Senator and Presidential candidate Rick Santorum  told of the regular frantic note taking of candidates while they were  on the debate stage, all except for Rick Perry. Instead, Rick  recounted, Perry only wrote one note. It was when Rick Santorum told  about the health difficulties his beloved daughter, Bella, had faced  from her birth.   Following the debate, Rick said the two men spoke and Rick said as he  looked over Perry's shoulder at the single note written, it had three  words: ``Pray for Bella.'' That, Mr. Speaker, is a man of faith,  compassion, and integrity. It speaks to his character. It speaks to his  effectiveness. It speaks to his dedication to public service and to his  love of this great country.   I am grateful for having served under Governor Perry in the State  house for 4 years and with Secretary Perry in the Department of Energy.  The great State of Texas and our Nation are better for his service.   As Rick Perry moves away from public life, his leadership will be  missed, but the legacy he leaves behind will endure.   I thank my friend, Governor Perry, for all he has done. I thank Anita  for loaning Texas and then America a true Texas treasure, a true  statesman, and a truly fine individual. Rick and Anita both deserve a  rich time together. Blessings to them both and please enjoy the private  life.                                time  1945
