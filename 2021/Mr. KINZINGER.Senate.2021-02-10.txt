 You know, a guy who knows how to tweet very       aggressively on Twitter, you know, puts out one of the       weakest statements on one of the saddest days in American       history because his ego won't let him admit defeat.    He was not just our Commander in Chief. He had incited the attack.  The insurgents were following his commands, as we saw when they read  aloud the tweet attacking the Vice President. They confirmed this  during the attack too.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   Senators, ask yourselves this: How easy would it have been for the  President to give a simple command, a simple instruction, just telling  them: Stop. Leave.   This was a dereliction of duty, plain and simple, and it would have  been for any President who had done that. And that brings me to my next  point. You heard from my colleagues that when planning this attack, the  insurgents predicted that Donald Trump would command the National Guard  to help them.   There is a lot that we don't know yet about what happened that day,  but here is what we do know: Donald Trump did not send help to these  officers who were badly outnumbered, overwhelmed, and being beaten  down. Two hours into the insurrection, by 3 p.m., President Trump had  not deployed the National Guard or any other law enforcement to help,  despite multiple pleas to do so.   President Donald Trump was at the time our Commander in Chief of the  United States of America. He took a solemn oath to preserve, protect,  and defend this country, and he failed to uphold that oath. In fact,  there is no indication that President Trump ever made a call to have  the Guard deployed or had anything to do with the Guard being deployed  when it ultimately was.   Shortly after 3:04 p.m., the Acting Defense Secretary announced that  the Guard had been activated and listed the people he spoke with prior  to this activation, including Vice President Mike Pence, Speaker  Pelosi, Leader McConnell, Senator Schumer, and Representative  Hoyer. But that list did not include the President. This omission of  his name was reportedly not accidental. According to reports, ``Trump  initially rebuffed requests to mobilize the National Guard and required  interference by other officials,'' including his own White House  Counsel. And later, ``as a mob of Trump supporters breached police  barricades and seized the Capitol,'' Trump reportedly was ``disengaged  in discussions with Pentagon leaders about deploying the National Guard  to aid the overwhelmed U.S. Capitol Police.'' President Trump was  reportedly ``completely, totally out of it. He made no attempt to reach  [the National Guard.]'' And it was Vice President Pence, still under  threat for his life, who reportedly spoke to the Guard.    President Trump's conduct confirms this too. At no point on January 6  did Donald Trump even reference the National Guard. The only thing that  we heard connecting the President to the Guard was from his Press  Secretary, who tweeted about the Guard being deployed at the  President's direction over half an hour later, at 3:36 p.m.   We have seen what Donald Trump does when he tries to take credit for  something, and yet, even when the National Guard was finally deployed,  he didn't even acknowledge it. In fact, he didn't say a word about the  National Guard the entire day. Think about that: the bloodiest attack  we have seen on our Capitol since 1812 and our President couldn't be  bothered to even mention that help was on its way.   These insurgents had been attacking our government for over 4 hours  by that point. And we may have been the  [[Page S643]]  target, but it was the brave men and women who protect our Capitol who  were out there combating thousands of armed insurgents in a fight for  their lives, and that is who Donald Trump left entirely unprotected.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   This is hard to watch, but I think it is important to understand what  the Capitol Police were facing, how severely they were outnumbered  while our Commander in Chief, whose job it was to protect and defend  them, was just watching, doing nothing for hours, refusing to send  help. If he wanted to protect these officers, if he cared about their  safety, as he tweeted about, he would have told his supporters to  leave. He would have sent help right away.   One brave officer was killed. Others took their lives after the  attack. More than 140 police officers were injured, including cracked  ribs, smashed spinal discs. One officer will lose an eye. Another was  stabbed with a metal fence stake. They were completely and violently  overwhelmed by a mob and needed help, and our Commander in Chief,  President Trump, refused to send it.   Senators, you have seen all the evidence so far, and this is clear:  On January 6, President Trump left everyone in this Capitol for dead.  For the next hour after President Trump's 3 p.m. tweet, he still did  nothing. Not until 4:17 p.m., over 3\1/2\ hours after the violence  started, did our President send a message finally asking the insurgents  to go home.   On the right, you will see what happened that day in the hours  leading up to his prerecorded video. On the left, you will see his  message. Let's watch.   (Text of video presentation.)         President TRUMP. I know your pain, I know you're hurt, we       had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide       election and everyone knows it, especially the other side.       But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have       to have law and order. We have to respect our great people in       law and order. We don't want anybody hurt. It's a very tough       period of time. There's never been a time like this, where       such a thing happened, where they could take it away from all       of us. From me, from you, from our country. This was a       fraudulent election, but we can't play into the hands of       these people. We have to have peace. So go home. We love you,       you're very special. We've seen what happens, you see the way       others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how       you feel. But go home and go home in peace.    This is the first time our Commander in Chief spoke publicly at all  since the attack began, over 3\1/2\ hours after it started, and these  are the entirety of the words the President spoke out loud to the  American people or to the attackers that entire day.   Nowhere in that video, not once did he say: I condemn this  insurrection. I condemn what you did today.   Nowhere did he say: I am sending help immediately. Stop this.   Here is what he said instead:         I know your pain, I know you're hurt. We had an election       that was stolen.    Even after all the things we witnessed, even after all of that  carnage, he goes out and tells the same big lie, the same big lie that  enraged and incited the attack. He repeated this while the attack was  ongoing and while we were still under threat.   And here is what else he said:         Go home in peace.        We love you, you're very special.    Senators, you were here. You saw this with your own eyes. You faced  that danger. And when President Trump had an opportunity to confront  them as the leader of us all, as our Commander in Chief, what did he  tell them?         We love you, you're very special.    This was not a condemnation; this was a message of consolation, of  support, of praise. And if there is any doubt that his supporters,  these insurgents, took this as a message of support and praise, watch  for yourselves.   (Text of video presentation.)         Mr. Angeli. Donald Trump asked everybody to go home. He       just said--he just put out a tweet. It is a minute long. He       asked everybody to go home.        Unidentified Speaker. Why do you think so?        Mr. Angeli. Because we won the fucking day. We fucking won.        Unidentified Speaker. How did we win?        Mr. Angeli. Well, we won by sending a message to the       Senators and th Congressmen, we won by sending a message to       Pence, OK, that if they don't do as--as it is their oath       do, if they don't uphold the Constitution, then we will       remove them from office, one way or another.    I suspect you recognize that man. You will hear him say that ``we won  the day.'' Who won the day? We know that at least five people lost  their lives that day. The House and the Senate were in life-threatening  danger, and so was the Vice President, and think of everyone else here  as well. Who won on January 6? That is not a win for America, but it is  a win for Donald Trump unless we hold him accountable.   Now, a little over an hour after that video, the brave members of law  enforcement secured the Capitol, and we as a Congress got ready to  continue certifying the results of our free and fair election.   A half hour after that, President Trump issued another tweet. In case  there was any doubt as to whether he was happy with the people who did  this, as to whether he had incited this, he commemorated what happened  on January 6.   At 6:01 p.m. on January 6, he tweeted:         These are the things and events that happen when a sacred       landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously       stripped away from great patriots who have been badly &       unfairly treated for so long.    Ending with:         Remember this day forever!    My colleague Manager Cicilline started with this tweet because this  tweet shows exactly how Donald Trump felt about what happened on  January 6. ``These are the things . . . that happen.'' He is saying  this was foreseeable. He is saying: I told you this was going to happen  if you certified the election for anyone else, and you got what you  deserved for trying to take my power away.         [G]reat patriots. . . . Go home with love & in peace.       Remember this day forever!    He is saying to them: You did good. He is not regretful. He is not  grieving. He is not sad. He is not angry about the attack. He is  celebrating it. He is commemorating it.   This is the entirety of what President Trump said to the public once  the attack began--five tweets and a prerecorded video. On the day of  the most bloody insurrection we faced in generations, our Commander in  Chief, who is known for sending 108 tweets in a normal day, sent 5  tweets and a prerecorded video. That is the entirety of President  Trump's public statements from when the attack began until he went to  bed on January 6. That is all he did despite all the people we know who  begged him to preserve, protect, and defend. That was our Commander in  Chief's response.   He began the day with ``Our country has had enough, we will not take  it anymore, and that's what this is all about,'' and he ended the  attack with letting us know that we got what he forewarned that  morning.   We will, of course, each of us, remember that day forever, but not in  the way that President Trump intended, not because of the actions of  these violent, unpatriotic insurrectionists. I will remember that day  forever because despite President Trump's vicious attempts throughout  the day to encourage the siege and block the certification, he failed.  At 8:06 p.m., the Senate gaveled into session, and the counting of the  electoral votes continued. About an hour later, the House followed  suit. And close to 4 a.m., after spending a significant part of the day  evacuated or on the floor or hiding, this great body fulfilled the will  of the people and certified the electoral college vote.   And I am proud to be part of Congress. I am proud that we ensured  that the will of the American people finally prevailed on that day. And  I am proud that I and everyone in this room abided by our oath of  office even if the President didn't abide by his.   President Trump, too, took an oath as President. He swore on a Bible  to preserve, protect, and defend. And who among us can honestly say  they believe that he upheld that oath? Who among us will let his utter  dereliction of duty stand?   Mr. Manager RASKIN. Mr. President, the managers are prepared to  recess for the evening and to finish our opening statement tomorrow.
