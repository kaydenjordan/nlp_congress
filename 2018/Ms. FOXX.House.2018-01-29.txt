 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Gohmert, my  classmate, for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, tomorrow night the President will come before this  Chamber to address Americans and the wider world. While some in this  Chamber and those watching at home will disagree with the President's  vision, I hope that we may all agree to pay attention to the facts.   The fact remains that our economy is booming. Thanks to the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act, middle class Americans are receiving bonuses and are  empowered to keep more of their paychecks. Energy companies are  slashing their rates so that taxpayers are spending less on energy.  Families are now able to keep more of their hard-earned money to spend  any way they wish.   The Dow Jones has soared into new heights under this administration.  These facts will surely be addressed by the President, even if they are  conveniently ignored by some in this Chamber and members of the news  media.   I look forward to attending the State of the Union and encourage all  those tuning in to remember the facts.
