 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to the 2020  Census and to emphasize the importance of ensuring that rural America  is accounted for.   Our once-a-decade counting of all Americans is important for numerous  reasons. Most importantly, census data provides us with a roadmap for  allocating hundreds of billions of dollars annually in government  services. These include investments in things like education, roads,  and bridges, and other areas of importance to rural districts like  mine.   I appreciate the U.S. Census Bureau's efforts to streamline  government duties by including an online response option this year.  However, I am very concerned that rural areas like Kentucky's First  Congressional District could get left behind.   Unfortunately, nearly 30 percent of my district lacks internet access  or lacks access to reliable connection. This high number is  unacceptable and could have dire consequences, including ensuring that  people I serve are accounted for.   This startling lack of internet access in rural America is a call to  action for Congress to step up to the plate. My office has worked  tirelessly to address this issue, including funding critical programs  in the 2018 farm bill. But we must do more to expand internet  connectivity so that our voices will not be undercounted and left  behind.   Without action, small towns across Kentucky and our entire Nation  risk being left behind in the upcoming census, an outcome that should  be unacceptable to every member of this body.                            ____________________
