 Mr. Speaker, I am going to vote ``yes''  enthusiastically.   This is a big bill, but the American people are bigger. They will  respond to the present threat as Americans have always faced grave  challenges: as free men and women with deep reservoirs of strength,  capability, and, when summoned, duty and confidence.   It is the duty of some to mobilize this government to backstop the  economy; the duty of some to isolate, to blunt, the contagion; the duty  of some to face the risk tending the afflicted; and, fellow Americans,  the duty of the rest of us to mobilize the unstoppable force of the  American economy to provide supplies, innovate technologies, and  enlarge healthcare capacities to meet the needs of all and to defeat  this enemy.   With God's help, this virus is no match for the United States of  America.
