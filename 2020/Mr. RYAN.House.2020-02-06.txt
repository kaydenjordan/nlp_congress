 Mr. Chair, I rise today to strongly support the passage of  H.R. 2474, the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, and oppose any  motion to Recommit or amendment that will weaken this very important  piece of legislation.   In a letter to Members of Congress, Robert Martinez, Jr., the  President of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace  Workers writes:         ``American workers approve of unions according to a Gallop       poll conducted last year, and if they had the opportunity,       they would choose to have labor representation. However, the       right to freely form a union without the threat of company       intimidation or interference is denied to workers today. The       PRO act expands the enforcement powers of the National Labor       Relations Board (NLRB) and strengthens protections for       employees that engage in collective action. The bill would       level the playing field by prohibiting employers from       requiring their employees to attend ``captive audience''       meetings whose sole purpose is to convince workers to vote       against the union. In addition to imposing financial       penalties on employers and individual corporate offices who       violate the law, the bill would give workers the option of       bringing their case to federal court.        The PRO Act is a crucially bold piece of legislation that       modernizes federal laws and establishes a process for       mediation and arbitration to help the parties achieve a first       contract. It protects workers' rights to organize a union and       bargain for higher wages and better benefits.        Finally, the PRO Act would eliminate state right to work       laws. These laws are simply designed to give more power to       corporations at the expense of workers and have had the       effects of lowering wages and eroding pensions and healthcare       coverage in states where they have been adopted.        For all the above reasons, I respectfully urge you to       support the PRO Act and vote ``Yes'' when this long overdue       legislation is considered.''   Labor unions are the backbone of our economy. They have played a  vital role in securing worker protections by allowing workers to  collectively bargain for better wages and work environments. We must  ensure the rights of workers are protected, which I why I strongly urge  my colleagues on both sides of a isle to votes yes and pass the PRO  Act.   I include in the Record a copy of Mr. Martinez's letter.                                        International Association of                                Machinists and Aerospace Workers,                               Upper Marlboro, MD, January 30, 2020.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the International       Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, I strongly       urge you to support the swift passage of the Protecting the       Right to Organize (``PRO'') Act (H.R. 2474) and oppose any       Motion to Recommit or amendments that will weaken this very       important legislation.        American workers approve of unions according to a Gallop       poll conducted last year, and if they had the opportunity,       they would choose to have labor representation.
