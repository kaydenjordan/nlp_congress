 Madam President, I rise today in support of the fiscal  year 2020 Appropriations bill for the Departments of Transportation,  Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies. This bill is  included in the appropriations package that is before this Chamber.   Let me begin my remarks by thanking Chairman Shelby and Vice Chairman  Leahy for their bipartisan leadership in successfully finishing the  conference and advancing all of these appropriations bills to the  Senate floor.   I also want to acknowledge the hard work and strong commitment of my  friend and colleague Senator Jack Reed, the ranking member of the T-HUD  Subcommittee. We have worked closely together in negotiating this bill  and have crafted a truly bipartisan product.   The fiscal year 2020 transportation and housing appropriations bill  provides $74.3 billion to continue to improve our Nation's  infrastructure and maintain HUD rental assistance for low-income  seniors, homeless youths, and other vulnerable populations. This year,  we once again faced the funding challenge of rising rental costs across  the country and a reduction in the receipts from the Federal Housing  Administration that are used to offset some of the spending in this  bill.   However, we were successful in maintaining many of the Senate  priorities in the final bill. For example, the bill provides $1 billion  for the highly effective and popular BUILD grant program, which has  provided $205 million in critical infrastructure improvements in Maine  since 2009. In addition, the bill includes $1.15 billion for bridge  repair and rehabilitation, with a focus on those States with the  greatest needs. The need for additional bridge funding is clear across  the country and was highlighted in my home State of Maine by grant  awards for projects such as the Station 46 Bridge and the Sarah Mildred  Long Bridge.   The infrastructure funding in this bill not only addresses the  transportation challenges we face but also creates jobs and economic  growth in each and every one of our homes. The American Society of  Civil Engineers' most recent report card from 2017 shows that America's  infrastructure remains in poor condition with a grade of D+. This poor  rating is not only detrimental for the movement of people and goods but  also harmful from a safety perspective.   I am also particularly proud of the $300 million for the third  National Security Multi-Mission Vessel which will serve as the new  training vessel for Maine Maritime Academy. The new NSMV will play a  critical role in training the next generation of U.S. mariners. This  new ship will ensure that cadets receive the training hours they need  to graduate and join the workforce in the merchant marine, Navy, and  Coast Guard.   Another important issue, particularly to Senator Reed and me, is  reducing lead paint in homes. That is of particular health concern to  families with children under the age of 6. The bill provides $290  million to combat lead hazards, a historic level of funding. Lead paint  hazards are a significant concern for Maine families, as 57 percent of  our housing stock was constructed prior to 1978, the year lead-based  paint was banned. These grants will help communities protect children  from the harmful lifelong effects of lead poisoning.   Finally, I do want to mention that the bill provides additional  funding for the FAA's aviation safety programs in light of two Boeing  crashes. This funding ensures that the agency has the necessary staff  and training, as well as safety data reporting systems going forward.  Our Committee remains focused on this issue to ensure that we maintain  the Nation's safest airspace.   I appreciate the opportunity to present this important legislation to  the Chamber. As we begin debate on the Transportation-HUD bill, I urge  my colleagues to support the investments in this bill that benefit our  communities all across this Nation and the families, veterans,  children, and our seniors that rely on these programs.    Madam President, I rise today as a member of the Defense  Appropriations Subcommittee to express my support for this  appropriations bill and to highlight a number of important provisions  for both our national security and the State of Maine.   I would first like to thank Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member  Durbin, as well as Vice-Chairman Leahy, for their work and leadership  on the committee and their willingness to come together to complete  what is a strong, bipartisan final bill.   The bipartisan work of the Defense Subcommittee is vitally important  to ensure our men and women in uniform are able to fight and defend our  Nation as well as deter potential adversaries. It also ensures our DOD  civilians have the resources they need to support those servicemembers  and keep our ships, planes, and vehicles at the ready.   The bill before us today supports a military pay increase of 3.1  percent--the largest in a decade. It also recognizes the value of our  civilian workforce by also supporting an average pay increase of 3.1  percent for DOD civilians.   The bill recognizes the necessity of building and maintaining a  strong Navy. It provides nearly $24 billion for new Navy battle force  ships, including more than $5 billion for three DDG-51 destroyers.  Looking ahead to next year, it also provides an additional $390 million  above the amount requested in the President's budget request for DDG-51  advanced procurement. This demonstrates Congress's intent that the  Department sustain an aggressive growth rate for large surface  combatants in fiscal year 2021 and beyond.   In Maine, we are very proud of the role that Bath Iron Works plays in  contributing to our national security, building the finest ships in our  fleet. This bill includes $130 million to invest in our Nation's large  surface combatant industrial base, ensuring Bath Iron Works can  efficiently design and build our Navy's fleet long into the future.   BIW is known throughout the Navy for the high-quality of the ships  they build, with many Sailors using our motto that ``Bath Built is Best  Built.'' BIW employs the finest shipbuilders, engineers, and designers  in the world, and this bill rightly recognizes the great value that  these tried-and-tested warships bring to the Navy.  [[Page S7184]]    This bill supports our nation's public shipyards, which are truly the  backbone of our Navy's submarine fleet. It funds our Navy's maintenance  activities, ensuring workers at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and other  shipyards can carry out their work keeping our Nation's submarines at  sea.   The bill also makes clear that the Navy should continue to invest in  the very successful apprenticeship programs at our public shipyards-- which has been incredibly successful at PNSY--as well as work to  address the availability of Virginia-class submarine materials at our  shipyards.   This bill makes critical investments in research and development  programs, which are being carried out in partnership with research  institutions, including the University of Maine. These programs include  producing jet fuel from Maine's forest biomass; developing hybrid  composite structures for the Navy; and funding for DOD to utilize  UMaine's new 3D printer, the largest in the world, for cutting-edge  defense research and rapid prototyping.   This bill invests in fifth-generation aircraft we need to deter  Russia and China by funding 98 F-35 aircraft 20 more than initially  requested by the Department. These advanced, stealthy jets are key to  dominating the skies, and I am proud of Pratt and Whitney's  contributions to the program through its construction of the F135  engine at its facility in North Berwick, ME. Additionally, the bill  procures six CH-53K Heavy Lift helicopters for the Marine Corps. The  rotating drive shafts are a critical moment of the aircraft and are  produced at Hunting Dearborn's facility in Fryeburg, ME.   The National Guard provides our country with both a strategic and  operational reserve which has proven itself time and time again. I  applaud the bill's inclusion of $1.3 billion to the National Guard and  Reserve equipment account to help modernize our Reserve forces. It also  notes the critical capability that the National Guard provides to State  governments in DOD's cyber defense mission and urges the Department to  ensure there are cyber capabilities within the Guard in every State.   Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass  this important legislation.   Mr.VAN HOLLEN. Madam President, I rise to express my concerns with  H.R. 158, the appropriations package to fund the Department of Defense,  the Census Bureau, the Department of Justice, NASA, the Treasury, and  the Department of Homeland Security.   As a representative of many Federal employees in the State of  Maryland and a member of the Appropriations Committee, I take the  responsibility of funding the government extremely seriously. The  decisions we make in the appropriations bills govern the operations of  the Federal Government and its programs to serve the American people,  keep them safe, and foster opportunity.   I have also been deeply disturbed by this Administration's efforts to  disregard the appropriations bills that Congress has passed and the  President has signed by transferring funds from one account to another  and, in some cases, failing to spend duly appropriated dollars in a  timely fashion. In order to assert Congress's authority to make the  laws that the administration must faithfully execute, I have advocated  for greater transparency through disclosure of the apportionment  documents used by the Office of Management and Budget to plan spending  schedules among agencies and for restrictions on the administration's  authority to transfer funds between programs. We have seen that this  President does not care about, congressional intent and will flout the  law to use American taxpayer money build a border wall that he said  Mexico would pay for. The funds appropriated by Congress cannot be not  be allowed to be taken away and redirected on the whim of a President.  So I am disappointed that this bill does not include meaningful  restrictions on transfer authority.   It also does not include House language to require disclosure of  apportionment documents--language that is similar to an amendment I  offered that was passed on a bipartisan basis as part of a bill in the  Budget Committee. I appreciate the hard-won provisions in the bill to  bolster efforts to oversee and correct abuses in this administration's  disgraceful detention policy that has separated children from their  parents and funding for alternatives to detention family case  Management. The bill rightfully rejects the President's request to  increase his ICE and Border Patrol forces and prohibits border fencing  in environmentally sensitive areas. But I remain deeply concerned that  the President still can--and judging by past actions, likely will-- transfer resources to support his damaging agenda.   I am pleased that this bill provides a well-deserved 3.1 percent pay  increase for Federal employees who serve our Nation admirably every  day. I am a cosponsor of the legislation to do that and glad that it  has been included in this bill However, I am concerned that the bill  does not include House-passed language to counter the President's  Executive orders that undermine Federal employee collective bargaining  and have resulted in a number of anti-worker contracts. Federal  employees are prohibited from bargaining on wages and benefits, so they  focus their efforts on improving the operations of their offices. We  should not impede their efforts to establish better working conditions,  protect the civil service from political reprisals, and arbitrate  disputes between management and the rank-and-file. I will continue to  fight for fair treatment of Federal workforce.   I appreciate the willingness of Chairman Shelby and Vice Chairman  Leahy to work with me and with Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton to  provide the District of Columbia with funding to cover past  inauguration and Fourth of July expenses. But I am deeply disappointed  that the bill continues to include shameful political policy riders for  the District of Columbia that place restrictions on how the District  spends its own money. The U.S. Congress should stop acting like we run  the city of Washington, DC. Elected officials from the District should  be able to enact laws that address the needs of their constituents  without Congress looking over their shoulder. As I stated during our  full committee markup of the Financial Services and General Government  Appropriations bill, we must remove these restrictions--which none of  us would accept for our own States.   Despite my reservations about the bill, it does include funding for  many important programs. It fully funds the First Step Act to implement  needed criminal justice reform, rejects the President's request to  eliminate the Legal Services Corporation, and includes resources for  law enforcement to address crime and fight opioid and drug trafficking.  It fully funds the Census, a constitutionally mandated effort to count  everyone in the United States and ensure that every community receives  the resources it needs. It rejects the President's cuts to a number of  important programs at NASA Goddard in Maryland, including the PACE  Program, W-FIRST, and carbon monitoring. These programs are essential  to our understanding of the universe and to own world and have been on  the Trump chopping block year after year. I will continue to fight to  make sure they are adequately funded. It fully funds the James Webb  Space Telescope, supports RESTORE-L, and increases the base budget for  Earth Science. NOAA and NIST, which are also headquartered in Maryland,  will receive modest increases instead of the Administration's proposed  cuts. The bill also includes important funding for defense  installations in Maryland. This funding, coupled with the National  Defense Authorization Act, which I was proud to support and which  included a military pay increase and for the first time paid parental  leave for federal employees, will ensure that the men and women of the  military will receive benefits they deserve. Finally, the bill rejects  the President's request to eliminate the Economic Development  Administration and preserves funding for cooperative agreements between  the Minority Business Development Agency and Minority Business  Development Centers--three of which serve Maryland.   I recognize that no bill is perfect and that appropriations bills  require compromise. I respect the work that Chairman Shelby, Vice  Chairman Leahy, and their staffs have put into this legislation and am  grateful for their willingness to work with me on many Maryland  priorities. However, I believe  [[Page S7185]]  that we must take steps to assert Congress's role in the appropriations  process in the face of a President who is willing to disregard the laws  we pass--and he signs--to further his individual agenda. Because this  bill does not restrict the President's ability to flout Congress's  stated intent, I regret that I cannot vote for it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Karen J.  Lewis on her many years of service to Congress. After a 45-year career  distinguished by outstanding achievements, Karen will retire from the  Congressional Research Service, CRS, in January 2020 after leading the  Service's American Law Division, ALD, for many years.   Karen joined CRS as a legislative attorney in 1974 after graduating  from Albany Law School earlier that year. In the following decade,  Karen provided nonpartisan advice to Congress on some of the most  difficult legal matters facing the Nation in the 1970s and 1980s,  including sex discrimination in the workplace, abortion rights after  Roe v. Wade, and the Equal Rights Amendment. She also advised Congress  on the implementation of numerous civil rights laws, including title  VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Fair Housing Act, title IX of the  Higher Education Act, and the Age Discrimination Act.   In 1984, Karen moved into CRS management, serving first as the  section head of ALD's consumer law group before heading the Division's  administrative law section. In the nearly 25 years she served in these  roles, Karen helped mentor dozens of attorneys, engraining in them  CRS's core values of providing authoritative and objective legal advice  regardless of partisan affiliation. Any attorney trained under Karen's  tutelage is well familiar with her repeated advice to rely on primary  sources to ensure CRS's legal advice is trustworthy and reliable.   In 2007, Karen was promoted to senior CRS leadership, serving in a  variety of capacities, including 11 years as the Assistant Director of  CRS's ALD. As the head of the law division, Karen played a central role  reviewing ALD's written work, helping to ensure its accuracy,  completeness, and quality. She also led countless initiatives for the  Service. This included helping to establish the Legal Sidebar--CRS's  first exclusively web-based product line to provide succinct and timely  analysis to Congress on matters of pressing importance. She also was  instrumental in raising the profile of the Service's Federal Law  Update, a seminar series that provides continued legal education for  Congress, which tripled its average attendance under Karen's  leadership. Karen also spearheaded the first major revision since 1952  of the ``Constitution Annotated,'' the Congress' official treatise of  record on the Constitution. And Karen has been instrumental in hiring  some of the finest attorneys in the Federal Government to help Congress  in legal debates over executive power, health care reform, immigration,  and the future of the Supreme Court. Moreover, throughout her time in  management, Karen served on countless advisory panels that have helped  establish organizational practices and policies for CRS.   While Karen's retirement is a loss for Congress, her imprint on the  legislative branch will not soon disappear. CRS and the ALD offer an  invaluable service to Congress by providing members with reliable,  nonpartisan information to assist the legislative process at every  step. Karen spent nearly all of her professional career supporting  Congress's work and strengthening CRS through her work in ALD. She  served as a role model for hundreds of attorneys who can attest that  her integrity, work ethic, and dedication to CRS's core values is  second to none. Her legacy will continue with the division she helped  build and the Service more broadly. Congratulations to Karen, and I  wish her many long and happy years in retirement.  [[Page S7202]]                              ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Ending the  Diagnostic Odyssey Act. This legislation gives States the option of  providing whole genome sequencing WSG clinical services through  Medicaid for children with a disease that is suspected to have a  genetic cause, at an enhanced Federal matching rate for 3 years. I am  pleased to be joined by Senators Jones, McSally, and Menendez.   Children with rare diseases will spend on average 5 to 7 years on  diagnostic odyssey, and 30 percent of those children will not survive  beyond the age of 5 years old. The average patient sees seven different  physicians in that time. The wait to find a cause--nevermind a cure-- can be excruciating. Parents try to project a calm and reassuring  presence for their child while facing a whirlwind of doctor  appointments, hospital visits, and unanswered questions.   Undeniably, we are making progress in both accelerating research  funding for rare diseases as well as in the development of diagnostics.  In 2014, the National Institutes of Health, NIH launched a program  called the Undiagnosed Disease Network UDN. In its first 20 months, the  UDN accepted 601 participants undiagnosed by traditional medical  practices. Of those who completed their UDN evaluation during this  time, 35 percent were given a diagnosis. Many of these diagnoses were  rare genetic diseases, including 31 previously unknown syndromes.   In May, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr.  Francis Collins, wrote a blog post on how whole genome sequencing-- combined with artificial intelligence, AI--can now be used to diagnose  genetic diseases in seriously ill babies in fewer than 24 hours. Dr.  Collins writes: ``I would submit that there is no other technology in  the history of planet Earth that has experienced this degree of  progress in speed and affordability.''   For parents of children with an undiagnosed illness, answers cannot  come soon enough. There are approximately 7,000 rare diseases known  today. Approximately 80 percent of rare diseases are genetic, and about  one-half of all rare diseases affect children. For example, Alstrom  syndrome is an extremely rare and complex genetic disorder.  Approximately 1,200 affected individuals have been identified  worldwide, which makes a obtaining a correct diagnosis challenging.  Characteristics of Alstrom syndrome include vision disturbances,  sensorineural hearing impairment, cardiomyopathy, obesity, kidney  dysfunction, and diabetes.   Robin Marshall, executive director of the Alstrom Syndrome  International, located in Mount Desert Islanas, ME, has said that  ``whole Genome Sequencing has changed the lives of those we represent  by enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis, fostering more timely  and appropriate medical care, and unlocking a host of social services  to combat the educational and psycho-social complications that our  children confront.''   By giving States an incentive to provide whole genome sequencing for  eligible children through Medicaid my legislation will ensure that more  children and their families can obtain the right diagnosis and  treatment the start. The Ending the Diagnostic Odyssey Act has the  support of more than 100 patient advocacy organizations, including  Alstrom Syndrome International, the Genetic Alliance, the Personalized  Medicine Coalition, and many others. I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. MANCHIN (for himself and Mrs. Capito):   S. 3147.

This act shall take effect one day after the date of       enactment.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Ending the  Diagnostic Odyssey Act. This legislation gives States the option of  providing whole genome sequencing WSG clinical services through  Medicaid for children with a disease that is suspected to have a  genetic cause, at an enhanced Federal matching rate for 3 years. I am  pleased to be joined by Senators Jones, McSally, and Menendez.   Children with rare diseases will spend on average 5 to 7 years on  diagnostic odyssey, and 30 percent of those children will not survive  beyond the age of 5 years old. The average patient sees seven different  physicians in that time. The wait to find a cause--nevermind a cure-- can be excruciating. Parents try to project a calm and reassuring  presence for their child while facing a whirlwind of doctor  appointments, hospital visits, and unanswered questions.   Undeniably, we are making progress in both accelerating research  funding for rare diseases as well as in the development of diagnostics.  In 2014, the National Institutes of Health, NIH launched a program  called the Undiagnosed Disease Network UDN. In its first 20 months, the  UDN accepted 601 participants undiagnosed by traditional medical  practices. Of those who completed their UDN evaluation during this  time, 35 percent were given a diagnosis. Many of these diagnoses were  rare genetic diseases, including 31 previously unknown syndromes.   In May, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr.  Francis Collins, wrote a blog post on how whole genome sequencing-- combined with artificial intelligence, AI--can now be used to diagnose  genetic diseases in seriously ill babies in fewer than 24 hours. Dr.  Collins writes: ``I would submit that there is no other technology in  the history of planet Earth that has experienced this degree of  progress in speed and affordability.''   For parents of children with an undiagnosed illness, answers cannot  come soon enough. There are approximately 7,000 rare diseases known  today. Approximately 80 percent of rare diseases are genetic, and about  one-half of all rare diseases affect children. For example, Alstrom  syndrome is an extremely rare and complex genetic disorder.  Approximately 1,200 affected individuals have been identified  worldwide, which makes a obtaining a correct diagnosis challenging.  Characteristics of Alstrom syndrome include vision disturbances,  sensorineural hearing impairment, cardiomyopathy, obesity, kidney  dysfunction, and diabetes.   Robin Marshall, executive director of the Alstrom Syndrome  International, located in Mount Desert Islanas, ME, has said that  ``whole Genome Sequencing has changed the lives of those we represent  by enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis, fostering more timely  and appropriate medical care, and unlocking a host of social services  to combat the educational and psycho-social complications that our  children confront.''   By giving States an incentive to provide whole genome sequencing for  eligible children through Medicaid my legislation will ensure that more  children and their families can obtain the right diagnosis and  treatment the start. The Ending the Diagnostic Odyssey Act has the  support of more than 100 patient advocacy organizations, including  Alstrom Syndrome International, the Genetic Alliance, the Personalized  Medicine Coalition, and many others. I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation.                                  ______    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to Executive Session for the en bloc consideration of the  following nominations: Executive calendar 518, 519, 520, 521, 522, 523,  524, 525, 526, 527, 528, 529, and 411.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  nominations en bloc.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the  nominations en bloc with no intervening action or debate; that if  confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table en bloc; the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action, that no further motions be in order, and that any  statements relating to the nominations be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that nomination  525 be removed from the list.    Mr. President, I send a list of nominations to the desk  and ask that they be kept in status quo despite the sine die  adjournment of the 1st session of the 116th Congress.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 286, S. 1608.    I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported  substitute be agreed to and the bill, as amended, be considered read a  third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill, as amended.    I ask unanimous consent that the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the senior  Senator from North Dakota be authorized to sign duly enrolled bills or  joint resolutions during today's session of the Senate.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:37 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, December 23, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
