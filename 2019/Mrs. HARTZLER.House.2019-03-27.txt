 Madam Chair, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 7. It  is a deeply flawed bill that offers false promises while empowering  lawyers and bureaucracy, not empowering women.   In fact, I agree with my colleague from Wyoming who said a minute ago  it should not be called the Paycheck Fairness Act; it should be called  the pay the trial lawyers act.   If there exists residual bias and discrimination against women in the  workplace, it is wrong, and it needs to end. Since 1963, equal pay for  equal work has been the law of the land under the Equal Pay Act.   Let me say that again. Since 1963, equal pay for equal work has been  the law of the land. It is currently illegal for employers to pay  different wages based on gender, and as the bill sponsor just said,  there are currently mechanisms to address any wrongs that may be there.   While I appreciate the sentiment of the bill before us, I cannot  support its flawed approach. The pay the trial lawyers act does not  build on the Equal Pay Act. It does not offer women new protections  against discrimination in the workplace. Instead, it encourages  lawsuits against employers by offering the prospect of unlimited  monetary damages.   The pay the trial lawyers act also creates an impossibly high burden  of proof for job creators defending themselves in lawsuits.   Furthermore, the pay the trial lawyers act handicaps job creators,  including women-owned businesses, by adding onerous compensation  reporting requirements. The Federal bureaucracy will heap yet another  burden on hardworking Americans if this passes.   So, Madam Chair, the pay the trial lawyers act does not build on the  Equal Pay Act's success. Instead, it encourages lawsuits, hurts job  creators, and empowers lawyers. Sadly, it also misses an opportunity to  truly help women.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this  deeply flawed bill.
