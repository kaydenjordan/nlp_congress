 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentlewoman for yielding. I have to say that the working people of not  just Ohio but this country are very lucky to have Marcy Kaptur fighting  for them and for her years of service. There is not a more passionate  champion for working Americans in this House than the gentlewoman from  Ohio.   Mr. Speaker, I come here not with a prepared text, but really to  speak from my heart. As the son of two hardworking parents who were  working in industries that were supported by organized labor, and it  depresses me to see the great decline in our workforce today that is in  a union.   Now, the subject that we are speaking about tonight is about the  trade deficit, and I just started talking about unions. To some that  might seem as if I am off topic, but there is no question the two are  absolutely related.                                time  1745    Mr. Speaker, I want to correct a fallacy that sometimes is out there  about those of us who may be critical about NAFTA and other trade  deals. I am not antitrade. I recognize that the United States of  America, despite being a large country of over 320 million people, we  are only 5 percent of the world's population. We must engage in trade  with the rest of the world. I also look at those economic statistics  that tell us, without question, the most productive workforce in the  world today is the American worker.   So if the grounds of trade are fair and if the rules of the game are  fair, we can compete with anyone. Our workers can compete and  outcompete anyone in the world. But, Mr. Speaker, they have not been  fighting on a fair playing field.   Now, let's not forget that over the last 20 to 23 years or so since  NAFTA was passed, that happens to also coincide with this point in  American history in which most wages have been stagnant. Indeed, for  middle class people and lower middle class folks, their real wages have  declined, not to mention the most lower income quintile, which has seen  a dramatic drop in real wages.   I think that it would be unfair for any of us to say that this is  because of NAFTA or that this is because of any specific trade deal.  But it is also very fair for us to point out that none of these trade  deals did anything to raise the living standards and wages of American  workers. Here we are in an environment in Congress in which, recently,  we were talking about the TPP and moving forward with other trade deals  and talking about nothing really to raise wages and living standards  for our own workers here at home.   Look at the example of NAFTA, something that was promised to raise  wage standards in Mexico, that we would benefit from having on our  [[Page H2683]]  southern border a country with a rising middle class population. There  is no question that would be in the best interest of the United States  and, obviously, in the best interest of Mexico.   However, Mr. Speaker, here we are in the last few years with more  jobs going to Mexico, including the closing of the Nabisco plant in my  district that I stood on the well of the House floor and protested  against. It goes to a nice new facility in Monterrey, Mexico. Is that  helping to raise wages in Mexico? Actually, wages are lower today in  Mexico than they were 3 years ago. That is an economic fact.   Under the letter of the law of NAFTA, that is something that our  administration could take up with our Mexican counterparts, but they  don't. Instead, we see Nabisco. And I am taking one specific example  because it affected my district. We see them closing a plant that had  existed in Philadelphia since before my parents were born lay off 325  workers, lay off double that in Chicago, and move to Monterrey, Mexico,  which they can do in accordance with NAFTA.   If we are going to move forward with new trade deals, which  inevitably at some point in years moving forward we will, I would  simply ask--and strongly suggest--that we look out not just for the  corporate interest, not just for what is in the best interest of  consumers, but also what is in the best interest of American workers.   We should not be surprised that we see this tumult in the United  States politically at the same time that we are seeing stagnant wages  and stagnant benefits for decades. Those two are inextricably linked.   Mr. Speaker, finally, let me say to all those who are interested in  working on this trade issue on both sides of the aisle: You have  committed and passionate public servants on this side of the aisle who  want to get it right, who want to ensure that we finally have trade  deals that put American workers first and foremost.
