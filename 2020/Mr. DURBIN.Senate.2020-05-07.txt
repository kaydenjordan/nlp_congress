 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, we live in a dangerous world, and this  morning we were reminded as the Republican leader came to the floor and  spoke about foreign policy. Later on today, we will address the issue  of a veto override on the War Powers Act, a measure which I  cosponsored.   It may surprise some people that we are in the area of foreign policy  on our Senate agenda this week, because in this dangerous world that we  live in, we all know that the first thing we look for is the danger at  the doorstep.   Our danger, of course, is a national emergency, as President Trump  has characterized it, a public health crisis--the COVID-19 coronavirus  threat to the United States and all of our families.   Many of us who came back to Washington this week were wary because we  had been warned to stay in our homes as long as possible, to stay out  of circulation, and not to gather in workplaces unless absolutely  necessary. All of us thought if we were going to return, we hoped the  priority would be this looming crisis in America, this public health  crisis. But, sadly, as we bring this week's legislative activity to a  close, little, if anything, has been said or done on the Senate floor  or in committee to address the issue at the moment.   What are we going to do to protect Americans and their families?   Senator McConnell brought us back for a hearing for one of his  favorite judges--a Federal judge in Kentucky, a young man who was an  intern in his office and whom he is now trying to promote to the second  highest court in the land.   In the ordinary course of Senate business, this would not be unusual.  It might have drawn some attention because of the qualifications of  this individual, but attention has been given to it as people compare  it to the real issues that we should be facing.   When you think about the issues before us, one of them is very  imminent. Across the street from the U.S. Senate is the Supreme Court  building. Pending before the Supreme Court at this moment is a lawsuit  brought by President Trump and Republican attorneys general from across  the United States to abolish the Affordable Care Act--to abolish an  Affordable Care Act that provides health insurance for 20 million  Americans and also provides protections in the health insurance  policies for another 135 million Americans--a law which basically says  if you have a preexisting condition, you can't be denied insurance  coverage.   At this moment in our history, at this moment as we face this health  crisis, it is unimaginable that the Republican position is to eliminate  health insurance protection for 20 million Americans and to lessen the  protections in health insurance policies for 135 million more. So far,  1.2 million Americans have been diagnosed as infected with the COVID-19  virus. Sadly, some 70,000 Americans have died. What is going to happen  in the days and months and years ahead if the Republicans have their  way and if preexisting conditions return to health insurance? Will  there be a day when you or your spouse or your parent or your children  will be asked if you were ever diagnosed positive for COVID-19? Will  this be a disqualification in the future if we don't have the  protection when it comes to preexisting conditions? That is not out of  the realm of possibility.    How can the Republicans be thinking that this is the right moment in  history to abolish the Affordable Care Act and the health insurance  that 20 million Americans count on and 135 million Americans who have  their own health insurance plans take advantage of? It is exactly the  wrong moment.   There was an effort to abolish this Affordable Care Act--they like to  call it ObamaCare--on the floor of the Senate in the last 2 years. I  still remember the moment when Senator John McCain, the late Senator  from Arizona, came to the floor in the early morning hours and gave the  motion for a ``no'' vote, and that was the end of the story. The  Republican abolition effort ended with that vote. You would think they  learned their lesson.   Senator McCain and other Republicans said: We cannot eliminate this  unless we have something better to replace it with.   They didn't then. They don't now.   Attorney General Barr warned the Trump White House not to go forward  with this lawsuit pending in the Supreme Court. He understood that it  was unwise not only from a policy viewpoint, but it was unwise  politically.   Imagine, if you will, in the weeks and months ahead, should this  Court, this Roberts Court, decide to abolish the Affordable Care Act in  the midst of this public health crisis--I can't think of anything more  catastrophic when it comes to these 20 million families and their  health insurance protection and the 100 million-plus who count on this  protection against discrimination for preexisting conditions.   That is the reality we face, but it is not the only reality. A  decision was made this week that is almost impossible to understand.  There was a telephone conference call involving leaders from all around  the world. These leaders came together to discuss something that we are  all praying for--the discovery of a vaccine that will protect us from  this coronavirus. They wanted money pledged, some $8 billion. Norway  pledged $1 billion. The European Union pledged $1 billion. When they  went around the table, there was a chair that was empty. The United  States of America wasn't at the conference. The President made a  conscious decision that we would not engage in this conversation about  the discovery of a lifesaving vaccine. Why? What was he possibly  thinking?   This notion of America first, which we hear over and over again, has  some value, of course, but when it comes to a global pandemic, when it  comes to a global challenge, when it comes to the fact that over 90  countries around the world are searching for that vaccine, when it  comes to the fact that most of us don't really care where it is found  as long as it is found and the sooner the better and that we have  access to it for Americans as well as everyone else--that is the bottom  line. It isn't about America being first and only when it comes to the  vaccine. Even the Senate Republican leader said this morning that we  can't retreat from the world.   It is so appropriate to have this global vaccine conference. Two  Americans were involved in this conference--in this virtual conference  call--Bill and Melinda Gates. We know his background, his great success  at Microsoft, and his commitment, with his wife, ever since to global  health issues. They were at the table speaking for the United States,  and I want to personally thank them for being there, but we should have  been there as well. The President of the United States should have been  on that conference call. He should have said: The United States is  going to help find this vaccine wherever it is found in the world. We  are going to be at the table when we talk about producing it in  quantities that will make a difference for people living  [[Page S2303]]  everywhere in the world, including the United States, and we are going  to be here as well when we apportion those vaccine doses so we make  certain that Americans have their fair share and that we can protect  our own country.   Do you want to reopen the economy, Mr. President? Do you want to  liberate America from the CDC suggestion that we shelter in place? Do  you want to liberate us truly? Then join in this conference and this  conversation among leaders across the world to find this vaccine.   I hope we can find it in the United States. We have a lot of talented  people searching, but if another country finds it, let's applaud that.  If it is an effective and safe vaccine that protects us, let's applaud  whatever country finds it--including the United States, of course, but  if it is found in another country, we are not going to be part of the  conversation as long as this President folds his arms, juts out his  chin, and says: I am sorry, the WHO--the World Health Organization--is  at the table, and we want no part of them, so we are staying away.   Pride cometh before the fall, Mr. President. You can't expect the  American people to fall with you because of your own source of pride.  We should deal with the reality of what we face in this world.   Let me say a word about the State and local governments because as we  consider the next round of legislation to help this economy, we  certainly want to make certain that unemployment insurance will be  available for the millions of Americans--over 30 million Americans who  are unemployed. The current round of unemployment insurance is set to  expire around July 31. We want to make certain that small businesses  that are receiving forgivable loans so they can be poised and ready to  reopen and go into business, put people back to work--that is supposed  to end around the end of June. I pray that this whole controversy and  this crisis will be behind us by then, but we know better. We know it  will take some time to get the economy back in gear. Let's make sure  that we renew our commitment to the people in this country, the  families in this country, the unemployed in this country, and the small  business owners as well.   But don't forget the others who are counting on us. Don't forget our  first responders. How often have we stood up and responded and praised  police, firefighters, paramedics, medical professionals, and nurses who  stepped up in the midst of this crisis and showed extraordinary  courage, some giving their lives in the process? Well, part of their  future depends on us in the next bill. Are we going to stand up to make  sure that State and local governments, which have been hard hit by this  crisis as well when it comes to their own revenue, will get a helping  hand? God forbid we reach a point where, because of the shortcomings in  the State and local revenue, we have to lay off police, firefighters,  healthcare workers, and teachers. Is that what we want to do in this  moment?    A few weeks ago, when he was asked, Senator McConnell said we should  consider bankruptcy--bankruptcy for State and local governments that  can't pay their bills. What a disaster that would be. You want to see  America cartwheeled into a recession leading to a depression?  Bankruptcies from one end of America to the other by State and local  governments would do just that, and the damage it would do to first  responders who would be laid off as a result of it, the police and the  firefighters and the teachers, is incalculable. We can't let that  happen to America.   A bankrupt America is an America headed for a depression, and when  Senator McConnell suggested that, I thought to myself, he hasn't  thought this through. He cannot be saying that to the teachers of  Kentucky and the police and the firefighters and the medical  professionals who count so much on our support.   At this point, there are things we can do and must do. My checklist  would include hazard pay for those I mentioned, including the  healthcare workers, and most importantly, a dramatic increase in  testing. We have about one-third of the test kits we need to put  America back to work.   We look at situations like the ones facing us in meat-processing  facilities. It has created a real hardship on consumers across America.  But don't forget the producers of livestock in South Dakota and  Illinois and Tennessee. They are producing pork and beef to be headed  to the processing plants, and the plants are closed down. It is a  downturn in demand for sure but also working conditions, which need to  be addressed directly so there is safety in the workplace for all  American workers.   When the Senate Republican leader comes to the floor and talks about  how we don't want anybody held responsible or liable for their conduct  or misconduct during the course of this, I think he is not thinking  through clearly what he is talking about. In this situation, you  certainly wouldn't want to deny to nurses, who were seeking protection  with protective equipment--masks, gloves, and gowns--you wouldn't want  to deny them a day in court, if necessary. You wouldn't want to say to  workers who were in dangerous situations in the workplace that they  can't collect workers' compensation even if they are injured or sick.  But when I hear the Republican leader talk about COVID-19 lawsuits-- both the lawsuits I just described relate to COVID-19, and both call  for simple fairness when it comes to protecting workers and families  over large corporations.   The Senate leader has come to the floor so many times and said that  the real enemy here are the lawyers of America. Really? At this moment  in history, that is the fight we want to pick? It is time for us to  come together, not to make something like that a redline against  continued bipartisan cooperation.   I stand here today in the hopes that we will come back to session--if  we do next week--to truly address the COVID-19 crisis. We have wasted a  week here when it comes to that crisis. We could be doing so much more.   I hope the Senate Republican leader, who sets the agenda for the  Senate, will go home to Kentucky, and as he goes home to Kentucky and  talks to the families there--and I will in Illinois--we will both come  back with the realization that the No. 1 priority in this dangerous  world is the danger at our doorstep. Let's get this under control and  protect the families and individuals across America so that we can  resume the path to greatness this country has been on since the  beginning.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, we are here today to ensure the Senate  fulfills its constitutional duties in having the sole power to send  U.S. troops to war.   Article 1, section 8 of the U.S. Constitution is explicit in saying  the power to declare war is an explicit power of the Congress.   Congress overwhelming reaffirmed this Constitutional provision when  it passed the War Powers law in 1973 over the veto of President Nixon  after the American people were lied to by both political parties about  that war.   Under the law, the President has the authority to approve military  attacks as a response to an imminent threat or with the expressed  authorization of Congress.   Neither of these was the case with President Trump's decision to kill  Iranian General Suleimani in January, a decision that led to a horrific  missile attack on U.S. forces in Iraq and only further added to ongoing  tensions with Iran.   The majority leader has argued that the War Powers law is somehow  only relevant to thousands of troops being deployed to a Vietnam type  situation, not a military action the President argues is simply a  deterrence.   Well, that is a dangerous rationale argument and exactly what this  law had in mind, the reckless or creeping escalation to war without the  authorization of Congress.   In fact, the recent briefing by the administration on Iran was filled  with  [[Page S2312]]  echoes of the Gulf of Tonkin, vague assertions used to justify stunning  military escalation in Vietnam.   It raised serious concerns about what we are being told about the  justifications for the attack and showed little evidence of an imminent  threat and this from an administration whose President has made more  than 18,000 misleading or false statements already.   Certainly nothing in the briefings offered the Senate convinced me  that the administration even thinks it needs congressional  authorization for taking escalatory actions.   That is why I joined Senator Kaine in invoking the War Powers Act.  This Senate should not allow the county to led into another Middle East  war without its consent.   And the Constitution is clear on this; Article I section 8 states  that the power to declare war is an explicit power of the Congress--as  it should be, one should never send our sons and daughters into war  without the consent of the people.   I have made this same argument regardless of who was in the White  House, Republican or Democrat.   I urge my colleagues to join us in reaffirming this body's  constitutional role in matters of war by overriding the President's  veto.    I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Brown), the  Senator from Washington (Mrs. Murray), the Senator from Vermont (Mr.  Sanders), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz), and the Senator from  Michigan (Ms. Stabenow) are necessarily absent.   The result was announced--yeas 49, nays 44, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 84 Leg.]                                  YEAS--49       Alexander      Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Cassidy      Collins      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Harris      Hassan      Heinrich      Hirono      Jones      Kaine      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lee      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murkowski      Murphy      Paul      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Tester      Udall      Van Hollen      Warner      Warren      Whitehouse      Wyden      Young                                  NAYS--44       Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Capito      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Enzi      Ernst      Fischer      Gardner      Graham      Grassley      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Loeffler      McConnell      McSally      Perdue      Portman      Risch      Roberts      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Sullivan      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Wicker                               NOT VOTING--7       Brown      Burr      Moran      Murray      Sanders      Schatz      Stabenow
