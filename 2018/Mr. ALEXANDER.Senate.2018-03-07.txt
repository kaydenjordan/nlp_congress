 Thank you, Madam President.   (The remarks of Mr. Alexander pertaining to the introduction of S.  2509 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced  Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, probably every single one of us in the  Senate would agree that it is hard to get here, it is hard to stay  here, and it is wonderful to be able to accomplish something worthwhile  while you are here. That is why I am here today--because I want to call  attention to an announcement that was made this morning by a bipartisan  group of U.S. Senators and the Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke,  which could take away  [[Page S1455]]  the $11.6 billion of national park maintenance backlog in the 417  national parks that we have. The proposal we made this morning could  eliminate that backlog over the next 10 years.   I want to give Secretary Zinke and the President a lot of credit for  this because they have agreed to do something that no other President  and no other Secretary of the Interior have ever agreed to do, as far  as I know, and that is to allow us to use revenues from energy  development on Federal lands as mandatory spending to pay for the  maintenance backlog in our National Park System.   Ken Burns called our national parks ``America's Best Idea.'' I would  say that the best idea to support America's best idea is the proposal  that Secretary Zinke has made to take care of the maintenance backlog  in our national parks.   Half of that maintenance backlog is our roads. Of course, when we pay  for the roads this way, that means all the money that is now being  taken away from all the other purposes at our national parks--I am  talking about the National Mall, where I get up in the morning and walk  every day, or the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, where I walk  when I go home on the weekends--could be used for other purposes there,  in all 417 of those parks.   If we don't do this, we will never catch up because this backlog-- this $11.6 billion backlog--is four times the annual appropriations for  the National Park Service. Everyone who cares about our national  parks--and that should be almost every American--should welcome this  proposal.   As I said, our use of Federal dollars in this way is unprecedented,  but the principle is not unprecedented. The principle is a very simple  principle, and that is this: If we create an environmental burden,  which energy exploration does, whether it is wind turbines or whether  it is spreading solar panels all over hundreds and hundreds of acres or  whether it is oil and gas exploration. If we create an environmental  burden, we should create a corresponding environmental benefit. That  principle is well established in our laws and has been supported by  almost every major environmental and conservation group I know of.   Let's start with the 1962 Outdoor Recreation Resources Review  Commission that Laurance Rockefeller chaired. That Commission, which  took a look at America for the next generation to see what we should do  to protect the outdoors so we could all enjoy it, recommended, and the  Congress adopted, the idea of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.  There was a Federal side and a State side. Over all of the years since  1964, $18 billion has been spent in the Land and Water Conservation  Fund. That is the environmental benefit. Where did the money come from?  It came from drilling on Federal offshore properties.   In 1986, I chaired President Reagan's Commission on Americans  Outdoors. We reaffirmed our support for the idea that an environmental  burden means we should have an environmental benefit. We urged Congress  to make permanent the funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund.  So we reaffirmed that again for the next generation.   Then, in 2006, with the leadership of Senator Domenici, Senator  Bingaman, and others--many of us worked on it--Congress decided we  would take some of the revenues from new drilling in the Gulf of Mexico  and apply those to the State side of the Land and Water Conservation  Fund--again, an environmental burden and a corresponding environmental  benefit.   That is why this proposal is so exciting to me. That is why this  proposal has such strong bipartisan support.   In the Senate, the supporters include Senator King of Maine, Senator  Daines of Montana, and Senator Heinrich of New Mexico. It is a  bipartisan group. Supporters also include Senator Capito and Senator  Manchin, Senator Gardner and Senator Tillis; all of us support and are  cosponsoring this legislation we are introducing today.   In the House of Representatives, we also have two cosponsors.  Congressman Mike Simpson of Idaho, who is chairman of the House Energy  and Water Development Subcommittee, and Congressman Kurt Schrader from  Oregon is also a cosponsor in the House of Representatives.   So I believe this is an unprecedented day; for all of those who care  about and love our national parks and who have struggled to imagine how  we can deal with this $11.6 billion maintenance backlog--a backlog that  is four times the annual appropriation--we can pay this all off with  this proposal, which is supported by the President and his Office of  Management and Budget, a bipartisan group of Senators, and a bipartisan  group in the House.   I look forward to working with Senator Murkowski and Senator Cantwell  in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Hopefully, it can be  moved promptly through that committee. There are other important things  we would like to do, but I can't think of anything much more important  than our National Park System.   I mentioned a little earlier that we have 417 national parks in the  country. I grew up camping and hiking in one of those, and I live  within 2 miles of that park. It is the Great Smoky Mountains National  Park. It has more visitors than any other national park--nearly twice  as many as the closest one. Eleven million people a year come to the  park.   Many of my best memories are from that park. I remember, when I was  15 years old, my dad dropped me and a couple of other boys at the  highest point of the park, Clingmans Dome, one day around  Christmastime. There was 3 feet of snow. He said: I will pick you up in  Gatlinburg. Well, he did, and that was about 8 or 9 hours later.   Later that same year in the summertime we were camping on Spence  Field. That is at about 5,000 or 6,000 feet as well. We had taken  blueberry pancake mix up there. We picked the blueberries. We had all  of the materials for a good breakfast, but we made one mistake. We left  the breakfast in our packs in the tent, and during the night a bear  crawled in there with us, took it out, and we ended up on top of the  trail shelter banging the pans together trying to run the bear off.  That was the last time we left our breakfast materials nearby the  sleeping area when we were camping in the park.   The park is a good place for lessons and learning and appreciating  beauty. It is a good place for the rich. It is a good place for the  poor. Parents bring their children out of a digital diet to feast on a  world of natural splendor. We learn our history in a place where  history comes alive; not just the history of the world but the history  of East Tennessee, the history of Wyoming, the history of Maine, the  history of Montana.   Let me give my colleagues a sense of just what this $11 billion  backlog means. I have already said it is nearly four times what the  National Park Service receives in annual appropriations. We can talk  about the Smokies alone. Between Tennessee and North Carolina, there is  about a $215 million backlog of projects; 75 percent of that is roads.  We get nearly twice as many visitors as any other park. These visitors  come to see our majestic views. They spend 400,000 nights camping in 9  frontcountry campgrounds and 100 backcountry camp sites.   In 2013, the park had to close Look Rock Campground and the picnic  area due to funding shortfalls in replacing the water treatment  facilities. In order to open this recreation area for visitors, the  park needs $3 million to replace the water treatment facility, repair  the road infrastructure, and replace aging picnic tables and campground  pads. This proposal could do that.   The funding provided in the National Park Restoration Act, which is  what we call our legislation, could help reopen this campground for the  enjoyment of the over 11 million visitors to the Smokies.   The Smokies also supports a vast trail system, with almost 850 miles  of maintained trails for hikers, backpackers, and visitors. The current  deferred maintenance backlog for trails in the Smokies is $18.5  million. This proposal would take care of that.   In August 2017, I visited the Smokies with Interior Secretary Ryan  Zinke, and I saw firsthand with him the work that is needed on the  trails. We hiked the Rainbow Falls Trail, where a 2-year project is  underway to rehabilitate the trail.   Crews from Trails Forever, a partnership between the Great Smoky  Mountains National Park and the Friends of  [[Page S1456]]  the Smokies, and the American Conservation Experience are working to  build a rock staircase along the trail to reduce erosion and improve  visitor safety and enjoyment.   Crews use rigging systems to move large rocks, split them using  drills and chisels, and then set them into place to provide long- lasting trail structures for those hoping to see the rainbow formed by  mist from the 80-foot waterfall along the Rainbow Falls Trail.   Secretary Zinke and I worked to split and place one of those rock  steps. It is not very easy to do. Volunteer crews will work to  rehabilitate over 6 miles of that trail.   In addition to the crews, every Wednesday volunteers head up the  trail to help restore it for future visitors. In 2017, volunteers  donated 900 hours of work on that trail.   The Smokies is full of wonderful volunteers like those working on the  Rainbow Falls Trail. Over 2,800 volunteers donated over 115,000 hours  last year alone, but we must do more to get the funding to our parks to  help address the maintenance needs and support the countless  volunteers.   In the Smokies, 75 percent of that maintenance work is roads, which  isn't surprising, since millions of visitors to the park each year  experience it behind the wheel. The park maintains and operates nearly  400 miles of roads, including 6 tunnels and 146 bridges, which allow  visitors to traverse the park's mountainous landscape.   The Smokies is working hard to address these maintenance needs, and  later this year they will open 16 miles of the Foothills Parkway. We  are all looking forward to that in East Tennessee. Driving the  Foothills Parkway will give you a spectacular view of the highest  mountains in the Eastern United States. Tennesseans are excited that  these new 16 miles of the parkway will soon be open to the public. It  is scheduled for this fall.   Due to funding shortfalls, building and repairing the 16-mile stretch  of the Foothills Parkway took over 50 years and will be completed  nearly 75 years after Congress first authorized the Foothills Parkway.  Completing just 1.6 miles of the parkway took nearly 30 years.   In 1944, Congress authorized the Foothills Parkway but prohibited  Federal funds from being used to purchase and acquire the land, so the  State of Tennessee purchased the land and gave it to the Federal  Government to create a scenic parkway to provide views of the Great  Smoky Mountains National Park.   For 75 years, Tennesseans and visitors have been waiting to enjoy the  majestic views of the Foothills Parkway because there hasn't been  sufficient Federal funding to address the maintenance needs of our  national parks. Other roadways in the Smokies, including Newfound Gap  Road and Clingmans Dome Road, remain on this backlog list.   Clingmans Dome Road takes visitors to Clingmans Dome--the highest  point in Tennessee and the third highest mountain east of the  Mississippi. At 6,643 feet, Clingmans Dome offers panoramic views of  the Smoky Mountains.   Additional funding is desperately needed for the Smokies and all of  our National Parks to help repair and rebuild campgrounds, trails, and  roads. Doing that will bring more visitors, more tourists, and more  jobs to Tennessee and to national park communities throughout our  country.   According to the Outdoor Industry Association, the outdoor recreation  economy generates 7.6 million direct jobs and $887 billion in consumer  spending. In Tennessee, the outdoor recreation economy generates  188,000 direct jobs and over $21 billion in consumer spending.   In 2016, the visitors to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park  alone spent nearly $950 million in communities surrounding the park.  The over 11 million visitors to the park supported nearly 15,000 jobs  and $1.3 billion in economic output in these communities.   Restoring our parks not only helps to preserve our land for  generations but helps to grow our economy.   Now, here is what our bill does. I see the Senator from North  Carolina is coming to preside, and he is one of the principal  cosponsors of the bill. The National Park Restoration Act will use  revenues from energy production on Federal lands to help pay for the  $11 billion maintenance backlog at our national parks. It will provide  mandatory funding on top of annual appropriations for the National Park  Service--for the priority-deferred maintenance needs that support  critical infrastructure and visitor services at our parks.   The National Park Restoration Fund created by the legislation will  receive 50 percent of revenues from energy production on Federal lands  over the 2018 projections that are not already allocated to other  purposes.   This legislation includes revenues from all sources of energy  production on Federal land: oil, gas, coal, renewables, and alternative  energy.   The legislation protects all existing obligations for revenues from  energy production on Federal land, including payments to States,  payments to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and payments to the  Reclamation Fund.   Finally, I want to acknowledge the work that Senators Portman and  Warner have done. They have introduced similar legislation. They have  many of the same objectives. I know there are many other Senators who  care deeply about this issue, other than the bipartisan group of us who  introduced the legislation today. We can all work together in the  Energy and Natural Resources Committee where this bill will be  referred. We will put our heads together with Senator Murkowski and  Senator Cantwell. We will come out with the best possible bill-- something that President Trump can continue to support and that the  full Senate and then the House of Representatives can pass. Then, we  can get on with it and begin to deal with the deferred maintenance  backlog in our national parks.   Theodore Roosevelt once said that nothing short of defending this  country in wartime ``compares in importance with the great central task  of leaving this land even a better land for our descendants than it is  for us.'' We must all work together to restore our national treasures  so future generations have the same opportunity to enjoy them, as we  have.   In conclusion, let me reiterate something personal about this. In  1985, the Secretary of the Interior called and asked me, when I was  Governor of Tennessee, to chair the President's Commission on Americans  Outdoors. I did that, along with Gil Grosvenor, the chairman of the  National Geographic Society, and a variety of people. One of our major  recommendations was to pick up the recommendation of the Rockefeller  Commission from 1964, which said, if there is an environmental burden,  there should be an environmental benefit. They are the ones who  recommended, to begin with, that we take land from energy exploration  and use it to pay for the Land and Water Conservation Fund.   We reaffirmed that in 1986. We reaffirmed that principle in 2006 when  we used revenues from drilling for the State side of the Land and Water  Conservation Fund.   So while this proposal is unprecedented in the sense that it is the  first time that I know of that a President and his Office of Management  and Budget have approved mandatory funding using revenues from energy  production on Federal lands to deal with national park maintenance  needs, the principle of matching an environmental burden with an  environmental benefit is well established.   I am grateful to the President, and I am especially grateful to  Secretary Zinke for his initiative. I look forward to working with a  bipartisan group of Senators in the Energy Committee to develop a bill,  pass it, and get started on the work of America's best idea for  restoring America's best idea--our National Park System.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Brown):   S. 2518. A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, to improve  protections for employees and retirees in business bankruptcies; to the  Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, probably every single one of us in the  Senate would agree that it is hard to get here, it is hard to stay  here, and it is wonderful to be able to accomplish something worthwhile  while you are here.
