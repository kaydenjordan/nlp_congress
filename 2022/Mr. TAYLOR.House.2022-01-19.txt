 Madam Speaker, today I rise to stand in solidarity with  the many Americans, including my own constituents from Texas' Third  Congressional District, who are here at our Nation's Capital to march  for the right to life.   As a father of three wonderful daughters, I know how precious every  stage of life is, and I believe it should be protected at every stage.   Every year, I am awed by the outpouring of love and passion so many  Texans show by traveling to Washington and voicing their support for  sanctity of life. Even more travel to our state capital in Austin to  advance the cause in our local communities.   Your engagement is humbling, and it gives me faith that we can become  the pro-life generation.   I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the pro-life and faith  leaders here in our Nation's Capital and join in fighting to protect  innocent human life.                            ____________________
