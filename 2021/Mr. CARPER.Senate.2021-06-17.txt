 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Thank you, Madam President. I hope you are well today.  Good to see you and our staff.   I rise this morning to applaud the nomination of COL John Tien. He  has been selected by our President to serve as the Deputy Secretary of  the Department of Homeland Security, a very big job and an important  job.   I have the honor of currently serving as the senior member and former  chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs, which is responsible for, among other things, overseeing the  operations of the Department of Homeland Security.
