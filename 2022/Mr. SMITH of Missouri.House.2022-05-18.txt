 Mr. Speaker, for the millions of Americans  struggling under skyrocketing prices, President Biden's attention to  this issue is a day late and many dollars short.   For the first year in office, he denied inflation existed and then  dismissed it as transitory. Now, he is blaming Putin, even though  inflation was already at 7\1/2\ percent before Putin's army invaded  Ukraine.   It took President Biden almost a year to speak up because he doesn't  see inflation as a threat to families. He sees it as a threat to his  political problems and his political party's problems.   Since Joe Biden became President, inflation has risen 11 percent; gas  prices are at an all-time high; real wages have gone down 2.6 percent;  and our economy is shrinking. This is the result of the President's  policies: high prices for food and energy, lower wages, and now a baby  formula shortage.   Americans are hurting, and the President's policies are making it  worse.                            ____________________
