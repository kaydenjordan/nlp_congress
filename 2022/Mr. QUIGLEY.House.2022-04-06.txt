 Madam Speaker, this weekend, the world watched in horror  as the retreat of Russian forces from  [[Page H4194]]  the town of Bucha revealed the scope of the appalling war crimes  committed by Vladimir Putin's military.   Journalists and the Ukrainian military discovered mass graves, bodies  left in the streets, and the evidence of a massacre of civilians. These  are war crimes.   We know now, with certainty, what fate awaits Ukrainians who are  subjected to Russian occupation. The United States must open its doors  to welcome Ukrainians who are fleeing this invasion.   As co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus, early on in the  conflict, I and others called on the Biden administration to extend  temporary protected status to Ukrainians already in the United States.  I was proud when the President heeded that call and when he  subsequently increased the refugee cap.   We must do everything in our power to accept fleeing refugees  expeditiously. This is a matter of life and death. Over 4 million  refugees have already fled the violence in Ukraine. Half of those  refugees are children. Millions more remain trapped in cities and  villages without access to food, clean water, or medical care.   We now know that Putin's military is willing to slaughter any  innocents left behind. It is absolutely critical that the U.S. do  everything in its power to assist the people of Ukraine. This means  military assistance, yes, but it also means providing for Ukrainians  who make the difficult decision to leave their homes behind.   We must support the nations that are already taking in refugees.  Allies, like Poland, have already admitted more than 2 million  Ukrainian refugees into their nation, and we should ensure that Poland  and other countries that have opened their doors are able to help these  Ukrainians resettle safely.   This also means continuing to investigate the reports of refugees of  color being turned away at border crossings. Here in the U.S., we have  a long history as a safe harbor for people of the world.   It has been inspiring to see Americans offer unwavering support for  Ukraine from the outset of the Russian invasion. I am confident that  this support will mean Americans will rally together to support any  Ukrainian refugees who arrive on our shores. As they do, Congress has  an opportunity to reform our immigration system to be more welcoming to  individuals around the world who are in need.   I share the outrage of my constituents who are watching what is  unfolding in Ukraine. As an advocate for Ukrainians here at home and  abroad, I am also reminded that there are other atrocities occurring  around the world. We can, and must, extend the same outrage we have for  the crimes in Bucha to the crimes in Syria, the conflict in Tigray, the  famine in Yemen, and the violence in the Northern Triangle. And just as  we open our doors to Ukrainian refugees, we can, and must, open our  doors to refugees from around the world.   In recent weeks, I have urged the Biden administration to end title  42. This policy allowed the U.S. to use the pandemic as justification  for expelling migrants without a hearing before an immigration judge.  The administration just announced last week that they intend to end  this policy.   One immediate effect will be that Ukrainians arriving at our borders  will be able to seek asylum more easily, but, critically, it also means  that migrants from the global south will no longer be stranded in the  immigration process. The Federal Government should seek out other  avenues in which providing recourse for Ukrainians will make our system  more equitable for all immigrants.   Since the beginning of the pandemic, foreign citizens seeking entry  into the U.S. have faced months-long waits for counselor appointments.  That backlog now threatens to prevent fleeing Ukrainians from reaching  our shores.   The lengthy immigrant visa delays have caused many Ukrainians to turn  to nonimmigrant visas so they can reach temporary safety with family or  friends in the U.S. Yet, as Ukrainians and other foreign citizens have  been increasingly forced to utilize nonimmigrant visas, wait times have  drastically increased.   Reporting last month showed that wait times in Hungary were 275 days.  In Moldova, the wait was 329 days. On February 28, the wait in Warsaw,  Poland, was 86 days. Two days later, the wait was 134 days for visitor  visas and more than 40 days for other types.   I sincerely hope the State Department finds a way to dramatically  decrease processing times for Ukrainians who have fled their homelands,  but we cannot simply prioritize Ukrainian cases and leave all others  behind. These wait times impact immigrants, refugees, and asylum  seekers from around the world. Ukrainians are not the only ones whose  lives are in danger.   The tragedy in Ukraine has shone a bright spotlight on the need for  our entire immigration system to be more inclusive. Congress cannot  allow this moment to pass without finally addressing the flaws in our  system. Too many lives hang in the balance for us to do nothing.                            ____________________
