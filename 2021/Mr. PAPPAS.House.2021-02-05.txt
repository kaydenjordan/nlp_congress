 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Michigan for  yielding and for his work on this critical bipartisan piece of  legislation.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the National Apprenticeship Act  and I urge swift passage of this legislation, which will help open the  doors of economic opportunity to more Americans.   We must work to strengthen and expand apprenticeships to align the  skills of our workers with the needs of our employers and economy. Too  often, however, employers and workers are simply unaware of what is out  there.   I am pleased this legislation includes a provision I introduced that  would create a centralized, one-stop shop where interested parties  would be able  [[Page H426]]  to access information on apprenticeship opportunities so we can best  meet the needs of individuals, employers, educators, and trainers.   I am offering another amendment today that promotes real  demonstration projects to explore new models of programs and that can  result in innovation, including how to adjust programs through the  COVID-19 pandemic for safety reasons.   As we come back from this crisis, new ideas and approaches are so  crucial to our success. Apprenticeships offer an important ladder into  good-paying jobs and lifelong careers, and this legislation will make  them more available and accessible.   Americans are ready, willing, and able to get to work to rebuild our  country, revitalize major trades and industries, and light a path for  the future. It is time we made it a little easier for the American  worker to build their American Dream, and we can do that by passing the  National Apprenticeship Act.   Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will support the amendments in  the underlying bill.
