 Madam Speaker, the Build Back Better Act is an historic  opportunity to reduce our Nation's healthcare costs, increase access to  childcare, support working families, and strengthen our economy.   One item I would like to highlight is a provision to boost regional  innovation. Since the 116th Congress, I have proudly sponsored the  Innovation Centers Acceleration Act, legislation that would invest  significant Federal dollars in our Nation's innovation efforts.   Federal R&D as a percentage of GDP has fallen considerably since the  mid-1960s, harming our productivity and global competitiveness, while  opening the door for China to lead the world in innovation.   I am incredibly proud that this bill includes $3.36 billion to create  the regional innovation clusters envisioned in my proposal. Not only  will this investment enhance our ability to be competitive, but it will  create jobs at a time when they are needed the most.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in proudly supporting and  advancing this historic legislation, and I look forward to its passage.
