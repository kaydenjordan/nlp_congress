 Mr. Speaker, in that we do have other things going on in  this country besides the virus, we do have a crisis up in the Klamath  Basin on the border of California and Oregon right now.   The Klamath farmers up there are the owners of the Klamath Project  water. It was created approximately 100 years ago to allow the ability  to farm crops to returning World War I and World War II veterans at  that point. Those growers owned the right to approximately 350,000  acre-feet from the Upper Klamath Lake, water created by the project  which would not exist without the creation of the project.   This year, after many years of having their water pirated away from  them, their allocation during a lesser water rainfall and snowfall  season was 140,000 acre-feet, they were told on April 1, the second- worst allocation they have ever had, rivaled only by 2001 when they got  zero acre-feet allocated to them. 140,000 acre-feet, they were told.  [[Page H2289]]    So as farmers do--I am a farmer; I get it--we go out and start the  process of planting; tilling the ground; ordering up your fertilizer  and your seed; applying the fertilizer; and then, finally, seeding the  ground.   Well, lo and behold, a few weeks later, it was decided to release  50,000 acre-feet from that lake in order to help suppress a virus  farther down the Klamath River called the C. shasta, which is supposed  to be harmful to the coho salmon, a fish that is deemed endangered on  the Klamath, yet not endangered in other areas of the country.   Right on the heels of the end of that 50,000 acre-foot release for C.  shasta virus for coho salmon, it was decided that there is now not  enough water in the lake. The incoming water supply was misestimated.   They were told they were going to have to cut back from the original  140,000 acre-feet. They were going to cut back approximately 60,000  acre-feet of that, leaving them with about 80,000 acre-feet for the  entire season. This is crops already spent, the cost already incurred  to be put in the ground.   The water supply is estimated to last until approximately June 15.  From June 16 to September, they are going to be in a very dire way.  They are going to be out of water, with the investment in the ground.   As devastating as 2001 was, this will break many farms up in the  Klamath Basin. Unique crops they grow up there--mint, radishes,  potatoes, many others--as well as the refuge that sits at the far end  of that system that needs the water to flow through those irrigation  districts so we will have a duck population, so we will have other  wildlife that is extremely important not only for the area but for the  entire State of California and the West Coast.   This duck population is going to be devastated. Just recently, when  they had good water, they had a huge number of ducks hatch, and we had  a good population. That is going to be devastated.   Farming is the only major economic industry, really, in the region,  other than some tourism. There are about 12,000 farms in that Klamath  Basin. Approximately $75 million has been spent putting those crops in.  It is thought, as it is being estimated right now, the total effect on  the region, if this water is taken away and not restored by somewhere  around June 15, $200 to $300 million more is coming out of that area.  We have created a crisis up there.   This water, by law, belongs to the irrigators, not to the Endangered  Species Act, not to a Federal agency. The irrigators themselves spend  $30 million a year to maintain and operate, if it is actually  operating, the project. They still have to pay that bill.    But the Endangered Species Act is being interpreted to require water  that doesn't belong to the government to be taken and given either to  keep the lake fuller for the sucker fish or run downstream in order to  allegedly help the coho salmon. There are science and arguments out  there that this doesn't help those two species, yet we continue down  this blind path, doing it year after year after year, for least 20  years.   At this point, with the uncertainty of our Nation's food supply, from  the farm gate to the markets, this is what we have going on with  farmers up there, having their property rights taken. We must do  better. We must take immediate action.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  legacy of a good friend and great leader from south Sutter County,  Robert Gallagher.   Born and raised in Rio Oso, California, Bob spent his life dedicated  to family, farming, and service to his country.   After serving in the Army Air Corps during World War II, Bob returned  home to the family farm, which has been owned and operated by the  Gallagher family for the last seven generations. There, he and his wife  of 53 years, Marian, raised their seven children. Indeed, they have a  very large, proud Irish family.   When he was not with his family, Bob served as a Sutter County  supervisor, and was chairman of the board. And this is a legacy that  has been passed down to his grandson, James, who also served as a  Sutter County supervisor, and indeed has gone on to serve in the  California legislature.   Now, Bob was always a fun guy, and a guy I enjoyed meeting up with  every time I had a chance to be in Sutter County. He would be known for  a quip like--really helpful to politicians--``Don't put your mouth in  gear before you put your brain in gear,'' which is something that can  be very helpful in a lot of venues.   He had a passion for family, for baseball, and treating people well.  That is his legacy. We will miss him. What a dear man and a dear  friend. God bless him and his family.                            ____________________
