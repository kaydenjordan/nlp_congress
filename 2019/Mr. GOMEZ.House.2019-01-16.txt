 Madam Speaker, I rise today on the 116th anniversary of  Korean American Day, which recognizes the first wave of Korean  immigrants who arrived to the United States on January 13, 1903.   They reached our country in pursuit of the American Dream, determined  to secure a better life for themselves and their families.   They served as farm workers, wage laborers, and section hands, laying  the groundwork for the success of their children and future generations  to come.   Today, our Nation is home to nearly 2 million Korean Americans who  enrich every aspect of American life. They embody the ideals that  define our country: hard work, resilience, and community spirit.   I am proud to represent the largest Korean population in the country  in California's 34th Congressional District, and I am honored to  reintroduce this resolution in the 116th Congress, recognizing their  contribution 116 years after their arrival.   Please join me in acknowledging the generation of Korean Americans-- the dreamers, the trailblazers, and the visionaries--who have realized  the American Dream and continue to inspire us all.                            ____________________
