 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Louisiana for hosting this Special Order tonight.   As we celebrate National Police Week, I would like to also add my  voice to recognizing the brave men and women who put their lives on the  line to keep our communities safe across California's 39th District and  beyond. We also honor those who have paid the ultimate price in the  line of duty.   I am proud to support our law enforcement and their important hard  work that they do each and every day. From Captain Steven Tousey and  Deputy Louis Denver with the Walnut Diamond Bar Sheriff's Station in  Los Angeles County, who I rode along with, by the way, last week, to  Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes and their hardworking team, I am  always talking to our law enforcement across Los Angeles, Orange, and  San Bernardino Counties about how I can help make sure that they have  the support and resources needed to perform their demanding jobs and to  learn how I, in Congress, can support our police officers.   I would also like to recognize the men and women of our Capitol  Police here in Congress who put their lives on the line to protect not  only the Members of Congress but our staffs and all the House staff  behind the scenes who make this place run. We are so grateful for you  and appreciate each and every one of you.   This National Police Week, I encourage all of us to take the time to  thank a police officer in your area. It is because of our police  officers that we can live our daily lives each and every day knowing  that we are kept safe.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be standing here and back the blue.
