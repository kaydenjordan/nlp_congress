 Madam Speaker, I thank my brother for yielding.   Madam Speaker,   John Larson and I came into the Congress together,  elected in 1998 to be here. But I want you to know, John, that I have  been working on issues of Social Security since the 1970s--well before  I was eligible for Social Security.   When I was an organizer in Chicago, one of my first organizing  efforts was to help establish Metro Seniors in Action, an organization  in the city of Chicago of older Americans. I will tell you what, John,  I learned a lot from them. One of them was courage to stand up to  power, to not be afraid of the old Mayor Daley in Chicago, not to be  afraid of anyone, to stand up for rights. One of those priorities then,  as well, was making sure that Social Security was solid.   Now that you have talked about the Alliance for Retired Americans, I  was the executive director of the chapter of that in the State of  Illinois throughout most of the 1980s until I ran for the legislature  in 1990. And again, we were fighting--I remember well--to protect  Social Security.   Well, guess what? Now, we are not just talking about protecting  Social Security, but we did have a battle when George W. Bush decided  that he thought privatizing Social Security was a good idea. Well, all  over the country we organized, seniors organized, the Democrats  organized, to make sure that privatizing Social Security, which would  have jeopardized the security of that benefit--and actually, let me  correct that for a minute.   You know, many people call Social Security an entitlement. This is  something that people in every paycheck that they have had is paid for.  This is a program that is paid for out of the pocket of workers and has  to be there when they retire. This is not some sort of a gift from the  American people. This is something that has been earned by the American  people.   But we won that battle with George W. Bush because that was not the  direction that the majority of Americans--Democrats, Republicans,  rural, urban--wanted. They wanted to make sure that Social Security was  reliably there. But it was always to protect Social Security. And now,  thank you,   John Larson, because now we are talking about improving  Social Security benefits. And isn't it about time?   Right now, the majority of Americans get more than half of their  income from Social Security. When Franklin D. Roosevelt first talked  about Social Security, it was thought of as a three-legged stool.   Did you talk about that already?    Okay. So the first was people's savings. You know  what? There is hardly any savings anymore for the elderly. And  actually, for most Americans, hardly have any money, unfortunately,  that has been put away, because average wages, compared to the  wealthiest people, have gone down.   The second was pensions. Remember that? There were pensions. People  would have that guaranteed retirement benefit from the work. Those are  largely gone. And then, Social Security to help along. Well, now it is  mostly about Social Security. More than half  [[Page H7622]]  of Americans rely on Social Security for more than half of their  income. And a quarter of seniors now rely on Social Security for 90  percent or more of their income. You need Social Security to survive.   But let's talk about what survival is. The average monthly Social  Security check is $1,543 per month. Who can live on that? I mean, it is  really a struggle, at the very best, to be able to even make it. That  is it--$1,543 a month.   So the gentleman's legislation is so incredibly important. And you  talked about grandparents. Well, you know, plenty of us in the Congress  now are also Social Security-eligible. And those who are not, are  thinking about their parents and loved ones. But I also want to point  out that two of my grandchildren benefited from Social Security  because, sadly, their mother had died. And so they were eligible for  benefits that helped them to be able to continue with their education.   So it is a family plan. Social Security is a necessity. And for a  long time we have also been talking about women, particularly women,  people who have left the workforce to become caregivers. But there has  been no help for them, even though they haven't been able to pay into  Social Security.                                time  1700    I now understand that there will be a provision for a caregiver  credit?    I thank so much; for people who have taken time out  of the workplace. Many of us have heard from public employees,  including school teachers, who have lost Social Security benefits due  to the so-called windfall elimination provision that has meant unfairly  that they have lost Social Security benefits.   Finally, after years and years and years of fighting, that unfairness  will be gone because of your legislation.    Madam Speaker, let me just close with this. We are  going to hear, oh, well, you know, too much money. We can't afford to  increase the benefits. I think it is important to remind people that  Social Security was born during the greatest depression that this  country had ever seen.   It was from the understanding of the President at that time,  President Roosevelt, who understood that we cannot have poorhouses for  older Americans. That this country, if we can't afford to do that, then  we cannot call ourselves a real democracy, a country that really cares  for people.   At this point we are the richest country in the world; the richest  country ever on the planet. Now is the time when we need to do this.  There is absolutely no excuse. You have said about the urgency of now.  This is a moment of opportunity, and we should not make the mistake of  overlooking it.   We have got everything in place. We have got your bill. We have got a  President. It is time now to engage everyone in this country to say  yes. Let's make improvements to one of the greatest things that ever  happened in the United States, the greatest treasures that we have, and  that is Social Security.   Let's make it even better. God bless you for leading the way on this.  I am so proud to be helpful in any way that I can to be a partner with  you. We can do this.
