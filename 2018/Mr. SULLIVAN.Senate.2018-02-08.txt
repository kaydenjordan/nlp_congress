 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a  colloquy with my colleagues Senator Casey and Senator Wicker.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.  [[Page S802]]                             Coast Guard Authorization Act     Mr. President, I rise with my colleagues Senator Wicker  from Mississippi and Senator Casey from the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania to talk about legislation that I believe is of vital  importance to every State in the country--certainly to mine, the great  State of Alaska. Most importantly, it is vitally important legislation  to the men and women who serve in the U.S. Coast Guard. I am going to  talk about them for a minute. Yet, in addition to the legislation we  are talking about here, it is also vitally important to our maritime  and fishing communities.   This is very important legislation. Which legislation am I talking  about? S. 1129, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2017. It is  legislation that has broad bipartisan support, including from Chairman  Thune of South Dakota and Ranking Member Nelson of Florida of the  Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee; my colleague from  Alaska, Senator Lisa Murkowski; and many, many others, Republicans and  Democrats. The Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee,  which has jurisdiction over the Coast Guard and our fishing fleets and  our fisheries, marked up this important legislation back in May of  2017. Unfortunately, due to a lack of an agreement on one particular  provision--although we have very strong support, even for this  particular provision, of over 60 Senators--the Coast Guard bill overall  remains stuck.   We always talk about the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marines. I love  them to death, but sometimes we forget about our fifth branch of  service. These men and women do incredible work every single day for  our country.   This bipartisan bill, the Coast Guard Authorization Act, will give  the Coast Guard the resources it needs to protect our waterways and  coastlines, to block illegal drug traffickers and smugglers, and to  more efficiently procure future Coast Guard cutters. It will authorize  the Coast Guard in terms of policies and spending through fiscal years  2018 and 2019. Most importantly, it will take care of the men and women  who serve in our Coast Guard, who hail from every State in our great  Nation. They do so much.    So we are going to be debating the continuing resolution that will  have very significant funding for our military but also for natural  disasters. Think about the natural disasters that occurred in the  United States in Florida, in Texas, in Louisiana, and other places in  the last several months. The Coast Guard undertook thousands of rescue  operations--men and women risking their lives, literally, to save their  fellow Americans. This bill focuses on them.   In constructing this legislation, we worked in a bipartisan manner  for months. However, it appears that the Coast Guard authorization  bill, unfortunately, remains stuck.   I serve as the chairman of the subcommittee responsible for the Coast  Guard. In Alaska we know all about the men and women of the Coast  Guard. I would like to say that prior to 9/11, the Coast Guard was  probably the only military service among all five branches that had men  and women out there risking their lives every single day for Americans.  Unfortunately, since 9/11 and the big challenges we have had from a  national security perspective, we have had men and women from all  branches of services, every single day, risking their lives. But the  Coast Guard does it at home and abroad.   What is happening with this bill? Well, this bill, which is  bipartisan, not only contains critical needs and authorizations and  policies for our Coast Guard and the men and women who serve, but it  also contains provisions of vital importance to our maritime industry  and fishing communities. Included in this legislation are important  elements of another act, the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, which we  call VIDA, to address an issue that has been around for years  pertaining to the incidental discharges for those in our fishing fleets  and maritime fleets.   Currently, vessel owners and operators in the fishing and maritime  industry are forced to comply with a patchwork of burdensome State and  Federal regulations and laws for vessel ballast water and incidental  discharges--the discharges of water that come off the deck of fishing  vessels, for example.   Think about it. When thinking about the Constitution and the commerce  clause, this is an issue where a fishing vessel moves in different  waters in the United States--State waters from one State to another--or  a maritime ship goes from one State to another, and it has to comply  with a patchwork of different State laws and regulations as it moves  through different waters controlled by different States. This creates  inefficiencies, adds to business costs, and, particularly in the  fishing fleet, inhibits economic prosperity for States and people in  the industry, whether in Alaska or other places throughout the country.   So the VIDA provision, which we all worked on and which has very  strong bipartisan support, would provide the maritime and fishing  industry with a consistent, uniform regulatory structure across the  country, restoring efficient and cost-effective commerce while ensuring  that environmental protection remains at the highest levels for our  ports, waterways, and harbors.   We have been working together for months, and I want to commend my  friend from Pennsylvania, Senator Casey, as we have tried to  accommodate the concerns of many other Senators. We changed this part  of the Coast Guard bill numerous times to try to address those  concerns. I think we have gotten almost every Senator on board, with  the exception of just a few.   Notably, one of the measures that we have strong bipartisan support  for in this bill, which would help a number of my constituents-- thousands in the fishing industry--is the provision we have agreed on  that provides a permanent exemption on incidental vessel discharges for  all fishing vessels and small commercial vessels. Right now, believe it  or not, if you have a small commercial vessel and you are gutting fish  caught on the vessel and you hose down the guts of those fish back into  the water, you need a permit from the EPA. Think about that. Think  about a regulation that is going to hurt small businesses.   We are trying to encourage all of our colleagues to help us move  forward with the Coast Guard bill. We move the National Defense  Authorization Act that covers the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines  every year, but we should be moving the Coast Guard bill every year, as  well, to make sure we are taking care of the men and women in the Coast  Guard and we are not forgetting the fifth branch of the military that  does so much for our men and women. We also need solutions to the issue  of the vessel incidental discharge challenges, and we need to get this  provision of the Coast Guard bill unstuck.   I thank my colleagues again for being on the floor with me. Again,  this is a bipartisan issue, and we wanted to call out the importance of  this issue so that our colleagues in the Senate can say it is time to  act.   It is time to move on the Coast Guard bill. It is time to include  this very important VIDA provision, and I am hopeful we can do it soon.   I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Casey.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.    Absolutely. I want to thank Senator Wicker for his  leadership on this issue, and I think what we are seeing here in this  colloquy is the strength of the bipartisan support for this bill, not  only in the Senate but throughout the country. I appreciate my  colleague's words about who is supporting it. It is a very broad-based  coalition--fishing vessels, passenger vessels, labor unions, the Navy  League of the United States, marine terminals, port authorities.   I think both Senator Wicker and Senator Casey made a very strong  point: This is going to keep the highest standards on the environment  for our waters. This isn't about cutting corners, but it is going to  make these standards uniform, which is what our Nation needs.   What we also need to do is to make sure we pass the Coast Guard bill  as well as this important component of it. The men and women of the  Coast Guard are serving our Nation just like the other members of the  military, and somehow, by delaying this bill, we are undermining their  longer term interests. I think the Senate can do a much better job.   I agree with my colleague from Mississippi that we are close. There  is clearly bipartisan support across the board for the VIDA Act and the  Coast Guard bill, and we are hopeful that within the next few weeks or  few months, we are going to get this done, and it is going to benefit  literally every State in this great Nation of ours.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Mississippi  for his strong leadership on this issue as well.   I think we are seeing here that Democrats and Republicans are pretty  much all united on this issue. We are hopeful to move not only the VIDA  Act but also the broader Coast Guard bill out of the Senate, get it  passed, and get it to the President's desk. That is going to be good  for the men and women of the Coast Guard, it is going to be good for  our maritime and fishing interests, and it is going to be good for the  country.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from Arizona.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            Tribute to Kirk Alkire     Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, I have  been coming to the floor every week to do what I consider the favorite  part of my duties serving here in the Senate, and that is to talk about  someone special in my great State. We call that person our Alaskan of  the Week.   I have been told by some of my colleagues that they look forward to  this, and I know the pages do, learning a little bit about Alaska. I do  this because I certainly want my constituents to know about so many  people in their State--what they are doing, how they are impacting not  only their community or State but sometimes even the whole country.   Much of what the country knows about Alaska is what they have seen on  TV--beautiful glaciers, giant salmon, skiing, hiking, kayaking,  boating. We want everyone to come visit Alaska. It will be the trip of  a lifetime, guaranteed.   The real beauty of my State rests in the people who call it home. It  is a State of rugged, generous, patriotic people devoted to service to  their country, their State, and their communities. In many ways, this  is what this ``Alaskan of the Week'' honor is all about.   When we talk about service to our country, Alaska boasts thousands  and thousands of Active Duty members of the military, reservists-- thousands of reservists--and tens of thousands of veterans, in fact,  more veterans per capita than any other State in the country. So many  of the veterans in my State have not just served their country but have  devoted their time and energy in ways that so many veterans do, helping  and caring for other veterans and their families.   Many in the military know it is not easy to serve, but what is often  forgotten is that service and the sacrifice of service, particularly  military service, often hits the families the hardest. When that  service results in the loss of life, the ultimate sacrifice, it is  devastating for the families, friends, and loved ones all across  communities, all across Alaska, and all across the country. When one of  our own loses their life in the fight for freedom, we all grieve. We  all grieve.   Today I want to introduce a very special Alaskan, Kirk Alkire, who  has devoted countless hours to make sure that those we have lost in  battle will never be forgotten and that the families of those who have  paid the ultimate sacrifice receive a fitting tribute to their  sacrifice.   Kirk believes that such a fitting tribute lies in a peak in one of  Alaska's vast, beautiful, almost endless mountain ranges that we have  in my great State. This is a peak that actually exists in the Chugach  range between Eagle River and Palmer, AK, overlooking the Knik River.   Kirk has been on a quest to name this peak the ``Gold Star Peak.'' It  is actually a mountain that is unnamed right now next to another  mountain that is named. That mountain is called Mount POW/MIA, but he  wants to name this other mountain for the Gold Star families who have  lost loved ones who were killed in action defending America. Kirk is  passionate about this peak, just as he was passionate about the men and  women he served with during his 23 years in the Army on Active Duty.   Let me tell you a little bit about Kirk. He was born and raised in  San Jose, CA. He enlisted in the Army right out of high school in 1986.  He married his high school sweetheart, Angie, and they had a son,  Matthew.   During his time on Active Duty in the Army, like so many soldiers,  particularly over the last couple decades, he had various assignments  in both airborne and light infantry units spread across the United  States--really with deployments all over the world--and eventually he  was stationed in Alaska. His final assignment was as a first sergeant  with the Alaska-based 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the 25th  Infantry Division, a unit that we in Alaska lovingly know as simply the  425. It is a unit that we all care about--the only airborne brigade  combat team in the entire Asia Pacific, mountain-trained and arctic- tough.   I had the opportunity to visit a couple thousand of those troops from  the 425 who are actually serving their country in Afghanistan. These  are the best of the best, and they are always forward-deployed.   Kirk and the 425 deployed to Iraq for 15 months during the 2006 to  2007 surge. Kirk's brigade, during that tough, tough fighting in Iraq  during that time, during the surge--one brigade combat team lost 53  paratroopers over that 15 months. Fifty-three American soldiers were  killed in action from one brigade, and that doesn't even touch the  numbers that were wounded in action, which were many, many more. That  is a devastating number.   Kirk now lives in Eagle River, AK. It is a beautiful community in the  mountains overlooking Eagle River near Anchorage. Since his return, he  has climbed Mount POW/MIA a few times every year to tend to the flag  that exists on that peak, again out of patriotism. It was during one of  those hikes that he noticed the beautiful unnamed peak right next to  Mount POW/MIA, and then he knew what he needed to do.   Mr. President, it is not easy to name a peak, and in Alaska, we have  so many mountains that there are dozens and dozens of mountains that  are still not named. It is not easy to name the peak of a mountain. So  what did he do? Well, first, he secured support from members of the  Eklutna Tribe, whose region in Alaska the mountain occupies, so it was  a very respectful action toward our very important Native community in  Alaska. He then took letters of support and a petition with over 1,500  signatures from all 50 States, 4 countries, and 1 U.S. territory, to  the Alaska Historical Commission. I was  [[Page S810]]  one of the signors of that petition. He presented all of this to the  National Geological Survey, which is part of the Department of the  Interior, all to get this peak, this mountain, named for the Gold Star  families, the Gold Star Peak. So he worked this hard. He worked this  very hard.   Today, I have the honor of announcing on the Senate floor that just  this morning, the U.S. Board of Geographic Names, which is part of the  Department of the Interior, which votes to name mountains, unanimously  voted and approved naming that mountain in the Chugach Mountain range  ``Gold Star Peak.'' That is great news. That is hard work.   I am honored to have Kirk sitting up in the Gallery today after his  hard work where he was working at the Department of the Interior this  morning.   I first met Kirk at a Veterans Day parade in Anchorage, where he told  me about his quest to get the mountain peak named. That is where I  signed the petition. And then I asked him--I said: Kirk, you served  your country. Why are you so motivated and focused and determined to do  this?   Do you know what he did, Mr. President? He pulled out 53 dog tags  that he had in his pocket with the names of every soldier of the 425  who was lost in Iraq in 2006 to 2007 when he was the first sergeant for  that brigade. I held them in my hand. It was powerful and moving, and  in some ways it was so horrible to look at because these are the lives  and names of the best and brightest we have in America. That is why he  did it, and that is why he was motivated.   Because of Kirk and the announcement today, families--whether they  are from Alaska or anywhere in America who come visit, families who  have lost loved ones who made the ultimate sacrifice serving their  Nation will now be able to look up at Gold Star Peak as they drive up  the busy Glenn Highway in Alaska, and they will see that 4,000-foot  peak soaring into the sky. All of America will know that their loved  ones are not forgotten and that the service and sacrifice of the Gold  Star families whom we honor are appreciated and honored by a grateful  nation.   So thank you, Kirk, for all the work you have put into this.  Congratulations on the vote today. I can't wait to get home and see  Gold Star Peak, officially named, and maybe, just maybe, get out there  and summit it with you someday.   Thank you for being our Alaskan of the Week.   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
