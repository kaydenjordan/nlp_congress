 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Geraldine Amstutz of  Rochester, Minnesota, who will celebrate her 100th birthday on March  15.   Geraldine was born on March 15, 1921, in Grabill, Indiana, a small  town founded and named after her grandfather.   After graduating high school at the top of her class, Geraldine went  on to study music in college.   In 1943, Geraldine married Tillman Amstutz, with whom she would spend  the next 63 years raising four children and eventually settling in  Rochester.   Geraldine has always loved music, especially playing the piano, but  her greatest passions involve people and art. For decades she has made  personalized, homemade cards, sending thousands over the years to  encourage, lift up, honor, and celebrate others. Approaching her  centennial birthday, Geraldine continues making cards to bless others  with her kindness and compassion.   Here is to 100 terrific years, Geraldine.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  682, the Reopen Schools Act, to get our kids out from behind screens  and back into the classroom.
