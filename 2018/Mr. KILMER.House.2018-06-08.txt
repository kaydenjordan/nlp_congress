 Mr. Speaker, first, do no harm. That is rule number one  for every doctor, and it should be rule number one for this President  and this Congress as well. But because of the harmful, partisan  healthcare politics in Washington, D.C., next year, a quarter million  people in Washington State will have to spend 19 percent more per month  on their health insurance.   That adds up for a lot of folks. It will add up to the difference  between being able to afford healthcare or not. Families in Washington  State will have less money in their pockets because of the choices to  do harm by this Congress and this administration.   It is a choice to cut, as this administration did, the Federal  payments that make healthcare cheaper for families. It is a choice to  obsessively try to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, as this House and  this administration have done, creating uncertainty and driving up  costs.   Listen, the Affordable Care Act was not perfect, but it meant cheaper  healthcare and more people with insurance. Let's fix it rather than  harm people.   Rather than partisan attacks that do harm to the healthcare system  and harm to family budgets, let's first do no harm, and then let's work  together to actually help American families have healthcare.                            ____________________
