 Madam President, let me thank my colleague, the ranking  Democrat--the senior Democrat--on the Committee on Banking, Housing,  and Urban Affairs, for his passion and his commitment. He has really  elevated housing within the jurisdiction of the committee, which is  something I am passionate about. Very often, everyone refers to the  committee as the Banking Committee, but housing is a critical element  of what it does. He has elevated it, and I really appreciate his  passion on behalf of the millions who rent or who are fortunate enough  to own homes and want to keep them to try to be able to do so.   I would just say to my distinguished chairman of the committee that I  do have the highest respect for him.   Look, with the CARES package, we lumped in trillions of dollars, but  overwhelmingly that money went to businesses. Of course, I support  that, but it went to businesses. It went to sustain businesses. It went  to ultimately help small, midsized, and even large businesses. It went  to sustain sectors of our economy like the airline industry and others.   What we are talking about goes to the very essence of what it is to  have a home. ``Home'' is one of the most important American concepts.  It is where we are taken when we are born. It is where we are nurtured  while we are young. It is where we are schooled. It is where good times  and bad times take place. Ultimately, it is where we build a life  around our families if we are fortunate to have a home. Then, in a  pandemic, we have learned that it is also a place in which to shelter.   I come to the floor today to warn of an impending storm that is  brewing, and it is headed our way.   When the funds for the PPP--for the business program--ran out, we  didn't have regular order to see if the PPP had been working well. No.  There was a rush to put more billions in it. It was only when we said  ``Wait a minute, this isn't working so well for small and midsized  businesses'' that we made some reforms. So there was a rush then. There  was no regular order.   We have a storm that is brewing and is headed our way. It will bring  with it enormous financial pain. It will threaten public safety. It  will make fighting the pandemic that much harder, and it will set back  our Nation's economic recovery. If the Senate fails to respond to this  looming crisis, Americans will needlessly suffer; families will be  displaced; personal fortunes will be wiped out; and the scars will run  so deep that it could take decades to heal the wounds.   As the COVID-19 pandemic took hold, the one saving grace most of us  had--the one place we could take refuge to protect ourselves and our  families--was our home. Our leading medical experts all urged us to  stay home. If you are sick, stay home. If you have an underlying  condition or are immunocompromised, stay home. If you are elderly or  otherwise at risk, stay home. If you can, work from home. If you are a  student, go online and learn from home. If we have learned anything  from this pandemic, it is that staying home can help to contain the  virus, flatten the curve, and save lives.   What if you don't have a home? As we speak, millions of our fellow  Americans are asking themselves that very same question.   At a time when COVID-19 cases are spiking across the country, the  provisions that we passed in the CARES Act to help renters and  homeowners stay in their homes are about to run out. If we do nothing,  we could face a foreclosure and eviction crisis far greater than that  which we encountered during the great recession.   There is a storm on the horizon. Americans shouldn't have to fear  being thrown out on the street if they miss their next rent or mortgage  payments through, really, no fault of their own. They shouldn't have to  fear losing their greatest personal assets or that one safe place in  the middle of a pandemic, further exposing themselves and others to the  virus.   The Senate can stop this if it wants to. We can make sure that every  American has a safe and healthy place to call home. That is why I  joined my Democratic colleagues on the Committee on Banking, Housing,  and Urban Affairs in introducing two bills last month that will provide  assistance to homeowners and renters.   The Housing Assistance Fund, led by Senator Reed, provides $75  billion in targeted assistance to keep people in their homes while they  search for new employment or a way to get back to work. This money can  go toward mortgage payments or utilities or as other support to prevent  eviction, delinquency, or foreclosure.   The Emergency Rental Assistance and Rental Market Stabilization Act,  led by Senator Brown, would provide $100 billion in rental assistance  to help families pay rent and help property owners maintain safe and  healthy housing. It will help the economic recovery by stabilizing the  rental market overall.   We also have to empower Americans to make informed financial  decisions--to help them navigate the maze of lenders, landlords,  government agencies--to find a sustainable path to stay in their homes.   We all know there is a housing affordability crisis in this country  that jeopardizes the aspirations of millions of Americans who hope to  join the middle class, and just as they have borne the brunt of the  COVID-19 pandemic, low-income and minority Americans will  disproportionately suffer during economic downturns.   The provisions that the chairman talked about in the law that we  passed in order to help are going to be expiring. To the extent that  you know about it, you might invoke it to protect yourself against an  eviction or a mortgage foreclosure, but if you don't know about it and  either the financial institution or your landlord looks the other way  and doesn't follow the law, well then, you won't get the protection.   That is why I and 19 of my Democratic colleagues introduced a bill on  Monday to provide $700 million in housing counseling assistance.  Research shows that homeowners who receive housing counseling have  better outcomes than those who don't, and that evidence is  overwhelming. Their risk of default goes down, and they are more likely  to see their credit scores rise and their debt levels fall.   In rough times like we are in right now, these borrowers are more  likely to get sustainable mortgage modifications and are less likely to  end up in default. The benefits of housing counseling flow to the  community at large because when a family is able to buy a home, pay  their mortgage, build equity, and ultimately achieve the American  dream, our towns and cities thrive. And during a pandemic, having  [[Page S4111]]  a safe and affordable place to live could mean the difference between  life and death.    It is also especially important for senior citizens, who are more  susceptible to COVID-19. So tomorrow I will introduce legislation to  provide $1.2 billion in aid for older adults living in federally  assisted housing.   This bill provides additional rental assistance for senior housing,  personal protective gear, and staffing to help maintain a healthy  community.   So the forecasts are in. The storm is coming. The question is, What  are we going to do about it?   The Fourth of July is Independence Day. It is nice to have  independence from the fear that I will lose the place that I call home.  That would be a tremendous gift on the Fourth of July.   Are we going to help our most vulnerable citizens during this  pandemic or are we going to just watch them suffer, lose everything,  and exacerbate this public health crisis?   Today is July 1. The rent is due. Mortgage payments are due. The  Senate's work is due.   I remember--and I will close with this personal anecdote--when I was  growing up poor in a tenement in New Jersey, the son of an itinerant  carpenter and a seamstress, there wasn't always work, which meant that  sometimes paying the rent was a real tough choice. And it was a choice  of paying the rent or putting food on the table. I saw the anxiety in  my mother's eyes. I saw the fear in my siblings not knowing whether  that apartment in that tenement was something we were even going to be  able to keep. That wasn't in a pandemic. That was just in normal times.  Imagine in a pandemic, you are told to stay home, and there is no place  to call home. We can do much better than that. We can do much better  than that.   July 1, the rent is due. The mortgage payment is due. The Senate's  work is due. Let's pass this bill today and make sure every American  can weather the pandemic in a safe and affordable place to call home.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise to speak to S. 3669, the COVID-19  International Response and Recovery Act of 2020.   As of this weekend, there are an estimated 10 million confirmed cases  of COVID-19 worldwide. More than 2.5 million of those cases are right  here in the United States. The disease has claimed over 125,000  American lives.   For anyone who questioned why we should care about what happens  elsewhere in the world, this pandemic has certainly been most assuredly  a wake-  [[Page S4118]]  up call. The virus didn't start here, but it came here and Americans  are now suffering from the effects of an epidemic that shows no signs  of stopping.   Even if we bring it under control in the United States, in the  absence of U.S. leadership for a truly global response, the virus can  and will return. We cannot safeguard American lives without one, but we  cannot lead or even meaningfully participate in a global response when  we don't have a coherent and effective domestic strategy.   The President's desperate denial, his refusal to take this pandemic  seriously, and his seeming inability to care about the health and well- being of all Americans are as shocking as they are dangerous.   As opposed to a pandemic response strategy, the White House seems to  have a dangerous public relations strategy focused on perpetuating a  false narrative that insists the pandemic is almost over, blames China  and the World Health Organization for its own preparedness and response  failures, overstates the administration's domestic and international  response, and refuses to be candid with Congress and the American  people about the consequences of its irresponsible actions.   Make no mistake, contrary to what the White House would have us  believe, the COVID-19 threat is far from over. As Dr. Anthony Fauci  testified, it is a lack of serious response--not as some in the White  House would have us believe, more tests--that is leading to the  skyrocketing case numbers and hospitalization rates we are seeing  today.   Unfortunately, the haphazardness that has characterized the White  House's response at home has also shaped its response abroad.   Secretary Pompeo is right. The American people are the most generous  on the planet, but that belies this administration's actual response.  The reality is that when it comes to discussions about what it is doing  to end the pandemic globally, the administration is trumpeting programs  it has spent 3 years consistently and aggressively cutting, which  explains perfectly why Secretary Pompeo, to this day, refuses to come  before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to defend his proposed  fiscal year 2021 budget.   America, the world needs a strategy to end this pandemic, not a PR  blitz to cover inaction. The blame game will not help us either. Yet,  instead of taking care of the business at hand, the administration is  channeling its energy toward fault finding and divisive, racially  inflammatory rhetoric.   First, the White House tried to say that the U.S. epidemic was the  World Health Organization's fault, despite the fact that the United  States was regularly communicating with and receiving information from  the WHO, including through U.S. Government employees embedded at the  WHO headquarters in Geneva.   In May, the administration announced a 30-day plan to review the  organization's handling of the pandemic response. But less than 2 weeks  after it announced that sham review, the President said he was going to  withdraw from the organization--so much for the 30-day review.   Next, the administration doubled down on blaming China. The  President, the Secretary of State, and the Deputy Administrator of  USAID have all used racially stigmatizing language to describe COVID- 19, in direct contradiction to guidance issued by our own Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention. And the insistence that the rest of the  world agree to use such language has prevented us from reaching  consensus on statements at the G-7 and in the U.N. Security Council and  seriously weakened our standing.   If this administration is truly concerned about China's malign intent  at the WHO and elsewhere, there is a simple answer: Take action. If the  United States leads, others will follow. If we leave the field open,  others, like China, will step into the vacuum.   Isolationist, go-it-alone tactics are not the way to end a pandemic.  At a time when the United States should be leading the global response  to one of the greatest threats we face in the 21st century--and this  pandemic will, most certainly, not be our last--I have to wonder if,  instead, what we are witnessing is the death of American leadership and  the end of American exceptionalism, brought about by the inattention  and ineptitude of the Trump administration, both here and abroad   Meanwhile, the rest of the world is stepping up and stepping past us.  For example, when Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed the World  Health Assembly in May, he pledged $2 billion over 2 years to combat  COVID-19. Secretary Azar used the opportunity to attack the WHO and  cast blame on China for the pandemic.   The European Union held a pledging conference on vaccines in May, at  which $8.2 billion was raised. The United States was invited to  participate, but the White House declined the invitation. Is this what  the President means by ``America first''?   Well, if this EU consortium comes up with a vaccine before we do, it  will mean America last, as we wait for them to share it with us.   This approach is not only isolationist, shortsighted, and foolish; it  is dangerous.   It is clear that the administration's response is not keeping the  American people safe, and it is just as clear that there are actions we  can take to effectively respond to this pandemic and better prepare for  future pandemics.   Since the administration doesn't seem to have any ideas, Democrats on  the Foreign Relations Committee introduced a bill to provide some. S.  3669, the COVID-19 International Response and Recovery Act, or CIRRA,  presents a clear strategy to confront the ongoing pandemic--the ongoing  pandemic--and prepare the United States to deal with the next.   It compels the Trump administration to constructively engage with  other countries, international organizations, and multilateral fora to  stop the spread of the coronavirus.   Specifically, our bill authorizes an additional $9 billion in funding  to fight the COVID-19 pandemic through contributions toward vaccine  research at the Coalition for Preparedness and Innovations; a  contribution to the Global Fund for Aids, Tuberculosis, and Malaria,  for its COVID-19 response mechanism; additional funding for emergency  overseas humanitarian assistance in response to the pandemic, ensuring  that these funds are provided both to the U.N. for its global response  plan, as well as directly to NGOs working on the frontlines; and a new  surge financing authority at the U.S. International Development Finance  Corporation, or DFC, that will allow the DFC to expedite decisions and  make strategic investments quickly to aid in COVID-19 reconstruction  efforts.   CIRRA also puts in place mechanisms to help us prepare for the next  pandemic. It requires an annual national intelligence estimate on  pandemic threats, and it establishes a White House adviser for global  health security to coordinate a whole-of-government U.S. response to  global health security emergencies, aimed at improving both domestic  and international capacity to prevent, respond, and detect epidemic and  pandemic threats.   It clearly delineates the roles for the State Department, USAID, and  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in responding to  pandemic threats, and it directs the U.S. Executive Director at the  World Bank to begin negotiations to establish a trust fund at the World  Bank designed not to compete with or supplant the World Health  Organization but to work in tandem with the WHO on incentivizing  countries to mobilize their own resources for epidemic and pandemic  preparedness.   Now, my Republican colleague on the Foreign Relations Committee  finally did introduce a modest bill in response to the pandemic. In  keeping with the Republican effort to pretend that the pandemic is  over, it completely ignores the current crisis.   Instead, it focuses on giving legislative cover to elite proposals  from the White House that seem to strip essential pandemic response  functions from USAID and put them in the State Department, and sets up  a structure at the World Bank that would allow the White House to  channel funding meant for the WHO into another multilateral mechanism.   Colleagues, to say that that approach is inadequate to meet the  crisis of the century would be so much of an understatement as to  almost be a lie in and of itself. The chairman's legislation  [[Page S4119]]  completely ignores the current pandemic while setting us up for failure  when we are confronted by the next pandemic. We quite simply must do  better.   More than 700 Americans a day are dying. Neither the finger-pointing,  blame-game, race-baiting statements linked to the origins of the  disease, nor a strategy centered on denial will win the battle against  COVID-19.   It is painfully apparently that Congress will have to lead in this  effort, just as it led in domestic relief and recovery efforts. If we  fail to develop a proposal that boldly and robustly addresses the  current crisis, ensures that we are adequately prepared for the next  one, and aids countries around the globe with recovery, we will have  failed the American people and fallen painfully short of the legacy  created through initiatives such as the President's Emergency Plan for  AIDS Relief and the Marshall plan, to name a few.   We must understand that there is a recent report that came out of a  potential swine flu. Well, whether it is that or something else, we  have the risk of the next pandemic. Our engagement globally is not just  about being a good global citizen. It is about security and health here  at home.   When we can engage abroad to stop the flow of a virus, then, we  ultimately achieve the success on behalf of the American people, and we  leave the world with a better response. That is what we are seeking to  do, and we will come back to the floor at the appropriate time to seek  to move that legislation.                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 5084    Madam President, turning to a different topic for the moment, one  that my colleague from Louisiana is also here to join me in--and I  appreciate his being here--I come to the floor today, in addition to  speaking about the COVID-19 international legislation, to seek  unanimous consent on H.R. 5084, the Improving Corporate Governance  Through Diversity Act of 2019.   This is a bipartisan piece of legislation aimed at increasing  transparency in America's corporate boardrooms and ultimately lead to  greater diversity in the upper tiers of America's companies.   We know that corporate America has a diversity problem. Boards and  executive offices across the United States do not look like the  customers they serve.   Multiple studies, including my own, have demonstrated this hard fact.  Since 2010, I have conducted four surveys focused on the Fortune 100  companies looking into this problem. They had very big response rates,  for which I am grateful to the companies who participated.   My latest survey revealed that since 2010, women and people of color  have made only marginal gains in representations on corporate boards.  For example, in 2018, women held only 25 percent of corporate board  seats on Fortune 100 companies. Despite making up over half of the  entire U.S. population, they held only 25 percent of corporate board  seats, and only 5.8 percent of that 25 percent were women of color.  While men make up 75 percent of Fortune 100 corporate board seats, only  13.7 percent of those are men of color.   If we wanted to take a broader look, the picture is even bleaker.  Latinos and Latinas make up 25 percent of the U.S. population, yet they  held only 2.7 percent of corporate board seats in Fortune 100  companies. I could go on, but I think I have made the point.   I was originally hopeful that the Securities and Exchange Commission  would help address this problem through its 2009 diversity disclosure  rule, but the 2009 rule failed to even define diversity and gives  companies far too much discretion on what they report. That is why I  introduced a bill last year with Representative Meeks to improve the  SEC rule.   The bill does three main things. No. 1, it requires public companies  to disclose specific information related to the racial, gender, ethnic  makeup and veteran status of corporate boards and senior management-- simple disclosure. No. 2, it requires public companies to disclose  whether they have policies in place to promote diversity in their  leadership. No. 3, it requires the SEC to establish a diversity  advisory group composed of government, academic, and private sector  representatives to study strategies for increasing gender, racial, and  ethnic diversity in corporate America.   Let me be clear. The bill does not force companies to be more  diverse, but it does require them to be more transparent about their  numbers and their practices. That is valuable information that the  public and potential investors should have when deciding where to put  their money.   The House passed this bill on a bipartisan vote in November, and it  enjoys bipartisan support here in the Senate. It is supported by a  fantastic coalition that includes the NAACP, the National Urban League,  the Latino Corporate Directors Association, and the U.S. Chamber of  Commerce.   Corporate diversity is not just morally right; corporate diversity  makes financial sense. McKinsey & Company studies have consistently  found that greater diversity on executive teams has led to greater  profitability. The need for increased corporate diversity is not an act  of benevolence; it is a necessity for businesses looking to compete in  a diverse 21st century economy.   Before I proceed to my unanimous consent request, I would like to  yield to Senator Kennedy for some remarks he has on this issue, and  then I will proceed to that consent request.    I thank the Senator from Louisiana for his words and  for his support, and I wish we had this already. It is not very  difficult--transparency, information for which consumers can make  decisions and investors can make decisions, and you would think in the  21st Century, that is not a problem.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Banking,  Housing, and Urban Affairs be discharged from further consideration and  the Senate proceed to H.R. 5084; I further ask unanimous consent that  the bill be considered read a third time and passed and that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    I am not surprised, but I am deeply disappointed that  my colleague takes that position. First of all, the SEC has had a  diversity rule since 2009. It has a diversity rule, but the diversity  rule as they devised it doesn't do anything about transparency of  information. So we are not creating something at the SEC that the SEC  itself wasn't pursuing in the protection of investors   If I were an investor, I would like to know whether a company is  diverse or not. Latinos represent 25 percent of the population, the  fastest growing, largest minority in the Nation. I would like to know  if the money I am going to put into a stock--buying a stock of a  company--does it reflect the understanding of that community in any  way? African Americans--does it reflect that understanding? Does it  reflect the understanding that 50 percent of the population are women?   The free market--yes, the free market works on information. You make  decisions in the free market based on information, but when the  information is hidden from you, when you can't find out, in fact, what  is the diversity of the corporate board, senior executive management,  procurement and other things, then the free market doesn't work very  well, does it?   The heavy hand of government--oh, my God--to disclose, to be  transparent--that is the heavy hand of government? When the government  doesn't work to make our systems more transparent so that investors and  consumers can make decisions, who will do that? The free market? I  don't think so.   The Senator from Utah, I know, has been very much an advocate of  transparency in other matters; somehow, in this one, it seems to be a  problem. And to protect investors--yes, we ought to protect investors  because investors who would be making investments in a company that is  devoid of African Americans, devoid of Latinos, devoid of the  representation of who America is today may think twice about the large  pension funds and other entities. They may say: Wait a minute. Maybe  that is not the type of company I want to invest in.   But the investor will not know that unless they have that  information. I would think, in the 21st century, when we see the  national debate that is taking place today on the questions of race, on  questions of ethnicity and other things, we would want to at least have  the data so that we can make intelligent decisions.   By the way, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce--the Chamber of Commerce is  normally not on my side. They came and testified specifically in  support of this provision. They represent business in America, and they  came forth and said: We believe that, in fact, this is good for  business. If it weren't good for business, they wouldn't be there. They  wouldn't be advocating for it.   So we will succeed at this. We may not have done it today by this  process, but we will succeed at this because the Nation requires it. It       is good accountability. It is good transparency. It is       good for the free market to know what the information is       so people can make decisions. It is certainly, at the end       of the day, about protecting investors. So I look forward       to making that happen at the appropriate time.    Mr. President, I appreciate the intellectual exercise  we are going through on the floor. I will just make two final comments  because I know that my colleague is anxiously waiting to talk about the  need for people to be able to put food on the table.   Look, the Securities and Exchange Commission exists, yes, to protect  investors and also the marketplace, but they make all types of demands  upon the companies that are publicly traded in terms of disclosure of  information, so I don't know what is so difficult about that.   I will say this: The Nation will have a rude awakening if it thinks  it can continue with business as usual--a rude awakening.   Something as simple as simply knowing the information about diversity  on corporate boards, which every study shows actually improves the  bottom line and which investors should be able to have to make those  decisions--and we are not talking about the employees; we are talking  about the corporate board members, my God, the people who make billions  of dollars of decisions, who ultimately decide whether they go to a  community or don't go to a community to invest in, who ultimately get  the dollars from the communities that I like to see represented. It is  good enough to take our money, but it is not good enough to have us  have any representation. And evidently this body is not even good  enough to have the information so I know who is taking my money without  representation. That cannot be. That cannot be the American way.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise to clarify a point concerning my  amendment No. 2270 to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2021, S. 4049. This amendment would establish in law the position  of the Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs at the State Department and  provides that the Special Envoy shall have the rank and status of  ambassador. Under article II of the Constitution, the President's power  to appoint ambassadors is subject to the advice and consent of the  Senate. Accordingly, it is my view that the appointment of the Special  Envoy with the rank and status of ambassador, pursuant to this  amendment, requires the advice and consent of the Senate.                            ____________________
