 Madam Speaker, due process is a right so important that we  have not one but two constitutional amendments to ensure it.   Past impeachment inquiries began with a resolution to define scope,  to establish rules and procedures, and to give equal subpoena power to  the minority. These due process protections are critical because  removing a President is one of the most serious decisions Congress can  make.   But last week, the Democratic Caucus chair dismissed our pleas for a  resolution to formalize the impeachment inquiry as a ``cosmetic  procedural matter.'' Cosmetic. Since when did fairness in this country  become cosmetic?   Democrats point to the Constitution in undertaking this inquiry, but  look at how it is being handled. There is no due process. The accused  is presumed guilty. There is no right to confront your accuser. All  proceedings are taking place in secret.   The only reason for secret hearings is to control what people see and  what they hear. This sham process disregards the fundamental rights our  country is founded on, and the American people deserve more.                            ____________________
