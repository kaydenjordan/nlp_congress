 Mr. Speaker, since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the world  has changed--socially, economically, and the political landscape.  Putin's war has killed thousands of Ukrainians, innocent citizens, and  displaced millions who have struggled to get food and resources in this  region.   Last April, I spoke on the floor after the attacks in Bucha, which I  visited, and labeled President Putin for what he is, a war criminal. As  Russia continues this unprovoked attack on Ukraine, we must continue to  stand strong and united against him.   I traveled to Kyiv, Ukraine's capital city, as a part of the Yalta  European Strategy Conference recently.   As one of the only Members of Congress to have actually stayed  overnight, spent a couple of days, I witnessed the 24-hour cycle of the  capital city finding energy once again, revitalizing itself through its  day-to-day routines.   I saw parts of the city where Russia's tanks entered the suburbs and  killed innocent civilians, as well as children, destroying homes,  apartments and schools, mass graves with over 166 individuals. Even  through this tragedy, Ukraine has remained resilient, and Kyiv returns  to life.   I felt relatively safe as I walked the streets in the central city.  Looking back to where the city was 6 months ago is a reminder to me of  how precious all of our freedoms are. As I met Ukrainians across the  capital, it was inspiring to see their hope that better days are  coming, and that Ukraine will prevail.   During my visit, we met with NATO allies and many of the panel  sessions that we had focused on how we will continue our support for  Ukraine amidst Russia's brutal war that was unprovoked.   Critically, we discussed matters related to Ukraine's defense, its  economy and recovery plans, and humanitarian aid as it continues to  prevail from Russia's countless attacks.   Strong economic security is critical to rebuilding Ukraine and  preserving its sovereignty. That is what we must do after the war. We  saw Ukrainian Armed Forces execute one of the most pivotable 48-hour  counteroffensives during the past 6 months, and it continues.   The liberation of Izium and territory to the north in Kharkiv is one  of the countless displays of bravery and sacrifice that have come to  define Ukraine's fight.   Ukraine is putting up a stronger fight than Russia was anticipating;  through strength, unity, and love of country, Ukraine will prevail.   Today, we heard that Putin is enlarging his forces by 300,000 and is  inferring that everything is on the table. We must call his bluff.   Congress and President Biden have provided significant support to  Ukraine since the beginning of the war, and it has made a difference on  a bipartisan basis, and we must continue that when we pass the  continuing resolution later in the next week.   Ukraine has been able to strengthen its defense systems, bolster its  refugee services, and tackle food insecurity. Millions of tons of grain  have come out of Odessa through the agreement that was reached through  Turkey and the U.N. However, challenges remain, and the war has not yet  been won.   We, the United States with our NATO allies, must continue to unite  against Vladimir Putin and provide Ukraine with the tools to defend  itself and to protect its sovereignty from this brutal invasion.   As we craft the upcoming continuing resolution, we must continue  additional funding.    This is a pivotal moment in our history. Our actions today will  determine the future of the 21st century.   The world has changed in the last 8 months. Future generations will  look back in history and judge us if we made more good decisions than  poor decisions to preserve their rights and their liberties.   We must not let Putin win. Democracy must prevail. This is the test  of our time and our generation among our NATO allies and here in  America to stand up for liberty and democracy.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to condemn Azerbaijan's  attack on Armenia.   Nearly 204 Armenian troops are confirmed killed or missing. It was an  attack on a sovereign territory.   Speaker Pelosi's visit to Armenia is a symbol of the United States'  commitment to a peaceful, prosperous Armenia that is setting up its own  democratic nation. That is why I am pushing to include demining  assistance and other aid for Armenia and Artsakh in the fiscal year  2023 budget.   Mr. Speaker, we must stand with the people of Armenia for all the  right reasons.                            ____________________
