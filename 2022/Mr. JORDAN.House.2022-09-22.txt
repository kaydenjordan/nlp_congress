 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the chairman just said that the Democrats have always  been for--I think the direct quote was: ``equitable funding for law  enforcement.'' That is interesting because, just 2 years ago, here is  what the chairman said in June 2020:         There should be substantial cuts to police budgets.    I don't know how you can say you have always been for something when  2 years ago you said that you weren't, but that just seems what  Democrats are up to today.   Let's call this package of bills before us today exactly what it is:  It is an election year ploy from Democrats to look like they care about  funding law enforcement.   In the wake of radical leftwing efforts to defund the police, it is  no surprise that violent crime is on the rise in America. Every major  urban area has seen a huge uptick in violent crime. It should also be  no surprise that Democrats are now trying to run and hide from their  radical ideas and dangerous rhetoric.   For more than 2 years, we have seen violent crime surge all across  the country, particularly in Democrat-run cities while many of those  same Democrats not only advocated for defunding police departments, but  they did it. They cut them.   Now, the Democrats want to use Federal tax dollars to paper over the  problems they created in their local Democrat-run cities.   These bills do nothing to solve the underlying problem. They simply  create more grant programs within the bureaucracy of the Federal  Government.   Under current law, there are already grants available to law  enforcement to hire personnel. In fact, last year, the Justice  Department awarded more than $139 million in grant dollars through the  Office of Community Oriented Policing Services. That money provided  funds to 183 law enforcement agencies and allowed them to hire more  than 1,000 additional officers.   We don't need more Federal grants so Democrat-run cities can then  divert taxpayer money to fund their woke agenda. What we need are  prosecutors who are willing to prosecute crimes and jurisdictions with  laws that actually keep violent criminals in prison.   Nothing in these bills prevents jurisdictions that choose to defund  their police from receiving these grant funds. In fact, when Judiciary  Republicans offered an amendment to preclude jurisdictions that  defunded their police from receiving grant funds, the Democrats  rejected it, and they rejected it unanimously.   Faced with an election just over a month away, House Democrats now  want to pretend they actually support law enforcement. The timing of  this bill should tell you all you need to know about where Democrat  priorities are.  [[Page H8087]]    Democrats who are in full control of this body have had 2 years to  show their support for law enforcement. Only now, when faced with an  impending election, are Democrats beginning to feign support for our  men and women in blue.   Democrats could have shown their support for law enforcement.  Instead, Democrats passed bills to infringe on Americans' Second  Amendment rights, legalize marijuana, and further empower the Biden  Justice Department to spy on concerned parents.    These bills are just another admission by Democrats that the defund  the police movement is wrong and irresponsible. Perhaps, if the  Democrats weren't in a cleanup mode after their irresponsible embrace  of defund the police rhetoric, the Judiciary Committee could have had  an opportunity to consider and improve most of these bills before they  came to the floor. But we didn't. Instead, Democrats are rushing to  consider these bills to give themselves some pretense that they support  funding the police.   No one is fooled. Americans know where Democrats really stand.  Americans aren't buying the Democrats' revisionist history. They have  seen years of Democrats embracing and supporting the radical defund the  police movement. Americans know that the Democrats are the party of  soaring crime and defunding the police.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition of this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to be clear. The Democrats want to go from  COPS to community organizers, and they want the American taxpayer to  pay for it. That is what they want to do in Democrat-run cities.   Mr. Speaker, read the bill. It talks about stipends to be used for  graduate education or social work. That is what the bill is for. It is  not about putting cops on the street. It is about transferring wealth  from the people who funded their police and communities around the  country, who funded their police, and giving American tax dollars to  cities who didn't fund their police so they can use it for community  organizers.   That is what this bill is about. That is why we are against it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Arrington).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Fitzgerald).    Mr. Speaker, I have no idea what my distinguished  colleague and chairman of the committee was referring to there, but I  yield myself the balance of my time for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I would just add this: One of the phrases we heard from  the Democrats over the last couple of years is ``reimagined policing.''   Well, now we know what they mean. Now we get it. They want to take  money from communities who funded their police and give it to  communities who didn't, so they can get past this whole defund the  police that has been their mantra for the last couple years.   In fact, as I said before, I am surprised by some of the statements I  have heard from the chairman of the committee, because as I said, in  June of 2020--and it is a direct quote--``There should be substantial  cuts to the police budget. . . . `'--by Mr. Nadler.   Now he has got a bill that supposedly, they are saying, funds the  police, but we know it doesn't. It takes money from communities I get  the privilege of representing in west central Ohio who never, never  defunded their police. They made sure the men and women in blue got the  resources they needed to protect their communities.   And now the Democrats are saying: We want to take taxpayer dollars  from those communities and set up these grant programs so we can give  it to social workers. This is straight from the bill, so we can give  ``a stipend to be used for graduate education in the area of mental  health, public health, or social work. . . . `'   That is what they want the money to be used for, not for the people  who are stopping the crime that is happening in every major urban area  around the country.   That is why we are opposed to this legislation. I hope it goes down.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz), my friend and colleague, a member  of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Mr. Speaker, I would say, if this bill was so important-- we have had over 20 markups in the Judiciary Committee--why didn't this  bill come up? We have had markups in the last 2 days on one occasion,  so I don't know why this bill didn't come up.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is about giving dollars to community organizers.  This bill is most definitely--$5 billion goes to Health and Human  Services, $1.5 billion goes to the Department of Labor, zero money goes  to law enforcement.   In the last bill, they could at least make that case somewhat. This  bill you can't. It doesn't give one penny to law enforcement. In fact,  the legislation explicitly says it can't go to police officers and it  can't go to police departments.   But what it does do is this: sets up an Office of Community Violence  Intervention to administer programs or activities related to violence  intervention; it sets up a Community Violence Intervention Advisory  Committee; it sets up a National Community Violence Response Center.  Three new bureaucracies in the Department of HHS. I mean, wow.                                time  1445    This is all about taking money, taking American tax dollars from  communities who did fund their police and setting up three new  bureaucracies, $5 billion for community organizers.   If that is what you are for, vote for it, but I sure ain't. I know  the folks I represent and, I would guess, most Americans aren't for  that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, for reasons we have articulated on the  previous bills, we oppose this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock), my friend and colleague and  a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, I oppose the legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
