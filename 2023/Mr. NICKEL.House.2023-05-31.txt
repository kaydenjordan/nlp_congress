 Mr. Speaker, I rise today and stand in solidarity with my  fellow North Carolina delegation members to honor and remember the life  and legacy of Conen Morgan.   Conen was a friend and a giant in the world of North Carolina  political advocacy and public policy. He had an uncanny ability to  connect with people from all walks of life, bridging divides and  fostering a sense of unity.   He wanted everyone to have access to the American Dream. His passion  in life was to work for fairness and equity.   Conen left this world a brighter place for current and future  generations of North Carolinians. May we find strength in each other as  we remember the profound impact Conen Morgan made in our lives, and may  we strive to carry forward his legacy of compassion, dedication, and  tireless advocacy.                            ____________________
