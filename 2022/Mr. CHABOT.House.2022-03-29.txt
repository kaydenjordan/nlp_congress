 Mr. Speaker, I had the honor to serve 26 years here in  the House with Don Young.   There is an expression some of our Texans have about not messing with  Texas. Well, with Don Young, you knew not to mess with Alaska.   We butted heads on that several times, but we remained friends. When  my family and I went to Alaska some years ago, he told us the places  not to miss. It was a family vacation. It was wonderful. We stopped by  the State fair there, and we picked up ``I'm a Young Man'' buttons-- this is one today--and ``I'm a Young Woman'' buttons for my wife and  daughter. Periodically, I would wear it here in the House, and he  always got a kick out of that.   Now, Don Young is gone, and as they said about Lincoln, he now  belongs to the ages. He will be long remembered in this place, and he  will certainly be long remembered in Alaska.   May Don rest in peace.
