 Mr. Speaker, I come to the House floor today to honor an  amazing public servant in my community, public servant and a role  model, a Gwinnett County police officer by the name of Antwan Toney.   Mr. Speaker, Officer Toney was a California native, but he adopted my  local community at the age of 30 and knew that he could change the  world from that location. He was working not just to make the world  better, but to make us better as individuals--one community, one  family, one officer at the time. And, Mr. Speaker, with the infectious  smile you see here and a tireless work ethic and boundless energy, he  was doing exactly that in my hometown.   Mr. Speaker, I wish I was here just to honor Officer Toney today, but  on the afternoon of October 20, when responding to a call, Officer  Toney was killed. Mr. Speaker, I am appalled and pained by the  senselessness of this young man's murder.   Mr. Speaker, while our community aches over the loss of Officer  Toney, we also celebrate the life that he led and the role model that  he provided for all of us. Those who have been fortunate enough to know  Officer Toney are forever changed for the better by that experience. Of  all the places Officer Toney could have served, I am honored that he  chose our home to be the place for his incredibly proud work--again,  not just to make us safer, but to make us better.   Mr. Speaker, today, I pray for all of those who loved Officer Toney  and those whom he loved. I pray for all of his brothers and sisters in  uniform who, even in the face of this loss, wake up every single  morning and agree to serve once again.   May God bless all of them, Mr. Speaker, and may we give thanks to God  that He shares with each and every one of us heroes in our lives,  difference makers in our lives, difference makers like Officer Antwan  Toney.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
