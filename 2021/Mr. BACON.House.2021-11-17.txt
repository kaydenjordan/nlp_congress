 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  Build Back Better Act.   President Biden, Leader Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, and Chairman Bernie  Sanders have made it clear they want to transform America. In fact,  those are their words. They want to transform America using  reconciliation, the so-called Build Back Better Act. They are trying to  do it with a 50-50 Senate, a 3-seat majority in the House out of 435  Members, and a President that won by just two States.   Last November, the country did not vote for transformation, but for  middle-of-the-road centrist policies and steady leadership. That is not  what they got, and voters are mad.   Just look at the polling. The President sits at a 38 percent  favorable rating. The generic ballot for the House favors Republicans  by 11 points--the biggest margin seen in the history of this polling.   If there is any doubt, just review the recent results of Virginia  where a Republican was elected; in New Jersey where a Democrat squeaked  by in his reelection. A 12-point swing in Virginia and a 14-point swing  in New Jersey in just one year.   Our Nation does not desire to be a giant welfare State with cradle- to-grave government oversight controlling their lives. Last year, the  country didn't vote to give amnesty and government payouts for adults  who illegally crossed our borders and jumped to the front of the line  of those trying to come here through legal channels. The country did  not vote to hire 87,000 more IRS agents for auditing every-day  Americans to raise $400 billion to pay for their reckless spending  spree.   We need IRS agents to provide customer service to those still waiting  for their tax refunds, sometimes a year late, but not for more audits.  Americans didn't vote to raise taxes on a third of the middle class,  which is what the left-leaning Tax Policy Center stated is the case,  while it also found that two-thirds of millionaires will now get a tax  break at the same time because of the changes made to the SALT  deductions in this bad bill.   Americans didn't vote to remove the Hyde amendment that prevented our  tax dollars from paying for abortions, and they did not vote to remove  work requirements for able-bodied adults to receive welfare benefits.  Americans did not vote to impede and ban domestic energy and mineral  production, or to increase our reliance on China and OPEC. Our citizens  did not vote to raise taxes on natural gas that Americans use to heat  their homes, and we did not vote to undermine our research and  discovery of new drugs that can save people's lives.   Finally, Americans did not vote to give people earning up to $500,000  tax breaks for buying electric vehicles. The authors of this  legislation have either misjudged or ignored where the country is at on  these issues. This legislation is a total transformation, is what the  President is saying, but it is a giant, welfare-State transformation.  For these reasons, and many more, I will be voting ``no'' on the Build  Back Better Act, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I pray that moderate Democrats will say no, and like  many Americans, I am grateful that Senators Manchin and Sinema have  been voices of reason and commonsense. We need more of their voices.                            ____________________
