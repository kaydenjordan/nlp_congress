 Madam Speaker, I stand as an original cosponsor  of the Farm Workforce Modernization Act.   Agricultural workers are crucial to our economy and this bill would  establish a legal and reliable farm workforce.   I support this bill because it recognizes the humanity of farmworkers  and their families.   This is personal to me.   I grew up poor picking cotton in the fields of South Texas.   I can testify firsthand about the incredibly hard, back breaking work  farm workers do, especially in the heart of South Texas.   Not much has changed since I worked in the fields.   This bill is long overdue and would provide farm workers with  important worker protections and legal rights that they desperately  need.   Texas is home to nearly 250,000 farms and the need for a strong  agricultural workforce is vital.
