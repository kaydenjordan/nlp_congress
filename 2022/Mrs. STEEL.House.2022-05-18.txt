 Mr. Speaker, today, I stand with my fellow Orange County  Representatives to honor the courage and sacrifice of one of my  constituents.   On Sunday, Dr. John Cheng of Aliso Viejo drove his recently widowed  mother to her church in Laguna Woods. They were attending a special  lunch in honor of their pastor, who had just returned after 2 years in  Taiwan.   Just after lunch, a gunman opened fire, and Dr. Cheng gave his life  defending those around him. Local law enforcement agents said, without  Dr. Cheng's courage, there would have been more casualties that day.   He was a beloved son, husband, father of two, and a respected  physician. He was a hero.   We share our condolences with his family and stand here today to  honor his life.   Please join us in a moment of silence to honor Dr. Cheng.   May he rest in peace, and may his courage never be forgotten.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7791, the Access to  Baby Formula Act, a bipartisan bill I am proud to lead with my  colleague from Connecticut.   The shortage of infant formula across the country has led to panic  and desperation among so many families. As a parent, there is nothing  more important than ensuring the health and safety of your child. As  families continue to bear the brunt of crippling inflation, this  formula shortage only compounds the stress that these families are  facing at home.   It is estimated that the cost of baby formula is up almost 20 percent  in the last year. More than 40 percent of the top-selling baby formula  products were out of stock as of the beginning of this month. Families  desperate to feed their babies shouldn't have to face empty shelves  because of government mismanagement and overregulation.   We should have never gotten to this point, but this bipartisan  legislation will provide certainty for recipients and manufacturers,  ensuring this crisis doesn't happen again.   Under this bill, WIC participants and infant formula manufacturers  will receive the clarity they need in the event of another emergency or  supply chain disruption. The bill requires infant formula manufacturers  to have a plan that will detail how they will address an emergency or  disruption, so WIC participants aren't impacted.   Importantly, the bill also includes strict timelines so the companies  and WIC participants will know the rules of the road during a  disruption.   Finally, this bill includes important transparency requirements so  the public will know what the administration is doing to remedy this  crisis and prevent future disruptions. I am pleased that we were able  to come together and put American families first.   Madam Speaker, families deserve to have this weight lifted off their  shoulders. It is time to act and pass this resolution.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1915     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   It is undeniable that the nationwide baby formula shortage has  created immense panic and desperation among families. From skyrocketing  inflation and gas prices, to rising violent crime, the American people  are being faced with crisis after crisis. The last thing families need  right now is a shortage of such essential goods as baby formula.   In the United States of America, no parent should be unsure of how  they will feed their infant child. We need to act today to reverse the  effects of this shortage on American families, and the bipartisan bill  before us today offers an opportunity to right this ship.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
