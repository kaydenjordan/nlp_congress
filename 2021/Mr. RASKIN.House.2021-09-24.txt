 Mr. Speaker, the women of Texas are citizens of the  United States, but they are being treated like outlaws by their own  legislature.   Under the Texas law, any person, including murderers, serial rapists,  sexual harassers, January 6 insurrectionists, or Texas State  legislators themselves, can sue doctors, nurses, mothers, fathers,  medical personnel, simply for helping a woman in Texas exercise her  constitutional rights under Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey  for $10,000.   You want to give $10,000 to a total stranger for helping your  daughter through a personal crisis caused by a rape? Move to Texas.   You want to join the GOP in turning America into a nation of  theocratic busybodies and vigilante bounty hunters policing other  people's families? Go right ahead.   But for me, I am standing with the Constitution of the United States.  I am voting for the Women's Health Protection Act, and I am proud that  we are passing it today.                            ____________________
