 Mr. President, this is National Police Week. It is a  time every year when we stop to pay tribute to our law enforcement  officers around the country, the men and women in blue who serve us  every day in my State of Ohio and every State represented in this  Chamber.   We also remember the brave law enforcement officers who tragically  died in the line of duty. We can never forget this is a dangerous  profession. The National Law Enforcement Memorial and Museum reported  that 2020 was the deadliest year for law enforcement in decades. In  Ohio alone, we sadly lost six brave law enforcement officers over the  past year. Here in the Capitol, of course, we lost three officers over  the past year, including on January 6. In the course of our Nation's  history, more than 24,000 officers have died in the line of duty.   I was proud to join colleagues in March in sponsoring legislation  called the Protect and Serve Act, which would create Federal penalties  on those who would attempt to harm or kill a police officer. I believe  Protect and Serve would send a strong message to help deter these  crimes. Ultimately, I think it would make our men and women in blue  safer and help save lives.   This week, I urge my colleagues to join me in standing with the  families of our fallen police officers and thanking them and thanking  law enforcement for what they do every day to protect us. One way to  express our gratitude is passing laws that will assist them in their  critical work to keep us safe.                               Opioid Epidemic    With that in mind, I am also on the floor today to call on my  colleagues to support our law enforcement by taking decisive action to  help them to keep some of the deadliest drugs in the world from coming  into our communities. It is not an overstatement to say that this is a  matter of life or death.   Overdose deaths in the United States have sadly reached a record high  during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to recent data from the Centers  for Disease Control, 87,000 Americans died during the 12-month period  between September 2019 and September 2020, the most recent data we  have. This can be directly attributed to the circumstances surrounding  the pandemic. So many families are feeling the pain of these losses.  Sadly, based on the current trends, we expect calendar year 2020 in  full to be even worse.   What is the main driver of these overdoses and overdose deaths?  Synthetic opioids, most notably fentanyl. Fentanyl is 50 times more  powerful than heroin, relatively inexpensive, deadly, and incredibly  addictive. For years, this has been coming to our shores from China,  first predominantly  [[Page S2439]]  through our mail system, and with our new legislation in place to  prevent that from happening, much of it is now coming in through  Mexico. In 2019, there were 70,630 deaths from opioids and other drugs,  and more than half of those--36,359--involved fentanyl, sometimes mixed  with other drugs like cocaine and crystal meth or heroin.   Again, of all the poisons, fentanyl is the most deadly. It does have  a medical purpose and can be used to treat patients in severe pain the  same way morphine is used.   Both fentanyl and morphine are classified under schedule II by the  drug enforcement authorities. In order to avoid prosecution under that  scheduling order, drug traffickers started making slight modifications  to fentanyl, creating what we call fentanyl analogs or fentanyl-related  substances, essentially copycat fentanyl.   Evil scientists in places like China, Mexico, and India, working in  unregulated pharmaceutical plants, will make a slight modification to  fentanyl, sometimes adjusting a single molecule, to create what are,  essentially, these fentanyl copycats.   While these copycats may have the same narcotic properties as  fentanyl, these tiny variations allow these traffickers to evade  prosecution.   Oftentimes, by the way, these fentanyl-related substitutes, these  copycats, are even more powerful than fentanyl itself. Take, for  example, carfentanil.   These fentanyl-related substances are the reason I am on the floor  today. In 2018--2018--in recognition of the growing threat these  copycats posed to our public health, the DEA temporarily scheduled  fentanyl-related substances as schedule I, the highest designation they  can give.   Since then, we have passed two temporary extensions of that  designation. Most recently, Congress passed a 5-month extension just  ahead of the previous deadline of May 6, just a couple weeks ago, and  President Biden signed that legislation into law last week.   I supported that temporary extension because the alternative was  worse. The only alternative was to let these substances become legal.  But I don't think kicking the can down the road for another 5 months is  nearly enough to safeguard against the threat of copycat fentanyl. We  need to do much more between now and when this temporary scheduling  extension expires in October.   Law enforcement needs certainty, and the drug cartels and those evil  scientists need to know we are serious in addressing this problem, that  there will be consequences.   We need a permanent solution. Specifically, let's pass bipartisan  legislation I introduced with my colleague Senator Manchin called FIGHT  Fentanyl, which simply says: Let's not allow these illicitly  manufactured and deadly synthetic opioids to suddenly become legal  again. That is what law enforcement wants. That is what our communities  demand. That is what we deserve to give them. It is long overdue that  we make this designation permanent.   I know some of my colleagues oppose permanent scheduling of these  fentanyl drugs because they are concerned about mandatory minimum  sentences, and also that it could hinder research into future  medications to treat addiction. Let me address both of those quickly.   First, there is this concern about the harsh punishments that don't  fit the nature of the crime. I share that concern. That is why our  legislation ensures that mandatory minimum sentences are not  automatically imposed in any criminal case. We want the judge to look  at the severity of the crime and consider all relevant factors in  sentencing. So that issue has been addressed in our bipartisan  legislation.   There has been a great deal of conversation about the impact of  prosecutions and incarcerations on specific populations, including  minority communities. What is often lost in this debate, I will say, is  the growing impact of fatal overdoses in those same communities. Since  2016, while White fatalities have decreased through the period of 2019,  the data we have shows that overdoses from opioids among Black  Americans, particularly Black men, have actually gotten worse, not  better.   From 2011 to 2016, that same time period, when White overdoses and  deaths were reduced, Black Americans had the highest increase in  synthetic opioid-involved overdose deaths, compared to all populations.   And while in 2017 to 2018 overall opioid-involved overdose fatalities  decreased by just over 4 percent, rates among Black and Hispanic  Americans actually increased. This is an issue we must address here.   Another issue my colleagues have raised, again, is concern that  permanently scheduling fentanyl and its analogues somehow hinders  research into treating addiction. First of all, I agree we need this  research. We need it badly. One example of this is coming up with  naloxone, a miracle drug based on heroin that actually reverses the  effects of an overdose.   I spoke to the scientist, Roger Crystal, just last week, who  developed the nasal version of this naloxone. It is a miracle. I have  seen it work, and it saves lives.   Researchers have told me there are barriers to being approved to  legally research schedule I substances. There is also a stigma to  conducting this kind of research, even though we know that it could  lead to the development of new treatments. But this is something we can  easily address by allowing qualified researchers the ability to study  fentanyl analogues under schedule II as opposed to schedule I. So we  can address that issue.   I am open to working with my colleagues to address these barriers,  and I believe that we can do that through the legislation creating  flexibility in the registration system for scientists.   But I would urge my colleagues that we need to use the next 5 months  to do the hard work of finding a permanent solution to this crisis  before we have to once again run the risk of letting these drugs become  legal and the message that that sends and the deaths that would occur  as a result. The U.S. Senate can take the lead and permanently classify  these dangerous narcotics that are literally killing tens of thousands  of our fellow citizens every year. Instead of kicking the can down the  road again for 5 months from now, let's make it permanent. The House  and the Biden administration should support this effort. Lives are at  stake.   It is important that we continue to focus this body, as we have, on  the demand side of this equation--prevention, treatment, longer term  recovery for fentanyl and for other substances.   But it is also important that we not allow these substances to come  on the streets at lower and lower costs and at greater and greater  volumes. That is what would happen if we do not move as a Congress to  ensure that these fentanyl copycats and fentanyl itself remain illicit  drugs, as they are.   Let's do the right thing for our community. Let's do the right thing  for law enforcement. Let's be sure they have the predictability and  certainty in law enforcement to know that these criminals can be  prosecuted, these traffickers.   We need to act now to address the threat of these deadly fentanyl  drugs coming into our communities. I urge the Senate to pass the FIGHT  Fentanyl bill. Join us in this effort so we can better work to reverse  the tragic rise in overdose deaths around the United States of America.   I yield the floor                                 S.J. Res. 15     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize my  friend, Father Michael J. Graham, on his retirement as the 34th  president of Xavier University in my hometown of Cincinnati, OH, and to  thank him for his more than 34 years of service at Xavier helping to  cultivate young leaders and developing Musketeer students with the  Jesuit values of becoming ``men and women for others.''   Father Graham started at Xavier in 1984 as an assistant history  professor. After pursuing his master of divinity from the Weston School  of Theology, he returned to Xavier in 1989. He was appointed vice  president for university relations in 1994 and was inaugurated  president of Xavier University on September 8, 2001.   Father Graham is the longest serving president in Xavier University's  history, and over the past 20 years, he has had an incredible impact on  the university, the Cincinnati community, and the more than 30,000  students who have  [[Page S2445]]  graduated from Xavier University during his tenure. He has helped raise  over $500 million to fund scholarships, advance the academic  experience, support community projects, and advance the development of  the university.   In the community, Father Graham's passion to connect and collaborate  with local and regional communities inspired him to establish the  Community Building Institute as well as the Eigel Center for Community  Engagement at Xavier. In 2017, Father Graham was asked to chair the  Cincinnati Preschool Promise Board of Directors, a voter-approved  initiative to ensure that quality preschool is available and affordable  to all children living within the Cincinnati school district. It is one  of many ways he has extended his and Xavier's reach into critical  issues that impact the Cincinnati community.   Since Father Graham began his presidency, U.S. News & World Report  has consistently listed Xavier among the Nation's top 10 Midwest  universities. Under his leadership, the university has expanded to  offer master's programs in coaching education and athlete development,  health economic and clinical outcomes research, customer analytics, and  others. The impact of President Graham's academic and community-based  vision for Xavier is far reaching. Father Mike will be missed, but his  legacy will be felt for generations to come.                            ____________________
