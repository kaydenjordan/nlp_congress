 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  life of Mr. Cameron Walters, who passed away at the age of 21 on  Friday, December 6, during the barbaric attack on Naval Air Station  Pensacola.   Originally from Richmond Hill in the First Congressional District of  Georgia, Mr. Walters was a pilot in training at the naval air station.   He had recently passed an exam in order to stand watch over the  entrances to the station, and when the shots rang out, it was his first  time on guard duty.   Before the tragic attack, Mr. Walters joined the Navy to follow in  his father's footsteps and build a better sense of purpose in life.   His father remembers that when he graduated boot camp, the grin on  his face said it all. He was so proud to have the opportunity to earn  his wings as a Navy airman.   For his friends and classmates, his bright personality and sense of  humor could light up any room he walked into.   It is truly devastating that Mr. Walters' life was cut so short by  this tragic event, a life which had so much enthusiasm to serve his  country and make this world a better place to live.   Mr. Walters' family and friends will be in my thoughts and prayers  during this most difficult time.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   We have a situation here where we all want the same thing. We all  want to bring down prescription drug prices. We want the same thing. We  need the same thing. We can achieve the same thing. We can achieve the  same thing without taking the risk of drugs not coming to the market.   Physicians take an oath when they graduate from medical school, it is  called the Hippocratic Oath. It says, ``first, do no harm.'' Now,  whether you believe the Congressional Budget Office that it will be  eight to 15 drugs, or whether you believe the Council of Economic  Advisers that it will be over 100 drugs, even if it is one drug, that  is one drug too many.                                time  0945    It is simply a chance we cannot afford to take. Every one of us in  this body knows a story, knows someone who has suffered from that awful  disease Alzheimer's. It is an awful disease.   Barbara Lutz tells the story about her husband, Richard, who suffered  from that disease. She tells the story about how she and her family  suffered through that with him. Oftentimes, it is the caregivers who  suffer so much.   Finally, Richard has succumbed to that disease after a 7-year fight.  Now, people who are diagnosed or who have family and loved ones who are  diagnosed with Alzheimer's come up to Barbara and ask her: ``What do I  do? What do I do?'' Barbara simply told me: ``All I can tell them is to  pray for a cure.''   This is not a Republican-Democratic issue. This is our issue. This is  America's issue. We have to solve it together, and we can do that.
