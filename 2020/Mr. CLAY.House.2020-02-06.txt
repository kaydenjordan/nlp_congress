 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National Gun  Violence Survivors Week.   When gun violence occurs in a community, lives are too often lost,  but for survivors, the neighborhoods they know and love are never the  same.   This is especially true when gun violence impacts our young people.  Despite the terrible loss of so many young lives in my district last  year, I see hope in the messages from their peers.   I recently heard from some high school students who shared their  stories and support for a bill I introduced with Congresswoman Robin  Kelly, H.R. 3435, the Local Public Health and Safety Act, to empower  local communities to address gun violence.   These students believe we can make changes to heal our communities  and prevent future tragedies. I agree and join them in a renewed call  to action on behalf of survivors everywhere.                            ____________________
