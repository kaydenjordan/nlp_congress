 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and  thank Louisiana's brave first responders who valiantly rose to the  occasion this summer as our State was hit with unprecedented wildfires,  the largest of which is still burning today.   We had tens of thousands of acres that have been charred. Nearly half  of the parishes in my district were ablaze. At one time, parts of  Sabine, Beauregard, Allen, Vernon, Natchitoches, Grant, Caddo, and  DeSoto Parishes were all on fire.   Our communities received support from the State fire marshal, the  State police, the National Guard, as well as nearly every local police  and fire department in the region. The U.S. Forestry Service dispatched  firefighters from many States around the country to help.   Many of the first responders have been volunteers, Louisianans who  donated time, money, and shelter to their neighbors in need. This  disaster tested our State more than ever, but we responded.   Louisiana is home to the most resilient people you will ever meet,  and we will bounce back from these wildfires just as we have done after  every disaster we have ever faced. It is a great honor to represent so  many of these heroic individuals in Congress.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my  Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, barring declarations of war,  impeachment is the most awesome power that Congress has. It shouldn't  be a threat. It shouldn't be a political exercise. It is certainly not  a pledge to be made on the campaign trail.   This is the most serious business that we can engage in. No one  should want to impeach a President or take any pleasure in that.  However, after months of blocked investigations by agencies in this  administration, it became clear that an impeachment inquiry was the  only course of action to complete our necessary and important  investigations.   Let me explain why because there has been some confusion and some  controversy about this.   Mr. Speaker, there are three irrefutable facts that have taken us to  this point.   One, President Biden lied directly to the American people.   Two, President Biden's family and their associates profited millions  through shell companies.   Three, President Biden's Federal agencies are stonewalling our  legitimate congressional inquiry.   That is just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many scandals.  There is so much corruption that is being uncovered. Every stone that  we overturn leads to more and more corruption.   Because of that, Mr. Speaker, a lot of the American people are simply  getting lost in the barrage of evidence, in the barrage of allegations  of corruption, and the evidence itself.   Let me go through just a couple of highlights here to bring  everybody's attention to this to help explain why we are doing what we  are doing.   In August 2019, President Biden said: ``I have never discussed with  my son or my brother or anyone else anything having to do with their  businesses, period.''   Two months later, he said: ``I never discussed a single thing with my  son about anything having to do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I  have. We have always kept everything separate.''   He then doubled down on those claims during the debates, and both Jen  Psaki and Karine Jean-Pierre have echoed that straight from the White  House press briefing room.   Make no mistake about this: Everyone now knows those were all bald- faced lies.   While President Biden was Vice President, we know now that he had  dinner at least twice with his son, Hunter, and Russian and Kazakhstani  oligarchs. He spoke on the phone at least 20 times with Hunter's  associates.  [[Page H4279]]  He met with CEFC, a Chinese energy company, while Hunter was working on  their behalf.   Here is a text message from Hunter Biden that alone is justification  for an inquiry: ``Z--Please have the director call me, not James or  Tony or Jim. Have him call me tonight. I am sitting here with my  father, and we would like to understand why the commitment made has not  been fulfilled.''    A confidential human source, known well to the FBI and relied upon  often, alleged that President Biden received a $5 million bribe for  services rendered.   The House Oversight Committee investigation has been going on for a  while, and the investigation has yielded many important facts. Here are  a couple of examples the investigators have found.   They found that Hunter Biden flew on Air Force Two at least 15 times  and engaged in activities that Devon Archer testified were to sell the  brand and enrich the Biden family.   They found an email from Biden associate James Gillar that breaks  down the profit agreement for a deal involving the Chinese Communist  Party-linked CEFC, including ``10 held by H for the big guy.''   They found a text message later that month from Gillar to Tony  Bobulinski, which read: ``Don't mention Joe being involved. It is only  when you are face-to-face. I know you know that, but they are  paranoid.''   This is just a sampling of what we already know. This impeachment  inquiry will offer House investigators greater subpoena authority to  receive information from evasive Federal agencies.   We have been impeded in the collection of all this evidence because  the Federal agencies under the executive branch are openly,  aggressively trying to protect the President. We are going to have  advanced authority now and a larger platform to share this information  with the American people.   Mr. Speaker, remember how we arrived here. When the New York Post  reported the existence of the Hunter Biden laptop, now-Secretary of  State Anthony Blinken organized a group of 51 former intelligence  officials to claim the laptop was Russian disinformation. Social media  accounts were banned from sharing the story, and individuals who  believed it were labeled Russian assets and conspiracy theorists.   We now know that not only was the laptop not Russian disinformation,  of course, but it was known previously to the intel community and many  of the individuals who signed that letter. They knew it was legitimate.  They knew it was not Russian disinformation. They knew it came from  Hunter Biden, and they hid it from the American people.   On July Fourth, just a couple of months ago, the Federal district  court in the Western District of Louisiana, my home State, issued a  155-page court opinion. The State of Louisiana and State of Missouri  sued the Biden administration because they had a hunch and knew that  the White House and its agencies, including the FBI, the DOJ, and other  Federal agencies, were engaged in a coverup. They were censoring and  silencing the viewpoints of Americans they disagreed with. They would  not allow conservative speech on the social media platforms.   We know from the evidence produced in that case and listed in the  155-page court opinion that issued an injunction against the White  House. By the way, just last Saturday, that was upheld by the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The court points out that Elvis  Chan, the FBI official in the San Francisco field office, was meeting  regularly with the Big Tech platforms in Silicon Valley leading up to  the election and telling them things that they had to pull off the  internet, conservative voices and social media postings that they  didn't want people to see. The FBI coerced, the court said, and then  coordinated with the Big Tech giants to make sure that on Facebook,  Google, and Twitter at the time, and all these other platforms, you  couldn't see that information.   It wasn't just the Hunter Biden laptop story. It was a lot of  categories of things. It included negative information about the  economy. It included people's opinions, conservative's opinions about  the efficacy of COVID vaccines and the lockdowns, how crazy that was,  and what they were doing to schoolchildren. All that was censored.   They even took down jokes about the President. If you posted a parody  about President Biden, even as a candidate or after he was elected, it  was pulled off the internet.   It is unbelievable. It is staggering. The judge's words in the court  that this is arguably the largest and the greatest attack on free  speech in U.S. history. He called it Orwellian. He said it was  dystopian.   This is what we are facing. This is what this White House has been  involved in. They did not want the American people to have the facts,  and that is one of the reasons that we have to go to this next step.   That is why, Mr. Speaker, we have to follow these facts where they  lead. The facts are irrefutable. They have understandably set  Washington ablaze, even though the American people weren't able to see  it. The judge said that millions of free-speech-protected postings were  taken down from the internet and not seen. Yet, it has set Washington  ablaze. Why? Because we are bringing these facts to bear. We are laying  them out for people to see.   Our colleagues here, some of them, don't want to see it. As John  Adams said, ``Facts are stubborn things.'' As expected, the D.C. and  national press corps have blindly accepted the White House's spin and  are trying to convince the American people that our inquiry, even the  impeachment inquiry, is illegitimate just 3 years after they carried  the water for Adam Schiff and the Democrats on their crazy impeachment  quests against Donald Trump.   Here is a sampling of the headlines so far. Now, remember, we just  announced the impeachment inquiry step yesterday. Here it is so far.   From Time magazine: ``Biden inquiry may be weakest in history.''   From CNN: ``The most predictable impeachment investigation in  American history.''   From Reuters: ``McCarthy opens long-shot impeachment probe of  Biden.''   From MSNBC: ``McCarthy's Biden impeachment inquiry is the Benghazi  investigation on steroids.''   These headlines are going to increase. We know it is coming. We know  that they are working against us, against the American people, in this  case, and for the White House. They are on their team. We get it.    CNN is reporting this week that the White House is urging news  executives to ramp up scrutiny of our investigation. In fact, now there  is a memo going around that they sent to all the big news agencies. As  if weaponizing the Federal agencies wasn't enough, President Biden is  now publicly directing the free press to play defense for him. Do you  know what? They are willingly going along with it.   Mr. Speaker, why? I am just going to ask this question. It is a  rhetorical one. Nobody can answer it here, of course, but we are trying  to seek the answer to this. I think we know. If there was no  impropriety, why wouldn't the President provide congressional  investigators with all the information we have requested? What do they  have to hide?   The President could make the short trip from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  tomorrow. He could sit down with our committees. He could clear his  name. We could do that behind closed doors. We could do it very  discreetly, with all the protection he needs. In fact, we would welcome  it.   Let this be an open invitation to President Biden. I know the White  House is recording all this. They are watching what we do here. Here is  the open invitation: President Biden, Secretary Blinken, any of the  Biden family members and associates, or anyone who seeks to clear their  name, anybody involved in this investigation at all, you can come right  here. You are welcome here in Congress to our committees.                                time  1800    We on the House Judiciary Committee, House Oversight Committee,  Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, the  Ways and Means Committee, any of them--pick your committee--and we will  bring you in and you can clear your name.   Mr. Speaker, we would love to return our full focus to our regular  and important work here, but the fact is our sworn oath to defend the  Constitution  [[Page H4280]]  requires this inquiry. I will close with this--and I am going to bring  up a couple of my colleagues who will share their thoughts, as well-- but remember that Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution itself  expressly states that the sole power of impeachment belongs here to  this House. Then Article II, Section 4 says--listen to the language  carefully. It is expressly written in the Constitution. These are not  political talking points. We are not making this up. It says in Article  II, Section 4 that the President shall be removed from office on  impeachment for and conviction of treason, bribery, or other high  crimes and misdemeanors.   Mr. Speaker, I listed just a small sampling, just the tip of the  iceberg of the credible allegations and the mounting evidence that  shows that Joseph Biden has engaged in bribery schemes, pay-to-play  schemes. This is what the evidence shows.   We have to follow it. We took an oath to uphold the Constitution. The  Constitution requires this action. The inquiry is the appropriate step.  We have no choice but to pursue the facts wherever they lead, and we  will leave no stone unturned.   Mr. Speaker, I yield next to the great gentleman from Utah (Mr.  Owens), not only a Super Bowl champion but also a wonderful  Congressman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Idaho (Mr. Fulcher).    Mr. Speaker, I ask the gentleman before he  leaves the podium today: I was told by automobile dealers who were in  my office from the district that the State of California has banned the  combustion engine. Is that a rumor or is that true?    I yield to the gentleman from Idaho.    Isn't it true then that if California,  which is one of the largest markets for vehicles, bans the sale of the  combustion engine, then the car manufacturers, if they want to do  business in California, are going to have to shift lots of their  production lines to these vehicles that, by the way, no one wants, and  they are not affordable or maintainable. As I understand it, if the  battery goes it costs you another $100,000 for an already overpriced  vehicle that no one wants or can charge up. Isn't that then going to  affect the automobile market in every other State, and your ability to  get a truck or a car?     Exactly.    Mr. Speaker, I think the people are calling  upon us to bring common sense to this equation because this team on the  other side who is pushing this radical climate agenda is engaged in  fantasy economics.   The people in my State of Louisiana need their trucks and cars. They  are not going to buy electric vehicles. They can't afford them, first  of all. It is not practical because there is nowhere to charge them in  my State.   If we have a shortage of vehicles on the market that is going to be a  real problem. I am told delivery trucks are involved in this in  California, and if you can't get the fruit shipped from California,  that means the prices at the grocery store are going to go up, as well.  Everyone is going to suffer from this; isn't that true?    Mr. Speaker, it is about government  control. I thank the gentleman for his work on that, and we urge our  colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa),  the gentleman from the northern portion of California.  [[Page H4281]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his  remarks.   Sadly, what happens in California, that giant market out there,  affects the entire country. I appreciate him shining light on that.   Mr. Speaker, I will wind down our Special Order hour just by  returning to the issue of the impeachment inquiry.   Even as I have been sitting here, I got a question from a Hill  reporter about some of the Senators in the other Chamber and their  reaction to our bringing forward the impeachment inquiry.   I just want to say that, to speak very frankly, whether or not the  Senate is courageous enough to confront the alleged corruption of  President Biden is not really the House's concern.   As I mentioned earlier, it is Article I of the Constitution, Section  2, that gives the sole power of impeachment to us in the House. We are  supposed to investigate these things. We have to do it. It is our  constitutional responsibility. They will later try the matter, if it  comes to them.   If our committee uncovers evidence, if our investigations uncover  evidence that lead to an impeachment vote indeed, then it will be  incumbent, when we send it over to the Senate, to decide if they want  to engage with those facts. They will have to answer to their own  constituents and voters and the American people, but we will have done  our job here.   If the inquiry comes up fruitless, say some evidence is determined  and uncovered that completely exonerates  [[Page H4283]]  President Biden, then we will have concluded a legitimate congressional  inquiry as directed by the Constitution, and we will be satisfied with  that and the American people will be satisfied. Some will be frustrated  whatever happens at the outcome of this, but the Constitution will have  been followed and upheld. On our side, that is the most important thing  here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
