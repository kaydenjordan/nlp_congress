 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 9, the Climate  Action Now Act. I am a proud cosponsor of the bill and a longtime  supporter of the Paris climate accord.   With the Northwest on catastrophic fire alert every year, everyone  out west knows full well that climate change is a real and serious  threat that needs addressing.   To that end, we cannot abdicate the United States' very serious  responsibility to lead the world in curbing the effects of climate  change. That is why I have strongly opposed the President's reckless  decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which has seriously  damaged U.S. credibility on the world stage.   The Paris Agreement stresses the dire importance of international  cooperation in combating the climate crisis. We must work together with  countries around the world if we are to achieve any sort of meaningful  dent in greenhouse gas emissions.   I am proud that my State of Oregon remains committed to the goals of  the Paris Agreement, but one State's efforts cannot combat climate  change alone. We need the Climate Action Now Act to keep the entire  country committed to the Paris Agreement.   I urge support for the bill.
