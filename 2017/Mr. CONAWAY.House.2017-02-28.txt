 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a constituent of  mine who is here with us today. Chaplain Harvey H. Klee, a resident of  Llano, Texas, joins us today as the national chaplain of the American  Legion.   We just heard Chaplain Klee give a beautiful invocation, calling for  us all to be unified in our actions, with the best interest of the  American people at heart. Chaplain Klee has dedicated himself to living  by those words, serving our Nation and its people in many ways.   Chaplain Klee served in the Navy during the Korean war and later  worked as a missionary helping drug addicts and designing training  programs for inmates at a prison in California.   Later, he founded the Texas Chaplains Association, and has been  appointed Texas Department Chaplain nine times, which is more times  than any other chaplain in the history of the department.   Chaplain Klee, thank you for joining us today and reminding us of the  great power of our Lord, Jesus Christ.  [[Page H1362]]                                ____________________
