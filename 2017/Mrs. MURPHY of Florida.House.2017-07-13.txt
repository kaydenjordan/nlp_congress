 Mr. Chairman, I am proud to co-lead this  bipartisan amendment. It would strike section 541 of the bill, a  provision that would make it nearly impossible for graduates of the  military service academies to play professional football, basketball,  or any other sport.    I serve on the Board of Visitors at West Point, and I believe section  541 will be detrimental to recruitment and morale at the service  academies, could undermine efforts to bridge the military-civilian  divide through the use of sports ambassadors, and could compromise the  effectiveness of our officer corps.   If our amendment is successful, the policy governing the  circumstances under which graduates can play professional sports will  be the guidance issued by Secretary Mattis earlier this year. Pursuant  to Secretary Mattis' guidance, an academy graduate must complete 2  years of active commissioned service before he or she can seek approval  to pursue a professional sports opportunity.   Section 541 goes far beyond this existing guidance, requiring a  graduate to serve 5 years on Active Duty before pursuing a professional  sports opportunity. This is the functional equivalent of prohibiting a  graduate from playing professional sports altogether.   Section 541 applies retroactively to current academy student  athletes, not just prospectively to future athletes, which strikes me  as unfair. Moreover, it removes the flexibility and discretion built  into Secretary Mattis' guidance, replacing it with a one-size-fits-all  policy that allows for no exceptions. Before Congress takes such  drastic action, we should carefully weigh the arguments for and against  such action. That process has not taken place.   I ask my colleagues to support this amendment and to allow Secretary  Mattis' guidance to remain in effect until such time as we can examine  this issue more fully.
