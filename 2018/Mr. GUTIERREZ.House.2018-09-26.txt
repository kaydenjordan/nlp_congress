 Mr. Speaker, I am a member of the Judiciary Committee  in this body, and, unfortunately, the Framers of the Constitution  didn't give my committee or this Chamber a role in vetting and  confirming the President's nominee to the Supreme Court.   But in the House, we pride ourselves as being the people's House  because we are in constant contact with our constituents. So while I do  not have a vote in the process, I do have a voice. As an elected  Representative, I feel a sacred responsibility to raise my voice.   First of all, I don't care when the allegations of sexual assault  came forward. I don't care about whatever schedule Senator Chuck  Grassley thinks is more important. I don't care about the impending  fall term of the Court or the timing of Robert Mueller's next  indictments in his investigation of the Trump White House and campaign.   In the case of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, we should listen to the women.  We should always listen to the women, but in this case, multiple women  have come forward to risk their lives and reputations because they  believe the truth about Judge Kavanaugh must come out before he is  confirmed or rejected by the Senate.   Women in this country should know that if you come forward to make  credible allegations against anyone, you will be respected and you will  be heard.   Do you want to know why so few sexual assaults are reported in this  country? Well, it is unfolding on the national stage: Why didn't she  report it? Why didn't she do something more? Why didn't she say  something earlier?   It is always she, she, she, when we know that sexual assault is not  her fault, and fear of coming forward is not her fault either.   They didn't believe Bill Cosby's accusers until they did, or Harvey  Weinstein, or Speaker Hastert's, or a hundred other people I could name  here today, until we did.   When the stakes are this high, we shouldn't be imposing deadlines or  ultimatums or requiring victims to conform to our timetables, as  Republican Senators have done. And by high stakes, I don't mean just  the lifetime appointment of a judge, but this is an important moment  for young men and young women in this country. They are watching, and  they are learning.   We should be leading by example and allowing victims to come forward,  be respected, and be heard.   Do I want my grandson to learn a lesson that sexual assault while he  is in high school could follow him for the rest of his life? You are  damn right I do.   Do I want young men to learn that behavior that hurts other people,  no matter how drunk or how high they are, is unacceptable? You are damn  right I do.   Do I want young women to not be afraid to come forward, no matter  when they are ready to? You are damn right I do.   Look, I am not saying you need to believe Judge Kavanaugh's accuser,  but as a Congress and as a country, we need to listen to women.   Now, I will admit that I would not vote for Judge Kavanaugh whether  or not the current allegations are true or Republicans steamroll the  victims to fast track his appointment. I believe in a woman's right to  control their own reproductive system, regardless of what men think.  So, yeah, you can bet I would vote against him.   I believe freedom of religion should extend to all, including those  of the Muslim faith, who should be able to worship and move around just  like everyone else. So you can bet I would vote against Kavanaugh.   I believe people should marry whomever they want, whomever they love.  I oppose a judge who thinks a sitting President is above the law right  now when we need as a Nation an independent judiciary to hold  politicians, even the President, accountable, which is another reason I  wouldn't vote for Judge Kavanaugh.   But what is important right now is not how I feel about Judge  Kavanaugh. What is important is that we lead by example. We need to be  clear that the days of, ``Boys will be boys,'' or, ``It was just locker  room talk,'' are over.   Mr. Speaker, the Senate should take as much time as is needed to take  very seriously this situation. They should take it seriously for our  daughters, for our sons, for you, and for me, too.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this bill does not come to the floor in a  vacuum. The midterms are coming, and Republicans will try to pass  whatever they can before they lose and pass the gavel to the new  speaker.   We know more indictments and guilty pleas are coming from Robert  Mueller and his team.   And we know Republicans are having a hard time defending tax cuts  where 83 percent of the cuts went to the richest 1 percent and the rest  of America got the leftovers.   Don't forget the Republican agenda to systematically strip away  healthcare coverage from American families who are struggling to make  ends meet.   No, the Republicans don't want to talk about tax breaks,  billionaires, or foreign Russian alliances of this President, Trump.  They want to talk about San Francisco and immigrants.   Republicans will do anything to beat up on immigrants so that voters  forget to beat up on Republicans who hold all the power. It is the  oldest political hokey-doke trick in the book: Hey, look over there.  Blame them, not us.   It started with immigrants are rapists and murderers. Then it was  immigrants are cheats and frauds. Then they said immigrants and their  children deserve to be locked up. Then the President started pushing  the biggest lie of all, that immigrants are a drain on the economy.   The Attorney General, despite being humiliated--I mean humiliated--on  a daily basis by this President is adopting a scorched earth, anti- immigrant agenda to ensure as many deportations as he can before he  gets the axe.   The American people are smart enough to see through this smoke  screen. They see how Republicans deal with a woman's claim of sexual  assault. They understand their taxes are going up at the same time  taxes on the Republicans' favorite people, that is to say,  corporations, are going down.    They get the message that the President opposes immigrant families,  except when it comes to his wife and her ability to make her own family  citizens of the United States of America. They understand Republicans  are opposed to legal immigration, refugees, Dreamers, and TPS holders.   Republicans are not interested in the kinds of immigrants or the  kinds of average American families, for that matter, who wake up early  every day and have to go to work. Nope. Not the people who work at Mar- a-Lago, not the people who tend to the greens at Trump golf courses,  not the people who clean rooms at Trump Tower.   No, Republicans are not interested in people who work at Trump Tower,  only the people who can afford to live there.   Well, your time is up. The American people will make that real clear  in a few weeks, regardless of how many of these resolutions you pass.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution.
