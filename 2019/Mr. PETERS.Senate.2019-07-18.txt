 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 50 years ago, more than 650 million men,  women, and children from nearly every corner of the Earth gathered  around radios and televisions with wide eyes and quickly beating  hearts. They gathered to witness one of the greatest triumphs of  ingenuity and cooperation in human history. Scrawled across television  screens were the words never seen before: ``Live from the Moon.''   I remember that moment vividly. I was 10 years old, and I was in  France with my mother and my French family, my grandma and grandpa, and  we huddled around a little black and white TV in my grandma's home on  July 20, 1969. It was evening in France when the landing occurred. Our  eyes were glued to the screen and we saw this grainy video, and there  was little prickly audio broadcast of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin as  they were attempting to do what no human had ever attempted to do  before.   Almost 2 hours after the landing, as we held our breath and saw the  landing, Commander Armstrong created the first human boot print not on  planet Earth. In that moment, I remember thinking that the astronauts  on the Moon didn't just represent America at that moment. They also  represented my family who lived in France and their excitement. They  really represented everybody around the world. They were representing  humanity and what is achievable when you dream big.   I have come to the floor today to honor the incredible achievement of  Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins, as well as the  400,000 people around the world who made the Apollo 11 landing  possible. Among those were NASA's now-famous ``Hidden Figures''-- African-American women pioneers--including Katherine Johnson, Mary  Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughn, who were responsible for calculating  trajectories to get Apollo astronauts to and from the Moon.   Ultimately, this achievement was the result of the perseverance of  countless individuals and, of course, the American taxpayers who, after  numerous high-profile failures, including the loss of the very first  Apollo crew, continued to support the Apollo Program.   Over the last few months there have been celebrations of this  anniversary around the world because the achievements of Apollo were  achievements for humanity. Here in the Senate I was  [[Page S4934]]  proud to introduce legislation with Senator Ted Cruz that would  establish the first of its kind of Federal protections for the Apollo  landing sites. Our One Small Step to Protect Human Heritage in Space  Act would permanently protect the Apollo landing sites from intentional  and unintentional disruptions by future Moon missions. It would ensure  that any activities destined for the Moon and licensed by the U.S.  Government would have to follow NASA's preservation guidelines for the  Apollo sites.   In recent years, a number of countries and private companies have  announced plans to send spacecraft to the Moon. For example, India just  recently delayed a launch of a spacecraft that is destined for the  Moon, and China has announced plans to establish a permanent presence  on the Moon.   Our legislation will set an example for other countries to protect  these sites for their historical, archaeological, scientific, and  engineering value and to help ensure that future lunar activities do  not disturb these sites.   I am pleased that last week we were able to pass the One Small Step  to Protect Human Heritage in Space Act out of the Senate Commerce  Committee, thanks to the leadership of Chairman Roger Wicker and  Ranking Member Maria Cantwell and their staffs.   Today I ask the Senate to take one small step in passing this  legislation--a first of its kind conservation measure to honor and  preserve human heritage in space.   Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No.  152, S. 1694.    Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the  Peters' amendment to the committee-reported substitute amendment be  considered and agreed to, and the substitute, as amended, be agreed to,  and the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    Mr. President, I further ask that the committee-reported  amendment to the title be agreed to and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I further ask that the  committee-reported amendment to the title be agreed to and the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table  with no intervening action or debate.  Mr.  President, I further ask that the committee-reported amendment to  the title be agreed to and the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.   Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague Senator Cruz  for helping me develop and advance this legislation.   Thanks, as well, to my colleagues on the House Science Committee,  Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Members Horn, Lucas, and Babin for their  leadership and support in the House of Representatives.   Fifty years ago, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin left a plaque on the  lunar surface. On that plaque is a map of Earth and the following  words:         Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the       Moon. July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind.   Our grandchildren's grandchildren should have an opportunity to  observe this plaque.   I thank my colleagues for taking this small step with me to ensure  that the opportunity will remain for generations to come and that the  spirit of Apollo--of ingenuity, of cooperation, and of peace--will  inspire generations to come.   Thank you.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Tristan  Brown, a member of my staff, be granted temporary floor privileges.
