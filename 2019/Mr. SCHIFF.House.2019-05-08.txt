 Mr. Speaker, 45 years ago this summer, the Watergate  scandal, which had preoccupied the Nation for 2 years, culminated with  the resignation of President Richard Nixon and touched off a period of  activism and reform on Capitol Hill.   In the years that followed, Congress worked to ensure transparency  and prevent the abuse of executive power, informed not only by the work  of two special prosecutors but also by the good investigative work of  multiple House and Senate committees.   The Watergate investigations exposed an array of abuses of power by a  craven President and his associates.   In response to illegal campaign contributions, the Congress enacted  the Federal Election Commission, required disclosure, and placed limits  on how much candidates could raise and spend.   When Congress discovered that private information held by the IRS and  other agencies had been used for political purposes, Congress passed  the Privacy Act, restricting government use of Americans' private data.   The Watergate era bears more than a passing resemblance to the tumult  of the last 3 years, and today, as in the 1970s, Congress has a  responsibility to act to fortify our democracy and our institutions.    Even in redacted form, the Mueller report has illuminated serious  gaps in laws intended to protect our Nation's electoral and political  process. The investigation, moreover, exposed weaknesses in the way our  government tracks and responds to foreign influence efforts.   Like other committees, the House Intelligence Committee is  undertaking a close review of the report to develop necessary  legislative reforms to protect our Nation moving forward. But to fully  assess the legislative implications, it is imperative that Congress,  including our committee, receive the full, unredacted report, as well  as crucial underlying evidence.   The report makes clear that the special counsel's mandate did not  extend to broader foreign influence activities. The Intelligence  Committee, therefore, is undertaking an investigation and related  oversight work focused on efforts by Russia and other foreign actors to  influence our political process before, during, and since the 2016  election.   A core component is to understand how Russia and other foreign powers  used financial leverage to further their geopolitical goals and whether  and to what extent financial entanglements exist and may have been used  to influence or compromise Americans, including President Trump, his  family, and associates.   Working with the Financial Services Committee, the Intelligence  Committee has requested information from financial institutions,  information that will be vital to fully identify the scope of this  threat, the financial means and methods that foreign adversaries use,  and the counterintelligence vulnerabilities of U.S. officials and  institutions.   The committee's ongoing investigation and oversight, along with other  committee investigations, will inform a wide range of legislation and  appropriations decisions, including to:   Require financial transparency so that politicians can never again  hide significant financial vulnerabilities from the American people;   Strengthen legal authorities and capabilities for our intelligence  and law enforcement agencies to better track illicit financial flows;   Deter Presidential abuses of power by instituting constraints on the  corrupt misuse of the Presidency, such as legislation I have introduced  to rein in the abuse of the pardon power;   Toughen foreign agent registration to prohibit tactics used by our  foreign adversaries' unofficial surrogates;   Ensure that campaign finance laws prohibit a campaign from taking  help from foreign actors and require reporting to law enforcement of  nefarious outreach from foreign powers;   Regulate Presidential transitions and inaugurations to prevent  foreign powers from exercising undue influence;   Counter covert active measures campaigns by enhancing cybersecurity  to combat hacking; and,   Reform security clearance processes to help prevent compromised  individuals from receiving access to our Nation's most sensitive  secrets.   For nearly 250 years, the durability of our Republic has rested on  our capacity to adapt to changing times and circumstances and to learn  from our mistakes. In this effort, Congress has played the leading role  and must do so here as well.   We are prepared to do the difficult work required, but we need all  the information we seek to ensure that we get it right.  [[Page H3482]]    Mr. Speaker, 45 years ago this summer, the Watergate scandal, which  had preoccupied the nation for two years, culminated with the  resignation of President Richard Nixon and touched off a period of  activism and reform on Capitol Hill.   In the years that followed, Congress worked to ensure transparency  and prevent the abuse of executive power--informed not only by the work  of two special prosecutors, but also by the good investigative work of  multiple House and Senate committees.   The Watergate investigations exposed an array of abuses of power by a  craven President and his associates, including campaign finance  violations, and the use of executive branch agencies to harass or  undermine domestic political opponents. Consequently, an informed  Congress enacted landmark legislation to curb such abuses and to close  those loopholes.   In response to illegal corporate campaign contributions, Congress  created the Federal Elections Commission, required disclosure, and  placed limits on how much candidates could raise and spend. When  Congress discovered that private information held by the IRS and other  agencies had been used for political purposes, Congress passed the  Privacy Act, restricting government use of Americans' private data.   The Watergate era bears more than a passing resemblance to the tumult  of the past three years, and today, as in the 1970s, Congress has a  responsibility to act to fortify our democracy and our institutions--in  the present circumstance to counter pernicious foreign efforts to  influence the U.S. political process. At the same time, and given the  narrowness of the Special Counsel's mandate, it is also incumbent on  Congress to continue to conduct rigorous oversight, without obstruction  by the President, and pursue unexamined investigative threads to  complete the fact finding work necessary to develop new laws and refine  existing ones.   Even in redacted form, the Mueller report has illuminated serious  gaps in laws intended to protect our nation's electoral and political  process. The investigation, moreover, exposed weaknesses in the way our  government tracks and responds to foreign influence efforts. Like other  Committees, the House Intelligence Committee is undertaking a close  review of the report to develop necessary legislative reforms to  protect our nation moving forward. But, to fully assess the legislative  implications and design laws that effectively counter the sophisticated  threats we face, it is imperative that Congress--including our  Committee--receive the full, unredacted report, as well as crucial  underlying evidence.   The report also makes clear that the Special Counsel's mandate did  not extend to broader foreign influence activities. The Intelligence  Committee, therefore, is undertaking an investigation, and related  oversight work, focused on efforts by Russia and other foreign actors  to influence our political process before, during, and since the 2016  election. A core component is to understand how Russia and other  foreign powers use financial levers to further their geopolitical  goals, and whether, and to what extent, financial entanglements exist  and may have been used to influence or compromise Americans, including  President Trump, his family, and associates.    Working with the Financial Services Committee, the Intelligence  Committee has requested information from financial institutions-- information that will be vital to fully identify the scope of this  threat, the financial means and methods foreign adversaries use, and  the counterintelligence vulnerabilities of U.S. officials and  institutions. A comprehensive examination of this information is  essential to understand the complete threat landscape and devise  effective legislative changes, policy reforms, and appropriations  priorities.   The Committee's ongoing investigation and oversight--alongside other  committees' investigations--will inform a wide-range of legislation and  appropriations decisions, including to:   Require financial transparency so that politicians can never again  hide significant financial vulnerabilities from the American people; so  that the American people are fully aware of any conflicts of interest  that arise from financial entanglements of individuals responsible for  our foreign policy; and so that foreign powers cannot use American  corporations to secretly funnel donations or engage in money  laundering;   Strengthen legal authorities and capabilities for our intelligence  and law enforcement agencies to better track illicit financial flows,  including through shell companies, real estate and other means; to  better identify counterintelligence risks; and to expose interference  by foreign actors;   Deter presidential abuses of power, by instituting constraints on the  corrupt misuse of the presidency, such as legislation I've introduced  to rein in the abuse of the pardon power;   Toughen foreign agent registration to prohibit tactics used by our  adversaries' unofficial surrogates, close gaps in the Foreign Agents  Registration Act, and ensure that law enforcement has the resources to  investigate and prosecute bad actors;   Ensure that campaign finance laws prohibit a campaign from taking  help from foreign actors and require reporting to law enforcement of  nefarious outreach from foreign powers;   Regulate presidential transitions and inaugurations to prevent  foreign powers from exercising undue influence, including by  contributing criminal or other proceeds to inauguration committees, and  by requiring that presidential transitions coordinate exchanges with  foreign leaders through the Department of State;   Counter covert ``active measures'' campaigns by enhancing  cybersecurity to combat hacking and taking steps to prevent social  media companies from serving as vectors for foreign propaganda and  disinformation; and   Reform the security clearances process to help prevent compromised  individuals from receiving access to our nation's most sensitive  secrets.   For nearly two hundred fifty years, the durability of our republic  has rested on our capacity to adapt to changing times and  circumstances--and to learn from our mistakes. In this effort, Congress  has played the leading role and must do so here, as well. We are  prepared to do the difficult work required, but we need all of the  information we seek to ensure we get it right.                            ____________________
