 Mr. President, I was just at a hearing in the Judiciary  Committee, and we were talking about what continues to happen, over and  over again in this country--mass shootings. We are an outlier in this  country, as we have far more shooting deaths per capita than any other  similar country in the world, and we heard some of the things that make  it difficult to attack the problem.   For example, Congress has passed legislation that cripples the Bureau  of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. When ATF is asked to perform a trace  on a gun involved in criminal activity, they have to go to a warehouse  with stacks of papers to do a physical search of records. They search  warehouses that contain the amount of information I can store on an  iPhone and find in a matter of seconds. This physical search is  something Congress has required them to do.   We heard about the fact that you can buy magazines carrying 15 or 20  rounds, even though many states including my own State of Vermont,  limit the number of rounds you can have in your weapon for deer season.   We want to give the deer a chance, but we don't want to give children  in school the same chance. This is the world upside down. We limit what  you can buy and use to go deer hunting but not what can be sold to  people who want to shoot children.   Outside the Capitol right now, there are young students who have  brought their powerful message to those of us inside the Capitol. They  say thoughts and prayers are welcome, but what the United States needs  right now is action.   I said this morning at the hearing that I am tired of people saying:  ``Oh, this is not the time to talk about taking steps. This is the time  for prayer and reflection,'' as though it is an either/or thing. It is  getting kind of weary to hear that refrain over and over again--this is  not the time for action. Tell that to the parents, tell that to the  other children, tell that to their siblings when they are at the  funeral because somebody shot them.   Now, I am very, very proud of those students in Vermont whose voices  are joining this nationwide chorus of student voices. We have  Vermonters showing up, even though we have had 10 to 20 inches of snow  in some towns in Vermont in the last day or so, and it is still snowing  heavily there now. We know that in Washington, half an inch of snow  would close the place down but not in my State. These Vermont students  are not going to use a heavy snowstorm as an excuse for not showing up  to deliver their message. We are here in comfort in a secure building.  We ought to act in solidarity with these students and with the students  who put shoes out here on the lawn of the Capitol--rows and rows and  rows of shoes--symbolizing children who have died.   Now, I remember a little over a year ago, millions of women across  the Nation brought their energy into the halls of government. In my own  hometown of Montpelier, VT, where I was born, our State's capitol,  there are only 8,500 people. We had 19,000 to 20,000 show up on the  statehouse lawn for the women's march there. Brave and strong, they  were speaking out. My sister was one of those joining them. In fact,  some had to park their cars on the interstate; they caused such a  traffic jam just to be there.   I remember the hundreds and hundreds of Vermonters who came here to  Washington. My wife Marcelle and I hosted them before the march with  coffee and doughnuts, and we had to keep sending out for more coffee  and more doughnuts because of the number of people there.   We marched with them alongside our daughter and granddaughter. We saw  people of all races, all backgrounds, all across the economic and  political spectrum marching for women's rights. They made a difference,  and now our students are doing the same thing. Our students are acting  as a catalyst to break the inertia that has prevented Congress from  dealing with the plague of gun violence.   When I was chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, we brought  several pieces of gun legislation here, and even those that got 50-plus  votes were blocked from going further. There was heavy pressure from  powerful lobbyists. The lobby that wasn't heard, though, were the  children who were facing this danger. Now they are being heard. Now  they are being heard.   The question is, does Congress have the courage to listen? The  strength of our democracy is citizen engagement. At a time when it has  never been more important to protect and engage in our democracy, I am  deeply moved by the students who are making their voices heard today. I  think of those students in Florida and elsewhere who faced a horrendous  thing that most of us will never see, even if we have been in combat,  but they had the courage to go back to school after the shooting. They  saw this tragedy, they faced the danger, they saw their classmates and  teachers killed, and they still had the courage to go back to school.   Well, I would ask: does Congress have the courage to do something?  That is the question they are asking. If we can't answer it positively,  then we in Congress have failed these students.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, 10 years ago this month, we saw the first  domino fall toward the worst financial crisis since the Great  Depression. Some of our country's largest financial institutions were  facing capital and liquidity crises, and it became clear that many of  the biggest banks would need a massive injection of capital, in the  form of a taxpayer bailout, to prevent what then-Chairman Bernanke  called the ``chaotic unwinding'' of financial markets.   The near collapse of the U.S. financial system had a real and lasting  impact on the prosperity of the United States, reaching the pocketbooks  and kitchen tables of every American family and the stability of the  world's economy across all sectors. We--and I do mean we--you, me and  all tax-paying U.S. citizens footed the bill for the risky and cavalier  behavior of our country's biggest banks, allowed largely by a poorly  regulated system that brought our economy to its knees. American  taxpayer dollars propped up our financial system to prevent its  catastrophic failure, an economic collapse that would have wrought even  more damage and misery on tens of millions of American households.   The crisis clearly exposed deep flaws in our regulatory system and a  serious lack of oversight of the financial sector. It taught us that  looking the other way and trusting the system to check and right itself  will always result in a race to the bottom in terms of capitalization,  risk-taking, transparency, and, too often, casual lending practices.   Big Banks and their executives took on untold and unnecessary risks,  hid their financial well-being and, at best, misinformed their  investors and, at worst, downright lied. This behavior was supported  and left unchecked by a regulatory regime without the oversight to  identify and teeth to prevent rampant risk-taking in the name of short- term profit.   We vowed we would never again put American taxpayers on the hook to  bail out Big Banks. To that end, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act,  the most sweeping, comprehensive reforms to our financial system since  the 1930s. These changes, including new regulations and enforcement  mechanisms, were necessary to prevent the recurrence of the systematic  profit-driven actions of bad actors throughout our financial system.  Dodd-Frank required Big Banks to meet capital requirements, pass stress  tests, and make plans for their orderly liquidation in case of failure.  All of these requirements were designed to prevent another taxpayer  bailout, and they are working. By design, these standards are difficult  to meet, but they have not prevented banks from profiting. Big Banks,  in fact, are thriving. They continue to protect American taxpayers who  are, rightly, wary of the behavior of Big Banks. Now is not the time to  roll back these protective rules for Big Banks. They don't need it. No  one except these big hanks will benefit, and it would all be at the  risk of future bailouts. Without these standards, we will again see  bank executives influenced by compensation packages that favor  [[Page S1710]]  risky short-term profits over sound investments and loan quantity over  quality. If we roll back commonsense oversight of Big Banks, we should  expect banks to take advantage of their newfound flexibility and  reintroduce risky practices like failing to ensure they are adequately  capitalized and mitigating risk.   Like most sweeping reforms, some pieces of the Dodd-Frank Act had  unintended consequences. We talk a lot about banks that are too big to  fail, but not about banks too small to succeed or perhaps too small to  comply with the new regulatory regime. Authority was granted to new and  existing agencies to mandate certain regulatory requirements intended  to safeguard our financial system. Our small community banks and credit  unions have done their best to comply with these one-size-fits-all  regulations and rules, often to the great detriment to their  businesses, their bottom lines, and their relationships with their  community and customers. I have heard from community bankers who,  instead of focusing on Vermonters' needs and tailoring their financial  services in the honest and professional way that is a hallmark of doing  business in a small community, must spend much of their time crossing  Ts, dotting Is, and collecting data for fear of the consequences of  minor errors. That is not how small community bankers should be  spending their time and not how they maintain the flexibility necessary  to meet the needs of their communities.   Our community banks and credit unions did not cause the financial  crisis; yet they are still paying the price for it, and by extension,  the consumers they serve. I am glad that this bill provides some  regulatory relief for smaller and community banks. If regulatory relief  for community banks and credit unions were its own bill, we would be  lining up to support it--or even more likely, pass it by unanimous  consent.   But what started out as an effort to help small community banks has  been hijacked by Big Banks and their supporters in Congress. I am  extremely disappointed that this essential relief has been coupled with  some very significant changes to regulations on the biggest banks,  banks that took hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer bailouts.  This is the handiwork of savvy lobbyists pushing a deregulatory agenda  and hiding it behind relief for our community bankers. They know  community banks are the backbone of our communities and that they enjoy  the support of their representatives. It is frustrating that we could  not consider, debate, and pass a bill that would responsibly allow  community banks to better serve and revert to relationship lending in  their communities without revisiting these additional oversight  measures on Big Banks that our constituents demand and deserve.   All told, this bill will substantially deregulate some 25 of the  largest 38 banks and will require fewer stress tests which are  effective ways to measure a bank's ability to withstand sudden or  prolonged economic downturns. I do not believe this is an appropriate  way to relieve our community banks and credit unions, and I am  concerned that instead of safeguarding our economy, this legislation  will instead open up our taxpayers to even more risk at the hands of  bank executives. For these reasons, I cannot support the Big Bank  protection act that this bill has become. I am disappointed that  instead of passing what we said we wanted--relief for small banks that  are being punished for something they did not cause--this bill will  roll back the very rules that hold Big Banks accountable and that  protect our economy and the American people.   To conclude, I ask unanimous consent that an opinion piece by Vermont  Law School Professor Jennifer Taub, which appeared online at CNN.com,  be printed in the Record. In it, she discusses the troubling flaws of  this proposed legislation. Her words would be instructive to the Senate  as we are poised to roll back some of the strongest protections we have  against another financial crisis.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                          [From CNN, Mar. 5, 2018]                  Mitch McConnell's Big Gift to the Banks                             (By Jennifer Taub)         This month marks the tenth anniversary of the $29 billion       US government-backed bailout of Bear Stearns. The collapse of       this giant investment bank in March 2008, under the weight of       its bad mortgage-linked bets, marked the beginning of the       global financial crisis.        To commemorate it, the US Senate plans to deliver a big       gift to the banking sector by removing several safeguards for       American families put in place after the meltdown.        Tin is the traditional tenth wedding anniversary gift. A       bank deregulatory bill on the crisis anniversary is a fitting       present from someone with a tin ear.        Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has announced that       this week the Senate, rather than respond to the plague of       gun violence by considering gun law reforms after the       Parkland shooting, will begin debating the rollback of       financial reforms.        The bill, S. 2155, would considerably weaken the Dodd-Frank       Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the law       President Barack Obama signed in 2010, which was designed to       tame Wall Street, protect consumers and make our financial       system less fragile.        Lifting the sensible limits imposed by Dodd-Frank would be       a dream come true for the banking sector, but eventually a       nightmare for the rest of us. This bill will hurt homeowners       and allow giant banks once again to take big risks with       taxpayer-backed, FDIC-insured customer deposits.        Who is calling for this bank deregulation? The pressure is       not coming from clamoring constituents. Instead, it is the       bank lobbyists, outside the public eye, who quietly       orchestrated this effort. Acknowledging this provenance, the       growing opposition has dubbed S. 2155 ``The Bank Lobbyist       Act.''        To pass it, McConnell needs 60 votes, so he will require       more than just his party's support. The bill already has 11       Democratic co-sponsors. Unless the public speaks up, he may       get those votes.        Here's why. The bill's sponsors on both sides of the aisle       are counting on our fading memories. They think we have       forgotten the terrible years after the toxic-mortgaged-backed       meltdown, when many millions of families lost their homes to       foreclosure. The bill's sponsors believe that the pain       previously inflicted upon us by the financial sector is       buried in the past. They are wagering that we have forgotten       both the 1980s Savings and Loan debacle and its repeat       performance in the more recent 2008 global financial crisis.        That is a bad bet. We remember.        We remember that banks and borrowers got into trouble with       unaffordable mortgages. Yet this bill would essentially       encourage banks with up to $10 billion in assets to once       again offer predatory mortgage loans to millions of       borrowers. This includes making mortgage loans to homeowners       based on their ability to pay just an initial ``teaser''       rate, not the fully-amortized rate. This puts borrowers at       risk of losing their homes if they cannot afford the higher       long-term payments. It also puts banks at risk when these       loans default.        As Boston College law professor Patricia McCoy detailed in       the American Banker, Dodd-Frank ``required lenders to first       determine that loan applicants are able to repay before       making them home mortgages. Lenders who fail to make this       assessment can be liable to borrowers.'' Yet the bill       ``permits banks with total assets of up to $10 billion . . .       to make unaffordable mortgages, with no liability to       borrowers, so long as the banks hold the loans on their       books.'' She adds that ``if the bill becomes law, Congress       will excuse over 97% of US banks from having to verify       applicants' income, assets and debts for mortgages they keep       on their books.''        We remember that big banks got taxpayer-funded bailouts.       That is why Dodd-Frank automatically subjects bank holding       companies with more than $50 billion in assets to enhanced       supervision by the Federal Reserve. Yet, under the Bank       Lobbyist Act, that threshold would be raised to $250 billion.       This is too great a risk. As former Fed lawyer Jeremy Kress       explained in The Hill, raising the threshold to $250 billion       is ``effectively deregulating 25 of the 38 biggest banks in       the United States, accounting for nearly one-sixth of the       assets in the banking sector.'' We remember that in 2008,       several banks with under $250 billion in assets, including       Countrywide, received billions in bailouts during the 2008       crisis. And even before the bailout funding was available,       when IndyMac with just $32 billion in assets went bust, it       cost the FDIC deposit insurance fund about $9 billion.        We remember that regional and community banks can cause a       national meltdown. The bill's proponents are positioning it       as harmless regulatory relief for regional and community       banks. But we remember that during the savings and loan       crisis during the 1980s, risky practices--including poor real       estate loan standards, thin capital, risky assets, and       dependence on short-term funding--led to the collapse of       hundreds of savings banks. The resulting S&L bailout cost       taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. As George       Washington University law professor Art Wilmarth explained in       the American Banker, ``Big regional banks and the largest       money center banks have held highly correlated risk exposures       during every US banking crisis since 1980. Those correlated       exposures resulted from very similar business strategies that       many large banks pursued during the boom leading up to each       crisis.''  [[Page S1711]]       Yet this new Senate bill would allow regional and community       banks to avoid prudential supervision, and also engage in       high-risk trading with customer deposits.        We remember the bailout oath of ``never again.'' Upon       signing Dodd-Frank, President Obama vowed we would ``never       again be asked to foot the bill for Wall Street's mistakes,''       but that ``for these new rules to be effective, regulators       will have to be vigilant.'' Yet with President Donald Trump's       appointment of Mick Mulvaney to head the Consumer Financial       Protection Bureau, the deliberate gutting of consumer       protections began.        Now with the ``Bank Lobbyist Act,'' our senators have a       choice. Will they pile on with the Trump Team and pummel the       already weakened financial reform law into submission? Or       will they honor their promises made to the American people       and protect us from a future financial meltdown?        Time will tell. We will remember.     Mr. President, late last month, as I watched Olympic Gold  Medal winner Jessie Diggins carry our flag in the Pyeongchang closing  ceremonies, I was overcome with pride--pride in Vermont and pride in  our great country. Throughout the games, athletes raised in Vermont and  those who choose to train at Vermont's world-class winter academies and  programs showcased the very best of our winter wonderland. Vermont,  ranked 49th in population among the States, sent the most athletes per  capita to the games. While there, they showcased Vermont values,  including respect, personal achievement and excellence, civility and  good sportsmanship.   Vermont athletes were also incredibly successful during these games,  bringing home three gold medals. Montpelier native Amanda Pelkey and  the U.S. Women's Hockey Team capped a year battling for equal pay and  treatment with a gold medal performance, stunning Canada in a thrilling  final match. Burke Mountain Academy graduate Mikaela Schiffrin  continued her stunning success, bringing home gold in the giant slalom  and silver in the alpine combined. Jessie Diggins, from Stratton  Mountain School's T2 elite team, lunged across the finish line in an  exciting end to the women's cross-country skiing team sprint to grab  the gold, the first cross-country gold medal ever for the United  States.   Between the golden moments of triumph, we also saw the grit and  determination of Vermont athletes to simply compete at the highest  levels of their sport. In the slalom, Ryan Cochran-Siegle demonstrated  his ability to overcome injuries and the odds as he enjoyed--and then  gracefully ceded--the lead to his fellow athletes. His teammate, UVM  alpine racer Tommy Bisemeyer, had the courage to speak honestly about  the profound disappointment of suffering a training injury that cut  short his second Olympic attempt. Other Vermont Olympians include  Sophie Caldwell, cross-country skiing, from Peru; Caroline Claire,  freestyle skiing, from Wilmington; Kelly Clark, snowboarding, from West  Dover; Emily Dreissigacker, biathlon, from Morrisville; Susan Dunklee,  biathalon, from Barton; Lindsey Jacobellis, snowboarding, from  Stratton; Nolan Kasper, alpine skiing, from Warren; Devin Logan,  freestyle skiing, from West Dover; Kaitlynn Miller, cross-country  skiing, from Elmore; Andy Newell, cross-country skiing, from  Shaftsbury; Ida Sargent, cross-country skiing, from Craftsbury Common;  Emerson Smith, freestyle skiing, from Dover; and Liz Stephen, cross- country skiing, from Montpelier.   We as Vermonters are so proud of each and every Vermonter who went to  Pyeongchang to represent the Green Mountain State and our country. Each  of them competed fiercely and truly  [[Page S1733]]  represented the Olympic values of friendship, respect, and excellence-- which also happen to be some of our cherished Vermont values. I  congratulate each and every one of them.                            ____________________
