 Mr. President, I rise to provide a brief statement on the  vote on the confirmation of the nomination of Brendan Owens, of  Virginia, to be an Assistant Secretary of Defense. I was unable to  attend the vote because inclement weather in Maine caused my flight to  be canceled. Had I been here on Monday, January 23, 2023, I would have  voted in support of the nomination.                            ____________________
