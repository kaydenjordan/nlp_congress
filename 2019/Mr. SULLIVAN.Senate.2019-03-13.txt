 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I wanted to come down here and  participate in this debate. It is the second one we have had in a  couple of months on the floor of the U.S. Senate regarding this  resolution with regard to U.S. policies and participation in helping  Saudi Arabia--a difficult ally but nevertheless a longstanding ally of  the United States--in its conflict with regard to Yemen. There have  been a number of speeches, as there were last time we debated this  issue a few months ago on the Senate floor.   I do want to call out my Senate colleague from the great State of  Utah, Senator Lee, who has been down here passionately arguing the  issue of constitutional authority that the President may or may not  have with regard to our U.S. military activities with regard to the  conflict in Yemen. Senator Lee is a great constitutional scholar. He is  someone who cares deeply about this issue, as do I. He is one of the  leaders in the Senate on this issue. That is where he has been focused.  That is why I believe he is part of this resolution that we are going  to be voting on here in a few minutes on the Senate floor.   I happen to disagree with him that under the War Powers Act, the  United States of America doing air refueling of Saudi aircraft--not  above Yemen, not above our conflict zone, but above Saudi Arabia--would  constitute hostilities. I think that is too limiting a view of that  statutory prohibition in the War Powers Act. I know Senator Lee comes  at this very honestly; I just happen to respectfully disagree with him.   I say to the Presiding Officer, as you have been watching this  debate, the vast majority of my colleagues, all of whom I have deep  respect for--Senator Durbin, Senator Sanders, Senator Murphy, and  Senator Menendez--have all been on the floor the last hour or so making  the case that if we, the United States, limit our involvement in this  war in Yemen, somehow it is going to get better.   We all want the humanitarian crisis in Yemen to end. We all want  that. I think all 100 U.S. Senators want that. The arguments that have  been made--and by the way, they were made a couple of months ago. We  debated this for a week. Nearly every U.S. Senator came down here on  the floor. They have just done it again. They said: The Saudis are  involved in this war in Yemen, a civil war--they are--and the  involvement of the United States is actually increasing the  humanitarian crisis.   These are the arguments. I have been listening. By the way, they were  the arguments a couple of months ago. Senator after Senator after  Senator made that argument. Well, I just wanted to provide a counter- argument. I am hoping my colleagues are listening because we should not  pass this resolution. We should not pass this resolution.   One thing that all of these debates--and I listened and I watched.  Certainly, we debated this a couple of months ago for almost a whole  week. Do you know what word never came up from my colleagues in these  debates--almost never? The word ``Iran.'' Why is that important? As the  Presiding Officer probably knows, the Houthis are actually backed by  the Iranians. The Iranians are the biggest state sponsor of terrorism  in the world. Right now, we are having this debate all about the  humanitarian crisis in Yemen, which we want to stop--we want to stop-- but this resolution would say: OK, one of the best ways to stop it is  we, the U.S. Senate, are going to tell the U.S. military that in terms  of military assistance regarding Yemen, they can't work at all anymore.  We are not going to allow that.   Somehow our lack of involvement is going to, A, help end the war, and  B, help end the humanitarian crisis. That is the argument. That is what  we are voting on right now. I happen to think that argument is wrong. I  think that, but I am going to talk about some people who have testified  on this very issue in the last couple of weeks who have a lot of  knowledge on this issue. I am going to replay a little bit of what they  said because I think it is important for other Senators to hear this.  Yes, we have a lot of experts, but I am going to talk about some of the  people who have talked about this recently, who I think have a little  more expertise on this issue than the vast majority--I would say  actually every Member of this body, with all due respect.   Let me go back to this point. Right now, as the Ayatollahs in Tehran  watch this debate, they are very pleased. They are very pleased. Why?  Because nobody is talking about them. Nobody is talking about them.  Well, I am going to talk about them.   First of all, with regard to what started as a humanitarian crisis-- which has been going on for a long time, but this war really kicked in  when Iranian-backed Houthi rebels seized power in 2015. There is not a  lot of discussion about how this began, but that is how it began.  Tehran has been trying to establish a Hezbollah-like entity on the  Arabian Peninsula in Yemen, increasing capabilities to target cities in  Saudi Arabia with ballistic missiles supplied by Iran. This is all part  of Iran's broader strategy in the region to encircle our traditional  allies--Saudi Arabia, the Gulf Arab States, and, of course, Israel-- with proxy fighters in Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen. Yet nobody is talking  about Iran.   Let's talk about the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. U.S. humanitarian  aid has totaled almost $697 million in the last 14 months. Yes, the  Saudis could do a much better job, but they have invested over $1  billion in trying to end the suffering.  [[Page S1832]]    Iran--the country that started this war, the country that nobody on  the Senate floor is even talking about--has not spent a dime to relieve  the suffering. Now, of course, they have supplied weapons and ballistic  missiles in the tens of millions of dollars but nothing to relieve the  suffering.   (Mrs. BLACKBURN assumed the Chair.)   There is something else here that I wanted to reemphasize on the  floor of the Senate. The horrible death of Mr. Khashoggi is something  we have all condemned. It is very important that we do that. It is very  important that we get to the bottom of it. Again, there has been a lot  of discussion on that death, and any death is a problem, but let's talk  about some other deaths, again, caused by the Iranians--a country we  are not even talking about in this debate.   In 2005, 2006, and 2007, they started supplying Iraqi Shia militias  with very sophisticated, improvised explosive devices that killed and  wounded over 2,000 American soldiers--2,000 American soldiers.   Where is the outrage on that? How come no one is talking about that  issue? Where are the editorials about that issue--killing our  servicemembers?   The whole concept in which we have to view this issue is through the  lens of the Iranian efforts to spread terrorism and to push their  malign interests, including in Yemen. Yet, once again, it is all about  the Saudis, and no one is talking about Iran. No one is talking about  Iran.   What has happened in the last couple of days since we debated this  issue 2 months ago? Well, we had an Armed Services Committee hearing.  It was classified, but I am going to talk about things that I asked  some of the witnesses--all of the witnesses with regard to operations  in Yemen and Saudi Arabia--and the answers are clearly not classified.   I asked: Will stopping U.S. support to help the Saudis end the  conflict in Yemen? No. Would it prevent more civilian casualties? No.  Would it give leverage to our negotiators and speed up the peace  process? No. Would it support Israel's interests in the region? No.  Would it support the U.S. interests in the region? No. Would it help  embolden Iran with its regional malign goals? Yes.   These are the experts in the U.S. intelligence community and the  Pentagon giving these answers. This is about 3 or 4 weeks ago. They are  questions that I was asking.   Let me give you another group of experts. Just last week, we had a  hearing. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee had a hearing for the  nominations of our new Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, General John  Abizaid, and our new Ambassador to Iraq, a career Ambassador,  Ambassador Tueller, a career Foreign Service officer. That Ambassador  had just spent the last several years as Ambassador to Yemen.   I had the honor of introducing General Abizaid at his confirmation  hearing just last week. He was the U.S. Central Command commander. By  the way, he was the U.S. CENTCOM commander when this spread of these  IEDs killing American soldiers started and began. I happen to have been  a Marine Corps major, a staff officer to General Abizaid for 1\1/2\  years during this time. I had the honor of introducing him.   This is an individual who is a great American, by the way, who spent  his life in the Middle East. He retired as a four-star general, speaks  Arabic, has a master's degree from Harvard on Middle East studies, and  was an Olmsted scholar at the University of Amman in Jordan. He knows a  lot about this issue that we are debating, as does Ambassador Tueller,  who had just spent the last several years as the U.S. Ambassador in  Yemen. He is a career Foreign Service officer who is getting ready to  go to Iraq as our Ambassador.   We have a lot of expertise here, but, with all due respect to my  Senate colleagues, these gentlemen have spent their lives in the  region. I am just going to quote from a couple of the questions and  answers that came from General Abizaid and Ambassador Tueller on what  is going on in the region.   Here is an important one. Ambassador Tueller was asked about the  humanitarian crisis in Yemen. Remember, this is the current Ambassador  to Yemen--a very, very knowledgeable career political officer, a career  Foreign Service officer. He said: But almost 100 percent of the  humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen has been caused by the Iranian-backed  Houthis that overthrew the Yemeni Government, destroyed the  institutions of state, and caused approximately a 40-percent decline in  the GDP of the country.   Let me say that again. This is the current Ambassador to Yemen, who  is getting ready to be Ambassador to Iraq. He was asked who was  responsible. Right now, if you listen to the Members of the Senate, it  is all the Saudis, and the Iranians have nothing to do with it.   Here is a guy who knows more than anybody, with all due respect to  the people in this body, on Yemen: One of the things I often feel badly  about is because we have a relationship with Saudi Arabia, and  understandably, hold them to a higher account. We do focus on the  consequences of Saudi actions. That is what is going on in this debate  right now. But almost 100 percent of the humanitarian catastrophe in  Yemen has been caused by the Iranian-backed Houthis that overthrew the  government in 2015, destroyed the institutions of state, and caused  approximately a 40-percent decline in the GDP of the country.   He continued: I see very, very little reporting, for example, of the  millions and millions of mines that the Houthis have planted around the  country, that in fact have caused more civilian casualties and continue  to cause civilian casualties going into the future. That is a great  concern, and I think the American people need to be concerned about the  humanitarian issues caused by the Iranian-backed Houthis.   This is last week in the Senate Foreign Relations committee. Now, you  wouldn't know it in this debate because everybody is saying the whole  problem is Saudi Arabia.   Saudi Arabia is a problem. They are an ally. They are a difficult  ally. They are a complicated ally. But one of the experts in our  country on this issue says that almost 100 percent of this is the  Iranian-backed Houthis who caused the humanitarian crisis.   Let me just make a couple of more points. This is General Abizaid. I  see the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee is on the floor,  and I hope he will talk to this because this was in front of his  committee. Iran and its proxies want us out of the region.   By the way, that is what this resolution would help us do. This is  General Abizaid last week: They see that their agenda is served by  having the United States disengaged and out to not counter their malign  influence. I think it is very important that we work to ensure that the  relationship with Saudi Arabia allows us to continue our influence in  the region. I think, as we continue to apply pressure to them, what I  hope is that we can create conditions with some of the elements to  begin to abandon sort of the Houthi ideological project, a project that  because it is an Iranian project really in Yemen will never bring  stability to Yemen.   Again, what is going on here is that the Iranian-backed Houthis in  Yemen are causing the humanitarian crisis. The Iranian regime wants us  out of the region, including in Yemen, and the U.S. Senate is getting  ready to vote on a resolution that does just that.   Again, the Ayatollahs are watching this debate, and they are very  pleased. They are very pleased with what is happening.   Let's hear one more final thing that General Abizaid said, again, in  this hearing just last week--a man who understands so much more about  what is going on in the region than my colleagues here on the Senate  floor: One thing we can't afford in Yemen, we can't afford to withdraw  U.S. expertise to the coalition about how to fight.   He is talking about the Saudis.   He continued: Does anyone think that if we leave and take our  assistance with regard to the Saudis, that is going to help the  humanitarian situation in Yemen?   The question almost answers itself, and here is General Abizaid, the  former CENTCOM commander, at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  just last week, saying that is not a good idea: If we want them, the  Saudis, to fight right, we need to continue to give them that  expertise.   That is exactly the opposite of what this Senate resolution is  getting ready to do.  [[Page S1833]]    He continued: As far as competence in military operations conducted  by the Saudi coalition, I think they have much work to do. We all agree  with that. It is very important for us to continue to talk to them  about the targeting system--we all agree with that--and about the way  that they go about hitting the various targets, and about the  professionalization of their forces, and when mistakes are made, that  they do like what we do, which is to convene a board of officers, talk  about the mistakes, and then take corrective action necessary to gain  better and better expertise.   This is still General Abizaid, just last week: I am hopeful that  there is a way to move forward with regard to easing humanitarian  problems in Yemen, and that it will continue. And if I am confirmed-- which we all hope he will be very soon--will tell the Saudi Government  they need to do that.   But the former commander of U.S. Central Command--and I spent 1\1/2\  years with him in the region, seeing him in action every day-- emphatically stated that if we don't work with the Saudis in terms of  military assistance, it is going to get worse.   The current Ambassador to Yemen testified last week that almost 100  percent of the humanitarian crisis in Yemen is caused by the Houthi  rebels backed by the Iranians. Yet, if you listen to the debate today  and if you listen to the debate 3 months ago on the floor of the  Senate, almost nobody even talks about Iran.   So given that the experts believe this strongly, given that they have  more knowledge--and they are not political; one is a career four-star  general, and one is a career Foreign Service officer--and given that  they think this is a really bad idea to vote for this resolution, I am  not sure how it advances American interests. I am not sure how it  advances humanitarian interests in Yemen, which we all want to advance.  It certainly will not advance the peace process, which we all want to  move forward.   The only entity in the Middle East that will be cheering a resolution  in support of American withdrawal with regard to the Saudis is the  biggest state sponsor of terrorism in the region, and that is Iran.  That is not just me saying it. That is literally some of the most  prominent experts in the country who have spent their lives focused on  these issues.   I urge my colleagues to vote no on this resolution that we are going  to take up here very soon.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 108, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I understand that there are two bills at  the desk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.    I now ask for their second reading, and in order to  place the bills on the calendar, I object to my own request, all en  bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, March 14; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, morning business be closed; that the Armed Services  Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.J. Res. 46, and  the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; further, that no  amendments be in order to the joint resolution.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:07 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, March 14, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
