Mr. President, first of all, let me say to the Senator  from Oregon that help is on its way. It is a very difficult thing  because we don't have any idea how long this is going to last. When you  stop to think about a land that is in the tropics not having  electricity, it is something that is hard to imagination and to get  arms around the devastation that takes place. I appreciate the fact  that he has brought that up.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.
