 ROE of Tennessee. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Chair, I rise today to fight for the rights of the brave men  and women who have risked their lives fighting for our rights.   The bill we are debating, H.R. 1112, would have a significant impact  on veterans' Second Amendment rights. A little-known and poorly  understood provision of H.R. 1112 would amend the law to make it  unlawful for an individual who has been ``adjudicated with mental  illness, severe developmental disability, or severe emotional  instability'' to purchase, to possess a firearm. It would make it  illegal to sell a firearm to such an individual.   Let's put this in perspective. There are over 1.6 million disabled  veterans with service-connected adjudication by VA of mental illness,  including 1 million veterans with PTSD. H.R. 1112 has the potential to  add all those names of veterans to the FBI NICS list and prevent those  veterans from being able to purchase or possess a firearm.   Now, I know that may not have been the intent of the author of this  bill, but that is a lot of veterans who will be impacted if this  becomes law.   I offered an amendment at the Rules Committee to clarify that  veterans with VA PTSD, diagnosed mental illness, and other affected  adjudications would be exempted from the bill's standards, but it was  ruled out of order.   VA already sends the names of veterans who have a VA fiduciary for  inclusion on the NICS list--not because there is a concern that the  veteran might be a harm to themselves or others, but because the VA has  determined that the veteran needs assistance handling his or her  financial benefits.                                time  0945    I am concerned that the expanded definition proposed in H.R. 1112  would infringe on the Second Amendment rights of over 1 million  veterans solely because they receive benefits from VA that they have  rightly earned through their service to our great country.   The last thing any of us in this room want to do is to discourage  veterans from seeking VA benefits and treatment because they are afraid  it might cost them a constitutional right. Think about that.   Although there may not have been a finding by a judicial authority  that a veteran poses a danger to themselves or society, these veterans  will be told that they were good enough to use a firearm to fight for  our freedoms, but they are not good enough to have the freedom to bear  arms as a civilian.   That is wrong, Madam Chair. Even criminals must be convicted in a  court of law before their names are added to the NICS list.   Of all Americans who deserve their constitutional rights, the most  deserving are those who fought for our country. Madam Chair, that is  why I strongly oppose H.R. 1112, and I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no'' on this bill.
