 Mr. Speaker, as a former member of the California Air  Resources Board having been a Republican appointee by Governor Pete  Wilson and having served under two Republicans and one Democratic  Governor, I have seen the modeling firsthand to know the importance of  reducing our transportation omissions. It is through this lens that I  strongly oppose H.R. 4468.   This bill would not only prevent the EPA from implementing its newest  and strongest emission standards, but it would also block EPA from  finalizing vehicle emission standards that indirectly result in the  phasing out of any specific engine technology, which could deal a fatal  blow to innovation and the deployment of alternative fuel energies,  including electric vehicles.  [[Page H6164]]    EPA's proposed standards that this bill would eliminate, reduces 7.3  billion metric tons of carbon pollution and 15,000 tons of particulate  matter pollution, which would provide between $63 and $280 billion in  health benefits to Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this bill and partisan efforts to  thwart EV development and hinder emissions reductions.
