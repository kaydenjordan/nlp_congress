 Mr. Speaker, my amendment, amendment No. 5, seeks to  draw attention to the need to resolve the significant delays in  passport services at the Department of State.   The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on international travel.  According to the Department of State's Passport Services, Americans who  submit new passport applications today may not receive their new  passports for another 18 weeks, well into the fall.   Even customers who pay an additional fee for expedited service may  not receive their passports for another 12 weeks.   In response, the State Department's Passport Services recommends  Americans planning to travel internationally apply for a passport at  least 6 months in advance.   These delays are simply unacceptable.   In North Carolina's Sixth Congressional District, my constituents  have been unable to travel to visit family, to seek important medical  care, and to conduct important business meetings.   It is essential that Congress send the message loud and clear. We  must have better service on passports. We need to address passport  delays so that Americans can get their passports in a timely manner.
