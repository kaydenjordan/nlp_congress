 Mr. President, today, I am proud to stand with my  colleague, Senator Smith, to recognize an organization that has meant  so much to the people of Minnesota.   On June 4, 2022, the Minnesota YMCA Youth in Government Program  celebrates its 75th anniversary. The Minnesota YMCA Youth in Government  Program is a youth-led, nonpartisan, experiential learning program that  develops and promotes lifelong, active, responsible citizenship in our  youth. Annually, the program brings middle and high school students  from across Minnesota to create a mock State government in the State  capitol, complete with legislative branches for upper and lower  classmen, a court, an executive branch, lobbyists, and a press corps.   The program has been developing tomorrow's leaders since 1946 and,  since that time, has served over 54,000 middle school and high school  students. Today, the Minnesota YMCA Youth in Government program stands  as one of the largest and longest running Youth in Government programs  in the Nation.   Through Youth in Government, students learn to write bills, debate  issues, argue court cases, elect their own leaders, and actively  participate in an authentic model of real-life legislative, executive,  and judicial processes and structures. Youth in Government students  learn about the importance of accountability, responsibility, and the  value of getting involved in civic affairs while developing self- confidence and learning their voices matter and need to be heard within  the State's--and Nation's--policy and decision-making process.   This vital program creates an environment for students to have  meaningful and respectful conversations where students can learn from  each other about today's issues while fully acknowledging that each  student brings a different life experience to the table, a skill that  they will carry with them for the rest of their lives. It is through  this experience that Youth in Government teaches young people that they  have an important and immediate stake in the decisions that shape the  future of not only the State of Minnesota, but of their Nation and the  world.   The program motto for Minnesota Youth in Government is ``Democracy  must be learned by each generation,'' which is more important today  than ever.   I ask that my colleagues join Ms. Smith and myself in honoring the  Minnesota YMCA Youth in Government Program.                            ____________________
