 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life of Tim Nelson, a beloved father, husband, community leader, and  football coach who passed away on January 16, after a courageous battle  against colorectal cancer since 2013.   Despite spending weeks receiving treatment in the hospital and going  in and out of remission, Tim's resolve and bravery in his battle  against this disease never wavered.   The support he and his family received in the Metro East and the  River Bend never wavered either. A member of the Calhoun High School's  1992 State championship football team, Tim served as head football  coach at Marquette Catholic High School in Alton and Dupo High School  before returning to his home school, Calhoun High School, as an  assistant in 2013.   Each of these communities and the entire region never stopped  rallying around Tim and his family. I am proud to honor him and his  life in this Chamber, and I ask you to join me in keeping his wife,  Casey; and young son, Crew, in your thoughts and prayers.                            ____________________
