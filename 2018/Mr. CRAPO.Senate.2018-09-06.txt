 Mr. President, my colleague Senator Jim Risch joins  me today in paying tribute to the veterans of the 116th Combat Engineer  Battalion in recognition of the battalion's 50-year grand reunion.   In 1968, the 116th Combat Engineer Battalion deployed to Vietnam. The  battalion was made up of approximately 800 Idaho National Guard  soldiers from National Guard companies based in Idaho. The soldiers'  tasks included clearing and repairing roads.   The soldiers who served in the 116th Battalion were an integral part  of the war effort. They have been credited with swiftly and effectively  reconstructing airfields, building bases, clearing thousands of acres  of minefields and jungle, constructing thousands of square feet of  buildings and bridges, moving critical supplies and equipment,  providing access to water, and more. Their legacy of outstanding,  dedicated service remains a hallmark of the battalion.   Veterans who served in the battalion are gathering in Idaho Falls on  September 14-15, 2018. As they join with their fellow veterans and  family and share memories and life experiences, we thank them for their  service to our Nation. We wish veterans of the 116th Combat Engineer  Battalion, your families, and loved ones all the best for an enjoyable  reunion and honor you for your remarkable service to our  country.                            ____________________
