 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Mr. Garrett for  yielding.   It is important that we discuss what has been going on in Iran. I  recall I was on Active Duty in the United States Army back when  President Carter stood by and basically encouraged the taking out of  the Shah of Iran. No prince according to his own conduct, but he made a  statement welcoming the Ayatollah Khomeini back to Iran as what he  called him, I believe it was a man of peace. He could not have been  more wrong.   There has been less peace because the Ayatollah Khomeini took over a  state government, a national government, and a powerful military than  any time since World War II. They have been the largest state sponsor  of terrorism. They have, we have been told, probably provided most of  the IEDs that have killed and maimed Americans fighting for freedom in  the Middle East, especially in Iraq.   They have worked to stir up trouble all over the Middle East, north  Africa, and have created massive mayhem, and they are looking to do  even more. And with the $100 billion or more that President Obama sent  to Iran, they have been able to make more IEDs to kill more Americans,  create more havoc, and stir up more sentiment against the United States  since that unconstitutional sending under a treaty that was never  ratified was done by the last administration.   Some have blamed President Trump for the problems in Iran. That is a  bit ridiculous. The problems are the radical Islamist leadership in  Iran. In fact, the same people that would like to blame President Trump  are some of the same ones who hailed the $100 billion sent under a  treaty that was never ratified that would be used to kill innocent  people around the world, including Americans.   The people of Iran are to be congratulated for saying: Enough is  enough.   There is a great article from Commentary magazine titled: ``What the  Iran Protests Have Already Achieved.''   Sohrab Ahmari says: ``More than 1,700 arrests and at least two dozen  deaths later, the Tehran regime seems to have suppressed Iran's latest  mass uprising. Scattered protests and skirmishes continue nationwide,  according to the citizen-journalists who, braving regime violence,  continued to post footage on social media. But for now, the  demonstrations don't seem to be growing in numbers or frequency. Yet  outside observers tempted to write off the movement should recall that  the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the Shah began decades  earlier. There were lulls through the years, which tempted President  Carter at one point to describe the Shah's Iran as an `island of  stability' in the Middle East.   ``Whatever the ultimate outcome, however, the protesters have already  accomplished a great deal and shattered many myths in the West. Let's  review their achievements:   ``First, the Iran protests showed that the people are not rallying to  the regime under the press of President Trump's hawkish rhetoric.''                                time  1745    ``Far from being `swept up in a wave of nationalist fervor,' as The  New York Times' Thomas Erdbrink reported a few weeks before the  uprising, Iranians still detest their corrupt, repressive regime. As my  colleague''--and this is the author, Mr. Ahmari, speaking--``Noah  Rothman has noted on our podcasts, Americans have an almost religious  conviction that world events revolve around the U.S. and specifically  the White House. To be sure, America remains the most important Nation  on the world stage. Yet the average Iranian doesn't wake up in the  morning cursing Donald Trump for trying to undo the nuclear deal. More  likely, he curses the fact that he can't even afford eggs to feed his  children, and there are more proximate actors whom he blames for that:  namely, the mullahs.   ``Second, the uprising revealed, once and for all, that Iranian  President Hassan Rouhani has been no moderate, and that the reformer  versus hardliner distinction is meaningless. Ever since he came to  power, Rouhani has been the subject of adulation among members of the  Western foreign policy establishment. The media attached the `moderate'  and `reformer' labels to Rouhani on the night of his first election, in  June 2013, and refused to remove them even as evidence mounted that he  was no such thing. There was Rouhani's leading role in the violent  repression of the 1999 student uprising; his support for the post-2009  crackdown; his long record of anti-American rhetoric (`the  [[Page H71]]  beautiful cry of ``Death to America'' unites our nation'); his  decidedly immoderate cabinet; his work overseeing Iran's campaign of  assassinations targeting dissidents abroad; and much else of the kind.   ``But now Iranians themselves are plainly telling the West that  Rouhani is no moderate. Their slogans--`Not Gaza; Not Lebanon; My Life  Only for Iran' and `Let Syria Be; Do Something for Me'--are a reminder  that Tehran has continued to underwrite terror and bloodshed across the  Middle East during the 4-plus years of Rouhani's Presidency. The people  have also been chanting, `Reformists; Hardliners; the Whole Game is  Over.' Let's hope the same realization soon dawns in Washington and  Brussels.   ``Third, the protesters put the lie to the Obama administration's  claims about the 2015 nuclear deal. Remember when senior Obama  officials reassured Americans that Iran would use the sanctions relief  under Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to improve the lots of  its people? Here is how Obama Treasury Secretary Jack Lew put it in an  April 2015 address: `Many Americans, and many of our closest allies,  are understandably concerned that Iran will use the money it receives  as a result of sanctions relief to fund terrorism and support  destabilizing proxies throughout the Middle East. We share those  concerns, and we are committed to maintaining sanctions that address  these activities, even after Iran takes the steps required to get  relief from nuclear sanctions. But it is important to note that the  connection between nuclear sanctions relief and Iran's other malign  activities is complicated, and most of the money Iran receives from  sanctions relief will not be used to support those activities.' ''   I would interject here he had absolutely, 100 percent, no basis for  making such ridiculous statements.   ``Two months later, Colin Kahl, a National Security Advisor to then- Vice President Joe Biden, told the Truman Center: `It is our assessment  . . . that the Iranians are not going to spend the vast majority of the  money on guns. Most of it will go to butter.' ''   I would insert here he had no basis whatsoever for making such  statements.   The article said: ``Millions of jobless and impoverished Iranians now  beg to differ. It turns out that the regime was happy to spend the  JCPOA''--the Iran treaty that was never ratified--``funds on Hezbollah,  Hamas, the Yemeni Houthis, and other nasties, even if that meant  Iranians would go hungry. And those hungry people aren't mistaken about  the roots of their hunger. Iran remains the world's top state sponsor  of terror, according to the U.S. State Department. Deal opponents  warned of this, only to be brushed aside by Obama and his media allies.  The Trump administration now has an opportunity to correct course, by  walking away from Obama's bad deal. The American people are under no  obligation to finance Iran's terrorist statecraft.   ``The mullahs would have no one to blame but themselves. The Iranian  people, defeated but unbowed, are sure to have another day.''   So, Mr. Speaker, let me just add here: God bless President Donald J.  Trump for recognizing the Iranian treaty for the horrible deal it was  and is to peace in our time. He paid for war, he paid for terrorism,  and it is time to stop it.    Mr. Speaker, we keep hearing about action that needs  [[Page H76]]  to be taken on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. I have spent  a lot of time down on our Nation's southern border, and I was quite  pleased, last year, when Border Patrol friends told me information  indicated that, after President Trump was sworn in, the number of  people coming into the United States illegally slowed to a trickle,  that it was a dramatic decrease, and that continued for awhile. But,  during the summer, as discussion about DACA started coming out, I was  told, and, apparently, the numbers indicate, the surge began anew.   What I have heard over the years is anytime anyone in Washington  starts talking about amnesty, legalization of any kind for people who  have come into the United States illegally, there is a fresh surge  across our border.   I have been told by border patrolmen, they hear people talking who  have come in illegally--whether before processing, during processing,  after processing, during the holding procedure, it is made very clear,  since they are willing to come into the country illegally in violation  of United States laws, that they want to get here before there is any  legalization. And it makes sense, as I am told, that they are willing  to come in in violation of U.S. law. They are also willing to say that  they came in a previous time and, you know, backdate it, different  identity, different date they came in, whatever is required in order to  get legal status.                                time  1845    I appreciate hearing from my constituents, I always do, and I  appreciate getting the opinions and thoughts of constituents from my  district, the First District of Texas. They are always welcome.   In the last couple of days, I have gotten a stack of petitions in my  office regarding a push to support what they are calling a clean  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals reform, but it raises some  questions. The best I can tell by the words ``clean bill,'' they mean  one that provides amnesty with no strings attached. However, all these  petitions have been provided, actual names and addresses are only on a  handful of them, many have names written in the same handwriting in  ink, and there are numerous unsigned blank petitions in the stack we  were provided.   In addition, I want to point out that, every time DACA legalization  is mentioned, we have greater surges of people into our country  illegally; and every time there is a surge, there are people who die  trying to get into this country illegally, bodies found. We have the  reports of a dramatic number of young girls, even some boys, who are  pulled into sex trafficking, drug trafficking, as a way to pay off  their debt to the drug cartels that control the area of the border that  they were allowed to come across by the gang that brought them across.   It should be noted, every young person in America has dreams. The  best way to achieve the greatest number of dreams for the greatest  number of people in the United States is if we enforce the law across  the board fairly.   I keep being amazed, and I have asked questions at our hearings:   So why did these people come into the United States illegally?   Well, because there are more jobs and opportunity.   No, but why did they leave where they left, where they fled?   Well, there was no opportunity there.   Why was there no opportunity? Why were there no jobs there?   Well, there is so much corruption. They don't enforce the law fairly.   So what we are being asked to do, instead of using political efforts  to get these countries that people have fled to fix their political  system, we are supposed to change our laws here so that those who have  been working--I have helped some people 17 years trying to get into the  country legally--they will be treated unfairly, because they have been  trying to do things legally, in favor of people who violated the law to  get here.   It kind of seems like we are being asked to become the kind of  country they fled, where the law is not enforced fairly across the  board. It sounds like the ultimate irony.   Until our border is made secure, we should not be discussing passage  of any legalization bill. We should stop talking about legalization  until the border is secure. When the border is secure, then we can work  things out.   It is so ironic to me, the very people who are demanding a big  amnesty, legalization, whatever you want to call it, say, ``We don't  want a wall, we don't want the border secure,'' which means we will  have to come back and have this discussion in the next couple of years  all over again.   It was supposed to have ended in 1986. We will get border security in  return for the amnesty. We got the amnesty, and we didn't get the  border security.   I am joined by a friend, a very dear friend, who wrote speeches for  his hero, a hero of mine, Ronald Reagan, who knows very well what  happened in 1986.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Rohrabacher).    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman personally witnessed what  happened after the amnesty of 1986. President Reagan rightly said that  we can't have an amnesty unless we have proper border security. They  put it in the same bill. They got the amnesty and there was no follow- up.   Let's say we want to do the best to help young people, the world  over. My friend here has already illustrated what happens. There are  rules for radicals. You want to bring down the United States,  apparently you bring as many people into being totally reliant on the  government, so you bankrupt the government, destroy the government.  That is how you eliminate the greatest, most representative government  in the history of the world.   Then what happens to young people around the world when there is no  America to stand up against repressive regimes? What happens?   Who is benefited by bringing down the United States by overwhelming  our system, running the $20 trillion debt up much higher? Who is  benefited?    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman and I have been to Iraq a  number of times together, to Afghanistan, to different places in the  world. It seems pretty clear, after our effort to create a democratic  republic in Iraq, that if a nation's people have not been properly  prepared and educated to maintain a democratic republic, they won't  keep it. It seems pretty clear from the places we have been together.    I will never forget Christian friends that I made in west Africa, who  sat me down at the end of the week and said they wanted me to  understand that they were so thrilled when we elected our first Black  President. But since he was elected, they said: We have seen America  get weaker and weaker, and we wanted to make sure you took a message  back to Washington that we are Christians, we know where we go when we  die. But our only chance of having peace in this life is if America is  strong.   I will never forget those words.   They said: Please stop getting weaker. We suffer when you are weaker.   And most of the people who are pouring across the United States for a  better way of life, they are not coming to weaken us. They are coming  with their own hopes and aspirations.   But I ask: What would be better? What better neighbor would we be to  continue until so many come in, our system fails and goes bankrupt, as  California is doing now?   Or would we be better to say: Let's build a wall where it is  necessary. Let's totally secure our border. Let's cut off the 70 to $80  billion that is flowing from the United States into the drug cartels of  Mexico, that allows them to corrupt the Government of Mexico and the  local governments and terrorist people and put police heads on stakes  to terrorize us. Let's cut off that 70 to $80 billion, however much it  is.   Let's totally secure the border. And people who love their Mexican  heritage are--other countries in Central and South America, they love  their heritage, but they can't make it.   Why don't we help cut off the corruption by cutting off the flow of  money out and drugs into our country? Why don't we work on that?  Wouldn't that be a better neighbor to our friends to the South?   There is no reason Mexico is not one of the top 10 economies in the  world. They have got the wonderful people, hardworking folks. They have  got the resources. They have got a fantastic location. There is only  one reason that they are not, and that is because of the corruption  that their drug cartels bring from U.S. money flowing into Mexico.   Maybe we would be better off helping all of those millions of people  who want to come here by helping them be a country that is one of the  top in the world.    Mr. Speaker, I so much appreciate my friend. I don't  like to use ``colleague'' with Dana Rohrabacher because he is so much  more than that. He is a dear friend and a brother, and I will treasure  most of the times that we have spent together in traveling, trying to  do right for the United States and the world.   One other thing, Mr. Speaker, I want to touch on before we finish up,  and that is the issue that is coming, we are told, this week, regarding  Section 702 reauthorization.   We are told that the folks in the deep state have made very clear  they want what they call a clean reauthorization. Nothing clean about  it when you look at how 702 is spent.   So just spend a couple of minutes here, based on an article entitled  ``How the FBI and DOJ Intelligence Units Were Weaponized Around  Congressional Oversight'' from January 8, 2018. It goes through this  scenario.   Sometime in early 2016, Admiral Rogers--talking about Admiral Mike  Rogers, not the Mike Rogers that was here in Congress--became aware of  an ongoing and intentional violation of Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Act Section 702 surveillance, specifically item 17, which  includes the unauthorized upstream data collection of U.S. individuals  within NSA surveillance through the use of ``about inquiries,'' where  they do a surveillance of someone foreign, capture American citizens,  which would violate our Fourth Amendment rights, except that those  names are masked and, supposedly, all kinds of efforts to protect that,  so it is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment, supposedly.   But this article points out that they get all of these conversations  in the database, and then they can do inquiries about people, subjects,  and capture that information about Americans, basically allowing them  to get around the Fourth Amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I commend this article. We see what occurs when we don't  have proper oversight. And Section 702, as being proposed, does not  give us the proper oversight, and I hope that we will look further at  that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
