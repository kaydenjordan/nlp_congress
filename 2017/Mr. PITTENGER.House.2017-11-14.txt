 Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, I had the privilege of  honoring six World War II heroes at VFW Post 2423 in Indian Trail,  North Carolina. Each hero was awarded the French Legion of Honor Medal  by the French consul. They were:   Charles Richardson, who flew 35 combat missions aboard a B-17 over  France, the Netherlands, and Germany.   Andrew McMahon received the Purple Heart while fighting to liberate  France.   William Rachui helped liberate Rome and southern France while earning  five Bronze Service Stars.   James Crump landed at Omaha Beach on D-day and received two Bronze  Stars and three Purple Hearts.   Aster Rider landed at Omaha Beach on D-day. As a rifleman on the  front lines, he was one of only a handful of soldiers to survive.   Harold Granger landed at Utah Beach on D-day. He helped save lives by  finding and disarming landmines.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in thanking these  brave patriots for their service to the United States and the cause of  liberty.                            ____________________
