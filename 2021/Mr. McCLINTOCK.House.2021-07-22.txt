 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is the culmination of 20 years of policy  failures in Afghanistan, and it comes at the same time that our  southern border has been recklessly opened to the world. This measure's  only redeeming feature is that the alternative is even worse.   Let's begin with the debacle occurring on what, until January 20, was  our southern border; finally secured by President Trump's policies.   On his first day in office, President Biden reversed those policies.  He stopped the ``remain in Mexico'' protocols that required asylum  claimants to remain there while their claims could be adjudicated. He  stopped all construction on the nearly completed border wall, leaving  construction gaps that make it all but useless. And he ordered our  enforcement agencies not to faithfully execute the law.   The result is that over a million foreign nationals have illegally  entered our country this year, with a projection of 2 million by the  end of the year. Now, that is the entire population of Wyoming, Alaska,  and Vermont combined. And the Gallup organization warns that based on  its polling, there are 42 million people just in Latin America and the  Caribbean who intend to follow. And this occurs at the same time that  20 years of failed policy in Afghanistan is culminating.   The attack on September 11, 2001, was our generation's Pearl Harbor.  It was conducted by al-Qaida, which was acting as an agency of the  Taliban government of Afghanistan, which gave it support and  protection.   Now, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Congress pledged the  entire resources of the country to the war and the President pledged to  win through to ``absolute victory.'' Days after the attack on New  York and Washington on September 11, Congress voted a tepid  Authorization for the Use of Military Force--whatever that is--and the  President told us to go shopping.    For 20 years, we dithered, twiddled, postured, hesitated. We attacked  Iraq, that had nothing to do with 9/11, and put a lot of brave troops  in harm's way without giving them the support that they needed and  without our leaders ever having a clear objective, much less any will  to win.   You know, it was from that very podium in this Chamber that General  Douglas MacArthur warned that in war there is no substitute for  victory. That is a lesson our leaders have failed to learn time and  again. So this debacle is now coming to its sad, shameful, and sorry  conclusion.   The Taliban again threatened to seize this ill-fated country,  imperiling the thousands of Afghans who assisted our troops in various  ways. To encourage their help, we passed the Afghan Allies Protection  Act of 2009, which created a special immigrant visa, or green card  program, for Afghan nationals who worked with the United States  Government for at least a year, and who face retribution from the  Taliban. This program also provides green cards to their spouses and  their children.   Now, during the 20 years that our troops have been in Afghanistan,  tens of thousands of Afghans have worked for or on behalf of the U.S.  Government in one capacity or another, and to date, over 15,500 green  cards have already been issued to the principal applicants. And then  additionally, for each principal applicant, an average of 3.5 green  cards have been issued to spouses and children. That is about 70,000  that we have already taken in. That is a city the size of Bowling  Green, Kentucky. But many more are still there.   So we have before us H.R. 3985, the ALLIES Act. It makes changes to  the Afghan special immigrant visa program to accommodate the  accelerated withdrawal that the President has ordered.   The emergency created by this order means that we will not be  adequately vetting arrivals under this program. Those already admitted  have had to meet eligibility requirements. They have had to undergo  security and background checks. If we had been able to develop this  legislation the old-fashioned way, through real face-to-face meetings  and good-faith discussions, I think we could have produced a process  that protected both the American people and the Afghan families who  sided with our government. But alas, that was not to be under this  majority.   Instead, H.R. 3985 authorizes 8,000 more green cards on top of the  10,000 authorized but still unclaimed. Now, given that 15,500 principal  green cards have been processed over the 20-year life of this program,  the odds of processing a like number in a matter of months is pretty  slim; unless, of course, the administration cuts processing and vetting  corners, which I think is a given.   H.R. 3985 also increases the eligibility pool for the Afghan special  immigration visa program in two ways.   First, it removes the requirement that Afghan nationals who worked  with the U.S. coalition forces must have performed ``sensitive and  trusted'' activities for U.S. personnel. This provision was added  several years ago with the understanding that there must be limits on  the number of people who come to the U.S., and in an attempt to ensure  that the limited number of green cards available actually go to those  Afghan nationals who are most in danger.   Now, we have asked the administration how many individuals may be  eligible once this language is removed from the statute. Their answer?  They don't know. And they don't care.   Second, this bill extends program eligibility to Afghans whose  employers received grant funding from the U.S. Government or were in  cooperative agreements with the U.S. Government and who ``contributed  to the United States mission in Afghanistan.''   Well, I am concerned that we do not know exactly what can be  considered as contributing to the United States mission in Afghanistan  or how many people to whom this could apply.   The bill also eliminates the requirement that an applicant has  experienced an ongoing, serious threat as a consequence of his or her  qualifying employment. This requirement is one of the main reasons for  the creation of the program; to help ensure the safety of those in  danger because of working with the U.S.   This means that among the worthy asylum seekers, we are likely to see  [[Page H3809]]  those without merit, or worse, those who seek to do our country harm,  because the vetting process is effectively abandoned by this bill. And  this comes at a time when the asylum process is being made a mockery by  thousands of meritless claims a day showing up on our southern border  and being admitted into our country.   I wish we could have had an honest and open discussion about the  wisdom of eliminating this requirement in committee. Unfortunately, the  Democrats chose to bypass the committee process. But with the American  withdrawal fast approaching, we are left with this deeply flawed bill  on the one hand, or the very real prospect of watching Afghan patriots  being hunted down and seeing them and their families hung by  construction cranes. So I will support this bill as the least bad  option that the Democrats have left us.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0930     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Waltz), a veteran of the Afghanistan war.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Jacobs).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. McCaul), who is the ranking member of the House Foreign  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Dunn).    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Meijer).    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this is a tragedy in so many ways; the loss of so many  of the best and brightest of our youth because of political and  military leaders who were willing to put them in harm's way but without  a commitment to victory and without the willingness to back them with  the full might of the United States.   For Afghanistan, it means the best and brightest of that country, the  very people who were willing to risk their futures for freedom are the  ones who are now being forced to flee, depriving Afghanistan of the  most patriotic citizens who could otherwise have formed the core of a  free government if we had finished the job we started.   It is to be greatly hoped that like the Iranian diaspora, they will  focus their energy from abroad to support the resistance movement that  is sure to emerge under the yoke of Taliban oppression. It is to be  greatly hoped that our Nation will finally return to a tradition that  served us well for nearly 200 years; that there is no substitute for  victory and no excuse for waging war without the absolute commitment to  swiftly win it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and  I thank Congressman Calvert for organizing the tribute to Jerry Lewis  today.   I knew of Jerry Lewis many years before I had the honor to know him  personally. He was elected to Congress the year that I graduated from  college in southern California, and he was a well-known name then  because of his activism for air quality, which at the time was a very  serious concern in that region.   I then had the opportunity and honor to actually be able to work with  Jerry in Congress. And I have to say I was a bit leery about him at  first. Jerry was a bit of the Republican old guard and I had spent an  entire career fighting that affectation, but what I found was a man who  was willing to listen as well as to be heard, a man who was so  interested in the process and the give and take and the sharing of  ideas, that he really demonstrated what this institution is all about,  how it did work, and how it could work in the future if we could learn  from his example and his life.   I am very honored to join in the tribute to him today on the floor.
