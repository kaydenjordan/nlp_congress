 Madam Speaker, I thank the chair for his friendship  and for letting me speak.   Madam Speaker, you know, I rise with great enthusiastic support for  the Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act.   No veteran of the United States of America should be forced to pay  out of pocket for basic preventative care. You know, this is 2021.  Birth control should not be controversial. Veterans' access to  healthcare should not be controversial.   And I really think, how dare Members on the other side even consider  shutting down this bill on suspension.   Our veterans deserve access to all of the healthcare services that  they need, and that would include every method of birth control.   Really? Are we still arguing this?    Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to just say--this  is something that is basic right now, we all believe that contraception  should be available. And, you know, it can end up actually being quite  expensive.   And why?   I don't understand. So I think this legislation is long overdue.  Let's pass it today.
