 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Fighting Trade  Cheats Act of 2023, recently introduced by my friend from Illinois (Mr.  Bost).   As the vice chairman of the Congressional Steel Caucus and  Representative from one of the largest steel-producing districts in our  Nation, I know it is a necessity that we protect American workers and  hold bad actors accountable for illegal trading practices.   More must be done to ensure that foreign countries and companies that  cheat our trade policies know that their actions will not be tolerated.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Bost for his leadership, and  appreciate that his legislation will increase penalties for those who  harm American manufacturers.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure  that all American workers can compete and can, no doubt, thrive when we  have a level playing field in our global economy.                            ____________________
