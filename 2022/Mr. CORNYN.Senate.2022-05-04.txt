 Mr. President, just a couple of days ago, we witnessed an  unprecedented attack on the independence and integrity of the U.S.  Supreme Court, a third coequal branch of government, when some  reporters got their hands on a nearly 3-month-old draft of an opinion,  setting off a political firestorm, creating a lot of confusion, more  than a little hysteria. And all of which is, frankly, beside the point  because the Court actually hasn't decided anything.   But this was a stunning breach of confidentiality for an institution  that relies on a private, confidential deliberative process.   The Supreme Court was designed to operate, as is our judiciary, free  of political and other outside influence and interference. That is why  Justices are not elected; they are nominated and confirmed to serve  life terms. That is why they don't have term limits. That is why you  can't reduce their salary while they are in office, to make sure that  politics and outside opinions have nothing to do with the way they do  their job because, of course, their job is a limited but important job  of saying what the law is, not making it up, not being a policy maker,  but saying what the law is.   It is absolutely critical to our form of government and to our  separated powers and our three branches of government that the Supreme  Court be protected from pressure campaigns from anyone--politicians,  political activists. Anyone. But that is exactly what is happening  right now, and many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  are fanning the flames. And they know that this is not a final opinion,  but they see a political opportunity to fan the flames of hysteria and  mislead the American people about exactly what this all means and what  the consequences are.   For example, in the wake of this news, the Democratic leader of the  Senate and the Speaker of the House released a statement--an  unconscionable statement, in my view. They called it an abomination,  one of the worst and most damaging decisions in modern history and one  that defiled the Supreme Court's reputation.   That is what they say about a nondecision, a nonjudgment, about a  leaked, 3-month-old draft.   We have no idea how the Court will ultimately decide the case, but  this was a political opportunity that the Speaker and the majority  leader could not resist.   Frankly, I think it is because they would like to change the subject.   The American people's concerns, if you ask them--as public opinion  pollsters have--what they are concerned about, they said they are  concerned about inflation, they are concerned about crime, they are  concerned about the border, they are concerned about the war, the  Russian invasion of Ukraine. But this is a grand opportunity to change  the subject and to mislead the American people.   For some reason, the Senate majority leader, Senator Schumer, and  Speaker Pelosi did not criticize the person who actually leaked the  opinion, the person who committed a frontal assault on the independence  of our judiciary, the Supreme Court.   One of the most powerful institutions in our country experiences an  unprecedented breach of confidentiality, and what do our Democratic  colleagues, the Speaker and the majority leader, do? They attack the  Justices. They attack the Court. They don't attack the leaker, the  person who committed this egregious breach of confidentiality.   Nowhere in their joint statement did they even mention the leak or  leaker, or reaffirm the importance of an independent judiciary.   No, they took the opportunity to slam the Justices, who have not yet  decided the case.   Unfortunately, this is nothing new. In 2019, the Democratic leader  went to the Supreme Court steps and threatened two Supreme Court  Justices by name if they did not rule in a certain way.    He said:         You have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the       price. You won't know what hit you if you go forward with       these awful decisions.    That is our colleague, the senior Senator from New York, the majority  leader of the Senate. He threatened two sitting Justices with  retribution should they rule in a way he disagreed with.   The top Senate Democrat lobbing threats at Supreme Court Justices is  a dangerous, dangerous model for the American people. This is the  branch of government that is supposed to be kept free from those  pressures and those sorts of threats, that kind of intimidation, or at  least attempts at intimidation.   But, here again, the Senator from New York and the Speaker of the  House, they know that, but they did it anyway.   It doesn't matter what case is before the Supreme Court or what  ruling is ultimately handed down, leaders of Congress, some of the  highest elected officials in the U.S. Government, should be a better  example and defend the important principle of judicial independence.   Justice Scalia, in one of his speeches that I read a few years back,  talked about what is unique about our system of government, and he said  it is the independence of the judiciary, which are the crown jewels. He  said, you read the Constitution of the old Soviet Union or any one of a  number of other countries, they may have a fine written document that  pledges allegiance to certain high-minded values, many of which are  contained in our Constitution, but they are just words on a paper.   He said what is different in the United States of America is the  independence of the judiciary, who will call balls and strikes and who  will ultimately decide some of the most contentious and disputed issues  in our country based on the Constitution and laws of the United States,  not because  [[Page S2308]]  they took a public opinion poll to see what was more popular or they  were threatened with retribution by some politician.   Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues and, in particular, their  leaders have taken a dangerous approach, and they are not just taking  aim at individual Justices; they want to undermine the entire  institution of the independent judiciary, particularly the Supreme  Court.   A few years ago, five of our colleagues on the Democratic side,  including the current chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, filed  an amicus brief--a friend of the court brief--in a case involving gun  rights. These Senators made a not-so-subtle threat that unless the  Court ruled in a particular way, the entire institution would be, in  their words, ``restructured.'' That is nothing more, nothing less than  a simple effort to coerce the Justices into deciding a case in a  particular way; to threaten them that unless you go our way, the Court  will be restructured.   Well, we know that those weren't just idle words, given some of the  threats to pack the Court by adding additional Justices to the Court.  We heard that threat of Court packing many times. That was one of the  agenda items should our Democratic colleagues eliminate the filibuster,  the requirement of 60 votes before you close off debate in the  Senate. They said they were going to pack the Court. Many of the  presidential hopefuls embraced that idea in 2020, and the latest news  has it that a number of Democrats are bringing this idea back to center  stage. Disagree with what you think the Court might ultimately decide,  and we are going to restructure it. We are going to pack it until we  get the result that we want. Kiss an independent judiciary goodbye--the  crown jewels of our system of government.    Earlier this week, the junior Senator from Massachusetts called the  Supreme Court's current majority ``stolen, illegitimate, and far- right.'' These are Justices who were confirmed by the U.S. Senate. It  is dangerous and dishonest to suggest that any of their positions are  anything less than consistent with the law and the Constitution.   Our colleague went on to say that the Supreme Court should be  ``expanded.'' That is another way of saying they should pack the Court  with like-minded policymakers. Well, whether you talk about expanding  the Court or packing the Court, the result is the same. It is just  another effort to try to politicize this independent branch of  government--this independent judiciary--which, as I said and will say  again, are the crown jewels of our system of government, an independent  judiciary.   Well, even Joe Biden knows that is a boneheaded idea. The reason I  know that and we know that is because that is what he said in 1983. He  called Court packing a ``boneheaded idea.''   Justice Ginsburg was asked about it. She said ``nine seems to be a  good number.'' That was her gentle way of saying that if you start  adding Justices to the Court or restructuring or packing the Court,  basically, you are in pursuit of a political outcome and you undermine  the independence of the judiciary and they are transformed into  something far different than what our Founding Fathers believed it  would be, which is an institution that would decide legal disputes,  whether they be constitutional or otherwise, and would be depended on  by the American people to present fair opportunities for all sides to  be heard and then an outcome that was not tainted by bias or politics  or policymaking.   As Justice Breyer has said, the very authority that the Court has  depends on ``a trust that the court is guided by legal principle, not  politics'' and that these types of changes--packing, restructuring,  whatever you want to call it--he said would erode that trust, undermine  the public's confidence and trust in the Supreme Court.   But as we have seen the last few days since this draft opinion was  leaked in an egregious breach of confidentiality, our friends across  the aisle don't want impartial judges. They don't want an independent  judiciary. They want judges who will deliver a particular outcome in a  case. They want the Court to be an extension of their politics here in  the Senate.   Well, politics has its place, but its place is right here and in the  White House, where the voters get to vote for us or vote against us  every 2 years or 6 years, as the case may be--or 4 years, in the case  of the President.   I understand that our colleagues want a specific ruling on abortion  rights. Tomorrow, it could be Second Amendment rights. The next day, it  might involve the means by which we run our elections. This entire  episode highlights just how far the radicals in the other party are  willing to go to try to get their way. They don't care about the long- term best interests of the country. They don't care about an  independent judiciary. They are looking for an opportunity to score  political points and distract the American people from what they are  really concerned about, which is their ability to put food on the table  and support their families.   The reason why our Founders designed a Federal Government with three  separate but equal branches is because they thought the checks and  balances that the three branches would impose would be protective of  their liberty. And when one branch goes too far, another branch can be  a check and a balance on that and, ultimately, the Supreme Court could  be the final arbiter on the constitutionality or the legality of what  the other branches are trying to do.   But our colleagues across the aisle--by their irresponsible rhetoric  undermining public confidence in the Court, jeopardizing the  independence of the judiciary--are blurring the lines between the  political process and the judicial branch's responsibility. And why?  For partisan political gain.   An independent judiciary is essential to our democracy. The parties  whose cases are being decided by the Court should never have to worry  about outside influencers or whether politics plays into the decision- making process.   How would you feel if you had a case before the U.S. Supreme Court  and you knew that your opposing party tried to pressure or coerce or  persuade the judge to arrive at a certain outcome regardless of the law  or facts? Well, that would be the opposite of an impartial tribunal and  independent judiciary; but that is exactly what our Democratic  colleagues are trying to do with the U.S. Supreme Court in this  instance.   Americans have a constitutional right to due process of law and that  precludes any attempt to influence or obstruct an independent judiciary  for making a decision in an individual case. I would like to see more  of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle fight to protect the  integrity and independence of the judiciary. But if they won't, then we  will.   One thing is for certain. As Chief Justice Roberts said, the Court  needs to get to the bottom of how this draft opinion got into the hands  of the press in an unprecedented and egregious breach of confidence.  The Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts has directed the Marshal of the  Court to investigate the source of this leak and once that happens, the  person responsible will be held accountable. It is a very tight-knit  group of people who have access to these draft opinions.   I have every confidence the Marshal of the Court will find the person  who leaked this opinion to the press, and they will be held accountable  in what will undoubtedly be a life-changing consequence, particularly  if it is a law clerk or someone who is working for the Court. It will  be a career-ending mistake.   But this is, first and foremost, a matter of protecting the integrity  and independence of the judiciary from any force, external or internal,  that seeks to chip away at the Court's independence.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print my bill  for introduction in the Congressional Record. The bill directs the  President to submit to Congress a report on U.S. Government efforts to  collect, analyze, and preserve evidence and information related to war  crimes and other atrocities committed during the Russian invasion of  Ukraine since February 24, 2022.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4134         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
