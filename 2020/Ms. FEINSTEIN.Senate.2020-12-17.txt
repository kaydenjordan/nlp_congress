 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  ``Addressing Climate Financial Risk Act,'' which I introduced today.                                  Background    The average global temperature has increased by over 3 degrees  Fahrenheit in parts of my home State of California over the last  century, and 2020 is on track to be the hottest year on record. Climate  change is driving the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires,  floods, droughts, and other natural disasters and extreme weather  events.   In California, wildfires in particular have become a major annual  concern. This year alone, wildfires have burned 4.1 million acres of  California forests and destroyed more than 10,000 structures, including  more than 5,000 homes.   The damage and risk generated by these events--in addition to the  changes needed to transition to a lower-carbon economy--threaten to  severely disrupt real estate values in high-risk areas, make insuring  against risk increasingly unaffordable, and dramatically change whole  sectors of the economy.                             Need for Legislation    Unfortunately, U.S. Federal financial regulators have not done enough  to ensure that they fully understand and are appropriately acting on  the risk that climate change poses to the stability of the U.S.  financial system.   Therefore, I believe there are a series of simple steps we should  take to ensure that U.S. financial regulators are well-equipped to  mitigate climate financial risk.   This bill would make five main improvements to the U.S. financial  regulatory system.   First, it would establish a permanent committee on the Financial  Stability Oversight Council (FSOC)--which Congress has charged with  identifying risks to the U.S. financial system--made up of experts in  climate science, climate economics, and climate financial risk.   This committee would assist FSOC in publishing a report that assesses  the ability of the U.S. financial regulatory system to mitigate climate  financial risk and makes recommendations for improving its ability to  do so.   Second, the bill would require each Federal bank and credit union  regulatory agency to update its supervisory guidance to include climate  financial risk, and to develop a strategy to identify and mitigate  climate financial risk.   Third, the bill would require FSOC to specify how it will take  climate financial risk into account when making decisions on whether to  subject nonbank financial firms to additional oversight by the Federal  Reserve Board.   Fourth, the bill would mandate a report from the Federal Insurance  Office on how to modernize and improve the regulation of climate  financial risk insurance regulation in the United States.   Finally, the bill would express the sense of Congress that climate  change is a global problem, and that U.S. financial regulators should  join international organizations focused on addressing climate  financial risk and work with financial regulators in other countries to  the extent possible and consistent with U.S. law.                                  Conclusion    Climate change is real. It's happening now and it will have a  profound effect on our financial system if we continue to do nothing.  We must act to ensure that federal financial regulators have expertise  in climate financial risk and develop approaches to mitigate that risk.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill. Thank you,  Mr. President, and I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Alexander):   S. 5045. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to reform the treatment  of multiemployer plans, to ensure the ability of the Pension Benefit  Guaranty Corporation to provide guaranteed benefits of retirees, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.
