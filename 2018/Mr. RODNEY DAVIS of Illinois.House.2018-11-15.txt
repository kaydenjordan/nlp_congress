 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the life and legacy of Eldon ``Twirp'' Williams, whose life was  tragically ended last month at the age of 87.   Endearingly known as ``Twirp'' by those throughout the Riverbend  community, he had been involved in local government for more than 60  years.   In 1957, Twirp was appointed as Godfrey Township assessor, a position  he held until 1997. In 1999, he was elected  [[Page H9537]]  as a trustee to the Godfrey Village Board, where he served until his  untimely death.   In addition to his decades of service to Madison County, Twirp was  also an Air Force Veteran.   Outside of his public service, Twirp worked as a Realtor for more  than 50 years and was even out on a real estate call at the time of his  passing.   Twirp leaves a long-lasting legacy of service that will never be  replaced. He is survived by his wife, 6 daughters, 11 grandchildren,  and 14 great-grandchildren.   Please join me in keeping the Williams family and the Godfrey  community in your thoughts and prayers.                            ____________________
