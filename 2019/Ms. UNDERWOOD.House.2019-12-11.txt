 Mr. Speaker, today is a historic day for patients in  this country because today we will be voting for a piece of legislation  that my community in northern Illinois wants urgently. It cannot wait.   I hear about unfortunate and unaffordably high drug prices every time  I am home. Recently, a 15-year-old boy in my district who relies on  insulin wrote to me: ``I am concerned with what my future holds. I need  this medicine to live, and if the costs continue to rise . . . I am  afraid that, one day, I won't be able to get the medicine and I will  die.''   No one should be thinking about the possibility of death because they  can't afford a common, live-saving medication, and the Lower Drug Costs  Now Act delivers the reforms we critically need because the bill  reduces out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs; it creates a new,  $2,000 out-of-pocket limit for seniors; and it allows the Secretary of  Health and Human Services to negotiate a fair price for the highest  cost drugs, which will reduce private insurances premiums and out-of- pocket costs.   This legislation also incorporates my bill to prevent drug companies  from making outrageous, unfair price hikes. And with the savings from  lower drug costs, we reinvest in Medicare, expanding much needed  hearing, dental, and vision services to seniors.   I am proud of this bill. It is a product of countless hours of  research and negotiation. I would like to thank the committee chairs,  leadership members, and staff who made it possible.                            ____________________
