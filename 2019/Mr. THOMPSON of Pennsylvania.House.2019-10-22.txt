 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize October as National Cybersecurity Awareness Month.   This month is a collaborative effort between government and industry  to raise awareness about the importance of cybersecurity in our  increasingly technology-driven world. We must emphasize the importance  of cybersecurity and take proactive steps to enhance our security both  at home and in the workplace.   That includes making a concerted effort to train dedicated  professionals who work to protect citizen privacy, consumer data, and  e-commerce. Training postsecondary students in cybersecurity-related  fields of study will be an instrumental part in protecting data and the  flow of sensitive information.   That is why I join my colleague, Congressman  Jim Langevin, in  introducing a bipartisan bill to strengthen cybersecurity education in  career and technical education programs.   H.R. 1592, the Cybersecurity Skills Integration Act, directs the  Department of Education to create a competitive grant program that  integrates cybersecurity education into new and established  postsecondary career and technical education programs. This bill also  requires the Secretary of Education to coordinate with the Department  of Homeland Security, which oversees the defense of our critical  infrastructure and networks, to promote a robust ecosystem of  cybersecurity education and training.   We must prepare our next generation of learners to have the most  sophisticated and comprehensive educational programs to protect our  Nation's critical asset systems and networks.   Despite the real harm and damage that can result from cyberattacks,  cybersecurity is rarely covered enough in our current workforce  development programs. That is why, together with my friend Congressman  Langevin, we have introduced this bill to help protect our sensitive  data and critical infrastructure from bad actors.   Madam Speaker, we must continue developing a 21st century workforce  to meet the technical demands our country is facing now and in the  future. This includes our cybersecurity.   I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and for every citizen  to learn more about protecting their privacy and data online during  this Cybersecurity Awareness Month.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, efforts to impeach the  President began in January 2017 with The Washington Post reporting:  ``The effort to impeach President Donald John Trump is already  underway.'' This was just minutes after the President was sworn into  office.   Now, 4 weeks into the Speaker's unprecedented impeachment inquiry, we  learn of hidden transcripts, closed-door meetings, complete disregard  for transparency and process, and the House has not even been afforded  the opportunity to go on record with a vote to open an inquiry.   If this were serious, House Democrats would bring a vote to the floor  to open a formal impeachment inquiry, but they won't do that. This is a  political stunt beneath the dignity of this institution.   Perhaps more egregious, this stunt has consumed valuable time that we  could have used to pass meaningful legislation for all Americans:  lowering prescription drugs prices, securing the border, repairing our  infrastructure, and moving the USMCA trade agreement forward.   Hold a vote or move on. The American people deserve better.                            ____________________
