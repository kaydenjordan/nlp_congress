 Madam President.    Reserving the right to object, I--what is missing from  this list is the Uighur Forced Labor Prevention Act. In a moment, you  are going to hear that it has this procedural problem--blue slips. For  anyone who is not familiar with the lingo around here, that means that  it is going to generate revenue, and therefore it has to originate in  the House. That is what you are going to hear in a moment.   Here is what is so interesting about it. About, I don't know, 4, 5, 6  weeks ago, that very bill passed by unanimous consent in this very  Senate.   This bill doesn't have a blue slip problem. It has a bunch of  corporations who are making stuff in Xinjiang Province problem. That is  what the problem is here. So everyone is aware--everyone here is aware,  I hope. In the Xinjiang Province of China, Uighur Muslims are put into  forced labor camps where they work as slaves--something that this  administration and the previous one termed as ``genocide.''   They work as slaves making products, and there are American companies  that are sourcing goods that end up on the shelves in this country. It  is, in fact, almost certain that in this very Chamber there is some  product that was manufactured by slave labor in China. We passed that  bill in the Senate by unanimous consent. Not a single person objected  to it. There was no blue slip problem then. Now all of a sudden there  is.   This is because there is a bunch--that is why they are killing it in  the House. A bunch of these corporations, lobbying against it, doing  everything possible, and they know if it gets in this bill it is going  to become law.   So I object, and I ask that the request be modified to include my  amendment No. 4330.    I object.
