 Madam Speaker, there is a major disconnect  between political elites here within the Washington beltway and the  hardworking Americans that live beyond it.   The American people in Virginia spoke loud and clear Tuesday. Those  serving in this building and at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue would be wise  to listen.   Americans want less government in their lives, not more. They are  sick of mandates. They are tired of being called racist. They are  worried about the increasing lawlessness in our cities.   They are angry their fellow Americans were left behind in  Afghanistan. They are frustrated that more of their paychecks are being  taken from them at the gas pump and the grocery store. And they  distrust a media that arrogantly dismisses their concern.   They are facing a bleak holiday, a cold, expensive winter, and a  down-sized American Dream. And they know full well the bigger  Washington gets and the more it spends, the less freedom they have.   The President's agenda isn't about protecting the climate, providing  vaccines, healthcare, or education funding. It is about control. And  the American people are seeing through it.                            ____________________
