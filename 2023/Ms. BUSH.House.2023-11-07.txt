 St. Louis and I rise today in opposition to this censure  resolution and also in opposition to the reckless manner that people in  this House speak when they don't realize or don't care that they put  targets on the backs of actual people, most of whom are Black and  Brown, because of a lack of care and the lack of understanding and a  lack of seeing the humanity of folks who look like Rashida Tlaib.   It is outrageous that my colleagues are blatantly, blatantly  attempting to silence the only Palestinian-American Representative  right here.   It is outrageous, but it is not surprising. Let me tell you, Mr.  Speaker, it is not surprising because this place is where 1,700 Members  of Congress, this elected body, enslaved Black people. It is not  surprising, because they thought it was right.   It is not surprising because this is a place where Members continue  to claim that the insurrection on the Capitol just appeared to look  like a normal tourist visit.   It is not surprising because this is the place where our Black and  Brown staff members repeatedly speak of experiencing racism, sexism,  Islamophobia, get pushed off of elevators, xenophobia and more right  here in this workplace. This is the place.   Let me say this: She mourns for the 1,400 Israelis who lost their  lives.    She mourns for the 10,000, and she will not stop.    No more lies. Cease-fire now. She takes the death threats  that you all send her, Mr. Speaker--
