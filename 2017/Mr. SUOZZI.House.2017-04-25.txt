 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 187, sponsored  by my colleagues, Ranking Member Bass and Chairman Smith, and I applaud  their and Chairman Royce's and Ranking Member Engel's continued  bipartisan attention to this oft-neglected part of the world.   South Sudan faces a famine of Biblical proportions which compels us  to act. As the world's newest country, South Sudan's entry on the world  stage has been fraught with disaster. A drought caused by climate  change, which has become all too familiar in this part of the world,  has, since December 2013, been coupled with politically and ethnically  fueled violence which has destroyed the infrastructure as well as the  economy. This has escalated drought into famine.   Across the African Continent and the globe, climate change and  extreme weather result in drought and the loss of farmland. Families  are forced to leave their homes in the countryside to seek work in the  cities. The work is not there. Incompetent and/or corrupt governments  fail to address the needs, and civil unrest devolves into violence.  Countries are destabilized.   Here in South Sudan, the newness of the nation, the government's  efforts to stamp out civil unrest--especially from nonruling tribes-- and military forces let loose upon their fellow countrymen has resulted  in death, destruction, and destabilization.   With nearly 3.5 million people displaced and at least 50,000 dead,  the international community, including the United States, has responded  with humanitarian aid to try and address the potential for 5.5 million  humans at risk for starvation by midyear.   However, last month the U.N. reported 79 incidents of aid being  either stolen or otherwise blocked. Eighty-two aid workers have been  killed since the start of the conflict, and around half of those deaths  have occurred in the last 2 years alone. Additionally, the upcoming  rainy season will further impede delivery of humanitarian aid.   For too many reasons, the hunger exists.   USAID is a leading provider of humanitarian aid, including more than  620,000 tons of food assistance since 2013.                                time  1815    This resolution calls on the government of South Sudan to cease  hostilities and allow aid to flow unrestricted.   In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus teaches: ``I was hungry, and you fed  me. Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you? Truly I tell you,  whatever you did for the least of my brothers, you did for me.''   In an effort to both stabilize the region and to feed those dying of  hunger, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 187.
