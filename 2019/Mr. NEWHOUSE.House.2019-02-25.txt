 Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special  Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to lead a Special  Order alongside my colleagues to discuss, frankly, a reckless and  misguided and radical proposal recently introduced by some of my  Democratic colleagues, the Green New Deal.   Tonight, together with many of my fellow members of the Congressional  Western Caucus, we will be taking the time to share with the American  people the details of the ill-advised and bizarre provisions included  in this green manifesto and the grave impacts that they would have on  our Nation's economy.                                time  2000    We will also share what we, as Republicans in the people's House,  believe when it comes to our national strategy to innovate, diversify,  and strengthen America's energy sector.   Mr. Speaker, the Green New Deal is a bad deal for the American  people. This so-called deal calls for cutting of greenhouse gas  emissions to net zero in only 10 years.   And while many studies are still working to grasp the perilous  impacts and the enormous costs of this proposal, one independent  estimate, led by a team of Stanford engineers, suggests it would cost  our Nation in the neighborhood of $7 trillion to convert all of  America's power to renewable power sources.  [[Page H2090]]    To quote the former Secretary of Energy under President Obama, Ernest  Moniz, he said: ``I'm afraid I just cannot see how we could possibly go  to zero carbon in the 10-year timeframe. It is just impractical.''   Mr. Speaker, the Green New Deal goes much further than just the  energy sector, however. It also mandates the guarantee of a job for  everyone, paid vacations for everyone, free college for everyone. It  dictates that every existing building in this country must be upgraded  and retrofitted for ``comfort.''   It calls for a drastic overhaul of our transportation systems across  the country, threatening not only our trucking and airline industries,  but also the daily lives of the 85 percent of Americans who drive every  morning or evening to get to work.   Mr. Speaker, while calling for all of these implausible mandates, the  Green New Deal would also insert the Federal Government into seemingly  every aspect of our daily lives.   By expanding our Federal bureaucracy far beyond anything we have ever  seen in history and undermining the federalist principles our country  was founded upon in the Constitution, this proposal would jeopardize  the future of America as we know it. It would sacrifice the American  energy, manufacturing, and transportation sectors; jeopardize  businesses small and large across the Nation; and lead our country down  the path of socialist nations like Venezuela, North Korea, and Cuba.   As the Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin said after reading the  proposal: ``What in the heck is this?''   Mr. Speaker, I couldn't agree more.   My State, the great State of Washington, consistently ranks among the  top of the list of States with the cleanest energy production. Do you  know why that is? It is because of the strong reliance on our  incredible system of hydroelectric dams, many of which are in my  congressional district along the Columbia and the Snake Rivers.   Nearly 70 percent of our power comes from hydropower, a clean,  renewable, reliable, and affordable source of baseload energy.   It also comes from our use of nuclear power. The Columbia Generating  Station, which is also in the Fourth Congressional District which I  represent, is the only nuclear power plant in the greater Northwest  region. It too provides clean, reliable power for the Pacific  Northwest.   On top of these sources, Washington State uses a variety of other  energy sources, including natural gas, coal, wind, solar, and biomass.   It is because we use an all-of-the-above mix of energy sources, but  largely concentrated on clean, renewable, reliable hydropower, that  Washington State continues to demonstrate how we can lead in the use of  clean energy while still diversifying and thereby strengthening our  energy portfolio.   Unfortunately, the Green New Deal negates this ability to do so. Not  once is the word ``hydropower'' mentioned in the legislation. And in  the frequently asked questions document that was released to accompany  the introduction of the Green New Deal, it stated that ``The plan is to  transition off of nuclear.''   Mr. Speaker, if we are going to continue to strengthen America's  energy independence and increase our use of clean sources of energy, we  must absolutely include hydropower and nuclear power. The science says  so, the facts say so.   So when Democrats in Congress release a sweeping, colossal overhaul  of our Nation's energy policies and do not include these clean energy  sources, it is clear that this is far more about politics and not about  sound science.   Mr. Speaker, my fellow House Republicans and I continue to advocate  for sound, comprehensive approaches to energy policy. We must continue  to explore every opportunity to develop viable alternative energy  sources, which is why under Republican control of the House in recent  Congresses, we have made serious investments in advanced nuclear and  basic science research, grid-scale energy storage, and equipped our  national laboratories with robust resources to lead the way in  research, development, and innovation.   National laboratories, like the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  in my district, play a crucial role in developing the basic science  research needed to pave the way for these alternative sources. Then  when private industry can utilize this research, the open marketplace  can put these new sources to use.   That is exactly what our country needs: more collaboration, more  innovation; not a top-down mandated system of bureaucratic dictates  based upon a green manifesto.   Mr. Speaker, I often share with my constituents that as a third  generation farmer, I consider myself to be a conservationist and on the  front lines of being a good steward of our natural resources. I know  that we must respect our environment, we must ensure clean air and  clean water for our citizens, and we must encourage innovative ways to  produce energy through a variety of reliable, renewable traditional and  alternative sources.   Tonight I am looking forward to hearing from my friends and my  colleagues in the Congressional Western Caucus on why the Green New  Deal would be catastrophic for their constituents and what we in our  Nation's capital should really be prioritizing in order to continue  America's energy independence dominance.    So with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield to my first speaker, the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber), the gentleman that represents the Eighth  District of that great State.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Minnesota for expressing so eloquently how Americans around the country  would be affected by this if this legislation was adopted into law.  People from different parts of the country with extreme weather, as you  have heard, depend on reliable sources of energy.   From minus 71 to hopefully a little warmer climate, the next speaker  I am going to yield to is the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar), the  chairman of our Western Caucus and the representative from the Fourth  Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the good gentleman from Arizona  for expressing his thoughts on how this would impact the people not  only in Arizona, but also around the country.   Mr. Speaker, many of my constituents continue to ask me what is  actually in this Green New Deal legislation. Unfortunately for the  American people, the Members of Congress who introduced the resolution  had, I guess, several hiccups along the way during their rollout and  released conflicting documents to accompany the bill.   One significant piece of legislation that my constituents have asked  me about is whether the related resolution mandated a job for everyone  in the United States. Well, that is, in fact, true. A part of the  frequently asked questions document that was released with the  legislation even stated that economic security would be provided for  those who are ``unwilling to work.'' Many of my constituents think that  is an amazing statement.   After an adviser to the Green New Deal accused Republicans of  doctoring this document, The Washington Post later reported that he  erroneously made that accusation. In fact, this document was released  by Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez's office.   Representative Ocasio-Cortez has since retracted the frequently asked  questions document, but the message I hope my constituents and the  American people hear clearly is that we know the motives behind this  legislation. We know the intent. From ending the airline industry to  shutting down all nuclear power, unfortunately, some people on the  other side of the aisle, my colleagues on the Democratic side, are  threatening the American economy.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the frequently asked questions  document that was released by Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez's office.                 LAUNCH: Thursday, February 7, at 8:30 a.m.                                   Overview         We will begin work immediately on Green New Deal bills to       put the nuts and bolts on the plan described in this       resolution (important to say so someone else can't claim this       mantle).        This is a massive transformation of our society with clear       goals and a timeline.        The Green New Deal resolution a 10-year plan to mobilize       every aspect of American society at a scale not seen since       World War 2 to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and       create economic prosperity for all. It will:        Move America to 100% clean and renewable energy        Create millions of family supporting-wage, union jobs        Ensure a just transition for all communities and workers to       ensure economic security for people and communities that have       historically relied on fossil fuel industries        Ensure justice and equity for frontline communities by       prioritizing investment, training, climate and community       resiliency, economic and environmental benefits in these       communities.        Build on FDR's second bill of rights by guaranteeing:        A job with a family-sustaining wage, family and medical       leave, vacations, and retirement security        High-quality education, including higher education and       trade schools        Clean air and water and access to nature        Healthy food        High-quality health care        Safe, affordable, adequate housing        Economic environment free of monopolies        Economic security for all who are unable or unwilling to       work        There is no time to waste.        IPCC Report said global emissions must be cut by 40-60% by       2030. US is 20% of total emissions. We must get to 0 by 2030       and lead the world in a global Green New Deal.        Americans love a challenge. This is our moonshot.        When JFK said we'd go to the by the end of the decade,       people said impossible.        If Eisenhower wanted to build the interstate highway system       today, people would ask how we'd pay for it.        When FDR called on America to build 185,000 planes to fight       World War 2, every business leader, CEO, and general laughed       at him. At the time, the U.S. had produced 3,000 planes in       the last year. By the end of the war, we produced 300,000       planes. That's what we are capable of if we have real       leadership        This is massive investment in our economy and society, not       expenditure.  [[Page H2092]]         We invested 40-50% of GDP into our economy during World War       2 and created the greatest middle class the US has seen.        The interstate highway system has returned more than $6 in       economic productivity for every $1 it cost        This is massively expanding existing and building new       industries at a rapid pace--growing our economy        The Green New Deal has momentum.        92 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Republicans       support the Green New Deal        Nearly every major Democratic Presidential contender say       they back the Green New Deal including: Elizabeth Warren,       Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Jeff Merkeley, Julian Castro,       Kirsten Gillibrand, Bernie Sanders, Tulsi Gabbard, and Jay       Inslee.        45 House Reps and 330+ groups backed the original       resolution for a select committee        Over 300 local and state politicians have called for a       federal Green New Deal        New Resolution has 20 co-sponsors, about 30 groups (numbers       will change by Thursday).                                     FAQ         Why 100% clean and renewable and not just 100% renewable?       Are you saying we won't transition off fossil fuels?        Yes, we are calling for a full transition off fossil fuels       and zero greenhouse gases. Anyone who has read the resolution       sees that we spell this out through a plan that calls for       eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from every sector of the       economy. Simply banning fossil fuels immediately won't build       the new economy to replace it--this is the plan to build that       new economy and spells out how to do it technically. We do       this through a huge mobilization to create the renewable       energy economy as fast as possible. We set a goal to get to       net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we       aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting       cows and airplanes that fast, but we think we can ramp up       renewable manufacturing and power production, retrofit every       building in America, build the smart grid, overhaul       transportation and agriculture, plant lots of trees and       restore our ecosystem to get to net-zero.        Is nuclear a part of this?        A Green New Deal is a massive investment in renewable       energy production and would not include creating new nuclear       plants. It's unclear if we will be able to decommission every       nuclear plant within 10 years, but the plan is to transition       off of nuclear and all fossil fuels as soon as possible. No       one has put the full 10-year plan together yet, and if it is       possible to get to fully 100% renewable in 10 years, we       will do that.        Does this include a carbon tax?        The Green New Deal is a massive investment in the       production of renewable energy industries and infrastructure.       We cannot simply tax gas and expect workers to figure out       another way to get to work unless we've first created a       better, more affordable option. So we're not ruling a carbon       tax out, but a carbon tax would be a tiny part of a Green New       Deal in the face of the gigantic expansion of our productive       economy and would have to be preceded by first creating the       solutions necessary so that workers and working class       communities are not affected. While a carbon tax may be a       part of the Green New Deal, it misses the point and would be       off the table unless we create the clean, affordable options       first.        Does this include cap and trade?        The Green New Deal is about creating the renewable energy       economy through a massive investment in our society and       economy. Cap and trade assumes the existing market will solve       this problem for us, and that's simply not true. While cap       and trade may be a tiny part of the larger Green New Deal       plan to mobilize our economy, any cap and trade legislation       will pale in comparison to the size of the mobilization and       must recognize that existing legislation can incentivize       companies to create toxic hotspots in frontline communities,       so anything here must ensure that frontline communities are       prioritized.        Does a GND ban all new fossil fuel infrastructure or       nuclear power plants?        The Green New Deal makes new fossil fuel infrastructure or       nuclear plants unnecessary. This is a massive mobilization of       all our resources into renewable energies. It would simply       not make sense to build new fossil fuel infrastructure       because we will be creating a plan to reorient our entire       economy to work off renewable energy. Simply banning fossil       fuels and nuclear plants immediately won't build the new       economy to replace it--this is the plan to build that new       economy and spells out how to do it technically.        Are you for CCUS?        We believe the right way to capture carbon is to plant       trees and restore our natural ecosystems. CCUS technology to       date has not proven effective.        How will you pay for it?        The same way we paid for the New Deal, the 2008 bank       bailout and extended quantitative easing programs. The same       way we paid for World War II and all our current wars. The       Federal Reserve can extend credit to power these projects and       investments and new public banks can be created to extend       credit. There is also space for the government to take an       equity stake in projects to get a return on investment. At       the end of the day, this is an investment in our economy that       should grow our wealth as a nation, so the question isn't how       will we pay for it, but what will we do with our new shared       prosperity.        Why do we need a sweeping Green New Deal investment       program? Why can't we just rely on regulations and taxes and       the private sector to invest alone such as a carbon tax or a       ban on fossil fuels?        The level of investment required is massive. Even if every       billionaire and company came together and were willing to       pour all the resources at their disposal into this       investment, the aggregate value of the investments they could       make would not be sufficient.        The speed of investment required will be massive. Even if       all the billionaires and companies could make the investments       required, they would not be able to pull together a       coordinated response in the narrow window of time required to       jump-start major new projects and major new economic sectors.       Also, private companies are wary of making massive       investments in unproven research and technologies; the       government, however, has the time horizon to be able to       patiently make investments in new tech and R&D, without       necessarily having a commercial outcome or application in       mind at the time the investment is made. Major examples of       government investments in ``new'' tech that subsequently       spurred a boom in the private section include DARPA-projects,       the creation of the internet--and, perhaps most recently, the       government's investment in Tesla.        Simply put, we don't need to just stop doing some things we       are doing (like using fossil fuels for energy needs); we also       need to start doing new things (like overhauling whole       industries or retrofitting all buildings to be energy       efficient). Starting to do new things requires some upfront       investment. In the same way that a company that is trying to       change how it does business may need to make big upfront       capital investments today in order to reap future benefits       (for e.g., building a new factory to increase production or       buying new hardware and software to totally modernize its IT       system), a country that is trying to change how its economy       works will need to make big investments today to jump-start       and develop new projects and sectors to power the new       economy.        Merely incentivizing the private sector doesn't work--e.g.       the tax incentives and subsidies given to wind and solar       projects have been a valuable spur to growth in the US       renewables industry but, even with such investment-promotion       subsidies, the present level of such projects is simply       inadequate to transition to a fully greenhouse gas neutral       economy as quickly as needed.        Once again, we're not saying that there isn't a role for       private sector investments; we're just saying that the level       of investment required will need every actor to pitch in and       that the government is best placed to be the prime driver.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Biggs for sharing his thoughts  on the direction that this would take our Nation and the dangerous path  it would lead us upon. Those are things that we need to make sure that  we don't allow happen, and I think the American people would agree with  us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Marshall), the  good doctor from Kansas' First District who serves on the Agriculture  Committee. I know this is going to have a huge impact on many  industries, but particularly agriculture.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Marshall for sharing with us  his thoughts from the great State of Kansas.   Some of the proponents of the Green New Deal have criticized others  for criticizing the Green New Deal, saying that we don't have any room  to talk if we are not going to offer something toward the issues that  we face as a world and as a country.   Let me just say, Mr. Speaker, we do have options, and we do have  solutions  [[Page H2094]]  that we have been offering. Let me share a piece written by my  Republican colleagues just recently who lead the Energy and Commerce  Committee. Mr.   Greg Walden, Mr. Fred Upton, and Mr.   John Shimkus  shared an article that was published in several newspapers around the  country. Some of the things that they say go like this: ``America's  approach for tackling climate change should be built upon the  principles of innovation, conservation, and adaptation. Republicans  have long championed realistic, innovative, and free-market strategies  to promote a cleaner environment and to reduce emissions. The results  are clear: The United States is leading the world in reducing  greenhouse gas emissions thanks to vibrant energy sector competition  and innovation.''   They go on to say: ``We should continue to encourage innovation and  renewable energy development. We should promote carbon capture and  utilization, renewable hydropower, and safe nuclear power, which is  emissions-free. We should also look to remove barriers to energy  storage and commercial batteries to help make renewable sources more  viable and our electricity grid more resilient. And we must encourage  more research and business investments in new clean energy  technologies. These are bipartisan solutions that we must seize on to  deliver real results for the American people.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cloud) from the  27th District.                                time  2030     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Cloud) for giving us great thoughts about the impacts of what the Green  New Deal would actually mean for Americans and jobs in the United  States of America.   As the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes) makes his way to the  microphone, I just want to share with you one study that was released  today by the American Action Forum. It says that the Green New Deal  will cost a startling $93 trillion over 10 years.   Now, put that into perspective: That is equivalent to $600,000 per  household.   To generate $93 trillion in income tax revenue, we would have to tax  every household earning more than $30,000 at a 100 percent rate for 10  years.   If every household earning over more than $200,000 were taxed at 100  percent for 10 years, it would still fall $58 trillion short. So you  can just see that this does not work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes), a  member of the powerful Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.  Estes). I appreciate very much him sharing his thoughts about the Green  New Deal and the impacts it would have on our country--something that  we just absolutely cannot afford. So I appreciate very much his time  this evening, and I thank him.   Mr. Speaker, I recently read an article from Reuters titled ``Labor  Unions fear Democrats' Green New Deal poses job threat.''   I didn't write that title. That is what they did. In it, a spokesman  for a major union in this country speaks on the legislation's language,  calling for a transition for union jobs. He says, ``We've heard words  like `just transition' before, but what does that really mean? Our  Members are worried about putting food on the table.''   Another labor union, the Laborers' International Union of North  America states, ``We will never settle for `just transition' language  as a solution to the job losses that will surely come from some of the  policies in the resolution.''   Mr. Speaker, hardworking Americans across the country deserve to be  heard. Unfortunately, as this article states, neither union was  contacted for input before the legislation was released.   And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield time to the gentleman from  California's First District (Mr. LaMalfa), my good friend and a fellow  farmer.  [[Page H2095]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  LaMalfa). I appreciate very much him sharing his thoughts--and  California's thoughts--about what we have in front of us and the impact  it would have.   And if anyone is thinking that this is just a bunch of Republicans  that are thinking this way and have these thoughts, let me share with  you some quotes from some of my friends across the aisle, Mr. Speaker.   Representative Jeff Van Drew, a Democrat from New Jersey. He says of  the Green New Deal, ``It is not a serious policy proposal. It seeks the  complete reorganization of American society, which took hundreds of  years to build, in a matter of 10 years.''   Or the senior Senator from California--Mr. LaMalfa's state--just  stated last week that ``There's no way to pay for it.''   From my own State, my colleague, Representative Rick Larsen just said  recently, ``It is difficult to support the resolution right now when  one of the lead sponsors says one of the intentions is to make air  travel unnecessary.'' He is the chairman of the House Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Aviation.   My neighbor from Oregon, Mr. DeFazio, chairman of the House Committee  on Transportation and Infrastructure, said, ``The idea that in 5 or 10  years we're not going to consume any more fossil fuels is  technologically impossible. We can have grand goals, but let's be  realistic about how we get there.''   Even our own Speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi from California, said  of the proposal, ``The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody  knows what it is, but they're for it, right?''   So you can see, it is not just us, this is a bipartisan feeling about  the Green New Deal that it needs a lot more consideration.   Mr. Speaker, at this point, I yield to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman), my good friend from the Palmetto State, Fifth  District, and a member of the Committee on Science, Space, and  Technology.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina  for his input on this important issue. It underscores the cost to the  Nation if this were adopted and its impact on our economy. I thank the  gentleman for that tremendous help.   I thank all my colleagues, members of the Congressional Western  Caucus, for participating tonight to point out some of the fallacies of  the Green New Deal. Certainly, it is something that, as legislation is  proposed, this is the process: We talk about what we like, what we  don't like, and we offer alternatives, trying to find solutions in a  bipartisan way.   Republicans have always advocated to continue looking at these issues  of climate change, of energy use and production, of issues facing the  environment. We are always looking for ways to innovate, to adequately  fund research, but, basically, underscoring all of that, relying on the  use of sound science for any decisions that we make, to make sure that  the policies that we adopt are those that will be sustaining and good  for not only our country, but for the world.   So we base our decisions on science, not politics. As Republicans, as  members of the Congressional Western Caucus, which is a bipartisan  organization, we look forward to debating seriously and making serious  decisions in regard to these very important issues that face our  country, face the next generation, and face the world.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing debates on this important  topic, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 47 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, February 26, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
