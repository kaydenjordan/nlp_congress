 Mr. Speaker, as an American, I certainly celebrate  religious freedom and acknowledge the importance of freedom of religion  and speech and the ability to have access to a free press.   Sadly, I rise to take issue with the comments said by the Commander  in Chief, well documented by Senator Durbin and the Senator from South  Carolina, Lindsey Graham, who delicately tried to instruct the  Commander in Chief of the ugliness of his words.   I will not say them on the floor, and I have not said the complete  word, but over this weekend of the beloved community of Dr. Martin  Luther King, everywhere I went, people were appalled. I believe that it  is crucial that we pass the Dream Act and that we speak to the racism  of this President through 1973, 1980, 1988, and 1989.
