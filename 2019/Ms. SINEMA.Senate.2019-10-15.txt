 Madam President, today I wish to honor the life  and legacy of William V. Bidwill, who passed away in Phoenix, AZ, on  October 2, 2019, at the age of 88. As the owner of the National  Football League's Arizona Cardinals, Mr. Bidwill loved his faith, his  family, and football. He will be fondly remembered as a principled  leader and generous steward of his community.   Bill began his career in football by joining the family business as a  ball boy for the then-Chicago Cardinals. After graduating from  Georgetown University, Bill returned to Chicago to assist his father  with day-to-day management of the Cardinals. Bill oversaw the team's  move to St. Louis in 1960 and took on full ownership of the team in  1972. In 1988, Bill moved the team to Arizona, where it has found a  home among a dedicated and growing fan base. In his time as owner of  the Cardinals, Bill took unprecedented steps to rearrange the team's  front office to improve diversity across the organization, setting an  example for other NFL franchises for years to come. Bill also founded  Cardinals Charities in 1990 to support women, children, and minorities  across Arizona. Cardinals Charities has donated more than $9.1 million  to support these groups and other causes over the years.   Bill is survived by his 5 children, 10 grandchildren, and 1 great- grandchild. He will be dearly missed by other family members, friends,  the Arizona Cardinals organization, and hundreds of thousands of fans  grateful for his work to bring the National Football League to Arizona.  Please join me in honoring his memory.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I wish to honor the career  Col. Steven D.
