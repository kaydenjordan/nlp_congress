 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I will take a moment to recognize our  colleague, Jackie Walorski. We come back to the Capitol with very heavy  hearts. Just over a week ago, we lost Jackie and two of her staffers,  Emma Thomson and Zachery Potts, while they were in their public  service.   I was lucky enough to serve with Jackie on the Ways and Means  Committee and worked with her numerous hours. I know that the Ways and  Means Committee will miss her dearly. The people of this body will miss  her dearly. I know that the people of Indiana will miss her very  dearly.   Mr. Speaker, I will say that Jackie was one of the hardest working  public servants that I have ever met, and when she gave you her word,  it was written and carved in stone. For that, she will always be in our  hearts.   Mr. Speaker, as we turn to the legislation before us today, this  week, we found out inflation remains at a 40-year high, having risen  13.7 percent since Biden became President. Real wages have decreased by  4.5 percent.   Americans are suffering. Are we here debating how to alleviate that  suffering? No. We are debating what Democrats call the Inflation  Reduction Act, which everyone from the Congressional Budget Office to  230 different economists--even Senator Bernie Sanders--says will not  actually reduce inflation.                                time  1200    When you strip away the fake sunset policies, this bill spends $745  billion and adds $146 billion to our debt. It adds $54 billion worth of  debt just in the first 5 years, and 80 percent of their ``budget  deficits'' don't even begin until after the year 2029.   So lots of spending up front, lots of debt up front, and then maybe  savings 8 years from now. How is that going to put out the fire of  inflation when the price of groceries is up 13.1 percent over the past  year?   Senators Manchin and Schumer, Secretary Yellen, and former President  Obama are all on record saying you don't raise taxes during a  recession. But that is exactly what this bill does. It includes $599  billion in new taxes and budget gimmicks. Half of the tax burden falls  on taxpayers making less than $400,000 a year.   The choice this bill puts in front of families making less than  $200,000 is clear. Put the government at the center of your healthcare  decisions or face a $10 billion tax burden. But it gets worse. This  bill doubles the size of the IRS. It doubles the size of the IRS, so it  can target and audit more middle-class families and snoop into their  bank accounts. I am not sure how subjecting Americans to more audits  solves the inflation crisis.   Mr. Speaker, in my home State of Missouri, this bill would quadruple  the number of audits, 18,000 more audits on hardworking Americans who  make less than $200,000 a year. Of course, that is not the only point  of this bill. This is about Democrats' Green New Deal agenda.   My colleagues on the other side will come down here today not to talk  [[Page H7647]]  about inflation, not to talk about gas prices but to instead talk about  the hundreds of billions of dollars that is being spent on radical  environmental projects. And you know what, they will be exactly right.   Half of the spending--over $400 billion--goes to things like:   $3.4 billion for tree equity. Tree equity, that surely is going to  bring down gas prices;   $7.5 billion for new luxury electric vehicles in tax credits for  families who make up to $300,000 a year. That should definitely curtail  inflation;   $27 billion for a national climate bank slush fund at the EPA. That  should definitely help our supply chain crisis;   A $362 million handout to corporate America to make their office  buildings much greener. That will definitely help secure our southern  border.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats believe they can spend their way out of  inflation and tax their way out of a recession. It will only make the  suffering Americans face today that much worse.   This bill is simple. It is welfare for the wealthy environmentalists  and big corporations, paid for by increased taxes and audits on middle-  and low-income taxpayers. These hardworking Americans are the ones that  have been forgotten under the one-party Democrat rule in Washington.  The Washington and wealthy elites win again.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from the great State of Iowa (Mrs. Hinson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Cline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Iowa (Mr. Feenstra).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Colorado.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentlewoman from Colorado.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record notice  from the Congressional Budget Office that we received just this  morning, as a matter of fact. Yes, the bill in front of us and the  numbers it claims does include additional audits on individuals making  less than $400,000 a year.        CBO has received a number of questions regarding our       estimate of an amendment offered by Senator Crapo during the       floor debate on H.R. 5376 last weekend. That amendment,       #5404, would limit the use of additional funds for the       Internal Revenue Service. If the amendment had been adopted       none of the additional funds could have been used to audit       taxpayers with taxable incomes below $400,000.        CBO did not complete a formal cost estimate in advance of       consideration of the amendment but the agency did provide the       following information to the Senate Budget Committee:        CBO estimates that the amendment 5404 would have the       following effects:        No effect on outlays in the one or ten year budget windows;       would reduce outlays in the five year budget window.        No effect on revenues in the one year budget window; would       reduce the ``non-scorable'' revenues resulting from the       provisions of section 10301 in the five and ten year budget       windows.        No effect on outlays after 2031 but would decrease the       ``non-scorable'' revenue resulting from the provisions of       section 10301 after 2031.        CBO has not completed a point estimate of this amendment       but the preliminary assessment indicates that amendment 5404       would reduce the ``non-scorable'' revenues resulting from the       provisions of section 10301 by at least $20 billion over the       FY2022-FY2031 period.        Thanks,                                                      Leigh Angres,                                    Director of Legislative Affairs                                       Congressional Budget Office.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter  from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which confirmed that  this bill will raise the cost of new prescription drugs for all  Americans.                                                      U.S. Congress,                                     Congressional Budget Office,                                     Washington, DC, August 4, 2022.      Re Additional Information About Prescription Drug           Legislation.       Hon. Jason Smith,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman: This letter provides additional       information that you and your colleagues requested about       subtitle I of the reconciliation recommendations of the       Senate Committee on Finance regarding prescription drug       legislation. You asked about how provisions involving       inflation rebates and the negotiation of drug prices would       affect launch prices for new drugs and the introduction of       new generic drugs. You also asked how a provision to       stabilize premiums as a part of the redesign of Medicare's       benefits would affect the federal budget and premiums.     Effect of the Inflation-Rebate and Negotiation Provisions on Launch                                   Prices         The Congressional Budget Office projects that the       inflation-rebate and negotiation provisions would increase       the launch prices for drugs that are not yet on the market       relative to what such prices would be otherwise. That effect       would primarily be driven by the inflation-rebate provisions       (sections 129101 and 129102), which would begin to apply to       prices within 12 months of a given drug's entering the       market. Under those provisions, manufacturers would have an       incentive to launch new drugs at a higher price to offset       slower growth in prices over time. The negotiation provision       (section 129001) would have less of an impact on launch       prices, CBO expects: Although the ceiling for a drug's       negotiated price is based on its price from a prior year,       negotiation could not occur until drugs were on the market       for a number of years--at least 7 for small-molecule drugs       and 11 for biologics.        Higher launch prices would primarily affect spending for       drugs in the Medicaid program, CBO projects, because an       increase in that program's basic rebate brought about by the       higher launch prices would only partly offset those prices.       Higher launch prices would also tend to affect spending for       drugs covered by Part B of the Medicare program because that       program's payments for those drugs are based on the average       sales prices. Over time, slower price growth would attenuate       the effect of higher launch prices.        In the commercial and Medicare Part D segments of the       market, spending would be less affected by higher launch       prices, CBO estimates, because manufacturers would have more       flexibility to manage rebates to maximize their revenues in       those sectors.   Effect of the Negotiation Provision on the Introduction of New Generic                                   Drugs         CBO has not analyzed the effects of the negotiation       provision on the introduction of new generic drugs. In       projecting the effects of the negotiation provision, CBO       estimated the share of spending that would be subject to       negotiation each year and the average reduction in prices       that would stem from the negotiations. But the agency did not       analyze how the provision would affect prices or spending on       specific drugs, nor did it quantify any impact on the       introduction of new generic drugs.                Effects of the Premium-Stabilization Provision         Under the premium-stabilization provision (section 129201),       the federal government would subsidize any growth in       beneficiaries' base premiums for Medicare Part D exceeding 6       percent from one year to the next over the 2024-2029 period.       The provision subsequently would lower the base premium       percentage (the percentage of the average cost of standard       Part D coverage that is used to calculate beneficiaries'       premiums) to ensure that premiums did not grow by more than 6       percent between 2029 and 2030. That subsidy and subsequent       reduction in premiums would increase federal spending by       roughly $40 billion over the 2024-2031 period, CBO estimates.       Beneficiaries' spending on premiums would be lower under the       premium-stabilization provision than it would be without it.        That estimate is an average effect among the possible paths       of premiums that CBO considered when modeling the uncertainty       of future outcomes. Under some of those paths, premiums would       grow by less than 6 percent a year, and the provision would       have no cost; under others, premiums would grow faster, and       the provision would generate costs.  [[Page H7650]]         I hope this information is useful to you and your       colleagues. Please contact me if you have further questions.            Sincerely,                                                 Phillip L. Swagel,                                                          Director.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman from  Washington State, and I would just like to point out that by doubling  the size of the IRS and adding 87,000 new IRS agents, that will result  in more than 20,000 of her families in Washington State who make less  than $20,000 a year that will be receiving audits.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin  (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record notice  from over 230 economists that this bill before us today would only  increase inflation.                     [From FOX Business, Aug. 4, 2022]     Over 230 Economists Warn Manchin's Spending Bill Will Perpetuate                                 Inflation                              (By Kelly Laco)         A letter sent to House and Senate leadership from 230       economists argues that the Inflation Reduction Act is       expected to contribute to skyrocketing inflation and will       burden the U.S. economy, contrary to President Biden and       Democrats' claims.        The economists wrote in the letter first obtained by Fox       News Digital that the U.S. economy is at a ``dangerous       crossroads'' and the ``inaptly named `Inflation Reduction Act       of 2022' would do nothing of the sort and instead would       perpetuate the same fiscal policy errors that have helped       precipitate the current troubling economic climate.''        Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va, announced last week he reached an       agreement with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, on       the $739 billion reconciliation Package after more than a       year of negotiations among Democrats.        The economic experts point to the $433 billion in proposed       government spending, which they argue ``would create       immediate inflationary pressures by boosting demand, while       the supply-side tax hikes would constrain supply by       discouraging investment and draining the private sector of       much-needed resources.''        Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., announced last week that he       reached an agreement with Senate Majority Leader Chuck       Schumer, D-NY, on the $739 billion reconciliation package       after more that a year of negotiations among Democrats. (F.       Carter Smith/Bloomberg via/Getty Images)        They also write that of ``particular concern'' is the       corporate minimum tax that they say will undercut efforts to       restore functioning supply chains.        In addition, the bill's prescription drug provisions       ``would impose price controls that  [[Page H7651]]       threaten healthcare innovation, creating a human health toll       that would add to the financial woes that Americans are       already experiencing.''        A few of the notable signers include Nobel laureate Vernon       Smith, former Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers Kevin       Hassett, former Director of the Office of Management and       Budget Jim Miller and Robert Heller, former president of the       Federal Reserve Board 1986-1989.        In addition, professors from the University of Chicago,       Princeton University, Duke University, the University of       Virginia, Columbia University and the University of Notre       Dame, among others, were listed on the letter dated Aug. 3.        The experts conclude that although they agree with an       ``urgent'' need to address inflation, Manchin's bill is a       ``misleading label'' applied to legislation that would       achieve the ``opposite effect''        President Biden urged Congress to pass the bill during a       virtual roundtable Thursday. ``My message to Congress is       this: Listen to the American people,'' he said. (Jonathan       Ernst/File Photo/ Reuters)        The letter was sent to Schumer, Senate Minority Leader       Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,       and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.        Schumer has touted the Inflation Reduction Act as an       immediate solution to inflation, which reached a new 40-year       high last month.        ``The Inflation Reduction Act will lower inflation, lower       the costs of prescription drugs, close loopholes long       exploited by big business who pay no or little taxes,''       Schumer said Thursday on the Senate floor.        In addition, Biden urged Congress to pass the bill during a       virtual roundtable Thursday. ``My message to Congress is       this: Listen to the American people,'' he said.        ``This is the strongest bill you can pass to lower       inflation, continue to cut the deficit, reduce health care       costs, tackle a climate crisis and promote America's energy       security and reduce the burdens facing working-class and       middle-class families,'' Biden continued.        However, Republicans are less enthusiastic about the more       than $700 billion spending and tax package.        Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told Fox News that       the bill raises taxes and ``calling it an inflation reduction       bill is rather laughable.'' (J. Scott Applewhite) (AP Images)        McCarthy told Fox News on Wednesday that ``Democrats have       no plans to solve all the problems they created'' and       Manchin's bill is not the solution.        In the Senate, McConnell stated this week that most of his       colleagues were ``somewhat shocked'' about Manchin's reversal       of previous positions He continued, telling Fox News that the       bill raises taxes and ``calling it an inflation reduction       bill is rather laughable.''        ``Democrats are catastrophically out of touch with what       American families actually care about. Their approval ratings       show it. And their reckless taxing and spending spree proves       it, as well,'' said McConnell in a statement this week.        The Senate is set to convene on Saturday to vote on a       procedural motion to move the bill forward. It is still       unclear if Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., will support the       legislation, and her vote is necessary for final passage of       the bill under reconciliation rules that would allow a       majority to pass.        Democrats previously touted a letter from 126 economists       supporting Manchin's bill.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Florida (Mr. Donalds).    Mr. Speaker, I want to point out that by  doubling the size of the IRS, working people in America, 85,000 more  families in the State of Texas, will face additional audits--these are  families who make less than $200,000--because of doubling of the IRS.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Smucker), who is a great leader on the Budget  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from  Pennsylvania an additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I want to point out to the  chairman of the Budget Committee that--maybe his staff has not  presented it to him--the Congressional Budget Office this morning--this  morning--confirmed that people making less than $400,000 a year will  face more audits.   You keep saying: Let the facts be real, no scare tactics.   The facts from the Congressional Budget Office are that, in fact,  your legislation is increasing more audits on people who make less than  $400,000 a year. I put it in the Record. You can read it there.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the great gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the great  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Guest).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cammack), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record analysis  from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, which confirms that  the bill increases taxes by $10.6 billion on individuals making under  $200,000 in 2023 and increases taxes by $32.6 billion across all  incomes.

Also the analysis does not include the effects of       spending under Subtitle C estimated by Congressional Budget       Office.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the good  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out to the  gentleman from Nevada that since Joe Biden has taken the oath of  office, his reckless spending has led to an inflation crisis that has  cost his families in Nevada $9,700 per family.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the great gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Carey).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Obernolte).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde), who definitely has experience with  the IRS.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much  time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   The solution to the inflation crisis that the Democrats have set  forward is to spend hundreds of billions of more dollars and to tax all  hardworking Americans once again.   You cannot spend your way out of inflation, and you cannot tax your  way out of recession. But that is the recipe that the one-party,  Democrat rule in Washington, D.C., has suggested for the hardworking  Americans who are barely surviving to put food on their table, clothes  on their backs, and gasoline in their cars.   I will point out to the chairman that his President's budget outlined  an additional $80 billion for the IRS. Highlighted in that budget he  wanted 87,000 IRS agents. That is where the number is coming from, from  your President, who provided a budget.   I know in the Budget Committee, we have never had a hearing on budget  for the last 3\1/2\ years. That is probably why you didn't know 87,000  auditors were in the President's budget.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
