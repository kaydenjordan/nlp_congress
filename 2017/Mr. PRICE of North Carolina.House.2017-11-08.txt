 Mr. Speaker, it is increasingly obvious  what a sham of a tax plan the Republicans have proposed, slashing taxes  on the superrich and large corporations at the expense of the middle  class.   What is less well known, and what the Republicans don't want to talk  about, is their proposal to repeal tax-exempt private activity bonds  and, therefore, to kill the same public-private partnerships that they  profess to support.   States, local governments, and private partners around the country  use private activity bonds to finance a wide array of infrastructure  projects, like highways, airports, hospitals, water treatment  facilities, and affordable housing.   In North Carolina, for example, private activity bonds financed and  upgraded the terminal at Raleigh-Durham International Airport and are  being used by our State housing agency to attract investors for new  multifamily housing developments worth more than $700 million.   If Republicans get their way, these projects would die on the vine,  and more than 6,200 units of affordable housing would simply disappear.   How does that help working families realize the American Dream?   At a time when funding for housing and infrastructure is continually  squeezed, the last thing we should do is push through a plan that would  hamstring our State and local governments and destroy our ability to  leverage private investment.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Republican tax plan.                            ____________________
