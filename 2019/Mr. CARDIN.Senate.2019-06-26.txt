 Mr. President, this administration is in crisis when it  comes to border security. John Sanders, the acting head of U.S. Customs  and Border Protection, resigned yesterday as a result of the growing  scandal and mistreatment of migrants, including children.   According to the Associated Press and NBC News reports, almost 300  migrant children have been removed from a Border Patrol facility in  Texas after media reports of lawyers describing ``appalling'' and  potentially dangerous conditions, DHS officials told NBC News. Lawyers  who recently visited two Texas facilities holding migrant children  described seeing young children and teenagers not being able to take  showers for days or even weeks, inadequate food, flu outbreaks, and  prolonged periods of detention. The facility in question has a capacity  of about 100 people. Yet 300 migrant children were there.   The children who were removed were being held at a border station in  Clint, TX. Some were wearing dirty clothes covered with mucous and even  urine, said one advocacy organization. Teenage mothers wore clothing  stained with breast milk. None of the children had access to soap or  toothpaste, according to officials at the Immigrants' Rights Clinic at  Columbia Law School. Some migrants were sleeping on concrete benches or  even outside at Border Patrol stations. This happened in the United  States of America, not some Third World nation.   One lawyer representing the immigrant children said:         Almost every child I spoke with had not showered or bathed       since they crossed the border--some of them more than three       weeks ago. There is a stench that emanates from some of the       children because they haven't had the opportunity to put on       clean clothes or to take a shower. . . . I have never seen       conditions as appalling as what we witnessed last week. The       children are hungry, dirty and sick and being detained for       long periods of time. . . . Children who are young themselves       are being told by guards they must take care of even younger       children. . . .  [[Page S4535]]       They don't know where their loved ones are who they crossed       the border with.    According to news reports, the children have now been taken to a  detention camp also in El Paso, TX, where they will remain under the  custody of Border Patrol until they can be placed with the Department  of Health and Human Services.   This is outrageous and unacceptable in the United States of America  or in any other country. We can and we must do better. What is  occurring in Texas may very well be a violation of our laws.   Federal law generally requires unaccompanied or separated migrant  children be transferred to HHS within 72 hours, but according to news  reports, some children at the Clint facility had been in Border Patrol  custody for weeks. That is in violation of Federal law. Now news  reports are saying these conditions have been replicated in other  border facilities, such as the Central Processing Center in McAllen,  TX.   Federal law also requires that children and families be held in  ``safe and sanitary'' facilities under the Flores settlement. The  public should be shocked that administration lawyers seem to argue that  these horrific conditions do not violate the Flores agreement or  Federal law. One government attorney recently argued that specific  amenities, such as soap, toothbrushes, and even half a night's sleep,  should not be required under the terms of the original settlement. The  argument drew criticism from the panel of judges at the Ninth Circuit  U.S. Court of Appeals.   One panel judge replied during the argument:         To me it's more like it's within everybody's common       understanding: If you don't have a toothbrush, if you don't       have soap, if you don't have a blanket, it's not safe and       sanitary. Wouldn't everybody agree to that? Would you agree       to that?    I certainly hope every Senator agrees with that, and I hope every  American does as well.   We have received conflicting media reports about children being moved  back and forth between different facilities that can only be described  as filthy and not fit for human habitation, particularly for children.  This is not what America should stand for.   President Trump's erratic actions on immigration and border security  have directly contributed to the crisis. Recall that President Trump  had literally shut down the entire U.S. Government in the failed effort  to fund an ineffective border wall. He has threatened to close down  borders entirely. He has cut off security assistance to the very  Central American countries that are trying to address the root causes  of migration, which is contributing to the migrant crisis at our  southern border.   This is an administration that instituted a policy of separating  children from their parents at the border. This is an administration  that proposed a Muslim travel ban. This is an administration that is  deliberately stoking fear by now threatening to tear apart families in  the United States with longstanding ties to the community.   Instead, President Trump should work with Democrats and Republicans  on comprehensive immigration reform. He could start by supporting  legislation I cosponsored entitled the Central America Reform and  Enforcement Act. This legislation would address many of the root causes  of migration and alleviate, not exacerbate, the suffering at our  southern border. This legislation would provide conditional security  assistance to Central American countries to combat the scourge of drug  cartels, violent gangs, and lawlessness that has pushed migrants to  journey north. It would enhance monitoring of unaccompanied children  after they are processed at the border and would ensure fair, orderly,  and efficient processing of those who reach our border seeking  protection.   I am pleased that at 2 o'clock today we will have the opportunity to  act.   Last week, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $4.6 billion  in emergency relief on an overwhelmingly, bipartisan vote--30 to 1.   I am pleased that this legislation will help better protect  vulnerable children in the custody of the Department of Health and  Human Services. The bill seeks to improve inhumane conditions for  migrants in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security. The  legislation improves due process protection for migrants.   The largest portion of this funding measure, $2.88 billion, goes to  the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is in charge of housing  unaccompanied children who are the most vulnerable group of migrants.  This office has advised Congress that it will run out of funds in July  and has already stopped making payments for education, legal, and  refugee support services.   The appropriations measure provides additional funds to assure the  safety and well-being of these children through social services and  case management to place children in appropriate homes, ideally with  family members who are already here in the United States.   The bill requires ORR facilities that house children to comply with  State-based licensure requirements, including minimum standards of  humane care, oversight and transparency, with an exception made for  influx facilities in emergencies.   The bill provides $1.3 billion to address increasingly inhumane  conditions for migrants apprehended and detained at DHS facilities. The  DHS inspector general found dangerous overcrowding at these facilities,  leading to sickness and even death in custody. The measure provides  additional funds for migrant food, clothing, medical, and baby  supplies, as well as funding to nonprofits and local jurisdictions  providing critical social services and shelter to migrants ultimately  released from DHS custody.   The legislation improves due process for migrants and reduces the  court backlog by nearly doubling the Legal Orientation Program, which  will significantly expand the number of migrants who have access to  their services. The bill provides additional funds to hire more  immigration judge teams to reduce backlog of pending immigration cases.   Now let me point out what this legislation does not permit in terms  of reining in some of the worst excesses of President Trump's  disastrous immigration policies. The legislation prohibits funding from  going to the President's border wall or new detention beds and  prohibits DHS from transferring funds for any other purpose. It  prohibits information obtained from potential sponsors of unaccompanied  children from being used in immigration enforcement actions.   I am pleased that last night the House of Representatives passed  their version of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill by a  vote of 230 to 195. The Senate will have an opportunity to vote on this  legislation at 2 o'clock, and I will support it. The House legislation  goes even further than the Senate legislation in enhancing protection  for migrant children in government custody.   I urge the Senate to pass the emergency supplemental appropriations  legislation later today, which provides desperately needed assistance  to the most vulnerable migrants, the children. Let us take steps to end  this humanitarian crisis on our own soil.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, the men and women who serve in our  military are incredible patriots, and the National Defense  Authorization Act, NDAA, is a vitally important bill the Senate passes  every year to ensure our servicemembers are trained, equipped, and  ready for the global threats our Nation faces. To this end, investing  in our ready and all-volunteer force to ensure we maintain a military  competitive advantage is crucial. I would like to highlight three  amendments that I have introduced to enhance the fiscal year 2020 NDAA.   My first amendment addresses an increasing concern regarding deaths  and injuries related to military training. Our men and women in uniform  volunteer to serve in a profession that carries a great deal of  inherent risk and can demand great sacrifice. Many have paid the  ultimate sacrifice with their lives upon the fields of battle.  Unfortunately, many have also died while training for battle. To ensure  that our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are the best fighting  force in the world, our military necessarily exercises them in  demanding and realistic training. Effective military training builds  readiness, tactical proficiency. and competence, and increases the  confidence of our military force to win wars. I am concerned, however,  that, under the guise of ``realistic training,'' the military is  assuming unnecessary risk that has resulted in an alarming increase in  servicemembers' training-related deaths.   In the past 9 weeks alone, six soldiers and marines have been killed  in military vehicle rollover accidents during training; an additional  34 service members have been injured. One of those killed on May 9,  2019, was my constituent from Chestertown, MD, 24-year-old Marine 1LT,  Hugh Conor McDowell, when his light armored vehicle rolled over during  a military training event at Camp Pendleton, CA.   Since 2015, noncombat deaths have exceeded the number of military  members killed in action every year. A 2018 House Armed Services  Committee Report stated, ``In 2017, nearly four times as many members  of the military died in training accidents as were killed in combat. In  all, 21 Service members died in combat while 80 died as a result of  non-combat training-related accidents.'' Training accidents are  occurring across the spectrum of military platforms, military aviation  incidents rose nearly 40 percent from 2013 to 2017. resulting in 133  military deaths; in 2017, 17 sailors were killed in two separate naval  ship collisions. Three of those who died were also Maryland residents.   Something needs to change in the military's current culture of  training safety, and the most recent losses of life reflect that the  current culture is increasing risk, not reducing it. When military  training yields nearly four times the casualties compared to combat,  training is no longer realistic, it is unsafe. These training accidents  are resulting in the unnecessary death and injury of our servicmembers  and are severely degrading our military readiness. No justifiable  reason exists for training that assumes unnecessary risk and disregards  the safety of our men and women in uniform. This worrisome trendline  since 2015 demands a serious examination of military training safety  and implementation of associated corrective actions across the entire  Department of Defense.   I have filed an amendment to the NDAA, which I hope the Senate will  consider, that would require the Department of Defense to conduct a  study that analyzes the recent training deaths of servicemembers;  provides an assessment of the associated trends, including vehicle  rollovers; and demands recommendations for actions to prevent or  minimize such deaths and injuries in the future. This report would be  due to Congress no later than 180 days after the enactment of the NDAA.  We owe it to the individuals who volunteer to serve, and their  families, to improve the military's culture of training safety and  prevent unnecessary deaths and injuries from occurring in training  environments.   Another important aspect of the NDAA is to ensure that our military  is investing in modernization and innovation to preserve our strategic  competitive advantage against our adversaries. I was pleased that  Senators Inhofe and Reed have included two of my amendments in division  E, the so-called managers' package of amendments to the substitute  amendment to the underlying bill. My two amendments focus on preserving  and bolstering modernization and innovation.   One of these amendments seeks to maintain the Nation's technological  superiority in energetics research and development. Energetics plays a  critical role in our national security in enhancing propulsion and  ordnance systems' effectiveness in terms ofreach, accuracy, and  lethality. Other nations, such as China and Russia, continue to make  strides in energetic material development, and the U.S. cannot afford  to fall behind. My amendment would require the Department of Defense to  develop an energetics research and development plan to ensure a long- term, multidomain research, development, prototyping, and  experimentations effort, which will have the additional benefit of  maintaining a robust defense industrial base and trained workforce. It  also requires the Secretary to work in conjunction with DOD Research  Labs, labs such as the Naval Surface Warfare Center at Indian Head, MD.  Indian Head is one of the premier research and development facilities  for energetics. The DOD would be required to brief the relevant  congressional Defense committees on this plan within a year of the  NDAA's enactment into law.   My other amendment seeks to preserve funding and staffing of Army  medical research and development efforts. The Department of Defense and  the Army's medical research and development efforts are critical to  increase warfighter readiness through improving health protection and  resilience, improving health delivery in deployed areas, and enhancing  the recovery and rehabilitation of our wounded servicemembers.   The Army's medical research and development has played a key role for  the Department of Defense, executing over 78 percent of DO D's medical  research, development, testing, and evaluation funding. I am proud to  say that the majority of this work runs through Ft. Detrick, MD, often  in partnership with the medical research programs at John's Hopkins,  the University of Maryland, and the Kennedy Krieger Institute. The  Army's medical research efforts have addressed medical issues unique to  the military, which private industry and academia have lacked interest  in conducting. Some examples include blast injuries, brain trauma, and  endemic diseases across the globe that our military has mobilized to  address, such as the Ebola outbreak in  [[Page S4563]]  Liberia. We need to ensure that in addition to investing in next  generation weapons to deter or destroy our adversaries, the Department  of Defense is preserving research and development resourcing for next  generation medical solutions that protect and save the lives of our  servicemen and women.   Readiness, modernization, and innovation are key pillars of the;  fiscal year 2020 NDAA; my three amendments strengthen those focus areas  by ensuring our servicemembers are receiving realistic but safe  training, are supported by weapons that are enhanced by energetic  materials, and are protected and treated by world-class military  medical solutions during their training and deployments. Our  servicemembers deserve the best, and our national security requires  that we maintain our competitive advantage. Let us ensure the fiscal  year 2020 NDAA incorporates the training safety, technological  innovation, and continued development of medical solutions required to  do so.    Mr. President, it is with great pride that I name  All Time Toys of Eldersburg, MD, the U.S. Senate Small Business of the  Week.   All Time's story and that of its owner Jason Barnes is one of  perseverance. That is because All Time has recovered from two 1,000- year flood events in less than 18 months.   On July 31, 2016, less than 2 months after Jason purchased All Time,  75 percent of his inventory was destroyed by a historic, fatal flash  flood that washed through Ellicott City, leaving millions of dollars'  worth of damage in its wake.   Within hours, countless videos of the destructive torrent rushing  down Main Street were being shared on social media and on the news. One  of those videos was of Jason leading a human chain to rescue a woman  trapped in her car. Jason's selfless act has been seen by millions of  people around the globe, and it earned him an award from the Carnegie  Hero Fund. When asked about his act of heroism, Jason said that he  ``just wanted to help any way'' he could and that he could not ``just  stand idly by.''   After the waters receded, Jason had to figure out how he would move  forward. Thanks to his persistence, and with support from the Maryland  Small Business Development Center,--SBDC--All Time reopened less than 6  months later on January 20, 2017; 2017 was a very successful year for  Jason and All Time. The company's sales doubled, it drastically  improved its business practices and systems, and Jason was scouting  locations for a second store.   Then on May 27, 2018, less than 2 years after the 2016 flood and less  than 18 months after All Time reopened, Ellicott City was devastated  again by another historic flash flood. This time, however, Jason was  prepared with a readiness plan and the business continuity strategies  he learned from the Maryland SBDC.   According to FEMA, 40 percent of small businesses that go through a  major disaster never open their doors again, and given that Jason was a  brand-new entrepreneur who had lost the vast majority of his stock, to  say that All Time beat the odds would be an understatement.   Jason's story is why the Small Business Committee invited him to  provide testimony during our hearing on the Small Business  Administration's Office of Disaster Assistance. In his deeply moving  testimony, Jason made clear that his recovery would not have been  possible without support from SBA, the Maryland SBDC, and its two  secret weapons: Maryland SBDC consultants Craig Panos and Garrett  Clover, whose advice and knowledge Jason called miraculous during the  hearing.   For too many small businesses, a major natural disaster marks the end  of a dream, but for Jason and All Time, surviving two historic floods  has opened up a new chapter defined by resilience and persistence. He  recently reopened All Time in nearby Eldersburg, MD, and he is once  again scouting locations for a second store.   I am proud of Jason's Free State perseverance, and I am honored to  recognize him and his entire team at All Time Toys as the Senate Small  Business of the Week. I look forward to watching their continued growth  and success.                            ____________________
