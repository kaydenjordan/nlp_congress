 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act authorizing funding  for the National Maritime Heritage Grants Program.   The competitive matching grant program, intended to enhance public  awareness, education, and appreciation for United States maritime  history, has not issued grants for the last serve years due to lack of  funding.   The Buffalo and Erie County Naval and Military Park in my community  is home to several decommissioned Naval vessels that serve as floating  museums, allowing visitors to be immersed in the incredible stories of  historic military battles and brave U.S. soldiers.   Without resources, ships like these across the country are  deteriorating and, in some cases, are literally sinking.   I ask my colleagues to support our amendment authorizing $10 million  for the National Maritime Heritage Grants Program and join me in  protecting irreplaceable maritime history from being lost forever.                            ____________________
