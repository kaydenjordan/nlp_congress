 Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the  amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).   His amendment would strike from the underlying bill a provision in  Section 108 that blocks the Trump administration from transferring  existing funds from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, known as the  Corps, for the construction of a wall or barrier along the U.S./Mexico  border.   I have been a very vocal opponent of this President's never-ending  political stunt to construct a wall along our southern border with  Mexico.   Through emergency supplemental bills, Congress provided billions of  dollars to help American families rebuild their lives after recent  storms and natural disasters, as well as prepare our country for future  disasters. This emergency money in the Corps budget is not a slush fund  to be raided by the President for his political purposes.   Americans have seen their lives upended, their homes and towns  destroyed, and havoc wreaked upon their local economies. Our government  should not abandon them in their hour of need.   I support Section 108 of the Energy and Water Appropriations title of  this bill that prohibits the President from transferring any funds  appropriated in this or earlier bills from being used for the  construction of this wall.   I was also pleased to join with the chairs of the Committee on  Transportation and Infrastructure, Mr. DeFazio, the Committee on  Appropriations, Mrs. Lowey, and the Subcommittee on Energy and Water,  Ms. Kaptur, in  [[Page H4740]]  challenging, in a letter, the underlying legal authority for the  President to re-allocate existing appropriated funds of the Corps'  Civil Works program for the construction of a physical barrier along  the southern border.   Madam Chair, I insert a copy of the letter in the Congressional  Record.                                  Congress of the United States,                                   Washington, DC, January 16, 2019.      Hon. Donald J. Trump,      The President, The White House,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. President: You have publicly indicated several       times that you may seek to declare a national emergency in       order to fund the construction of a physical barrier along       the southern border of the United States. Also, a number of       news reports suggest you are considering utilizing a       previously unused statutory authority to reallocate existing       funds of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) for this       construction.        We believe that any suggestion that you could use this       statutory authority for this purpose is misinformed. Simply       put, this authority does not authorize you to reallocate       existing Corps funds--including, but not limited to,       approximately $14 billion in disaster funds for communities       impacted by the 2017 and 2018 hurricanes or other natural       disasters--for the construction of the physical barrier. In       addition, we oppose the reallocation of existing Corps funds       from communities that are just starting to rebuild from the       devastation they faced, and for which Congress provided       emergency funds to help the lives and livelihoods of our       citizens.        Section 923(a) of the Water Resources Development Act of       1986 (33 U.S.C. 2293(a)) states that:        In the event of a declaration of war or a declaration by       the President of a national emergency in accordance with the       National Emergencies Act (90 Stat. 1255; 50 U.S.C. 1601) that       requires or may require use of the Armed Forces, the       Secretary, without regard to any other provision of law, may       (1) terminate or defer the construction, operation,       maintenance, or repair of any Department of the Army civil       works project that he deems not essential to the national       defense, and (2) apply the resources of the Department of the       Army's civil works program, including funds, personnel, and       equipment, to construct or assist in the construction,       operation, maintenance, and repair of authorized civil works,       military construction, and civil defense projects that are       essential to the national defense.        As you know, this authority has never been used by the       Corps since its enactment in 1986. Therefore, there is no       historical precedent on its use by any Presidential       administration. However, we believe that a plain reading of       this statutory provision does not provide legal authority to       reallocate existing appropriated funds of the Corps' civil       works program for the construction of the physical barrier       along the southern border you have called for.        First, section 923 unequivocally states that actions funded       by this provision ``require or may require use of the Armed       Forces'' (emphasis added). In our opinion, there is nothing       uniquely related to the planning, design, or construction of       the physical barrier that would suggest the Armed Forces' (in       this case, the Corps) involvement in these activities is       required. We understand that the Corps has, on previous       occasions and through its Support for Others authority,       participated in prior design and construction activities       related to existing barriers along with the southern border.       But, it is also our understanding that these activities were,       at best, supportive roles to other Federal agencies,       including the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and that       none of these activities were paid for using the Corps' civil       works funds.        The legislative history of section 923 further highlights       Congress' intent that there be a military nexus as a       prerequisite to use of this authority. In contemporaneous       hearings before the Senate Committee on Environment and       Public Works, the then-Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army       (Civil Works) testified on the limited scope of this       authority--noting that this authority ``would be available       only in two limited situations: in time of war declared by       Congress, or in time of national emergency, military in       nature, declared by the President in accordance with the       National Emergences Act'' (emphasis added).        It is our belief that construction of a physical barrier       along the southern border fails to meet either of these       limited situations. On the former, there is no active       declaration of war related to the border crossing. On the       latter, there is no justification that construction of the       physical barrier is military in nature. The term ``military       in nature,'' again, implies that the situation requires the       unique presence or involvement of the Department of Defense       in its military (Armed Forces) capacity. While the Corps is a       component of the Department of Defense, its civil works       mission is focused on water resources development activities       and emergency response to natural disasters. It is in that       capacity that the Corps provides domestic construction-      related assistance through its authorized civil works       activities, or through its Support for Others authority. Yet,       these authorities are solely distinct from the Corps' role in       supporting the combat and installation readiness needs of the       Department of Defense. In our view, because construction of a       physical barrier does not necessitate the actions of the       Department of Defense in its military capacity, the use of       the Corps for construction of the barrier would not fall       within the limited scope of section 923.        Second, section 923 also requires that any project, for       which construction, operation, maintenance, and repair work       is funded under this authority, be specifically authorized by       Congress. As noted in the Congressional Record during Senate       consideration of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986,       ``[this] section does not provide authority to construct any       project not authorized by law.'' Yet, the proposed physical       barrier that you are contemplating is not specifically       authorized by Congress--not as a civil works project, not as       a military construction project, and not as a civil defense       project. Therefore, your potential use of this authority       for the proposed physical barrier would fail a second test       of applicability.        Even if you were to ignore the plain text of section 923,       and continue to pursue this authority to reallocate existing       funds from the Corps, we want to be very clear who would be       impacted by your decision.        It is our understanding that the administration has       identified potentially $14 billion in construction funds from       the 2018 Supplemental Appropriations related to Hurricanes       Harvey, Irma, and Maria, as well as other disasters (Pub. L.       115-123) and an additional $2.9 billion in supplemental       appropriations related to Superstorm Sandy that remain       unobligated. These funds were specifically appropriated by       Congress to help communities in impacted states and       territories recover from devastating natural disasters.        In July 2018, the Corps released its list of specific       projects for which the 2018 Supplemental funds are planned to       be utilized. This list includes, approximately: $4.5 billion       for the State of Texas; $2.4 billion for the Commonwealth of       Puerto Rico; $2.4 billion for the State of California; $1.2       billion for the State of Louisiana; and $700 million for the       State of Florida.        Each of the states and territories that received an       allocation of emergency supplemental funds by Congress were       uniquely impacted by natural disasters.        For example, in the City of Houston, Texas, officials       believe that 82 people were killed, 13,000 people were       rescued, and more than 42,000 people were forced into       shelters by Hurricane Harvey (in addition to the 6 million       Texans who were otherwise impacted by the storm). Similarly,       in 2017, Puerto Rico faced Hurricanes Irma and Maria, with       Maria now designated as the third deadliest hurricane in U.S.       history, killing thousands of citizens, and disabling the       entire power grid of the Commonwealth for months. While these       are just two examples of the devastating impacts of recent       natural disasters, they are indicative of why Congress       decided to provide robust emergency funding to these and       similarly impacted communities that are only now starring to       rebuild.        In our view, it would be the height of irresponsibility to       take away vital reconstruction funds from communities       impacted by recent natural disasters, leaving these       communities at continued vulnerability to future disasters,       and future loss of life.        Again, we believe that section 923 of the Water Resources       Development Act of 1986 does not provide you with legal       authority to reallocate existing Corps funds to the       construction of a physical barrier along the southern border.       In addition, we oppose the transfer of Corps funds away from       communities that have already suffered enough from the       impacts of recent natural disasters, and strongly urge you       not to utilize these allocated recovery dollars for any       purpose related to the construction of the physical barrier.            Sincerely,      Peter A. DeFazio,        Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.      Grace F. Napolitano,        Member of Congress.      Nita M. Lowey,        Chairwoman, Committee on Appropriations.      Marcy Kaptur,        Chairwoman-designate, Subcommittee on Energy and Water       Development and Related Agencies.     Madam Chair, the construction of the President's  wall is the wrong way to address our Nation's immigration challenges.  This amendment would allow the President to abandon families in  California, Texas, Puerto Rico, Florida, the Midwest, and elsewhere,  that were impacted by recent natural disasters, in their hour of need.   I thank Chairwoman Kaptur for including much-needed funding in this  bill for the Army Corps of Engineers to do their job, and for including  Section 108 that protects the Army Corps from the political stunt of  building a border wall.   Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment.
