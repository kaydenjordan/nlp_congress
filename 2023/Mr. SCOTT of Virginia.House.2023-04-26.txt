 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the  reckless default on our debt act.   Unfortunately, those on the other side of the aisle have taken the  full faith and credit of the United States hostage and have offered a  terrible deal for the American people. Either they will inflict cruel  cuts on vital programs for working families or they will destroy the  economy.   Earlier this week, as has been pointed out, this plan was evaluated  by Moody's Analytics, and they confirmed that almost 800,000 jobs will  be lost. When they say the cuts aren't that bad, tell that to 200,000  children who will lose access to Head Start, 100,000 parents who will  lose access to childcare, the 26 million students who are in title I  schools who will get cuts in funding, or 6.6 million students who will  lose money in Pell grants, or the tens of millions who will lose the  funding for the student debt relief that has been promised.   These spending cuts are necessary, frankly, to pay for the Republican  tax cuts that weren't paid for at the time. Eighty percent of the Trump  tax cuts were scheduled to go to the top 1 percent and corporations,  and now we are going to pay for them with cuts to education,  healthcare, veterans' programs, and others.   I get tired of being lectured by the Republicans when it comes to  fiscal responsibility because we know that every Republican  Presidential administration since Nixon has left office with a worse  deficit situation than they inherited, and every Democratic  administration since Kennedy has left office with a better deficit  situation than they inherited.   Democrats are ready to act to prevent a devastating economic default,  just as we did three times under the Trump administration with little  fanfare. President Biden and Democrats have already significantly cut  the deficit, and we are willing to do more, but we want to do it in a  way that is responsible and helps families. This bill hurts families,  and we need to oppose the bill.
