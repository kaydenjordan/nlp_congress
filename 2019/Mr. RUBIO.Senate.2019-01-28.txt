 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to talk about the bill before us, S.  1. We have had multiple attempts to get onto this bill. I am hopeful  that today will be that day.                                  Venezuela    Mr. President, I wanted to briefly, for just a moment, divert to a  different topic on Venezuela that was in the news about an hour and a  half ago. The administration announced additional measures. It has been  covered in the press, largely as sanctions on the regime of Nicolas  Maduro, the illegitimate usurper and head of the criminal syndicate  that controls the security agencies in that country.   While it most certainly is going to hurt him, I think it is important  to point out that the more accurate way to describe it is that  Venezuela sends about 500 billion barrels of crude oil a day to the  United States to be refined. That belongs to the Venezuelan people.  What has been happening is that U.S. refineries pay for it. It is about  three-quarters of the cash generated by the state-run oil company.   Then, Maduro and his cronies steal that money--not to build roads or  feed people. They steal it to bribe and keep people loyal to him. If  you are a high-ranking general in Venezuela, with the fancy uniforms  and the stars and bars, in those pictures that you see--why are they  loyal to Maduro? They are ``loyal'' to him because he keeps providing  them access to corruption. One way is by pilfering and completely  taking all that cash out of the state-run oil company. That ends today.   What is going to be done now is that U.S. refineries are still  allowed to buy crude, but the payments, instead of being made to Maduro  so he can steal it, will be set aside in an account to be used by the  legitimate government of that country. If you are one of these corrupt  officials who has been ``loyal'' to Maduro up until today because of  the money, that is about to end, as well, and perhaps you should  reevaluate your loyalty, for lack of a better term.  [[Page S692]]                                          S. 1    Mr. President, the topic before us today is S. 1. This bill, among  other things, is a response to decisions that were made recently on the  U.S. presence in Syria. I believe that the decision to draw down is a  mistake. I have communicated that to the President, and he invited us  to the White House a couple of weeks ago to have a conversation with a  group of us. Irrespective of what ends up happening, there are going to  be byproducts of that decision. There will be consequences of it.  Several of those consequences are going to directly impact our allies  in the region.   Let me begin by saying that it will directly impact the United  States. We already see that ISIS in Syria was on the path to morphing  into an insurgency. An insurgency is different than what they used to  be. ISIS used to take over big pieces of land and fly their black flag,  and they had buildings. In some ways, that is terrifying because they  control land and they have people under their command. In some ways, it  is easier to target them. They are telling you where they are, and you  can see it, and it is out in the open.   Insurgency is different. It is when you blend into the population. By  day, you might be a baker or guy who runs a cafe. By night, you are an  ISIS killer. They sort of come in and out of the population. They don't  control large swaths of territory. They sort of embed themselves. This  insurgency is the threat we face and the challenge we had in Iraq that  led to the surge to have to come back in and rectify it. ISIS was  already on the path to doing that. This will make it easier for them.  It is harder to target an insurgency than it is to target the  caliphate.   I am deeply concerned that the U.S. withdrawal will make it easier  for them not to just establish an insurgency but, worst of all, it will  provide greater operational safety. That means more space in which they  can plot to attack the United States and our interests around the  world, and even here in the Homeland. There is real reason to be  concerned about that. You know, 9/11 doesn't happen if al-Qaida doesn't  have a safe haven in Afghanistan. I fear what ISIS might be able to do  if, in portions of Syria, they are able to establish a safe haven from  which they can raise money, produce videos, recruit, try to inspire  terrorist attacks abroad, and even direct them.   But one of the other byproducts is the impact it has with regard to  Israel. Envision for a moment a small country whose narrowest point is  only 9 or 10 miles wide, and it faces a threat to its north in Syria.  In Syria already, in addition to ISIS and all of these other criminal  and terrorist elements that are there, you have a growing Iranian  presence. That growing Iranian presence begins with Iran itself. If  current trends continue, Iran is going to base within Syria surface-to- air missiles designed to shoot down airplanes. They are going to base  ballistic missiles even closer now to Syria. They don't have to launch  them up to Israel. They don't have to launch them from Iran. They can  now launch them from Syrian territory, just off the Israeli border.  They have UAVs. We have seen how the Houthis have helped to  operationalize those. All of that is sponsored by Iran operating out of  Yemen.   One of the mortal enemies that Israel faces is Hezbollah. They are  headquartered primarily in Lebanon, but there are Hezbollah elements  all over Syria. For a long time now, they have been getting their  armaments and weaponry from Iran, but it had to be flown, especially in  the middle of this conflict.   Imagine that now Iran has the ability to arm and equip Hezbollah with  all of these things, not just from the air but through a ground route  where they can actually ship things to them from the ground. That is  why they so desperately care about what is happening in Syria. It gains  them operational space--not to mention that Hezbollah is in Syria.   There is a wing of Hezbollah that is inside of Syria. Imagine that  now, if you are Israel, you already face the threat of Hezbollah.  Hezbollah has already developed rockets that they are now making. They  are not shipping them anymore. They are now building these rockets.  They are developing these rockets in Lebanese territory. They are not  the rockets from the last time they had a war with Israel. These new  rockets are precision guided, meaning they can actually aim them to hit  certain areas and avoid hitting others.   They have a lot more than they used to have. Just by volume, they can  overwhelm Israeli defenses very quickly or potentially. You already  have that problem in Lebanon. Imagine that exact same problem, not just  from Lebanon but to the north of you, coming from Syria, just across  the Golan Heights.   Imagine you are Israel and you have your mortal enemy Iran, your  mortal enemy Assad, your mortal enemy Hezbollah, and these other  radical Shia groups all to the north of you in that country. Israel is  taking action. They are increasingly and openly acknowledging this as  they launch these attacks into Syria to try to degrade their  capabilities and put themselves in that position. They cannot allow  people and they cannot allow organizations whose very existence is  justified by the destruction of the Jewish State to openly operate and  increase their capacity just north of their borders. That is what is  happening, and that is why Israel is increasingly striking.   Listen to the words in a broadcast that I believe was yesterday or  the day before. The head of Hezbollah was on television in an open  television interview, and he basically warned Israel. He said: If  Israel continues to strike within Syria in this way, it is going to  lead to a war. It is going to lead to a war because Syria and its  allies, including them, but also Iran, are going to have to retaliate  for these attacks.   Walk through this with me. Israel attacks out of self-defense because  they have to. Syria, Hezbollah, and Iran, and a gang of others respond  against Israel. Then, Israel has to respond in kind, potentially, even  hitting Hezbollah inside of Lebanon, and suddenly we have another  Israel-Hezbollah war, but much broader than the last one because it  will involve Syria and it will involve Iran, and it will be far  deadlier because, unlike the last time, they now have a lot more of  these missiles and these missiles are precision-guided.   This is the threat that Israel faces. It is very real. Events there  can quickly spiral into that. One of the things our bill does is it  puts in law the memorandum of understanding between the United States  and Israel that says that, in the case of conflict, the United States  will be there to help Israel rearm and reequip itself, and we will work  hand-in-hand with them on things like missile defense, which are  mutually beneficial, by the way, because all these innovations  happening there can also benefit us here or by protecting our presence  around the world.   Why is this bill important? First, because of the practical  implications of it. We want Israelis to be able to defend and protect  themselves. It sets aside, in our arsenal, weapons that are held there  for purposes of if Israel ever needs them. For those who are worried  about whether that would degrade our own capability, the law says it  has to be done in a way that doesn't degrade our own capabilities to  defend ourselves. It sets in place the assurance that if Israel gets  into one of these wars that quickly escalates against multiple  parties--Hezbollah, Iran, potentially Syria, themselves--and they start  running out of weaponry--rockets to defend themselves, munitions and  the like--we will be there to quickly rearm them. That is just the  practical implication of it.   Here is the other: Israel's adversaries will know this too. They  would know that if their goal is to overwhelm Israel and deplete  Israel, it will not work because the United States is committed to  them.   Our hope here is two-fold. One is to strengthen Israel so they would  be able to withstand such an assault, but the other is to hopefully  deter a war by making it very clear that Israel will never run out of  missiles. They will never run out of munitions to defend themselves  because the United States will be there to support them every step of  the way.   One of the first things this bill does is it establishes that into  our law because this is not a threat that is going to go away in 2  years or even 5 years. This threat is an ancient one. It has grown more  dangerous.  [[Page S693]]    This bill was held up because my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle said they didn't want to hear any bills until the shutdown was  over if the bill didn't have to do with the shutdown. The shutdown is  over. I am hopeful today that this bill, which I believe enjoys wide  bipartisan support, when we finally get the vote on it and passage,  that we will have an extraordinary number of votes across the aisle and  across this Chamber and that we will finally begin debate on this  important topic.   There are other elements in this bill involving human rights  violations that occurred in Syria, supporting Jordan, and the BDS  movement, which we will talk more about tomorrow. At its core, the  linchpin is helping Israel defend itself.   I yield the floor.
