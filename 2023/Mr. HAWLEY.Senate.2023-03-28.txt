 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday the Nation witnessed a murderous  rampage at an elementary school, a small Christian school in Nashville,  TN. Tragically, three small children, 9 years old, lost their lives;  three employees of this school lost their lives. And even as I am on  this floor now, Nashville police are releasing the body cam footage of  the officers who responded with heroic speed and heroic courage to the  deranged individual who made her way into that school and was executing  students and teachers one by one.   Those officers deserve to be praised; they deserve to be thanked;  they deserve to be honored for what they did and for the lives that  they saved.   We must also tell the truth about what happened yesterday in  Nashville. This murderous rampage, this taking of innocent life was a  horrific crime; but, more specifically, it was a hate crime. A crime  that, according to Nashville police, specifically targeted--that is  their word--targeted the members of this Christian community, the  members of this religious institution, its students, its educators, its  employees.   Let's be clear, Federal law prohibits the targeting of violence  against any American on the basis of religious affiliation or religious  practice or religious belief.   But that is, according to police, exactly what we saw happen  yesterday. The members of this community were singled out because of  their religious affiliation. And now, three young children are dead,  and three educators are dead because of their affiliation with this  religious institution, because of their beliefs, because of their work,  because of their service. That is a crime under Federal law, and it  must be treated as such.   Today I have called on the director of the FBI and the Secretary of  Homeland Security to open a Federal investigation, a Federal hate crime  investigation, into what happened in Nashville. We need the facts. We  need to know about the premeditated crime. We need to know about what  this shooter did and intended to do. We need to know about the  influences. What kind of violent rhetoric motivated this shooter? Were  there others involved?   This contagion of hateful rhetoric and violence must not be allowed  to spread, and that is why we need all Federal resources, according to  Federal law, devoted now on the ground in Nashville to get the facts  and to stop the violence from spreading further.   And I call on this body, every Member of this body, to condemn, in  the clearest of terms, this hate crime against this community in  Nashville. Today, I will introduce a resolution explicitly condemning  this massacre as the hate crime that it is and calling upon this body  to condemn hateful rhetoric that leads to violence. Hateful rhetoric  against religious believers, religious institutions, religious  communities that leads to violence.    This isn't speculation; this is a tragic fact. It is happening before  our eyes, and we must condemn it. And I would call on those corporate  partners who  [[Page S980]]  are so quick to weigh in on social issues, now, make your voice heard.  Condemn this violence as the hate crime that it is. Stand with this  community in Nashville. This is a time to be heard. This is a time to  be clear about what has happened and is unfolding before our very eyes.   And let's just be crystal clear, rhetoric about days of vengeance and  genocide, rhetoric directed against religious believers of whatever  background--whether they are Presbyterians like the students and  teachers and employees targeted yesterday or some other Christian  affiliation or Orthodox Jews or Catholics or whatever the religious  background--it is a crime under Federal law to target and commit acts  of violence against Americans because of their religious beliefs,  because of their religious affiliation, because of their religious  practices.   This should not happen in the United States of America, and now we  must act to see that it does not spread.   And so I hope the Senate will soon take up my resolution. I hope that  every Member of this body will be clear about what has happened in  Nashville and will be clear in standing against the violence, in  standing against the hate, in standing against the rhetoric, in  standing with this community that needs now our support, that needs now  our encouragement and condolences, yes, but also needs our action.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 40 and ask that  it be reported by number.    Mr. President, this body has spent to date $113 billion  on the war in Ukraine and counting. Yet we do not have any direct  oversight of any of the money that is being spent.   My amendment is very simple. Let's create 1 government watchdog--not  2, not 3, not 20; 1 government watchdog--to oversee every cent that is  spent on Ukraine and to report back to this Congress and to the  American people as to how their hard-earned money is being spent.   Currently, there are dozens of reporting requirements. There are  multiple bureaucrats who are involved.   Listen, we learned this the hard way in Afghanistan, where, after  years of lack of oversight, billions of dollars wasted, and,  tragically, many lives lost, this body finally created a special  inspector general to oversee the Afghanistan effort and reporting  requirements, to report back to the public on what we knew and were  learning. That is what we should do in this case.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.    Mr. President, do I have any time left?    Mr. President, I would just say, in response to my  friend's point about there being 60-plus reporting requirements already  in place, that is part of the problem. When everybody is in charge,  nobody is in charge.   Currently, the oversight requirements are spread across three  different Agencies of the inspector general. The State Department, the  Defense Department, and USAID each would have a little piece of this-- dozens of disparate requirements.   Let's unify it. We have done this before--one inspector general, one  staff, one set of requirements. Make it public. Give the American  people the accountability they deserve.   I urge a ``yes'' vote.   I yield the floor.                           Vote on Amendment No. 40
