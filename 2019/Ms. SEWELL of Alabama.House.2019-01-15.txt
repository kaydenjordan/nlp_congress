 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  extraordinary life and legacy of late Mayor Larry Paul Langford. Mayor  Langford was a beloved mayor of Birmingham and Fairfield, as well as  serving Jefferson County as its first African American president of the  Jefferson County Commission. He devoted much of his time to big ideas  for the people whom he loved in the communities that he served.   Mayor Langford will be remembered as a larger-than-life personality  who broke barriers as the first Black reporter for the region at WBRC;  the first Black mayor of Fairfield, Alabama; the first Black president  of the Jefferson County Commission; and as mayor of Birmingham. A  Vietnam vet, Mayor Langford served in public office in multiple  capacities for nearly 23 years, and he will be greatly missed by our  community.   On March 17, 1946, Larry Langford was born to John Langford and to  Lillian Nance Langford as the oldest of six children. He was a proud  graduate of Parker High School in Birmingham, Alabama. After high  school, he enlisted in the United States Air Force, serving for 5 years  during the Vietnam war.   Langford returned home with a renewed sense of community and a  renewed sense of service. He quickly completed his college degree at  the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and he became the first  African American male to become a news reporter for WBRC 6 News in its  region.   The importance of this role was never lost on Langford. He knew that,  after the tumultuous decade before, to have an African American man  reporting the news in this area was an important sign of progress in  the city of Birmingham. Langford did well as a reporter, using his  charisma and outgoing personality. He was able to speak with the people  of Birmingham and tell their stories.   Langford decided to run for his first political office. He was  elected to the Birmingham City Council in 1977, where he quickly became  known as the liveliest and most outspoken of city council members, as  well as the most media savvy.   During his time on the Birmingham City Council, he also worked as a  radio news director and contributed to the Birmingham Times. After an  unsuccessful run for mayor of the city of Birmingham against fellow  Councilman Richard Arrington, Jr., in 1979, Langford temporarily  retreated from public life. By 1982, Langford had moved to Fairfield,  Alabama, a suburb of Birmingham, and married the love of his life, Miss  Melva Ferguson. A few years later, he decided to return to public life  and ran for mayor of Fairfield, handily defeating a crowded field of  candidates.   Langford became the first African American mayor of the city of  Fairfield in 1988, another first. After his election, he led an  aggressive campaign to revitalize the city. Langford was granted more  authority and helped to save the Fairfield City Schools from  bankruptcy, and he pushed for regional cooperation in economic  development that led to an agreement between 11 Jefferson County  municipalities which joined forces in 1998 to finance and construct a  $90 million project called Visionland, an amusement park that he  brought to the city of Birmingham. It was actually in Bessemer, and it  was part of a regional cooperation.   During his four terms as Fairfield mayor, Langford set his eyes on  the Jefferson County Commission, where he hoped to continue to develop  more regional cooperation in economic development. Langford was elected  to the Jefferson County Commission in 2002, defeating the incumbent.   After becoming elected to the commission, he was quickly elected by  his peers to be its president, another first. During his tenure as  president of the Jefferson County Commission, he proposed a 1 percent  sales tax that helped build 30 new schools and generated over $1  billion in revenue.   In 2006, Mayor Langford ran again for the mayor of Birmingham for a  second run. This time, he was successful and won in a very crowded  field without a runoff.   Mayor Langford was sworn into office on November 13, 2007, as mayor  of Birmingham. He went on to strike an agreement with a foundation that  provided computers to schoolchildren throughout the city of Birmingham.  Nearly 17,000 elementary and middle school children received laptops  that year.   While Mayor Langford's 23-year political career resulted in many  successful public projects, his service was not without controversy.  Mayor Langford's tenure as mayor of Birmingham was cut short when a  jury found him guilty of public corruption on October 28, 2009, and he  was sentenced to 15 years. After serving 8\1/2\ years, on December 28,  2018, due to his failing health, Mayor Langford's sentence was commuted  by a Federal judge, giving him compassionate release. The next day,  Mayor Langford was transferred from a Federal prison to Birmingham  Hospital, where he remained until his death.    I want you to know, on a personal note, Mayor Langford was an  outstanding mayor and his service will always be remembered and beloved  by the community that loved him so much. I was honored to be a part of  his funeral and to help him get his compassionate release. It is  important that we remember the totality of his career.   I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering Mayor Larry Langford.                            ____________________
