 Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern.)                          January 6 Wounds Must Heal     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today to discuss some other theories  and to honor this month, Black History Month, with first an  announcement.   Last year, the Governor of Kentucky wrote President Biden asking him  to promote Colonel Charles Young to brigadier general.   Charles Young is not a name that most people in the country probably  recognize. Charles was a ``buffalo soldier.'' He was the third African  American to graduate from West Point. And stories are legendary as to  what Charles went through.   Charles was born a son of slaves back in 1864 in Kentucky, but he  rose and went into the military at the urging of his father and  performed heroically. However, for obvious reasons, he was stuck at  lieutenant colonel and never got the promotion which he deserved.   So, posthumously, last week, the Defense Department, upon the request  of the Governor of Kentucky--and I was pleased to write a letter to the  President in support of that request--Charles was promoted to general.  I thank the Defense Department for repairing that fault.   Now, Mr. Speaker, Black History Month started out back in 1926. It  was started by Dr. Carter G. Woodson and the Association for the Study  of Negro Life and History.   Now, Dr. Woodson is known by most of us as the father of Black  history. Dr. Woodson had some strong feelings about the contributions  that African Americans were making to this great country that were  going untold and intentionally ignored. So Dr. Woodson and the  association lobbied for a week to focus the country's attention on the  contributions of Black Americans. He was successful, and as I said, in  1926, the week was established.   Now, back in the sixties, many college campuses had a lot of activity  going on on those campuses, and I am very familiar with some of them,  but one of the things that came up was this focus on the contributions  of African Americans. And so a movement started on these campuses. They  decided--in fact, quite frankly, I believe Kent University was the  first university that decided--that it would just celebrate and focus  on African-American history for the entire month of February, that a  week was not enough.   Now, we hear a lot of stories about February being the shortest month  of the year and why that was set aside for the study of Black history.  Well, the fact of the matter is, the number of days in the month had  nothing to do with it. It was all about 2 days in the month of  February.   When the agreement was made to celebrate Black History Month, Carter  G. Woodson and the association picked February because February 12 was  the birthday of Abraham Lincoln, and February 14 was the birthday of  Frederick Douglass. So to embrace both of those birthdays, they picked  a week in February that encompassed the two days. That is how it got to  be February.   And then, of course, with the agitation on the college campuses, they  started a tradition of celebrating the whole month. And, of course, in  1969 the activity took place up at Kent, and in 1976 President Gerald  Ford decided to officially recognize the month of February as Black  History Month. That is how we got to this point. And every President  since has followed suit.   Now, today, the teaching of Black history has taken on a new meaning  in this polarized country that we are currently experiencing. The  publication, Education Week, reports that since January 2021--so 13  months--14 States led by Republican Governors, Florida, Georgia,  Alabama, South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Utah, Oklahoma, Texas,  Iowa, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Montana, and Idaho have all imposed  restrictions or bans on teaching about racial issues. And legislation  is currently pending in another 23 States.    Black History Month, as I just indicated, was established officially  by a Republican President, Gerald Ford, but we have become so polarized  and this has become so politicized that in the last 13 months, 14  States led by Republican Governors have imposed restrictions or bans on  teaching about racial issues.   These States claim to be protecting the K-12 students from being  taught critical race theory, or as we have seen  [[Page H1094]]  in some publications, things that make White children uncomfortable.   I would like to remind all of us, especially my friends on the other  side of the aisle, that theory is part of the higher education  experience and is not part of any curriculum in K-12. Instead, these  students are being taught facts, what I call critical race facts.   Now, all of us are aware of the contributions of people like Rosa  Parks, Martin Luther King, Jr., Harriet Tubman, and none of us seem to  be uncomfortable with knowing about these people. But, Mr. Speaker,  there are a lot of other people of color who have made significant  contributions to the growth and development of this great country that  have been intentionally left out of our history books. And for some  strange reason, people seem to feel that students will be uncomfortable  learning about those contributions. It is important to the full  development of all children to be taught exactly what this country is  all about.   Let me offer a few examples of what I am talking about here. In fact,  I opened up Black History Month this year speaking to students over at  Gonzaga High School. And in that speech, as I have done on this floor,  I looked up at the lights, and I talked to those students a little bit  about the person that history records as responsible for the light  bulb: Thomas Edison. Nobody argues with that. We are very comfortable  with knowing that, reading about that in the history books, and  studying about Thomas Edison that many of us call ``the greatest  inventor of all times.''   But the fact of the matter is that Thomas Edison did invent the light  bulb, but a very critical, unknown fact to most people is that he could  not get the light bulb to work. He could get it to come on, but he  couldn't get it to stay on. And it was not until someone told Thomas  Edison about an African American, a young man, the son of former  slaves--his parents had escaped from slavery, and they were living up  in Massachusetts--this young man was totally different from Thomas  Edison; his name was Lewis Latimer.   Thomas Edison was informed that this light bulb that he couldn't get  to stay on, this guy up in Massachusetts might be able to solve his  problem, if he could just step outside of his comfort zone. Oh, it may  be uncomfortable, but if you can step outside of your comfort zone and  sit down with Lewis Latimer, this man has invented a filament that  might make your light bulb work.   Thomas Edison decided to do that. He wanted to light the world. He  was having problems. For some reason he could not get it done.                                time  1245    So he went up to Massachusetts and he sat down with Lewis Latimer.  And sure enough, Lewis Latimer's filament, when put inside of Thomas  Edison's light bulb, it worked. And together, they lit the world.   It should not be uncomfortable for people to know about Lewis  Latimer. That is not critical race theory. That is a critical racial  fact that ought to be known by all children and adults. And what is  wrong with teaching that in the classrooms? For some strange reason, a  lot of people feel that would be uncomfortable for children to learn.   There are plenty other examples like that. I think today of another  one, the steam engine. Nobody will argue about how important the steam  engine was and still is to the industrial revolution. And if you ask  people, most people from the books they have learned, who invented the  steam engine, they will tell you Thomas Savery. And they would be  correct.   But when Thomas Savery invented the steam engine, it would overheat  and they would have to cut the engine off. And sometimes in order to  keep from cutting it off, they would employ a person they called an  oiler. And that person's job was to pour oil on this engine so it would  keep running. They would not have to shut it down. And it was a very  dangerous job; some lost their limbs carrying out their duties.   But there was a guy working in a similar situation who came up with  an automatic oil pan. He designed a way for the engine to self- lubricate so he would not have to turn it off and lose production, so  he would not have to employ a person who could lose a limb.   That man's name was Elijah McCoy, who also--according to my  research--was the son of slaves. He was a prolific inventor. This was  just one of the things that he invented. In fact, Elijah McCoy's genius  was so well-thought of and highly respected, and he had invented so  many things to make life better, to make production more profitable, to  make this country a better place. And out of respect for his genius,  the stories are told that whenever anybody came up with some gadget or  something to make life easier, the question was asked often, ``Is this  a real McCoy?'' It is very comfortable for people, even today, to use  that phrase, ask that question:   Is that the real McCoy? Are you the real McCoy?   Why would it be so uncomfortable for children in the classroom to  know that that iconic phrase came about as a result of the significant  contribution to the human spirt, to the greatness of America by an  African American named Elijah McCoy. Why is that to be uncomfortable?  There is nothing that should be uncomfortable about that.   I also think today about another African American, Garrett A. Morgan.  Now, all of us marvel at the gas mask. I remember as a child, the first  time I saw one and experimented with how it worked, I had no idea of  the origin of it at the time. In fact, if I were to read the books that  were published, I still would not have known the real origin, because  in the books, they would tell you that John Haldane, a Scottish  inventor who came to this country, and supposedly during World War I,  invented the first gas mask.   But the critical fact is World War I started in 1914; ended in 1918.  But in 1911 or thereabouts, a man named Garrett Morgan, also from  Kentucky, he was born to a mother who was Native American and a father  who was African American, who was also a former slave.   Morgan, in 1914, at the beginning of World War I, invented the gas  mask. And that gas mask was used in 1916 in New York City to save the  lives of over 500 people caught in some kind of an accident. Now, if  you look at the calendar, this was done before John Haldane, whatever  contraption he may have developed.   Now the story of Garrett Morgan is kind of interesting and a little  bit--maybe to some, I know to me--uncomfortable to think about. Because  Garrett Morgan experienced a lot of difficulty trying to sell his gas  mask. And people wanted to use it for a big event in Cleveland, Ohio,  people wanted the gas mask, but they wouldn't buy it from him because  of his color.   So Garrett Morgan hired a White actor to pose as the inventor. And he  went along with the inventor and he put the gas mask, the hood, on to  demonstrate it and, of course, to hide who he really was. That is how  he was able to sell his gas mask. As effective as it was, as good of an  invention that it was, they would not buy it from him simply because of  his skin color.   Now, that might have disappointed him, and it certainly should have,  but he didn't let that deter him. He went on with other inventions. And  some know that it is Garrett A. Morgan that is credited with being the  inventor of the traffic light. So these inventions that made life  easier for people, made industrial plants more productive, made our  streets safer, made our existence much more pleasant and much more  conducive to reading, to getting around, all by African Americans.   What is uncomfortable about teaching this in our classrooms? What is  so bad about children knowing this? Why shouldn't the descendants of  all three of these people, why shouldn't their descendants be made to  feel proud of the contributions of their great, great, great--maybe  more greats--grandfather or great uncle or aunt. Why would anybody be  uncomfortable with that?   Mr. Speaker, that is not the only field this is in. I often talk  about Charles Drew. When I was growing up, polio visited my  neighborhood twice, leaving one of my playmates dead and another one  crippled for life. And along came Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin, two men  who happen to have been born white, two men who had a certain genius,  who did significant research. Because of their genius and because of  their great research, they were able to unlock some secrets. And  together, they virtually eliminated polio from the face of the Earth.   There is nothing uncomfortable about talking about that and people  [[Page H1095]]  learning about that. So why would it be uncomfortable for the guy who  was able to unlock some secrets of the blood cells, Charles Drew, an  African American, born right here in Washington, D.C., who because of  his research, he was able to figure out how to store blood, save it  until it was needed.   Blood spoils once it leaves the human body, but Charles Drew opened  up the secrets and figured out how to store blood and save it until it  was needed. Now, he has a pretty interesting history, also.                                time  1300    Charles Drew headed up the blood bank. He went off to Europe to head  up the blood bank, and his genius was recognized.   It is kind of interesting because he resigned from the job. Why?  Because they insisted that the blood coming from Black people had to be  stored separately from the blood coming from White people. It sounds a  little bit silly today, but that is what they did.   Soldiers were dying on the battlefield because of the loss of blood.  You have to take the time to figure out: Wait a minute. This is a Black  soldier, so we have to find some blood from a Black person.   Scientifically, it has been proven forever that there ain't no  difference in the blood.   Today, we don't separate the blood anymore because we learned better.  We have a little saying in the neighborhood I grew up in: When a person  learns better, a person will do better.   Well, I am hoping that we will take a little time to learn better  about the history of African Americans. Maybe if we did, we will do  better.   Now, I don't want to leave here without bringing up another incident  because this is one that bugs me a little bit. I keep some busts around  my home, and of course, I have one of Charles Drew and Matthew Henson,  but I also have one of Daniel Hale Williams, who few people know.  Daniel Hale Williams was an African American.   If you look in the books and they ask the question: Who is the father  of open-heart surgery? You will get the name of Dr. C. Walton Lillehei,  who was White. He is credited in all the books with performing the  first open-heart surgery. He just passed away in 1999. His surgery was  performed in 1952. But that is not the real history.   Why would it be uncomfortable for you to know that Daniel Hale  Williams, who was a doctor and who founded the Provident Hospital up in  Chicago, one day, back in 1893, had someone come to that hospital with  a stab wound in the chest? The guy happened to have been White, but  Daniel Hale Williams, the Black guy, performed open-heart surgery and  saved the man's life, and he lived 20 years afterward.   The textbooks don't record that. They decided to wait almost 100  years to give somebody else credit. That is what happened, and that is  why we look at this week.   Now, I think that Carter Woodson was very concerned about what seemed  to be going on today, people leaving out facts, ignoring facts,  lowering their level of respect for people. I can't tell you how many  times I have been engaged in conversation with people who, out of their  ignorance, say things that they really believe that indicate there can  be found no significant contributions to this great country from people  of color. I have had it said to me.   It is not their fault. They believe that because that is what they  have seen in the books or have not seen.   If we teach these facts, then I think Black history will take on a  new meaning, and Black History Month would not be so uncomfortable for  anybody to celebrate.   Next month, we will celebrate Women's History Month simply because so  many of the contributions of women have been left out and ignored. So,  we take the month of March to focus on those things, and that is why it  is so important for us.   Mr. Speaker, I did not look at the clock. How much time do I have  left?    Mr. Speaker, I have a lot of time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee),  who wanted to participate in this hour. I assure you, Mr. Speaker, 23  minutes may not be enough for Ms. Jackson Lee, but that is all we have  left.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
