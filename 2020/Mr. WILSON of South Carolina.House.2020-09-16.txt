 Madam Speaker, yesterday marks an  historic turning point for the Middle East and north Africa. For the  first time, Arab nations have pursued peace with the Jewish state with  the motive of friendly relations with Israel--no land for peace, no  confidence-building measures, simply peace in exchange for peace for  the very first time.  [[Page H4439]]    I was grateful to be at the White House for the signing of the  landmark agreements brokered by President Donald Trump between the  United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Israel. Seeing Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu alongside UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin  Zayed al Nahyan and Bahraini Foreign Minister Dr. Abdullatif bin Rashid  Al-Zayani was inspiring.   Under the leadership of President Trump, the Middle East is a new  chapter, an opportunity for peace and prosperity.   Thank you to President Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Jared  Kushner, and all others who achieved this historic advance for peace.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
