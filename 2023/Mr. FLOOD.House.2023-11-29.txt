 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Stanton High  School football team for winning the first State football championship  in their school's history.   The Mustangs hail from Stanton, Nebraska, a town of less than 2,000  people in Nebraska's First Congressional District. The Mustangs, with a  roster of 29 players, went undefeated in their 2023 season and finished  it off by winning State at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln. This was  Stanton's first State appearance in almost two decades.   With two Mustang touchdowns within 13 seconds in the fourth quarter,  the 8-man team pulled off a comeback for the Stanton history books.   The team dedicated this season to their late coach, Patric Brechbill,  who passed away just weeks before the season started. The boys said  they knew he was with them through every tough play.   Congratulations to the Mustangs' players and coaches. They have made  their hometown proud and Coach Brechbill very proud.                            ____________________
