 Mr. Speaker, my amendment alters the charging  and fueling infrastructure grant program in this bill, laying the  groundwork to deploy zero-emission EV charging infrastructure  nationwide.   This amendment strengthens plans for renewable or zero-emissions  energy sources to power EV chargers. It directs DOT to study financing  options for a national network of EV chargers and determine the right  distance between those chargers so Americans can drive across the  entire National Highway System without running out of power.   It makes sure environmental justice organizations have a seat at the  table as we build this beautiful green future.   We must transform our transportation sector and end our reliance on  fossil fuels. Today, we take an important step in that transformation.   I hope we can take up this work and advance ever-bolder proposals to  fight climate change and protect life on Earth as we know it.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio for including this amendment in  the en bloc package and for his great work on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Pallone  for his tremendous work on this bill and all the staff of the Energy  and Commerce Committee who worked on this.   My amendment modifies H.R. 2's pilot program to improve lab  infrastructure, ensuring grants can help labs reduce wait times for  COVID-19 test results.   It can take several business days to find out if you have tested  positive for COVID-19. During that time, folks are told to take  precautions as though they are positive.   Not everyone can afford missing work to do that. Not everyone has  another person who can take care of an elderly or sick parent. If we  don't bring down wait times, we are asking Americans to do things that,  for them, might be virtually impossible. Let's make things easier for  working families.   I urge support of this amendment and this tremendous bill.                                time  1730
