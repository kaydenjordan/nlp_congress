 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Laser  Interferometer Gravitational Observatory, or what is known as LIGO, for  its achievements in the field of gravitational discovery.   The American Physical Society recently named LIGO, which is located  in my district in Richland, Washington, as a historic site for its  groundbreaking detection of gravitational waves. These waves passed  through the Earth on September 14, 2015, nearly 100 years after Albert  Einstein predicted their existence. This discovery has opened up new  opportunities for learning about the universe.   I am amazed by the work being done in central Washington. In addition  to this recognition, three LIGO scientists, Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish,  and Kip Thorne, also received the 2017 Nobel Prize for Physics.   A plaque that will be placed at the site reads: ``The precision  required to detect these tiny disturbances in space-time, caused by  emerging black holes, was made possible by the coordinated labor of  over 1,000 scientific and technical workers.''   I want to thank the American Physical Society and the Nobel Committee  for recognizing the hard work and dedication of these men and women,  and I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating LIGO's scientists  and employees.                            ____________________
