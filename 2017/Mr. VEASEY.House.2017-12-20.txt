 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Lorimer  Arendse, the principal of Grand Prairie High School, who lost his  battle with stage IV lung cancer on December 15.   Never shy about sharing his hatred for school during his formative  years, Lorimer found his passion for academics once he met and fell in  love with his wife, Jeanelle, while attending Grace College in Warsaw,  Indiana. Upon graduating Grace College, Lorimer continued his passion  for education upon earning his master's degree in educational  administration from Ashland University.   From there, he began his career in education as a math teacher and  advanced to assistant principal. In 2013, Lorimer was named principal  of the Young Men's Leadership Academy at Kennedy Middle School in Grand  Prairie. In 2014, he was named principal of Grand Prairie High School.   Although his time with us was short, let us all be encouraged by his  final lesson: treat each other with kindness. Be respectful. Be  courteous. Be what a Gopher is.   At this time, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending their  prayers to Principal Lorimer Arendse's family and the Grand Prairie  High School community.                            ____________________
