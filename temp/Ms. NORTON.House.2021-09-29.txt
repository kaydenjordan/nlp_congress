 Mr. Speaker, the Build Back Better Act is historic, but I  want to focus on two of its most important programs: climate change and  much-needed social programs.   First, climate change, the most important issue facing the entire  world, without exception. The U.S. can double its impact--reducing  carbon emissions 50 percent while creating 2 million jobs annually over  the next 10 years in clean technologies.   And the Build Back Better social programs respond to needs Americans  have long prioritized. Among them, childcare and lower costs for  Medicare and college tuition.   Build Back Better pays over the long run with investments for  reducing fast-rising climate change issues and pays right now with  investments in much-needed social programs.                            ____________________
