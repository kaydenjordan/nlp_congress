 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 582.   This bill would cause disruptive job losses and harm entry-level  workers in many regions around the country, effectively knocking the  bottom rung off the career ladder and especially hurting young workers.   Last Monday, CBO issued a long-awaited study, which estimates that up  to 3.7 million jobs would be lost from a $15 minimum wage, with a  median estimate of 1.3 million jobs lost. That includes 44,000 jobs  that would be lost in my home State of Alabama, and those under 21 will  suffer half those job losses.   When comparing those numbers with the report's estimate that only 1.3  million individuals would be lifted out of poverty, H.R. 582 would cost  at least one job to be lost for every person who moved out of poverty.  In the CBO's high-impact scenario, as many as three jobs would be lost  for every individual moving out of poverty.   This is not a tradeoff that Congress should ask America's workers and  small businesses to make, and I especially don't think we should ask  our young workers to make it.   Significantly, CBO has also found there would be a reduction in real  family income by 2025 of $9 billion, effectively reducing pay for many  American families.   Remember, wages are currently on the rise thanks to a booming  economy, the Republican Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and President Trump's  focus on eliminating wasteful regulations.   With 7.3 million unfilled jobs nationwide, job creators know they  must offer competitive wages and benefits to attract and retain  workers, and 29 States already have a minimum wage higher than the  Federal floor.   Instead of providing tangible benefits to working class Americans,  H.R. 582 would cause the most harm to the very people its supporters  claim to help.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
