 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 781, I call up  the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 83) directing the President  pursuant to section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution to terminate the  use of United States Armed Forces to engage in hostilities in or  against Iran, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 83, currently under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We are here this afternoon so that this body can exercise one of its  most  [[Page H93]]  important constitutional responsibilities, deciding on whether or not  this country will wage war, whether or not we will check an executive  that has brought our country to a dangerous brink.   In recent months, tensions between the United States and Iran have  ticked up, bit by bit, until this last week, when we found ourselves in  a crisis like we haven't seen in decades.   Let's be clear: The Iranians are responsible for their own harmful  behavior. We know this is a regime that underwrites terrorism, that  tries to strengthen its own position by fomenting instability and  provocation. We know that about Iran. No one expects Iran to be the  adult in the room when it comes to global affairs.   What we do expect is that American leadership and American policy  will be the moderating force.   So the world was stunned last week when the Trump administration  chose, instead, the path towards escalation with the killing of Qasem  Soleimani.   We need to be honest about Soleimani. He was a bad guy. He had  masterminded attacks and campaigns that cost thousands of innocent  lives. In the places where we have seen Iran's most harmful activity,  Soleimani's fingerprints were everywhere. He had American blood on his  hands, and the world is better off without him.   But are we really safer today, as the administration claims, with  American citizens told to get out of Iraq as fast as they can;  thousands of troops deploying to the Middle East; an eviction notice  from the Iraqi Government, whose partnership we depend on in the fight  against ISIS; Iranian missiles endangering American personnel?   It certainly doesn't feel like we are safer, and a poll out today  shows that the American people agree.   In foreign policy, you have to weigh decisions like this. As awful as  Soleimani was, this action has endangered American lives and American  security.   The President and his advisers say they had no choice; that there was  imminent threat. Then they said, well, he had done bad things in the  past and was going to do more bad things in the future. When they sent  a report on the strike to Congress, the administration took the highly  unusual step of classifying it.   And then yesterday, in a classified briefing, when Members demanded  to see the evidence that justified the strike, the message from the  administration essentially boiled down to this: Trust us. When we  asked, What is the plan going forward? The administration essentially  told Members: Trust us.   Trust us is not good enough, Madam Speaker, not for me, and not for  the American people.   Madam Speaker, if they are going to send our men and women in uniform  into harm's way, they shouldn't hide the facts.   First of all, this administration hasn't given us any reason to  believe that this is a fact. The foreign policy of this administration  has undermined American leadership, cut our diplomats off at the knees,  alienated our allies, and walked away from our obligations. We have  lurched from crisis to crisis, each time hoping that the situation  won't spin out of control.   I call it fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants foreign policy, and it is no  way to advance American interests and values on the global stage.   But beyond that, beyond the way this administration has acted, it is  not the job of Congress to give any administration its blind trust. It  is why we have separation of powers. It is why the Constitution  entrusts war powers to Congress.   Let me say that again. It is why the Constitution entrusts war powers  to Congress. We haven't had a declared war in this country since World  War II. It is not the way it should happen.   So it is a relief that both the administration and the Iranians have,  for the moment, opted to de-escalate. But we would be foolish to think  this crisis is over. It could flame up again in the blink of an eye,  and I worry that another misstep on either side could be what plunges  our country into another ill-advised war in the Middle East.   I will say it very plainly: The American people do not want war with  Iran. With the measure before us today, we are denying the President  the authority to wage such a war.   This would direct the President to terminate the use of armed force  against Iran without congressional authorization unless it is necessary  to respond to an imminent armed attack against the United States.   The President always has the power to defend America. No one denies  that. This resolution explicitly preserves this right, but that is a  limited exception. The President shouldn't abuse it.   Now, we have heard the argument that the 2002 Authorization for the  Use of Military Force, the Iraq war authorization, would justify  military action against Iran. That is just wrong. It is not what  Congress intended when it passed that resolution. I was here. I  remember it. It should be repealed, not used to launch more military  action.   If the President wants to use military force against Iran, he has to  come to Congress. Any President has to come to Congress. We are not  making rules only for this President. We are making rules for the  President, any President, vis-a-vis, Congress' constitutional powers.    The President has to make the case first, first, not after he  launches an ill-advised attack, then after the fact, comes up with a  reason why it was necessary and why it was legal. That is not the way  our system works.   Today, I have heard the myth floating around that this resolution is  nonbinding; that it is just symbolic. So let me quote from the War  Powers Act to prove that untrue.   The War Powers law says: ``At any time that United States Armed  Forces are engaged in hostilities outside the territory of the United  States, its possessions and territories without a declaration of war or  specific statutory authorization, such forces shall be removed by the  President if the Congress so directs by concurrent resolution.'' Again,  by concurrent resolution. That is what the War Powers Act states that  we need do. That is what we are doing today.   This is the House of Representatives exercising its Article I  authority. We don't get authority over war powers just because--if the  President says so. We get authority over war powers, period. That is  our authority. So let's put that fiction to rest.   And one final point, Madam Speaker, about the tone of this debate.  Yesterday, a Member of this body went on television and said that  Democrats ``are in love with terrorists. They mourn Soleimani more than  they mourn our Gold Star families.''   Another Member labeled a group of colleagues ``Ayatollah  sympathizers.''   At a time when we are talking about policy that will have direct  bearing on American men and women, servicemembers and diplomats in  harm's way, comments like that reflect very poorly on this body. And I  remind the House that all Members, in both parties, regardless of  party, love this country. These words have no place in this debate.   On the Foreign Affairs Committee, we take pride in debating issues,  even the toughest issues, on the merits and on the facts. I salute my  friend, the ranking member, Mr. McCaul, for working so closely with me  to make sure we do so. That is one of the keys of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.   I strongly encourage all Members on both sides to bear that in mind  during this debate. We all take the same oath. We can argue about this  resolution without questioning one another's motives or one another's  patriotism.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Slotkin), the author of this important resolution.    Madam Speaker, I am sorry that the Republican leader is  casting aspersions. I think everyone on both sides of the aisle takes  this seriously and has reasons for what we are voting on.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna), a gentleman who has been very involved in  these issues for a long, long time and has been a real leader in these  issues.

Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Omar).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Trone), a valued member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, let me remind my friend that we, too,  cherish our military and also have their backs.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York  (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and  Reform.    Madam Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Schiff).    Madam Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat), an esteemed member the  Foreign Affairs Committee.                                time  1545     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), who has worked very hard on these issues for many  years.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 15  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ted Lieu), who is a distinguished member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Massie).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), Speaker of the House.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan), a valued  [[Page H106]]  member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio  (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Ohio an  additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader of the House.

Mr. Speaker, I would say to my friends on the other side  of the aisle, please don't question our motives or patriotism and we  won't question yours.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, I just can't really believe what I just  heard.   It was the 2001 AUMF that specifically authorized our going after  Osama bin Laden. He is the example of Congress getting involved. That  was the authorization to get Osama bin Laden in Pakistan or anyplace  else, and that is what we are trying to assure here, that things aren't  just happening, that there is actual authority. Osama bin Laden is the  wrong example, because we gave the authority to go after him.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Frankel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan an  additional 15 seconds.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Brown).    Mr. Speaker, again, I think it would be helpful if  peoples' motives or patriotism wasn't questioned.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Schneider).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Crow).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Tennessee an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Meeks), a very distinguished gentleman on the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, this body has to make a decision about whether we are  going to stand up for our constitutional responsibilities or just  subordinate ourselves to the executive branch when it comes to war  powers.   We are two decades into the 21st century. Our country has been at war  almost that entire time. Not a day goes by that I don't wish we could  have some of those decisions back, especially because we see that those  measures we passed in 2001 and 2002 are still being used to justify  sending American men and women into harm's way.   We could stand here all day and say your side let this happen when  you were in charge, or you didn't say anything when this President did  that. I don't disagree that it has been a collective failure on the  part of this body that we have given away our authority on war powers  and that we haven't done enough to grapple with the issue.   I hope today will not be the end of our efforts to make progress on  debating Congress' war powers. If the President thinks he needs to use  military force, then he needs to come to Congress and make the case and  let us vote on it. This is the beginning of Congress' taking back its  authority.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my friends on both sides of the aisle to support  this resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
