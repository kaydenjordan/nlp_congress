 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Law  Enforcement De-Escalation Act that will add additional funding for our  local police officers. In my local police agencies, they are asking for  this funding, they are asking for additional training.  [[Page H9835]]    Today, the job of a police officer goes beyond protecting our family.  Today, we are asking police officers, protect our families and address  mental health issues and address substance abuse issues and address the  issue of homelessness. We have watched in horror on television as  situations get out of control because police officers are not trained  to deal with these issues on a day-to-day basis.   It is time to make a difference. It is time to train our peace  officers to do the job that we hired them to do, which is protect our  families and to address the local issues, to address the new jobs that  we have asked them to take on.   This bill will assure that our peace officers are trained and  prepared to handle the situations they encounter on a day-to-day basis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to please support additional  funding that our local police officers and local police agencies are  asking for.
