 Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I would  like to recognize a special place in my district, Fort Mose.   Near St. Augustine, Florida, it was the first legally sanctioned,  free Black settlement in what is now the United States.   As early as the late 1600s, freedom seekers escaped enslavement in  the English colonies and made their way to St. Augustine, then under  Spanish rule.   An estimated 100 Africans were then given freedom in exchange for  adopting Catholicism and declaring allegiance to Spain.   In 1994, the Fort Mose site was designated as a historic national  landmark.   Fort Mose embodies the fight for freedom by Black Americans in the  early days of our country, and it highlights a piece of Black history  that is dramatically different from the more familiar story of slavery  and oppression.                            ____________________
