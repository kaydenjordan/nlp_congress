 Mr. Speaker, when I became a physician, I took a  Hippocratic oath to do no harm. It has guided my actions and my  conscience to do no harm.   For the past 41 years, most Americans, regardless of their views on  abortion, have agreed on one very simple principle: No taxpayer should  be required to pay for abortion. We have agreed that Americans who  believe life begins at conception should not be coerced by the  government to violate their conscience.   As a Senator, Joe Biden told his constituents that, ``The government  should not tell those with strong convictions against abortion, such as  you and I, that we must pay for them.'' That was Joe Biden then.   Tragically, President Biden and our colleagues across the aisle now  want to eliminate lifesaving Hyde amendment protections and force every  U.S. taxpayer to fund abortions through government spending.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion  and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
