 Madam Speaker, after a long, embarrassing month, the House  will finally transmit the Articles of Impeachment against President  Trump to the United States Senate. Yet I understand Speaker Pelosi and  her managers will continue to push for witnesses in the Senate trial  because, in their words, they want the facts.   That claim is nonsense. House Democrats blocked the testimony of the  [[Page H250]]  whistleblower, DNC staffer Alexandra Chalupa, Nellie Ohr with Fusion  GPS, and, of course, the two gentlemen pictured to my left, Devon  Archer and Hunter Biden.   In reality, the Democrats' entire case depended on hiding the facts.  As more facts emerged last year, their case collapsed. Public support  for their impeachment fell as the weakness of their case was exposed.   I remind my majority that what is good for the goose is good for the  gander. I predict House Democrats will not fare as well blocking these  witnesses in Mitch McConnell's United States Senate.                            ____________________
