 Mr. President, back in 1876, Ann Reeves Jarvis was  teaching her Sunday school class about notable mothers in the Bible.  She ended that class with this prayer:         I hope and pray that someone, sometime, will found a       memorial mother's day commemorating her for the matchless       service she renders to humanity in every field of life. She       is entitled to it.    That was the prayer of Ann Reeves Jarvis. Her 12-year-old daughter  Anna, who was then a student in the class, took that prayer to heart  and went on to help establish Mother's Day in the United States in  1914.   As we approach Mother's Day this upcoming Sunday, I am gathered with  many of my Senate colleagues to urge our Republican friends here in the  Senate to reject many of the policies coming down from the Trump  administration that put women's health and well-being at risk.  Americans need access to family planning services. An investment in  family planning is money well spent because it helps families cope with  reproductive health planning and can help prevent health crises. This  is a win-win for those who receive these services and for all Americans  who, in the long run, must pay for health services that are the  inevitable result of neglect and failure to provide resources for  family planning.   While the Trump administration would have you believe that their  efforts are solely focused on eliminating access to abortion, the  reality is their actions are harmful to a broad array of family  planning services. For example, just in 2017, the administration tried  to eliminate the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program grants more than a  year early. I want to point out that the city of Baltimore had one of  those grants, and with the help of programming from the Teen Pregnancy  and Prevention Program, Baltimore saw a 61-percent drop in teen  pregnancy between the years 2000 and 2016. The good news is that the  city of Baltimore and other grantees prevailed in Federal court, so  that money was restored.   We now see repeated steps by the Trump administration through its  recent title X Federal rulemaking that represent another attempt to  restrict access to quality, affordable reproductive healthcare and  prevent women from receiving the information they need to make informed  decisions for themselves about their healthcare. It would jeopardize  the entire title X health network.   Specifically, the rule would block the availability of Federal funds  to family planning providers, even if those family planning providers  separately offer access to abortion services. In other words, despite  the fact that Federal law is already crystal clear about no public  funds being used to pay for abortion, the administration policy would  ignore that reality.   Under the status quo, title X-funded clinics that provide abortion  must keep those services financially separate from their title X  activities. So this rule would interfere with the ability of women  throughout America to get that unbiased family planning service and  counseling. The rule would specifically prohibit any referral for  abortion services and end the longstanding guarantee that pregnant  title X patients receive comprehensive, unbiased counseling.   A primary goal of this regulation--and there has been no secret about  this--is to prevent Federal funds from going to comprehensive family  planning providers, like Planned Parenthood, with little or no regard  for the impact this has on women throughout the country--and men and  families. In fact, Planned Parenthood provides health services to 4 in  10 women in America. For many women and men, Planned Parenthood is the  only source of care in their community.   I want to recount a couple of stories I have received from my  Maryland constituents. One is from Caitlyn. She lives in Severna Park.  She shared with me the impact that Planned Parenthood had in her life.  She says that while growing up, she did not have a basic education when  it came to reproductive health services and options. She writes:         I knew I wasn't getting the whole story and I decided [to]       do my own research. Planned Parenthood had the answers to my       questions with no agenda, just facts.    She went on to share a different firsthand experience she had with  Planned Parenthood as a patient.         I needed services that were quick, affordable, and       compassionate, and that's exactly what I received. When it       came time to pay my bill, I was surprised to find that they       just asked for a small donation. This donation-for-services       is possible through Title X. Because of Title X, patients       like me and more than 30,000 other Marylanders can access       care, no matter what, regardless of our ability to pay.    That was Caitlyn.   I also heard from Tamara from Takoma Park, MD. She moved back to  Maryland to care for her aging mother and accepted her dream job. Her  dream job was directing a training and education fund for healthcare  workers. She hesitated to accept her dream job because the employer- provided insurance plan was grandfathered into pre-Affordable Care Act  regulations, meaning that her preferred form of birth control wasn't  covered. Her prescription would cost her $125 a month, something she  could not afford. Through her local Planned Parenthood, she was able to  get the prescription for $20 a month. She wrote to me saying:         Without my local Title X-funded community clinic, I--a       graduate of Wellesley College, a Master's Degree holder, an       engaged community member, a daughter, a passionate person on       a meaningful career path--would be unable to afford my       prescription, leaving me in the uncomfortable and, quite       frankly, unfair position of having to choose between my       health or quality of life.    If you look at these stories, you will find that the proposed  regulations coming down from the Trump administration prioritize  ideology over patient health and safety and fiction over healthcare  facts. So that is something about title X.   I want to say a word about the Affordable Care Act, as well, and the  important protections it provides for people throughout our country,  but I want to focus for a minute on the protections it provides to  women.   It became the law of the land 9 years ago. I don't think any of us  expected we would still be fighting as hard as we are to try to protect  those essential healthcare protections. Despite the failure in this  body and this Senate just last year to overturn the Affordable Care  Act, we still see a constant effort from the administration, both  through nonstop, harmful, regulatory efforts and a wholesale effort  through the Federal courts. So I think it is important to remind all of  us about what the consequences of stripping away all those protections  would be. With respect to women's healthcare, it would do away with the  provision that requires coverage of maternity care as an essential  health benefit. It would reverse the provisions that ended gender  discrimination, which previously allowed insurance companies to charge  women higher premiums than men for their healthcare. It also would  eliminate the requirement to provide coverage for preventive health  services  [[Page S2725]]  like mammograms, screenings for cervical cancer, prenatal care, and  regular well-baby and well-child visits with no cost-sharing.   So it is important, as we look at the ongoing efforts to sabotage the  Affordable Care Act in pieces or get rid of it wholesale, that the  consequences of getting rid of that for women's health would be  devastating.   I heard from a constituent at that time; her name was Pamela. She had  aged off her parents' insurance in college and became uninsured and,  therefore, put off her medical care until she ended up in the emergency  room, had to declare bankruptcy to get out from under her medical  bills. She wrote me during that debate over the Affordable Care Act, as  follows:         Today my asthma medicine is covered with a nominal copay. I       can see my doctor before a case of bronchitis becomes       something worse, and I do not need to go to the ER for       treatment. Now I have a twenty year old in college who has       pre-existing conditions, unlike me she is still covered under       our health insurance and her prescriptions are affordable.       What happens to me, my daughter, and my husband who all have       pre-existing conditions if our insurance is allowed to go       back to the old days of charging more for our coverage? What       happens to my daughter if she can no longer be on our policy?    Like many of us, I have other stories I have received from  Marylanders who are either worried about losing their access to  healthcare through title X or worried about losing coverage under the  Affordable Care Act. I hope, as we reflect on all of the challenges we  are facing and as we honor mothers on Mother's Day, we don't support  actions that would actually degrade their access to important quality  healthcare.   I will close by urging my colleagues to reflect on the words of Ann  Reeves Jarvis, who I mentioned earlier was the one who had uttered that  prayer that led to the establishment of Mother's Day. What she also  said was that we need to honor the ``matchless service'' that mothers  and other women in this country ``render to humanity in every field of  life.''   I believe it is our obligation to make sure we provide access to  quality healthcare and choices for all of our constituents and for  every American. As we reflect on Mother's Day, be very aware of the  impact our actions will have on women throughout the United States.   I yield the floor.
