 Madam Speaker, Thanksgiving 2021 will  be the most expensive meal in the history of the holiday. You pay with  Biden inflation, build back bankrupt. A typical meal will cost more  than ever.   The Aiken Standard newspaper cartoon today is correct. Some specific  price increases include turkey up 27 percent, carrots up 47 percent,  potatoes 13 percent, and cranberries up 5.2 percent, in addition to gas  up 61 percent and home heating bills up 54 percent.   These are brutal realities for families as we celebrate being an  American with Thanksgiving.   Democrat elite think they are smarter than anyone, and they think  Democrat voters are ignorant to believe $5 trillion in spending costs  zero dollars. You pay with Biden inflation.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years in the global war on terrorism as it continues  moving from the Afghanistan haven to America.   Congratulations to the mayor-elect of Columbia, Republican Daniel  Rickenmann, who is the first Republican in 40 years for the capital  city elected yesterday.                            ____________________
