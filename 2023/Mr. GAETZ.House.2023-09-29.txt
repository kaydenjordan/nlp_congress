 Madam Speaker, the continuing resolution being offered  today is a bad deal for Republicans. The entire premise of this  continuing resolution is that if Republicans surrender on every single  issue except the border that it will be good politics because we will  force the Democrats to defend bad border policy.   However, Madam Speaker, surrender has been a virus that has afflicted  my fellow Republicans for far too long. To prove the point, just look  at the border policies that we are supposedly fighting for. The border  policies that Republicans will argue for this morning represent a  retreat from the border policies we took last night.   Last night, we said we wouldn't fund DHS unless E-Verify was passed  because they had to take up H.R. 2. Now we are saying we will give  Mayorkas and the Biden administration more money even if they don't  pass E-Verify. Overnight, in the last 11 hours, the Republican border  position has gotten weaker through this continuing resolution. That is  why I am voting against it.    We cannot be serious about border security without E-Verify. I will  fight for E-Verify. Eleven hours ago, the Republicans fought for E- Verify, and now the white flag of surrender.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives has passed  funding bills to fund our veterans, our troops, our Border Patrol, our  State and foreign ops.   These are the core functions of government. The Senate should take up  and pass those bills to make sure those folks are paid, and they should  do it today.   The rule we are on now advances a continuing resolution that weakens  the Republican position on strong border policies.   Just last night, we passed a Department of Homeland Security  appropriations bill that was lashed to policy requirements at the  Department of Homeland Security. They had to do certain things to fix  the border to get the money, and one of those things was E-Verify.   Last night, we stood together and we demanded that E-Verify be  included if Mayorkas wanted the money, and this continuing resolution  that the rule we are on now would facilitate strips E-Verify and takes  it out. Why would Republicans just overnight back away  [[Page H4867]]  from such a strong and necessary provision as E-Verify?   I will be voting against this continuing resolution because I want  House Republicans to have the strongest position on the border. The  American people will come with us on that. We have just got to have the  courage to lead and not surrender.   I know big businesses don't want E-Verify, but we should want it  anyway for the American worker.
