 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart. As a  father, as a grandfather, as a human being who cares about children, I  ask: For God's sake, America, what is happening to your soul?   There are 11,000 children who are being held in jail cells throughout  the country. Families arriving at the border seeking asylum  voluntarily, seeking refuge voluntarily, are being detained, and they  are being held in jail. Children as young as the children here today-- as young as the children here today--are being held in jail. Babies are  being separated from their mothers, even while breastfeeding them. This  constitutes child abuse.   Madam Speaker, show some basic compassion for these young children,  their brothers and sisters and their parents. Every single Member of  Congress should be able to stand behind the simple idea that families,  regardless of where they are born, belong together.   I know that Jesus of Nazareth was a refugee, and he paid the ultimate  price.   Madam Speaker, this is a historic fight for the soul of our Nation,  whether we remain a nation of aspirations or we become a nation of  deportation.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee).                                time  0915     Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New  York (Ms. Velazquez).
