 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss  what are, sadly, the harmful impacts of ongoing partisan obstruction in  the Senate.   Earlier today, at the Small Business Committee, our colleague,  Senator Cardin, who is chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business  and Entrepreneurship, held a business meeting--I think about the fifth  one--to try to advance the nomination of Mr. Dilawar Syed to be the  Deputy Administrator of the Small Business Administration.   As we know, the Small Business Administration is a very important  Agency under the best of circumstances. It does great work, but during  this pandemic, for the past year, it has become absolutely  indispensable as we tried to address the continuing economic impact of  COVID on our small businesses.   In order for it to operate effectively, in order for us to hold the  Agency accountable for administering the small business relief programs  that Congress has designed to pass, we have an obligation to ensure  that the Small Business Administration has a fully functioning and  Senate-confirmed leadership team.   Unfortunately, as Senator Cardin and others witnessed just a few  hours ago, Republicans, again, on the Small Business Committee--all of  the Republicans on the Small Business Committee--have orchestrated a  complete blockade of Mr. Syed's nomination, preventing it from even  coming to the floor of the Senate for debate and consideration.   And what is so confusing, Mr. President, is that there doesn't seem  to be a reason to the Republicans' objections to Mr. Syed. It keeps  changing. No one has raised any questions about Mr. Syed's competence  or his experience or his suitability to serve as Deputy SBA  Administrator.   In fact, several months ago, we tried to advance the nominee in our  first effort in a business meeting by a voice vote, and several  Republican Members of the Small Business Committee who are now  participating in this obstruction voted yes at that time, including the  ranking member.   Now it appears that this boycott is part of a pattern by just a  handful of Members who simply want to stop any action that would allow  the Biden administration to have a full complement of Senate-confirmed  officials at critical Federal Agencies so they can then carry out their  work as directed by Congress.   Unfortunately, I would also note that this partisan brinkmanship and  obstruction doesn't end with domestic and economic matters. I want to  point out, again, the dangerously slow confirmation process of our  State Department nominees and ambassadors. Again, we have a few  Republican Members of the Senate who are not just threatening our  economic recovery and the health of our small businesses; they are  threatening our national security by slowing the process to schedule  nomination hearings for qualified nominees and by placing holds on  their confirmation because of their own personal political issues.   I appreciate that some of those issues are very important. Nord  Stream 2, I support, but holding these ambassadors, holding these State  Department officials is not going to change what happens with Nord  Stream 2. All it is going to do is make the United States less  effective and less secure in the world.   Today, only 30 Ambassadors have been confirmed by the Senate. This  administration had to wait over 200 days--200 days--for its first  Ambassador to be confirmed, compared to only 62 days for the previous  administration.   For the first 300 days of the previous administration, 55 State  Department nominees were confirmed by the Senate. In the first 300 days  of Biden's Presidency, the Senate has confirmed one-quarter of that  number.   Actions speak louder than words. If our colleagues care about our  national security, they would match deeds with words and swiftly  confirm the 59 State Department nominees who are awaiting confirmation  on the Senate floor.   Unfortunately, the holdup is not only on the floor of the Senate but  also in the Foreign Relations Committee. Eleven nominees in committee  are awaiting business meetings, and 21 haven't even been able to have a  hearing to advocate for themselves and their qualifications.   What is worse from my perspective, the nominations that are being  affected by this obstruction are disproportionately women. In a Foreign  Service where men still outnumber women and where we are trying to  become a more diverse State Department, it is critical that we confirm  these qualified women.   Amid increased Russian aggression toward our Ukrainian allies, it is  particularly important that we confirm without delay the nominee to be  Ambassador to NATO, Julie Smith.   How can we advocate for American interests abroad, how can we  represent American citizens abroad, how can we support our economic  interests if we don't have people in place who can do that?   When we look at the increasing global threats to the United States,  operating with a depleted diplomatic corps jeopardizes our national  security. It jeopardizes U.S. interests and the safety of Americans at  home and abroad. The political games that are being played by a few  Members of this body are risking very serious consequences.   I see my colleague from Ohio, who is the cochair of the Ukrainian  Caucus, has come in. Perhaps he would work with me to try to get Julie  Smith, our Ambassador to NATO, confirmed so that we have somebody there  who can help as we are looking at the crises that are happening in  Eastern Europe. I know we can work together in a rational, bipartisan  way to address our country's basic needs because we have just seen it.  We saw it with the bipartisan infrastructure bill that was just signed  this week. Confirming Presidential nominees is one of the most  fundamental responsibilities of the Senate. It is the heart of article  II in the Constitution.   What we have seen to date is no substantive objection to the  nomination of Dilawar Syed to be Deputy SBA Administrator or to the  nominations to fill numerous critical national security and foreign  policy positions. This is obstruction for obstruction's sake, and it  has very real consequences for our country, for our small businesses,  and for our national security and foreign policy. I hope that we will  be able to work together on both sides of the aisle to address those  nominees, who must be confirmed if we are to represent American  interests at home and abroad.   Again, I want to thank Chairman Cardin for his hard work as head of  the Small Business Committee and for the work that he has done on the  Foreign Relations Committee as we have tried to address those people  who need to be confirmed. Obviously, he has worked very closely with  Senator Menendez, the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. These  are two committees that I have the honor of serving on, and they have  historically operated on a very bipartisan, very collaborative basis.  That is why it is so disheartening to see the breakdown that is  occurring.   I hope that our colleagues will have a change of heart, that we will  be able to move forward, and that we will be able to work together. I  look forward to doing everything I can to make that happen.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 14 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
