 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Kris Vancas, principal at Benner Elementary School in Bellefonte,  Pennsylvania.   Kris was recently named Pennsylvania 2019 National Distinguished  Principal by the National Association of Elementary School Principals  for his ``collaborative leadership style, empowering his staff to  create an environment where students can excel, and for his dedication  to students, staff, and community.''   Leaders like Kris are important to the success and well-being of our  Nation's schools. Kris, however, gives all of the credit to his staff,  the students, and their parents.   Kris has served as principal at Benner Elementary for approximately 7  years and is well aware of the impact teachers and administrators have  on the daily lives of our Nation's young people. He said: ``You don't  know the kind of day they're having when they walk in, but you know you  can positively affect them for the next 6 hours they're here.''   I would like to thank Kris for his commitment to students in  Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District, and I congratulate him on  this achievement.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  from Nevada and the gentleman from Kansas for their support of this  very important piece of legislation.   I rise in support of S. 760, the Support for Veterans in Effective  Apprenticeships Act of 2019. I was proud to introduce the House  companion bill, H.R. 5314, with my colleague, Representative Katherine  Clark.   Our Nation's veterans deserve our support while deployed and when  they return home. One of the best ways to do that is to prepare them  for the workforce outside of the military.   Our servicemembers have attained incredible skills during their  service, many times, quite frankly, under fire. Sadly, when they return  to civilian life, finding a good-paying, family-sustaining job may be  difficult.   Many States have significant inconsistencies between the number of  registered apprenticeships offered and the number of programs listed as  approved for veterans' benefits. These discrepancies exist despite the  simple, expedited VA approval process for apprenticeship sponsors who  have gone through all the steps to register their programs through the  Department of Labor at either the Federal or the State level.   The VA approval process still requires additional steps that not all  sponsors follow through to completion. This makes it difficult in many  States for veterans to have the full list of apprenticeship programs  where they can use their earned benefits and apply their learned skills  and knowledge.   H.R. 5314 helps streamline the process of attaining an apprenticeship  and reduces roadblocks for our veterans.    The bill ensures programs are equipped to complete the expedited VA  process for registered apprenticeships and expands coordination between  the Department of Labor and the Department of Veterans Affairs.   Now, additionally, the bill clarifies that veterans are eligible for  advanced placement and appropriate wage increases and instructs  apprenticeship programs to account for a participant's competencies and  prior experiences, including those gained during military service.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this bill, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.
