 Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues in  Congress to do the right thing and support the Democrats' efforts to  reopen our Federal Government.   We are seeing devastating impacts on 800,000 Federal employees who  serve us, the contractors that work for us, and the economy that  impacts every person in this country. Yet the President's petulant,  adolescent approach to the shutdown has been supported by my colleagues  through their inability to support reopening government.   Responsible governments around the world do not shut down, and  leaders do not take hostages and demand ransom.   Look, today the President is shutting down the government over an  inefficient and unnecessary wall. If we capitulate, the next shutdown  will be over his desire to lift sanctions on the Russians. The next  shutdown could be over his desire to stop the Mueller investigation,  and so on and so on.   This isn't how the United States can or should operate, yet the  Republicans' complicity in this petulant behavior hurts our  constituents and threatens our economy.   Mr. President, reopen the government before you further damage the  United States of America.
