 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate two high  schools in my district on their CIF Southern Section football  championships.   I offer my sincere congratulations to Sunny Hills High School's  Lancers from Fullerton for their win in the CIF Southern Section  Division 8 final.   I also want to congratulate the Esperanza High School Aztecs for  their win in the CIF Southern Section Division 13 final.   We are all especially proud of both schools for their amazing run  through the playoffs. This is both Sunny Hills' and Esperanza's first  CIF championships since 1972. Their championships speak to the  leadership of their head coaches, Pete Karavedas and Wes Choate, and  their respective coaching staffs.   But, more importantly, these championships were possible due to the  dedication, commitment, and teamwork of the players. I have no doubt  that this is just the beginning of continued success for both programs.   Again, on behalf of the 39th Congressional District, I want to  congratulate both Sunny Hills and Esperanza High Schools for two  outstanding championship seasons.                            ____________________
