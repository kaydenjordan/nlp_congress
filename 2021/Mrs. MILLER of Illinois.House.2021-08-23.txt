 Madam Speaker, America is less safe today  than when President Biden was sworn in 7 months ago.   Last week, as the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan, they  released 5,000 al-Qaida and Taliban terrorists who are armed with $85  billion of U.S. taxpayer-funded weapons as a result of the Biden  administration's incompetent withdrawal. Our allies have lost respect  for America, and our enemies do not fear us.   At the same time, Vice President Kamala Harris has left our southern  border completely exposed and vulnerable for anyone to cross, and over  200,000 people are crossing each month. This is a national security  disaster with dreadful future consequences.   But we shouldn't be surprised that Democrats are not concerned with  public safety. They have been promoting defund the police and  supporting soft-on-crime policies that have caused crime to skyrocket  this past year.   The key role of government is to keep our families safe, and the  Biden administration has failed miserably.                            ____________________
