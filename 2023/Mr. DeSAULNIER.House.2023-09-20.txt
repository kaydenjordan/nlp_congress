 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Alan Smith.   Throughout his career, Alan faithfully served his community and  played a key role in supporting his local library system. When I was in  local government, I was fortunate enough to appoint Alan to our local  library commission, the Contra Costa Library Commission in the bay  area. Through his decades of service with the library commission, he  worked throughout the State of California, in addition to our  community, conducting training sessions for library boards and  commissions and advocating for our libraries.   Alan also served as the president of the California Association of  Library Trustees and Commissioners and represented Contra Costa County  on the Bay Area Library Information Systems Advisory Board. Alan was  recognized for his leadership and received the California Library  Association's President's Award.   As part of his service, Alan was a fierce advocate for legislative  action to strengthen our Nation's public libraries.   Please join me in recognizing Alan Smith on his well-deserved  retirement after 26 years of service to this Nation's libraries.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today, I stand in solidarity with my  colleagues and the 150,000 members of the United Auto Workers fighting  for fair pay and safer working conditions. In high cost-of-living  areas, like the area I represent, the bay area, cost-of-living  adjustments are necessary to ensure that workers have a livable  standard in their community with their job.   Over the past decade, the Big Three automakers almost doubled their  profits, much of it with the help from the United States Government.  These profits totaled $250 billion. The CEOs' pay increased almost 40  percent just in the last 4 years. Unfortunately, pay for the workers  hasn't come near to following suit. Though the strikes are currently  ongoing in three States, their outcome will have impacts on and provide  benefits to the quality of life for autoworkers across the country.   As a member of both the House Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure and the Committee on Education and the Workforce, I am  especially aware of the implications these negotiations will have on  the electric vehicle transition. As a former union member myself, I  believe we need to ensure strong labor protections for this new and  fast-growing industry which provides a historic opportunity to both  support workers and provide for a just and sustainable economic  transition.   I thank the UAW members for their sacrifice and their commitment. I  thank them nationwide for standing up for what is right, and what is  right not just for their members but for the future of this country.
