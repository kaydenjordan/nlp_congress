 Mr. Speaker, we are five months in the 2018  fiscal year, yet here we are again getting ready to vote on another  short-term government funding bill.   Has this become the norm in the new Republican-led government?   I'd like to point out that this will be the fourth continuing  resolution since September.   Our country isn't winning when our military, government agencies, and  important federal programs are operating under short-term spending  bills.   The American people are tired of the partisanship that has kept  Washington from doing its job. They expect results and it's our job to  deliver.   It's our job to fund the military and domestic programs, deliver  protections for DREAMers, keep our quality community health centers  open, reauthorize the Children's Health Insurance Program, and for  those whose districts were impacted by natural disasters, it's our job  to pass disaster aid for the families and small businesses that were  impacted.   There's broad bipartisan support for all the priorities that I  mentioned.   It's my hope that the Republican majority will roll up their sleeves  and get to work for the American people.
