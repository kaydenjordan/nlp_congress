 Madam President, I notice of the Presiding Officer and the  junior Senator from Arkansas, who was the Presiding Officer right  before, and far too often of the Presiding Officers that they are  taking their masks off when they preside. I notice that right below the  Presiding Officer are always three or four staff people who are fully  masked. I also know that a number of our colleagues have been diagnosed  with the coronavirus.   I would hope that the Presiding Officers, starting today, would wear  masks when they preside. As they speak and project, it puts people at  risk who sit right below the Presiding Officer. I know it might offend  the President of the United States that the Presiding Officer wears a  mask when presiding because I know the President doesn't believe in it,  but public health officials in Tennessee and Arkansas and Ohio and  Oregon and Hawaii do. So I ask this of the Presiding Officer and would  hope the Presiding Officer and others will consider public health when  they preside over this body.   Before I address my issue--and I will note when Senator Crapo has  shown up on the floor to address--I want to point out a couple of  things that I just heard from Senator Thune and Senator Wyden.   Senator Wyden is exactly right. The only amendment to the $2.5  trillion package that the Republicans offered was to strip away the  $600.   I have always been puzzled by how much the Republicans as a party-- almost since Roosevelt--have hated unemployment insurance.   I know you don't like social insurance. You don't like Medicare, but  you pay into Medicare, and then you get a benefit when you need it. You  pay into Social Security and get a benefit when you need it. You pay  into unemployment insurance and get a benefit when you need it.   I know the Republicans say they don't like Medicare, but every time  they have a chance, they try to privatize Medicare.   Right, Senator Wyden?   Then they try to privatize Social Security, right?   I can't believe the number of Republicans I have heard, when they  have come to the floor, either publicly say or privately grumble to  themselves or each other: I can't believe this $600 a week for these  people. We shouldn't be giving that much money to these people.   I mean, that was the tone of voice. There was, perhaps, derision in  their voices.   I was talking to an unemployed worker today who has lost her job, and  she is hurting. I mean, fortunately she has a spouse, and her spouse  has insurance, but she was talking about the $600 she got. It has also  helped local businesses. A whole bunch of people in my communities are  getting the $600 a week, and it keeps these businesses going too.   I guess I don't understand the Republican hatred of unemployment  insurance. I would think it would be trumped--pardon my verb--by how  much it helps small businesses, but I guess it is not. So that debate,  I guess, is over.   I will also note that, when we were giving the $600 a week, one study  showed it kept 12 million people out of poverty. But I guess everything  is OK. The stock market is back up, so Trump and McConnell seem to  think everything is fine                          Unanimous Consent Request    Madam President, I thank my colleagues for joining me on the floor  today to be voices for the millions of people who are frustrated and  angry because President Trump and Senator McConnell continue to fail to  get this pandemic under control.   The stock market is back up, so Trump and McConnell seem to think  everything is fine. They are oblivious to the families who are staring  at stacks of bills, who can't pay their rent, who have to run up credit  cards, who go to payday lenders--who don't know what to do. There are  600,000 people in my State who lost their unemployment insurance in  August. What are they supposed to do?   Senator McConnell and President Trump are oblivious to the parents  who are under an overwhelming amount of stress. They try to do their  jobs, juggle remote learning, and worry about whether their schools are  safe. They are oblivious to the layoffs that keep coming, especially in  local governments and school systems.   It just didn't have to be this bad. We are the greatest, wealthiest  country on Earth. What good is it if we can't rise to meet a moment  like this?   Trump and McConnell want you to believe that we can't solve big  problems, that we can't use our resources to help ordinary families,  that we can't use our talent to produce tests and PPE, and that we  can't use our ingenuity to figure out how to open businesses and  schools safely.   A half a million Ohioans are out of work, and 220,000 Americans are  dead. Yet McConnell and Trump have simply said: Not our problem. You  are on your own. I mean, that is the story of this Senate unless you  have a family member who is going to be confirmed as a Federal judge.  Other than that, you are on your own. They want you to believe it is  the best America can do.   I think we can do big things. I think we can actually solve problems  for the people we serve. We did it in the spring when we put $600 a  week in the pockets of people who lost their jobs and kept millions out  of poverty. We put in place an eviction moratorium, and we gave people  stimulus checks to spend in this economy, but then McConnell and Trump  let it all expire. Families are now forced to choose between rent and  utility bills and between food and prescriptions.   Yet nobody around here does. I understand that. Nobody here has to  choose between food and prescriptions or between rent and utility  bills. Nobody here does, but a whole lot of people in our States do. So  they are turning to payday lenders and getting trapped in cycles of  debt. They are going to lose their homes. One-sixth of renters are  behind on rent right now. That is 11 million people. Most of them are  behind on rent because they have lost their unemployment checks and  don't have any place to turn.   Even with that, extending UI would not be enough. It doesn't help you  if you still have a job but have had your hours cut back. It doesn't  help recent college grads or recent high school grads. It doesn't help  if you are self-employed or are working odd jobs.  [[Page S6356]]    As Senator Wyden said, we simply haven't modernized our unemployment  system well enough. The CDC's eviction moratorium is also not enough.  Without the dollars to back it up, it is only going to lead to a wave  of evictions come the new year. We need to get money directly to the  people so they may pay these bills or there will be a wave of evictions  in the middle of a pandemic.   Hundreds of thousands of people a week are dropping into poverty, and  we know that the $600 kept a lot of people out. Now people are dropping  into poverty, so there is going to be a wave of evictions, and that  wave of evictions is going to come. No. 1, it is terrible to be evicted  anyway. No. 2, it is more terrible to be evicted in the middle of the  winter. No. 3, it is even more terrible to be evicted in the middle of  the winter in the middle of a pandemic. How can we sit here and allow  that to happen?   Even now, with the Trump administration's flawed eviction moratorium,  evictions are happening. We see stories every day across the country,  and more evictions are coming in January. The work we do in this body  to get help to people can't make up for the lack of leadership from the  White House, but we could mitigate some of the damage. The House did  its job and passed the Heroes Act a few months ago. Over and over, I  don't see a sense of urgency in McConnell and Trump. They have ignored  the families. They have told the families: You are on your own.   This month, the House again passed a bill to help families make ends  meet. It provides the help for renters that I come to the floor to  offer today. The bill contains $50 billion in emergency rental  assistance. It extends the CARES Act and the eviction moratorium to  virtually all renters through March. It will protect families, and it  will protect public health so that it will not just be those families  who are protected from eviction; it will be all of us around those  families who could suffer from a compromise in public health. It will  also give renters and property owners the help they need to pay their  bills.   Senate Republicans have refused to consider it and the bill that I  offer here today. The multimillionaire majority leader and his caucus  have the audacity to tell people who have lost their jobs and the  audacity to tell essential workers making $10 or $12 an hour that it is  too expensive to give them help to pay their bills in the middle of a  national crisis. It is never too expensive to help Wall Street. It is  never too expensive for a corporate tax cut. It is never too expensive  to help the people who are in charge, but it is too expensive to help  the people who are making $10 or $12 an hour.   People are exhausted. They are tired of feeling like no one is on  their side. The American people shouldn't have to fend for themselves  in the middle of a once-in-a-generation crisis. That is essentially  what the President and the majority leader are telling people: You are  on your own. You are on your own. You are on your own   It means we should be helping families pay the bills and stay in  their homes. It means bringing back the $600 UI. It means getting  support to our schools and communities so they can open. It means  helping small businesses. It means putting money in people's pockets.   Madam President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of my bill to  provide emergency rental assistance and rental market stabilization and  to provide a temporary moratorium on eviction filings, which is at the  desk. I further ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  three times and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, I thank the Senator from Idaho, and I  regret that he will not be my committee partner next year because he is  moving on to--I guess he considers it a better committee. I don't know  for sure.   But anyway, the Senator from Idaho is right. We passed it unanimously  back in March, and it worked. The $600 and the help for hospitals and  schools and governments, local and State governments, actually kept--1  study said 12 million; say it is half of that--5, 6 million people out  of poverty. It worked.   So we said to Senator McConnell in about May or June--because these  programs and dollars were running out--we see what has worked. We will  jettison what doesn't work, and we will continue those programs. But  then, lo and behold, Senator McConnell kept saying: No sense of  urgency, no sense of urgency, no sense of urgency, and we got zero in  the end, when we asked Senator McConnell in August to--don't let the  $600 expire. We know more people will drop into poverty. We know more  people will be evicted. We know, as Senator Jack Reed has worked on, we  will see more people foreclosed on.   Senator McConnell has used the crutch of half the Republicans, half  my friends on this side of the aisle, don't want to vote another  dollar. He said they won't vote for anything. So maybe Senator Crapo is  an exception to that.   But this proposal of McConnell, we know how cynical it is; we know  how inadequate it is; we know how pitiful it is; and we know that  Speaker Pelosi has made several offers. She started with a pretty big  package that a lot of us thought was pretty close to ideal. We knew  that there would be compromise. She came back with a significantly  smaller package, and still they just say she rammed it through, and  they rejected it.   So I understand the handwriting on the wall that as long as  Republicans control this body, that we won't take care of people at  home, that we won't do adequate--adequate rental assistance, and we  won't do adequate unemployment.   We will see a cynical, inadequate sort of pitiful attempt by the  majority leader to put something on the floor that really doesn't meet  people's needs.   I yield the floor.
