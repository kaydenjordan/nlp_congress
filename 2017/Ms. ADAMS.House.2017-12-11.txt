Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from North Carolina?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, for the next 60 minutes, we have a chance to  speak directly to the American people on issues of great importance to  the Congressional Black Caucus, the Congress, our constituents, and all  Americans.   I acknowledge all the members of the Congressional Black Caucus who  are here, and most specifically, Congressman Richmond, who helped to  organize this Special Order hour.   As we convene tonight, we are going to recognize our HBCUs, and more  specifically, the nine HBCUs under the caption of: 150 Years of  Excellence.   I rise today to honor our Historically Black Colleges and  Universities, and in particular, the nine schools that are celebrating  150 years.   As a member of the CBC's Task Force on HBCUs and as co-chair of the  bipartisan HBCU Caucus, I have the distinct pleasure of honoring all of  the following schools of the HBCU 9 for this remarkable achievement:  Alabama State University; Barber-Scotia College; Fayetteville State  University; Howard University, Morehouse College; Morgan State  University; St. Augustine University; Talladega College; and from my  very own 12th District in North Carolina, Johnson C. Smith University.   The achievement of these schools across the past 150 years are beyond  remarkable and their reputation as incubators of innovation and Black  leadership is an incredible accomplishment in and of itself.   From humble beginnings, these schools have been able to persevere,  despite decades of discrimination and intentional neglect, in order to  provide African Americans a first class education.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today as a living testament to the  necessity and the importance of HBCUs. My mother, who raised me, was  not an educated woman. She wasn't able to obtain a high school  education. She didn't attend an HBCU, for that matter. But she  understood how important education would be in my life. She did  domestic work. She cleaned other folks' houses so I wouldn't have to  because she understood how important it was for me to go to school.  [[Page H9782]]    But like those visionaries who founded these schools after surviving  the horrors of slavery, my mom dreamed of a better future for me, her  daughter. When I could not fully recognize the potential in myself, it  was an HBCU, North Carolina A&T State University, that saw something in  me and made a committed investment toward my success.   North Carolina A&T State University gave a poor Black girl from the  ghetto of Newark, New Jersey, an opportunity because it believed in  opportunity and the fundamental importance of education that W.E.B. Du  Bois spoke about when he said: ``Of all the civil rights for which the  world has struggled and fought for 5,000 years, the right to learn is  undoubtedly the most fundamental.''   A&T took me where I was. They got me to where I needed to be. They  shaped and molded me into what they knew I could become. Just as our  HBCUs have done for many of our colleagues who join me in the people's  House today, our HBCUs are responsible for educating 20 Members of this  esteemed body and one Member of the U.S. Senate.   But that is only a small part of the story that these schools are  continuing to tell. HBCUs also contribute 50 percent of African- American professionals and public schoolteachers. They contribute 25  percent of all African-American STEM graduates, 40 percent of all  African-American engineers, 50 percent of African-American lawyers, and  80 percent of African-American judges.                                time  1930    Most plainly, HBCUs are responsible for building today's African- American middle class--this is a record to be proud of--and, of all of  these accomplishments, without the assistance and support from the  government and our private sector partners that they need and deserve.   Mr. Speaker, as we stand here tonight, as the CBC, to honor HBCUs, we  remain vigilant about the current dangers that they face. Many HBCUs  still suffer from barriers for access for students, such as  affordability, and the overall financial instability of both the  students they serve and of the institutions themselves, due to a lack  of access to funding.   As many of you know, one of my first tasks when I entered Congress  was to launch the bipartisan HBCU Caucus, with my co-chair Bradley  Byrne from Alabama. Vice chairing our caucus is Terri Sewell and Bennie  Thompson, and French Hill on the Republican side. Since its inception,  we have witnessed fortunate growth to a total of 58 Representatives and  2 Senators. We came together to create a national dialogue around HBCUs  for our Members and their staffs about the issues impacting our  schools. We also came together to draft meaningful bipartisan  legislation.   In accomplishing the first aim, the willingness of Members to attend  today illustrates that a national dialogue has begun. Before we leave  here today, our Members and our staffs, who couldn't join us tonight,  will, hopefully, learn and know the issues. To achieve the third  legislative goal, it will take the collective effort of all of us who  have been entrusted to work here in the people's House.   Tomorrow, I and my colleagues on the Education and the Workforce  Committee will debate a reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, a  flawed piece of legislation that, in many respects, will devastate  HBCUs and their students. Consideration of this measure illustrates how  we need that collective effort from both sides of the aisle to work  together now, more than ever.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues tonight, dedicated to the  achievement of HBCU students and graduates, to come together to work to  increase access and career opportunities. I hope we can all, tonight,  vow to take substantive action and recognize that the government cannot  take on this aim and this challenge alone. Let's work with our private  partners to create pathways of opportunity for our students, placing  them in fields that will make the African-American middle class larger  and stronger than ever.   Let's vow to continue listening to our HBCUs and their able  administrators, to ensure that they have the tools and the resources to  make that happen, for only then can we ensure that these valuable  institutions not only survive, but that they thrive. We have a number  of universities in North Carolina for public HBCUs and six private  HBCUs, and we are so very proud of all of our HBCUs throughout this  Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr.  Thompson), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi for  not only that valuable information, but for the work that he has done  over the years and for making an HBCU choice. I did the same thing for  my daughter. I said: You go wherever you want, my money is going to an  HBCU.   But nothing could be finer than to be at an HBCU. It really does so  much to get our students to where they need to be, especially those who  come the way I did: not fully prepared.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop), from  the Second District.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Bishop), the Morehouse man. I thank him very much for his contributions  tonight and for all he has done.   Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from North Carolina has 39  minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Bishop), the Morehouse man. I thank him very much for his contributions  tonight and for all he has done.   Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from North Carolina has 39  minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio's Third  District (Mrs. Beatty).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs.  Beatty) for her participation and for all of the work that she  continues to do, and we are so very proud of her acknowledgment tonight  of our HBCUs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the 14th District in  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Michigan for her  contribution tonight and for her support of Historically Black Colleges  and Universities.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from North Carolina has  24\1/2\ minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the Third  District of Virginia (Mr. Scott), who is the ranking member on the  Education and the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his  comments and for his work in education.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the Second District of  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for  not only his support, but for his contributions to our Historically  Black Colleges and Universities.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the Sixth District of  South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), our final speaker, the Democratic  Assistant Leader.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from South  Carolina, and I can certainly associate myself with those remarks that  you spoke about with Ron McNair. I, too, enrolled at North Carolina A&T  not fully prepared, but they made a committed investment in me, and I  was able to go on and receive my Ph.D. from the Ohio State University  only because of North Carolina A&T, an HBCU which has done so much for  all of our students.   I want to acknowledge Elizabeth City State University; Fayetteville  State University; North Carolina A&T, my  [[Page H9787]]  alma mater twice; North Carolina Central University; Winston-Salem  State University; Barber-Scotia College; Bennett College; Johnson C.  Smith University, in my 12th district; Livingstone College; St.  Augustine's University; and Shaw University. All of these colleges  reside in North Carolina, and we are so very proud of the work that  they are doing.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from North Carolina has 1  minute remaining.    Mr. Speaker, let me just thank all of my colleagues for  coming out tonight and to say that we are certainly very proud of our  schools, and we celebrate them tonight and every day. We acknowledge  the work that they have done. We acknowledge all of the corporate folks  who have pledged to work with our HBCUs, our tech companies in  connection with Howard University, and all of the other tech  corporations that have stepped forward to help us and to help our  schools and to continue to enable the young people who so ably deserve  a college education are able to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of my colleagues who came tonight  and those who will join us as we continue to work on behalf of  Historically Black Colleges and Universities so that they not only  continue to survive, but that they thrive.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to  celebrate the 150th Anniversary of Historically Black Colleges and  Universities (HBCUs). Nine HBCUs--Alabama State University, Barber- Scotia College, Fayetteville State University, Howard University,  Johnson C. Smith University, Morehouse College, Morgan State  University, St. Augustine's University, and Talladega College,  celebrate 150 years of excellence this year.   HBCUs are pillars of the black community and important contributors  to the strength of our nation. 40 percent of the Congressional Black  Caucus (CBC) are graduates from one or more HBCUs and with their  representation they continue to remind us of the importance of fighting  for these institutions. HBCUs not only provide a college education for  300,000 students every year, but they are economic powerhouses. Since  2017 HBCUs have generated an annual economic impact of $14.8 billion  annually--nearly $5 billion higher than in 2006.   I've seen the substantial impact of HBCUs in my district by the  example Paul Quinn College has set. Paul Quinn College plays a major  role in the economic success of its graduates by enhancing their  education, training and leadership skills. A college degree opens the  door to economic prosperity through greater employment and earnings  potential. In fact, Paul Quinn College's class of 2014 can expect total  earnings of $53 million over their lifetimes--that's 77 percent more  than they could expect to earn without their college credentials.   Paul Quinn College not only contributes to the economic success of  its students, but it also provides a foundation for students to grow.  Like many HBCUs, Paul Quinn College is committed to the holistic  development of their students. Professors not only focus on academic  excellence, but they also invest in the professional and individual  development of their students.   HBCUs will always be a prominent force in our nation. As a member of  the Congressional Black Caucus I recognize the importance of its  funding and legacy in our country. Please join me in recognizing the  legacy of HBCUs across our country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
