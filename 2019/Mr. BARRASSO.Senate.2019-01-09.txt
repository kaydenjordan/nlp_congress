 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, a new year begins, and it brings us new  challenges, new opportunities, and new faces in the 116th Congress.   I welcome the nine freshman Senators: Mrs. Blackburn of Tennessee,  Mr. Braun of Indiana, Mr. Cramer of North Dakota, Josh Hawley of  Missouri, Martha McSally of Arizona, Mitt Romney of Utah, Jacky Rosen  of Nevada, Rick Scott of Florida, and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Their  talent and hard work brought them here, and now we have an expanded  Senate Republican majority--a majority we built on in the 115th  Congress. Albeit, we are still short of the 60 votes needed to pass  most pieces of legislation, we have a group of people committed to the  values of our party and our country and working together to find  solutions for the Nation.   During the swearing-in last week, as I was sworn in to the Senate, my  96-year-old mother joined us. She attended, enjoyed it, watches the  opening every day for the Pledge of Allegiance and for the prayer from  Reverend Black, and looks to that as a sign of our Nation moving  forward.   From the time I was a little boy, she would always say: ``This is the  most important year of your life.'' She started when I was very young,  and I think her lesson remains today. For me and for all of us, this is  the most important year of our lives, for ourselves, for our Nation,  and for the world. She would say: What you do this year makes a big  difference for the future, so make sure you do it right. Well, we are  now at a point of divided government--Democrats control the House and  Republicans the Senate. We need to work together and do it right on  behalf of the American people.                              Government Funding    Mr. President, I think we have some immediate tasks; one is to secure  the southern border and the other is to fund the government. These  goals are not mutually exclusive. We can and we must do both, and the  key to breaking the current impasse is for both parties to work  together.   President Trump, I believe, is absolutely right to insist on border  wall funding. I think he is right to insist on it before agreeing to  sign spending legislation to end the shutdown, and he spoke  passionately and I think spoke convincingly about it last evening. If  the southern border were a patient--and I practiced medicine for 24  years in Wyoming--if the southern border were a patient admitted to the  hospital, it would be listed in critical condition.   All Americans want an immigration system that secures the border,  enforces the law, and that keeps families together. The problem of  course is the rise in illegal entry, terrorists, drug smugglers, human  traffickers, the Mexican drug cartels, all exploiting our porous border  with Mexico. The Customs and Border Protection Commissioner has called  the situation a ``border security and humanitarian crisis.'' That is  what we are dealing with, a border security and humanitarian crisis.   Here are the numbers from the Department of Homeland Security.  Currently, 16,000 Border Patrol agents and 8,100 military troops guard  the southern border. The National Guard has been deployed there  continuously since 2006. Still, illegal border crossings increased  dramatically from 2017 to 2018.   In this past year, the year just ended, 396,000 people were stopped  at the border, including 3,700 suspected terrorists and 800 gang  members. Of the border's 1,950 miles, a physical barrier today protects  about 650 miles. Border Patrol areas with enhanced or expanded barriers  have been successful. They have seen a 90-percent decrease in illegal  traffic. That is why the President wants to continue with additional  physical barriers to protect the border.   There is a huge improvement due to the wall. Clearly, walls work,  barriers work. So I ask: Why is Nancy Pelosi, the House Speaker,  prolonging the shutdown by denying critical funding? She has called the  wall immoral. I would say what is immoral is refusing to provide for  the safety and security of the American people by providing border  security.   Border security policymaking has always been bipartisan but not now,  it seems. The Pelosi plan to end the partial shutdown isn't serious  policy; it is political posturing. I say there is a partial government  shutdown because 75 percent of the government continues to be funded.  The Speaker's proposal includes billions in wasteful spending while  ignoring the crisis at the border. The President has promised to veto  what she is proposing, but instead of negotiating, the Speaker is  basically playacting.   What is needed is an agreement between the President and the  Democratic leaders in the House and Senate that can pass the House and  secure at least 60 votes in the Senate and then be signed into law.   As President Trump said in a January 4 letter to Congress, a nation  that fails to control its borders cannot fulfill its basic obligations  to its citizens, physical safety, economic safety, essential public  services, and the uniform protection of our laws.   We cannot afford to play politics with the border. I think we should  listen to the advice my mother continues to give me; that this is the  most important year of your life. It is important for this body, for  this institution, and for this Nation. Let's start 2019 and do it in  the right way by passing commonsense legislation that does secure the  border, that does reopen the government, and that protects the American  people.   Let's work together to make this the most important year, the start  of a better future for all Americans.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
