 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oregon for  the time.   It may have been 200 times that the President said that Mexico would  pay for the wall, but here we are today.   I rise to support S.J. Res. 54.   I want the American people to know, $3.6 billion is coming out of  your United States military, the men and women, your children, your  husbands and wives that you send to faraway places and to the bases  where families live. That is what is happening.   Now, as a Texan and a Member of the Homeland Security Committee,  since the heinous act of 9/11, I probably have been to the border more  times than I can count. I have walked across. I have ridden in speed  boats. I have watched the officers deal with the issues at the border,  and I have asked and watched as they have interdicted drugs.   Drugs don't come in large numbers across the border. They come  through legal points of entry. And our men and women have been very  successful in doing that.   But let me tell you what we are facing:   A 1957 structure on the Portsmouth, Virginia, shipyard known as  Building 510 has been cited for numerous life safety violations. That  is where your young Navy personnel are--life safety violations. It has  threatened the well-being of hundreds of workers if not heavily  renovated.   The Navy warned in its budget request to Congress: The building has  been labeled a high-risk environment, largely due to fire safety  concerns.   So do you know what they have done? To compensate for the risk of  fire, the Navy has been reassigning workers to staff roving fire  watches around the clock, 7 days a week.   They have been cut out for getting their money. Childcare centers  have been cut out for the men and women in the United States military,  for getting their money, when we know that border crossings of  desperate people are down.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a September 7, 2019, article  from The Washington Post.                 [From the Washington Post, Sept. 7, 2019]   Projects Defunded for Trump's Border Wall Include Military Buildings             With `Life Safety Violations' and Hazmat Concerns                      (By Aaron Gregg and Paul Sonne)         The U.S. Navy has been forced to stand down on construction       projects meant to fix ``life safety violations'' and fire       risks at dilapidated ship maintenance buildings and hazardous       materials warehouses in Virginia after funds were diverted to       pay for President Trump's border wall.        The pending construction projects at Norfolk Navy Shipyard       are among 127 that the Pentagon has defunded to free up $3.6       billion in funding for fences and barriers on the southern       border with Mexico using emergency powers.        One of the military facilities--a 1957 structure on the       Portsmouth, Va., shipyard known as ``Building #510''--had       been cited for numerous ``life safety violations'' that       threatened the well-being of hundreds of workers if not       heavily renovated, the Navy warned in its budget request to       Congress last year.  [[Page H8068]]         The building has been labeled a ``high risk environment,''       largely due to fire safety concerns. As of last year it had       no sprinkler protection, inadequate fire alarm systems and       not enough exits. Excessive heat and humidity inside have       caused equipment problems despite a 60-ton portable HVAC       system brought in to clear the air, according to Navy budget       documents.        To compensate for the risk of fire, the Navy had been       reassigning workers to staff ``roving fire watches'' around       the clock, seven days a week. The budget request sought to       revamp the building, including relocating personnel       overseeing nuclear containment and repairing Navy life rafts       from an even more dangerous building.        If the building isn't replaced, the Navy wrote in its 2018       request, ``approximately 330 personnel, working more than       256,000 manhours annually will remain in a high risk       environment, with continuing significant rework, high stress,       and additional operating costs due to inadequate working       environment.'' The Navy received $26 million from Congress       for a construction project that would have upgraded the       building, only to see that funding taken away to pay for       Trump's border wall project.        The project is one of eight military construction projects       in Maryland and Virginia that will lose $155 million in       funding being diverted to construct fencing and barriers       along the southern border.        The episode highlights how long-neglected military       facilities that suffered under the sequestration-induced       budget restrictions are now being buffeted by a different       political head wind.        The defunded projects include a Maryland child-care       facility for soldiers' children, Virginia warehouses designed       to hold hazardous materials and a secure facility for       classified cyberwarfare operations. They are among 127       military construction projects across 23 states, three U.S.       territories and 20 countries that have been sidelined to pay       for fencing and barriers on the border with Mexico. Shooting       ranges, airfields, drone facilities, schools, a missile field       and a treatment center for working dogs are among the       projects that have seen their funding rescinded.        Members of Congress representing Maryland and Virginia said       the diversion of funds will hurt U.S. national security.        ``I'm deeply concerned about President Trump's plan to pull       funding from critical national security projects--including       millions of dollars from important projects in Virginia--so       he can build his border wall,'' Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said       in a statement. His state will lose an estimated $89 million       in funded projects to pay for the wall effort, making it one       of the most affected.        Trump declared a national emergency in mid-February after       Congress refused to give him the sum he wanted for border       barrier construction. An obscure U.S. Code section governing       the military allows the defense secretary, in the event of a       national emergency requiring the use of the armed forces, to       carry out construction projects in support of those troops       without approval from Congress. The statute permits the       defense secretary to take money that Congress has given the       Pentagon for other military projects that have yet to start       contracting.        Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper on Tuesday determined that       11 border barrier projects proposed by the Department of       Homeland Security would support troops deployed to the       border, and authorized the Pentagon to divert $3.6 billion       from 127 military projects to finance them. On the campaign       trail, Trump regularly said Mexico would pay for his planned       wall along the southern border.        For the defunded projects to proceed, Congress must once       again appropriate funds for them. Republican lawmakers on       Capitol Hill broadly support ``backfilling'' the $3.6 billion       worth of projects, and the Republican-led Senate has included       a provision to do so in its version of the annual defense       policy bill. Democrats, however, have balked at the       suggestion, saying Trump's action flies in the face of       Congress's constitutionally mandated power of the purse.       Democratic lawmakers, including Kaine, have argued that       ``backfilling'' the projects would set a precedent allowing       any future president to do an end run around Congress when       confronted with funding he or she deems insufficient.        Top Pentagon officials say they are committed to making       sure the defunded projects are still completed, and say they       will work with Congress to ensure that the funding for the       projects is replenished. Still, they have admitted there is       no guarantee the funding will be forthcoming.        The Portsmouth ship repair facility is part of the Norfolk       Navy Shipyard, the U.S. Navy's oldest shipyard, where workers       repair and build naval vessels ranging from submarines to       aircraft carriers. Among other activities, federal workers       and contractors there are responsible for maintaining       nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines, as well as       disposing of the radioactive waste they generate. The       shipyard processed approximately 8,000 cubic feet of       radioactive solid waste from nuclear submarines between 2013       and 2017, according to a recent report from the Energy       Department.        But the infrastructure supporting the U.S. military's       nuclear waste disposal efforts has crumbled in recent decades       under successive waves of budget restrictions. In some cases,       that work has been carried out using antiquated 40-year-old       pipes, valves and tanks, according to a 2011 budget document.        Other projects that have been sidelined in favor of the       border wall include $41 million for a pair of       ``noncombustible hazardous materials warehouses'' at the       Norfolk shipyard. One of the warehouses was to include a new       storage shed for gas cylinders; according to Navy budget       documents, the existing one is too small and doesn't have the       necessary fire safety systems.        The Norfolk warehouses currently being used to store       hazardous materials ``are World War II-era structures that       are inefficient and not designed for HAZMAT warehouse       operations,'' Navy officials wrote.        ``If this project is not provided, [the Defense Department]       will continue storing hazardous materials in nonconforming       storage facilities that do not meet current life safety /fire       safety code requirements,'' Defense officials told members of       Congress in 2018.     Mr. Speaker, we recognize that this border wall,  over and over again, has been said to be designated as an action of the  sovereign nation of Mexico. Why, then, are the people of the United  States, the taxpayers, voting for something that was promised by  someone else?   Vote for this resolution and help the men and women in the United  States military. Stand with them. Stand with them.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of our Constitution and in  defense of our republic and urge all members to join me in voting for  S.J. Res. 54, which terminates the phony declaration of emergency  issued by the President on February 15, 2019.   The reason this resolution is before us today is because of the  petulant intransigence of a single person, the current President of the  United States.   As a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary and the  Committee on Homeland Security, I visited the southern border on  numerous occasions several times and can state confidently that there  is no national emergency or national security crisis that justified the  President's reckless and unconstitutional decision or compels the  Congress to abdicate its responsibilities under Article I to check and  balance the Executive Branch.   The President only pursued this tactic of declaring a national  emergency after realizing that Speaker Nancy Pelosi was absolutely  correct when she informed him that he did not have the support in  Congress to require the taxpayers to pay for his broken promise that  ``Mexico would pay for the wall, 100 percent!''   In fact, according to public opinion polling, Americans  overwhelmingly disapprove of the President's national emergency  declaration by a 61%-36% margin.   The President's decision is opposed by both men and women in every  region of the country, by every income group and education category; it  is opposed by veterans organizations, education associations like the  NEA and AFT, and organized labor.   National security experts across the political spectrum are unanimous  in their assessment that the situation on the southern border does not  constitute a national emergency, an assessment echoed by leading former  Republican senators and Members of Congress.   They understand that after failing to convince the American people or  Congress to pay for his ineffective, wasteful, and immoral multibillion  dollar concrete wall, the President now embarked on a course of conduct  that is deeply corrosive of the constitutional system of checks and  balances wisely established by the Framers and which has served this  Nation and the world so well for nearly 250 years.   Having failed miserably to achieve his objective in the  constitutional legislative process, the President resorted to a  desperate 11th hour end-run around Congress with an unlawful emergency  declaration that contravenes the will of the American people and  negates the awesome power of the purse vested exclusively in the  Congress of the United States.   The Congress will not tolerate this.   Despite being repeatedly admonished and in the face of overwhelming  evidence to the contrary, the President continues to propagate false  information regarding the state of our southern border.   Mr. Speaker, these are the facts.          NET UNAUTHORIZED MIGRATION FROM MEXICO HAS FALLEN To ZERO    Net migration from Mexico is now zero or slightly below (more people  leaving than coming) because of a growing Mexican economy, an aging  population and dropping fertility rates that have led to a dramatic  decrease in unauthorized migration from Mexico.                  TOTAL APPREHENSIONS ARE Low AND MANAGEABLE    Migrant apprehensions continue to be near an all-time low with only a  slight increase from 2017.   The combined 521,090 apprehensions for Border Patrol and Customs  agents in fiscal year 2018 were 32,288 apprehensions fewer than the  553,378 apprehensions in 2016.   To put this in perspective, on average, each of the 19,437 Border  Patrol agents nationwide apprehended a total of only 19 migrants in  2018, which amounts to fewer than 2 apprehensions per month.   In the last few years, an increased proportion of apprehensions are  parents seeking to  [[Page H8069]]  protect their children from the violence and extreme poverty in  Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.   But even with more Central Americans arriving to our southern border  seeking protection, total apprehension rates are still at their lowest  since the 1970s.   The absence of a massive wall on the southern border will not solve  the drug smuggling problem because, as all law enforcement experts  agree, the major source of drugs coming into the United States are  smuggled through legal ports of entry.                         BORDER COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE    The southern border region is home to about 15 million people living  in border counties in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.   These communities, which include cities such as San Diego, Douglas,  Las Cruces, and El Paso, are among the safest in the country.             CONGRESS HAs INVESTED BILLIONS IN BORDER ENFORCEMENT    Congress has devoted more U.S. taxpayer dollars to immigration  enforcement agencies (more than $21 billion now) than all other  enforcement agencies combined, including the FBI, DEA, ATF, US  Marshals, and Secret Service.   The bulk of this money goes to U.S. Customs and Border Protection  (CBP), with a budget of $14.4 billion in fiscal year 2018 and more than  59,000 personnel.   CBP is the largest law enforcement agency in the country, and more  than 85 percent of the agency's Border Patrol agents (i.e., 16,605 of  19,437) are concentrated on the southern border.   Expanded deployment of the military to the border to include active  duty troops could cost between $200 and $300 million in addition to the  estimated $182 million for the earlier deployment by the President of  National Guard to the border.   Mr. Speaker, having been soundly defeated legislatively by Congress,  a co-equal branch of government, the President wants to finance border  wall vanity project by diverting funds that the Congress has  appropriated for disaster recovery and military construction.   The funds the President wants to steal were appropriated by Congress  to help Americans devastated by natural disasters, like Hurricanes  Harvey, Irma and Maria, or for other purposes like military  construction.   Congress did not, has not, and will not, approve of any diversion of  these funds to construct a border wall that the President repeatedly  and derisively boasted that Mexico would pay for.   In fact, the President has admitted he ``didn't have to do this,''  but has opted do so because ``I want to see it built faster.''   Mr. Speaker, a bipartisan group of nearly 60 national security  officials including former secretaries of state, defense secretaries,  CIA directors, and ambassadors to the UN issued a statement declaring  that ``there is no factual basis'' justifying the President's emergency  declaration.   Instead of protecting our national security, the President's  declaration makes America less safe.   The President is stealing billions from high-priority military  construction projects that ensure our troops have the essential  training, readiness and quality of life necessary to keep the American  people safe, directly undermining America's national security.   Mr. Speaker, on September 4, 2019, citing his emergency declaration,  the President announced 127 military construction projects being  canceled to pay for construction of the wall.   These 127 projects are critical to protecting our national security  and improving the quality of life of our servicemembers and their  families.   President Trump's cancellation of these projects makes America less  safe, disrespects military families, and dishonors the Constitution.   A recent U.S. Air Force report also highlighted the security risks  posed from the President's cancellation of various Air Force military  construction projects, including:   1. Cancelling military construction for the European Defense  Initiative, preventing our work to deter Russian aggression.   2. Cancelling maintenance at a key base in the Middle East to fix  weaknesses that leave us open ``to hostile penetration in the midst of  contingency operations and an increased terrorist threat.''   3. Cancelling planned upgrades of airfields across Europe, leaving  them unable to support U.S. and NATO planes.   Mr. Speaker, the President's declaration clearly violates the  Congress's exclusive power of the purse, and, if unchecked, would  fundamentally alter the balance of powers, violating our Founders'  vision for America.   Opposing the President's reckless and anti-American decision  transcends partisan politics and partisanship; it is about patriotism,  constitutional fidelity, and putting country first.   To quote Thomas Paine's Common Sense: ``In absolute governments, the  King is law; so in free countries, the law ought to be King.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to uphold the rule of law and the  Constitution and reject the President's power grab; I urge a resounding  ``yes'' vote on S.J. Res. 54.
