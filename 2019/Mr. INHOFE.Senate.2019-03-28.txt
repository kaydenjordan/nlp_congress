 Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to recognize  a titan of defense thinking, Andrew Marshall, who passed away at the  age of 97 on March 26, 2019.   Mr. Marshall was the founding father of the Department of Defense's  Office of Net Assessment. From its creation, he served as its director  for over four decades, leaving an indelible mark on our defense  institutions. He finally retired in 2015, at the age of 93.   In his role, he piloted rigorous analysis of critical national  security issues, rooted in his unparalleled institutional knowledge.  This is why he was often called the `Yoda' of the Pentagon.   His groundbreaking work shaped how the Department of Defense responds  to long-term challenges and paved the way for a nimbler, more modern  force.   Despite its relatively small budget, the Office of Net Assessment has  had an outsized impact on military thinking. In particular, he foresaw  the threats posed by the then-Soviet Union and, more recently, China.   Mr. Marshall's legacy goes beyond strategic thinking. He also trained  the next generation of defense analysts, including the current Vice  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Paul Selva,  ensuring his knowledge lasts into the future.   Our Nation is more secure because of Mr. Marshall's important work.  We owe a great deal of debt to him, and I am thankful for the  opportunity to commemorate him today.                            ____________________
