 Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in  urging approval of Chai Feldblum. The EEOC is a vital bipartisan agency  that enforces workers' civil rights and helps protect them from  harassment and discrimination while on the job. The EEOC has long  operated with bipartisan support and requires a quorum of its five  members to decide the cases before the Agency--cases which include  racial discrimination, gender discrimination, age discrimination, and  the abuse of people who experience disabilities. As my colleague from  Washington noted, it decides cases of sexual harassment as well.   In short, the EEOC operates to protect hard-working people who want a  fair shot in the workplace. Blocking this nominee prevents the EEOC  from carrying out the work it is tasked to do. It is bringing an  unnecessary level of partisanship to a previously bipartisan process.   Ms. Feldblum is a highly qualified nominee. She has already been  confirmed to the EEOC twice by the U.S. Senate, receiving support from  Democrats and Republicans alike. She is also the first and only openly  LGBTQ person to serve on the Commission.   After being nominated by President Trump for another term last year,  it is time that we finally move forward with Ms. Feldblum's nomination.  We need to stop these games, and we need to allow the EEOC to fully  carry out its duties.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
