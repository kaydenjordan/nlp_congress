 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the retirement  of Idaho  [[Page S5013]]  Supreme Court Justice Roger S. Burdick. Roger has served Idaho's  judicial system with distinction and integrity for over 47 years.   Roger graduated from Boise High School in 1965 and received his  bachelor of science in finance from the University of Colorado in 1970.  He graduated from the University of Idaho School of Law with a juris  doctor degree in 1974. After graduation, he worked at the law firm of  Webb, Pike, Burton & Carlson in Twin Falls, served as a deputy  prosecutor in Ada County, and as a partner for the law firm of Hart,  Burdick & Healzer in Jerome. In 1980, Justice Burdick was elected  prosecutor for Jerome County.   In 1981, Roger began his career as a judge, being appointed to  magistrate judge for Jerome County. During that time, he became the  first magistrate judge member of the Idaho Judicial Council. In 1993,  he was appointed as a district judge in Twin Falls County.   In Idaho, the saying, ``Whiskey is for drinking and water is for  fighting'' fits all too well. Given his extensive legal and judicial  experience, Judge Burdick was assigned one of the most difficult and  challenging processes in Idaho in 2001, presiding over water rights  determinations through the Snake River Basin Adjudication. During this  time, he also became the administrative district judge for the Fifth  Judicial District.   Roger was appointed to the Idaho Supreme Court in 2003 by Governor  Kempthorne. He won reelection three times, serving as vice chief  justice of the court and two terms as chief justice. Before his  retirement, he was again serving as vice chief justice. In retirement,  he will apply to serve as a senior judge, taking on periodic cases to  help ease the workload across the judiciary.   In addition to being a judge and attorney, Justice Burdick has  contributed to the Idaho judicial system by serving on various Idaho  Supreme Court advisory committees, as the district judge member on the  Idaho Judicial Council, and as president of the Idaho District Judges  Association. Nationally, he served on the board of directors for the  Conference of Chief Justices.   As an avid waterfowl hunter, Roger makes time to enjoy this sport  with family and friends. He also likes to spend time with his wife  Rachel and his two grown sons, Phillip and Benjamin.   Vicki and I wish you all the best in your retirement. Thank you for  your outstanding service to Idaho and the Nation's judicial and legal  system. You make Idaho proud.                            ____________________
