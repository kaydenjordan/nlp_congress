 Madam President, just 1 week after a party-line vote in  the Judiciary Committee, the Senate is about to vote on the nomination  of Judge Amul Thapar to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. It has been  more than 16 months since the Senate confirmed a Federal appellate  judge and almost 11 months since we voted on a circuit or district  nomination. That is because of Leader McConnell's unprecedented  obstruction, blocking any votes on President Obama's qualified,  consensus nominees, all in an effort to leave as many judicial  vacancies as possible for President Trump and the far right special  interest groups who are charged with selecting his nominees.   The 7 days Judge Thapar has waited for a vote is quite a contrast  with the last circuit judge that Leader McConnell permitted to be  confirmed. Judge Felipe Restrepo's nomination languished for 6 months  on the Senate floor last Congress before he was finally given a floor  vote. Of course, there was no good reason for that. Judge Restrepo had  bipartisan support at every step of the process: positive blue slips  from his Democratic and Republican home State Senators, a voice vote in  the Judiciary Committee, and a bipartisan 82-6 confirmation vote.  Likewise, there was no good reason for Leader McConnell to deny votes  on other circuit nominees like Donald Schott and Jennifer Puhl. They  were reported with strong bipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee  and had bipartisan support from their home State Senators, but were  left languishing on the Executive Calendar for months, without ever  receiving floor consideration. We should not forget the 20 district  nominees and the five Court of Federal Claims nominees, who were  reported with bipartisan support and then fell victim to Senate  Republicans' unprecedented obstruction and were denied a vote after  waiting months or even years. Of course, we cannot overlook one of the  most shameful inactions of the Senate--the treatment of Chief Judge  Merrick Garland, who did not even receive a hearing for his nomination  to the U.S. Supreme Court.   So why are we now rushing to confirm Judge Thapar? It is only fair to  note that the seat to which he has been nominated has been vacant for  nearly 4 years. President Obama's nominee to that seat did not receive  this expedited process. She did not even receive blue slips from the  Kentucky Senators. Now, that is their right. Had I still been chairman,  I would have honored that decision--as I did for both circuit and  district nominees--however much I might have disagreed with it. We  should not pretend that we are required to vote so quickly on Judge  Thapar simply because the Republican leadership held this seat vacant.   This is a nomination that requires thorough consideration by the  Senate. It is no secret that Judge Thapar is a favorite of the same far  right groups that handpicked Justice Gorsuch--in fact, Judge Thapar was  on the same shortlist that they gave to President  [[Page S3173]]  Trump. Given Judge Thapar's apparent views on campaign finance  regulation, it is no surprise that these groups, who are some of the  biggest opponents of any efforts to bring transparency to campaign  financing, want to see him elevated to a circuit court. His answers  during his hearing did not allay my concerns.   I was also troubled by Judge Thapar's responses to my written  questions. Like Justice Gorsuch, he dodged a very simple question about  whether the First Amendment permits a religious litmus test for entry  into the United States, but even that nonanswer was inaccurate. Judge  Thapar responded that the constitutionality of a religious litmus test  is an active question in pending litigation regarding the president's  Executive order targeting Muslim-majority countries, and that he could  not comment on it. That is not accurate. There is no question that such  a religious litmus test is unconstitutional--even the Trump  administration does not argue otherwise. Instead, they are arguing that  the Executive order does not impose such a litmus test. Judge Thapar  failed to get the facts right, and failed to show me that he  understands one of the most fundamental principles of our Constitution.  It will be very difficult for me to support any judicial nominee who  fails to answer this question with adherence to both the Constitution  and the facts.   The role that far right interest groups have played in this  nomination and the Gorsuch nomination is troubling. A President is free  to consult with whomever he wishes on potential nominees, but the  ``advice and consent'' power belongs to the Senate, not the Federalist  Society. For decades, Presidents of both parties have consulted with  home State Senators, a requirement formalized through the Judiciary  Committee's blue slip process. This tradition protects the role of all  100 Senators in the confirmation process and helps ensure that  Presidents work with Senators of both parties to find consensus  nominees.   During my nearly 20 years as either chairman or ranking member of the  Judiciary Committee, I encouraged Republicans and Democrats to work  with President Clinton, President Bush, and President Obama to find  qualified, consensus nominees, and I protected the rights of Senators  in both parties. As Ranking Member Feinstein noted in a memo that was  circulated yesterday, no judicial nomination made by the last three  Presidents was confirmed without the support of both home State  Senators. I cannot recall a nominee being confirmed over the objection  of his or her home State Senator. The blue slip is not a partisan  issue; it is about constitutional checks and balances and the Senate's  role in protecting the independence of our Federal judiciary. I  encourage President Trump to follow the example of his predecessors  from both parties and work with us to find consensus nominees to ensure  that our Federal courts remain the envy of the rest of the world.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.    Mr. President, while the Office of Management and Budget  was putting the finishing touches on its Orwellian-themed ``A New  Foundation for American Greatness,'' the President's fiscal year 2018  budget, which proposes to eliminate or drastically reduce funding for a  vast array of critical programs on which the American people--including  the most vulnerable among us--depend, the Trump family was being feted  by one of the world's wealthiest and repressive regimes.   Not only has the Saudi family used its vast oil wealth to promote an  extremist ideology, including in madrassas and mosques in South Asia,  the Middle East, and North Africa, its grip on power is made possible  through corruption and the systematic denial of fundamental rights,  including the brutal oppression of women and girls, human trafficking,  and the exploitation of foreign labor.   After criticizing the Saudis during the Presidential campaign,  earlier this week, President Trump and his family basked in the opulent  glow of Saudi family royalty. According to press reports, just prior to  their arrival, the President's son-in-law finalized a $110 billion sale  of American weapons to the Saudis; yet neither the President nor his  advisers, who danced with Saudi sheiks in a grand palace, voiced any  concern that Saudi Arabia is a police state whose citizens have no  opportunity to change their government, where criticism of the Royal  family is not tolerated, and where arbitrary arrest and torture are  common, nor with the Saudis' repeated misuse of U.S. military equipment  against innocent civilians in Yemen.   In fact, standing next to the Saudi Foreign Minister at a joint press  conference, Secretary Tillerson rightly called on the Iranian  Government to restore freedom of speech and assembly for its people so  they can ``live the life that they deserve.'' But do the Saudi people  not deserve such rights? He made no such appeal to the Saudi monarchy.   Secretary of State Tillerson has also made clear that the values and  individual rights that Americans have long believed are what makes the  United States the great country that it is and which are in fact  universal values enshrined not only in our Bill of Rights, but also in  the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, will take a back seat to our  ``national security and economic interests.'' In that sense, the  administration is modeling itself after China and Russia, which, given  President Trump's admiration for ``strong'' leaders like President  Putin and Secretary Tillerson's background as he head of the world's  largest oil company, should surprise no one.   According to a press report, Secretary of Commerce Ross found it  ``fascinating'' that there were no protests during the President's  visit to Saudi Arabia. ``Not one guy with a bad placard,'' he said,  apparently oblivious to the fact that protests are prohibited and any  protester would have been immediately arrested.   I know I am not the only one here who finds it hard to fathom that a  President who has condemned terrorism, as he should, says virtually  nothing about the Saudi royal family's own support for extremism that  breeds terrorism, and nothing about the Saudi regime's gross  mistreatment of its own citizens. In fact, the President's daughter,  who purports to speak on behalf of the White House, publicly praised  the Saudi regime's progress on women's rights, ignoring the fact that  every woman she met with--none of whom were women's rights activists-- required the permission of a male relative to participate.   America's values, including the defense of human rights, are a source  of our strength, our durability, and our leadership in the world. I  have no qualms with a President of the United States visiting Saudi  Arabia. In fact, I support it. What I don't support, however, is the  President agreeing to a massive sale of weapons to a regime that, with  the exception of its antipathy toward Iran, shares little in common  with the United States. Saudi Arabia has been a supporter of terrorism.  Its armed forces have committed war crimes in Yemen. Saudi Arabia ranks  among the world's worse violators of human rights--even below Iran. The  message to the Saudi regime and the Saudi people from President Trump  and his family is that these issues are no longer important enough to  even mention.   Those of us who have been working on protecting and promoting U.S.  national security interests since long before this administration took  office know better. It is not possible to effectively separate our  values, like the protection of individual freedoms and other human  rights, and our national security and economic interests. They are  inextricably linked, and we will all pay the price if we ignore that  reality.  [[Page S3204]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, my wife Marcelle and I know and respect  Jacqueline Mars. She joined the Washington National Opera's board of  trustees in 2003. She was elected as chairman of the board of the  Washington National Opera in 2011 and oversaw WNO's affiliation with  the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Some of the  highlights during her tenure as chair have been the acclaimed  production of American Ring--The Ring of the Nibelung; M&M's Opera in  the Outfield; the Holiday Family Opera; and the American Opera  Initiative. Marcelle tells me that, in recognition and appreciation of  all of her tireless efforts and enormous contribution and support of  the Washington National Opera, the Board of Trustees of the Washington  National Opera have unanimously approved that Jacqueline Mars will now  be recognized as chairman of the board of trustees emeritus of the  Washington National Opera.   I ask unanimous consent that this resolution be printer in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:    Resolution of the Board of Trustees of the Washington National Opera         The Board of Trustees of the Washington National Opera (the       ``Board'') does hereby adopt the following resolutions:        Whereas, the Board recognizes the extraordinary       achievements of Jacqueline Badger Mars as Trustee and       Chairman of the Washington National Opera;        Whereas, in her years as Chairman, Jacqueline Badger Mars       has provided wise, far-sighted, and creative leadership in       guiding the Washington National Opera from the challenges it       faced in effectuating its historic affiliation with the John       F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, through its       successful and acclaimed production of Wagner's Der Ring des       Nibelungen cycle of operas--perhaps the most ambitious       project that can be undertaken in the opera world, to its       commissioning and introduction of new works by new composers       and librettists as part of the American Opera Initiative;        Whereas, Jacqueline Badger Mars's service as Chairman has       included numerous other highlights and accomplishments; and        Whereas, the Board wishes to recognize its deep       appreciation to Jacqueline Badger Mars for her untiring       efforts and enormous contribution to and support of the       Washington National Opera and the operatic art form       generally, and for her friendship over the years, now,       therefore, be it:        Resolved, That Jacqueline Badger Mars shall hereinafter be       recognized as Chairman of the Board of Trustees Emeritus of       the Washington National Opera; and further        Resolved, That this resolution shall be effective May 15,       2017.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am very pleased to join my friend,  the junior Senator from Arizona, in introducing the Freedom for  Americans to Travel to Cuba Act of 2017.   I will have more to say about this bill, and United States policy  toward Cuba, in the weeks and months ahead. My purpose in speaking  today is simply to point out that 55 Democratic and Republican members  of the Senate have cosponsored this bill to allow Americans to travel  to Cuba in the same way that they can travel to any other country in  the world. And based on my conversations with other Senators,  especially Republicans, I have little doubt that if we voted on this  bill today more than 60 Senators would support it.   It is indefensible that the Federal government currently restricts  American citizens and legal resident from traveling to a country 90  miles away that poses no threat to us, unless they engage in certain  activities and not others. For example, an American biologist can go to  Cuba to study threatened species of migratory birds. That same American  cannot take his family on a trip to visit Cuba's national parks. Why?  Because one is defined as scientific research and the other is defined  as tourism.   At a time when U.S. airlines and cruise ships are flying and sailing  to Cuba, does anyone here honestly think that preventing Americans from  traveling is an appropriate role of the Federal government? Why only  Cuba? Why not Venezuela? Or Russia? Or Iran, or anywhere else? It is a  vindictive, discriminatory, self-defeating vestige of a time long  passed. This bill would end these Cold War restrictions on the freedom  of Americans to travel. It would not do away with the embargo.   We are told that the Trump Administration is conducting a review of  U.S. policy toward Cuba. That is to be expected of a new  administration. We have also heard a rumor, and I hope it is only a  rumor, that in return for the votes of certain Senators or  representative on health care legislation, promises may have been made  by the White House to impose further restrictions on the normalization  of relations with Cuba. I hope that is not the case. I hope the review  produces a policy based on what is in the U.S. national security  interest and on what is in the interests of the American and Cuban  people, an overwhelming majority of whom want closer relations. And I  hope the policy reflects the bipartisan majority in Congress that  supports expanding our engagement with Cuba, as evidenced by the bill  we are introducing today.   I and others who have traveled to Cuba many times over the past 20  years, who have met with Cuban officials, with Cubans who have been  persecuted for opposing the Castro government, and with many others,  have requested meetings with top White House officials before the  review is completed and any final decisions are made.   Every one of us wants to see an end to political repression in Cuba.  The arrests and physical mistreatment of dissidents by the Cuban  government are deplorable, just as they are by other governments  including some, like Egypt's and Turkey's, whose leaders have been  feted at the White House, or, in the case of Saudi Arabia, have feted  President Trump and his family. Americans can travel freely to Egypt,  Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and every other country, except Cuba.   The issue is how best to support the people of Cuba who struggle to  make ends meet, and who want to live in a country where freedom of  expression and association are protected, and where they can choose  their own leaders in a democratic manner.   Anyone who thinks that more economic pressure, or ultimatums, will  force the Cuban authorities to stop arresting political dissidents and  embrace democracy have learned nothing from history. For more than half  a century we have tried a policy of unilateral sanctions and isolation,  and it has achieved neither of those goals. Instead, it has been used  by the Cuban government as an excuse for repression to protect Cuba's  sovereignty. It has hurt the Cuban people, not the Cuban government.  And it has provided an opening for our adversaries and competitors,  like Russia and China, in this hemisphere.   Change is coming to Cuba, and we can help support that process. There  is already visible, tangible evidence that the changes in U.S. policy  initiated by President Obama are having positive effects for the Cuban  people and for our security and economic relations with Cuba, even  though critics, particularly those who have never been to Cuba, prefer  to deny it.   But most importantly, the bipartisan bill we are introducing today is  about the right of Americans, not Cubans, to travel. Any member of  Congress, especially those who have been to Cuba, should support the  right of their constituents to do so. American citizens are our best  Ambassadors to Cuba, and it is wrong for the United States government  to be imposing restrictions  [[Page S3223]]  that have no place in the law books of a free society.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am very pleased to join my friend,  the junior Senator from Arizona, in introducing the Freedom for  Americans to Travel to Cuba Act of 2017.
