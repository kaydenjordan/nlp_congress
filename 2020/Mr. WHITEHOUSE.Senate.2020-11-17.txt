 Mr. President, it is timely that I should be giving  my ``Time to Wake Up'' speech with the distinguished Senator from  Louisiana presiding because I am going to be talking about sea level  rise, and seeing him in the chair reminds me of a recent report on what  sea level rise is doing to the great State of Louisiana, ``the  sportsman's paradise,'' in which a scientist from Tulane University--a  Tulane University geologist--was asked about the report about what the  State had to look forward to from sea level rise, and he said: ``What  it says is we're screwed.'' NOLA, the news website in New Orleans, in  Louisiana, ran that headline. So I know the Senator is sympathetic to  it.   But today, all eyes are on Georgia, which for the first time in  generations voted for a Democratic Presidential candidate, and the two  Senate races are headed for runoff elections, which will decide the  balance of power in this body.   Georgians of every race and background turned out to reject the  politics of fear and division that came from the White House for the  last 4 years and to reject the disdain for facts and science that has  cost Americans so much in battles like COVID and climate change.   Perhaps buried in the election outcome in Georgia was Georgia's  knowing the threat of climate change. For people along Georgia's coast,  climate change is no Chinese hoax; it is a clear and present danger.   In the spring of 2014, I took a climate trip along the coast of the  Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. I met with scientists and students,  outdoorsmen, faith leaders, and State and local officials, who cherish  their coastal communities, as Louisianans do and as Rhode Islanders do.  They saw the seas rising and acidifying due to carbon pollution.  Georgians told me how deeply they care about their coast. That caring  has powered them through some tough battles. They fought hard against  fossil fuel development off Georgia's shores, and they won.   It is not hard to understand why Georgians fight for their coasts  against fossil fuel pollution. Near Savannah, I visited Fort Pulaski  and Tybee Island. NOAA has a tide gauge at Fort Pulaski. It has been  measuring sea level since 1935. The tide gauge takes straightforward  measurements--clear, irrefutable facts. That tide gauge showed sea  levels up over 8 inches since it was installed. For low-lying areas,  those 8 inches of sea level rise are a problem already, but it is going  to get worse.   Climate change worsens coastal flooding in two ways. First, it raises  the level of the sea as glaciers and ice sheets melt into the sea and  as warmer oceans expand. Second, climate change powers up stronger and  more frequent hurricanes, which send those higher seas as higher storm  surges farther inland. So it is important to look at how far and how  often sea level rise and storm surges will flood coastal areas.   This is the map of Georgia's coastal area around Savannah. Here is  Savannah. Here is the coastline. Here is the ocean. Here is Tybee  Island. This dot here is Fort Pulaski, where the tide gauge is. That is  what it looks like now, but ``now'' is not going to stay because here  is what Georgia has coming at it.   Based on NOAA information, this is the risk of flooding along the  Georgia coast. It takes NOAA's intermediate prediction of sea level  rise--``intermediate'' meaning it is not the most extreme scenario; it  is the midrange prediction--and it shows the risk in any year of a 4- foot-deep flood.   So here we are in 2020, and the risk is negligible. It is about 3  percent, meaning in present circumstances, you get a 4-foot flood  through that area every 33 years. But by 2040, the risk is over 40  percent, which means that a 4-foot flood in that area is now not  happening every 33 years, it is happening virtually every other year.  By 2060, you hit 100 percent. You are getting a 4-foot flood in coastal  Georgia every year. Of course this tops out at one flood per year based  on the percentages, but if you look at this trajectory, clearly we are  headed for multiple 4-foot floods per year in the outyears.   When I was on Tybee Island, I met city councilman Paul Wolff, who  showed me the city of Tybee's new stormwater tide gate, which they just  installed to protect the island from sea level rise. He explained that  the road out to Tybee Island, which is here, running along that edge,  flooded already 45 times per year with just 1 foot of sea level rise.   The city had already put in place a short-term plan for 14 to 20  inches of sea level rise by 2060. They were already thinking what the  community would need to do as seas rise and acting on the best science  back at that time. But now consider this: Consider sea level rise and  storm surges combining to produce a 4-foot flood every year, at least  once a year.   Here is what that map looks like when you put 4 feet of water there.  This is the Savannah area, and here is Tybee Island. This is all land  in gray, and now all of this is underwater. Tybee Island has turned  into just a tiny little atoll, basically, out in the ocean. The road  that I was talking about is now not just occasionally washed over with  water; for 5 miles, that road is underwater.   Now, 4 feet of flooding happening every year is obviously bad, but  remember, that wasn't the worst-case scenario; that was the  intermediate NOAA scenario.   Here is an extreme case--10 feet of sea level rise. That was Tybee  Island. There is nothing left. Do you want an island now? Your island  is Savannah--Savannah Island, surrounded by water.   Well before the physical disaster of sea level rise and storm surge  and flooding happens, something else comes first: an economic disaster,  because we are not the only people looking at these projections of 4  feet and 10 feet of flooding. So do insurance companies. So do banks  selling mortgages   In these populated areas that are now land, how do you insure against  a 4-foot flood that will happen every year? You can't buy a flood  insurance policy for an event that happens every year. How do you get a  30-year mortgage for a property that will have flooded at least 30  times by the end of the mortgage? That economic punch--when you  [[Page S7030]]  can't get insurance and when you can't get a mortgage on the property,  that punch lands long before the floods come.   Take Chatham County and Glynn County. According to a report by  Climate Central, over $2 billion in property value would be lost in  those two counties with 3 feet of sea level rise. Up the flooding to 8  feet, and it is over $7 billion in property value destroyed--people's  homes, people's businesses. When a buyer can't get insurance and when a  buyer can't get a mortgage, sellers face plummeting property values.  The market unbalances rapidly because all of a sudden, you don't have  many eligible buyers. The only buyers you have are people who can  afford the property without having to borrow and who can afford to take  the hit of an annual flood without insurance. That is not a big crowd.  So the bottom falls out of the coastal property market.   That collapse in the coastal property market is what financial  experts call a systemic risk. ``Systemic risk'' is the mildest and  blandest term for a catastrophe that I know. It means that the whole  economy is threatened by the economic collapse of coastal property  values.   It is not just me saying it. In 2016, the top economists for U.S.  mortgage giant Freddie Mac projected that climate-driven flooding along  U.S. coasts will cause a property value collapse, leading to economy- wide losses ``greater . . . than those experienced in the housing  crisis and the Great Recession.''   For those of us who remember 2008 and the pain and the difficulty and  the harm and the fear that was caused by that mortgage meltdown-- greater than that, is what Freddie Mac says. That is not an  environmental group, by the way; that is Freddie Mac.   It has already begun. Lenders are already requiring bigger and bigger  downpayments in coastal areas, sometimes as much as 40 percent of a  home's value before they will insure the remainder. Flood insurance  premiums continue to rise, and coverage limits leave many seaside  property owners exposed to huge losses.   The people who own this flooded property are going to want to know  why Congress paid more attention to fossil fuel polluters than we paid  to coastal property owners; why we would only listen to the people  causing this problem and not listen to the innocent property owners who  are going to suffer billions and, if you multiply it out, trillions of  dollars in losses.   When I was in Georgia in 2014, a local clammer named Charlie Phillips  took me out over the marshes on his airboat. It was a boat he built  himself. He is a member of the South Atlantic Fishery Management  Council, which runs the regional fishery, so Charlie knows his stuff.  He has been an outdoorsman his whole life, and he needs fresh, clean  water for his Georgia clams. Charlie told me that changes in the  climate are hurting the ecosystem that supports his and his employees'  livelihoods. Six years ago, Charlie was worried about a perilous  future, one that looks even more perilous now and one to which we have  not responded for 6 long years.   Well, one hopeful change is that we have a President-elect now--a  President-elect who understands what is happening to our climate and  who understands what is happening to our coastal communities. He is  from Delaware. He gets it. The question is, How will Congress respond?  Will Republicans allow a strong, comprehensive climate bill? So far,  there is no sign of that, not in this building.   At some point, we will--mark my words--we will finally cast off the  grim and malign grip of the fossil fuel polluters and their massive  political influence machines. At some point, we will finally listen to  the people now on dry land whose homes and businesses are going to be  predictably flooded out because we did nothing. I will tell you that it  had better be soon because time is not on our side. As these coasts  flood--not just the Georgia coast but the New Jersey coast, the Rhode  Island coast--as these coasts flood, coastal property owners will  demand answers, and the Georgia voters who live near the Georgia coast  are entitled to an explanation of why nothing is being done.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise today to honor Mr.  Elmer, one of Rhode Island's leading advocates for humanitarian and  environmental causes. Mr. Elmer is set to retire after a long and  successful career, most recently with the Conservation Law Foundation.   After graduating from Rhode Island College and Harvard Law School,  Mr. Elmer devoted the first part of his career to humanitarian, peace,  and security issues. He was codirector of Rhode Island's American  Friends Service Committee, where he focused on nuclear disarmament and  human rights. He also traveled extensively in South and Southeast Asia  to research the status of human rights and the effect of Western  military and economic aid programs in the region.   Mr. Elmer's work yielded important, lasting change. He authored a key  referendum to freeze the production and deployment of nuclear weapons,  which appeared as a ballot question in Rhode Island in 1982. He then  led the successful statewide campaign for that referendum. The 1982  nuclear freeze measure was, at that time, the largest nationally  coordinated voter referendum in U.S. history.   Later in his career, Mr. Elmer turned to the fight for climate action  for renewable power in Rhode Island's energy market. At the  Conservation Law Foundation, Mr. Elmer appeared before Federal and  State courts and the Public Utilities Commission to enforce Rhode  Island's renewable energy laws. He was the principal author of several  of Rhode Island's major renewable energy statutes. Notably, he drafted  the long-term contracting statue, which gave rise to the Nation's first  offshore wind project, the Block Island Wind Farm, and helped to write  the distributed generation standard contracts law, to create a  comprehensive framework to spur development of small, local renewable  energy projects across the State. In recent years, Mr. Elmer led  successful opposition to the siting of a fossil fuel power plant in  Burrillville, RI, and has been one of Rhode Island's great  environmental litigators.   Mr. Elmer is a staunch advocate for human rights, peace, and action  on climate. His tireless efforts on behalf of the Conservation Law  Foundation and Rhode Island echo far beyond our State. I am proud to  recognize his service and thank him for such an impressive career in  battle for great causes.                            ____________________
