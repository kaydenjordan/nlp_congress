 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize July as  National Blueberry Month.   Georgia might be known as the Peach State, but our top fruit is  actually blueberries, making it a critical part of our State's economy.   From May to July, this fruit is harvested, and a 2019 study found  Georgia blueberries generate an annual economic impact of over $520  million.   Being a farmer is difficult. Most of their success depends on things  outside of their control, such as supply chain issues, worker  shortages, and, most notably, weather issues.   In March 2021, Georgia's blueberry farmers lost more than $140  million worth of crops to freezes, which, contrary to popular belief,  we do get from time to time down in south Georgia.   Unfortunately, freezes are not covered losses and do not qualify for  Federal assistance funds. That is why, in this year's farm bill, I am  fighting for freezes to qualify for the same protections as other  natural disasters such as floods or hurricanes.   This small legislative fix will give security to growers of Georgia's  number one export. Let's make this National Blueberry Month the last  one without this commonsense protection for blueberry farmers.                         Remembering Howard Allan Poe     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  Howard Allan Poe.   Howard was born on January 6, 1961, in Sanford, North Carolina, to  Allan Augustus Poe and Evelyn Grace H. Poe.   Mr. Poe was a resident of Brunswick for 22 years, where he was a  member of Cowboy Church, as well as the owner of American Dock Builders  and Coastal Marine Center.   He was the life of the party. He was loved by all who were blessed  enough to know him. Fondly known as Captain HAP, Howard competed in the  Southern Kingfish Association trail and SKA Pro Tour for over 25 years.  He was proud to be the 1996 SKA National Angler of the Year.   However, Mr. Poe's proudest accomplishment was his children, who he  watched grow and succeed, both personally and professionally.   Howard's legacy will live on in the positive impact he had on his  community, and I extend my deepest sympathies to his family.                     Celebrating Marion Virginia DeLoach     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  90th birthday of Marion Virginia DeLoach, a lifelong educator from  Chatham County and mother of Eddie DeLoach, the former mayor of  Savannah, Georgia.   Throughout her career in education, Marion served as a substitute  teacher, middle school teacher, Sunday school teacher, curriculum  specialist, principal, and president of her local parent-teacher  association.   There is no doubt that over her decades of service to her community,  Virginia has impacted thousands of students' lives, helping instill in  them values of hard work, courage, and dedication.   In her free time, Virginia enjoyed softball, reading, and camping. As  she celebrates nine decades of life this September, I wish her good  health and bountiful enjoyment and pleasure from these hobbies over the  next decade of life.                      Celebrating Military Marriage Day     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of  the upcoming Military Marriage Day, which is celebrated on August 14 of  each year.   My district is particularly blessed to have such a large veteran and  Active-Duty servicemember population, and Military Marriage Day  provides an opportunity to honor the sacred bonds these servicemembers  share with their spouses.   Strong military marriages are vitally important to the strength and  well-being of our Armed Forces. When one spouse decides to serve their  country, both spouses take on that responsibility. They can't do it  alone, and we are so appreciative of all the sacrifices made by our  servicemembers and their families to defend our freedoms.   I congratulate our district's new military marriages on their recent  unions and vows, and I am continually inspired by the persistence,  strength, commitment, and love of the many longstanding military  marriages in our district.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Trey  and Erin Thompson, the Muscular Dystrophy Association's first Savannah  Toast to Life Gala honorees.   The MDA is honoring Trey and Erin due to their tireless efforts to  increase muscular dystrophy awareness within the Savannah community.   Trey's father, Robbie Thompson, passed away on March 18, 2012, after  a brave fight with ALS. Robbie was a strong, kind man who lived his  life to the fullest no matter what trials he faced in his life. His  legacy lives on through Trey and Erin Thompson's advocacy for the  neuromuscular disease community in Savannah.   Through events like the Toast to Life Gala, the MDA funds research,  treatments, and technology that increase quality of life for those with  muscular dystrophy and related neuromuscular diseases, as well as their  families.   Trey and Erin will be honored at the Third Annual MDA Savannah Toast  to Life Gala on August 31, 2023. I thank them for their efforts in the  fight against muscular dystrophy.                            ____________________
