 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the order of the  House of January 21, 2021, I call up the bill (H.R. 335) to provide for  an exception to a limitation against appointment of persons as  Secretary of Defense within seven years of relief from active duty as a  regular commissioned officer of the Armed Forces, and ask  [[Page H210]]  for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 335.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, this is the bill that will grant a waiver, an exemption,  to Lloyd Austin to be nominated and confirmed as the Secretary of  Defense. This is required because there is a law on the books that says  that you must be 7 years separated from military service in order to  serve as Secretary of Defense.   Mr. Austin has been out for almost 5 years, but does not meet the 7- year requirement. So we need to pass this law to give him that  exemption.   Now, this is not an easy question. Civilian control of the military  is enormously important. That is why this law was put in place. But in  looking at this, I feel there are three basic questions:   Number one, does the nominee in question understand and reassure us  in the House--for the purposes of our vote on this portion of the  waiver--that he understands and is committed to civilian control of the  military?                                time  1415    Second, is there something about this particular nominee that makes  it important to grant this exclusion, to grant this waiver?   And, third, is the individual qualified for the job? Because I do  believe that that is important, and the details of their history is  important in deciding that.   And I have, after a lot of thought and a lot of conversations with  Mr. Austin and others, concluded that all three of those criteria are  met in this instance.   Taking the last one first, Lloyd Austin is unquestionably highly  qualified to be the Secretary of Defense. He had a distinguished career  in the military, serving in multiple different command posts, including  the commanding general in Iraq, the head of CENTCOM, and the Vice Chief  of Staff of the Army. It is beyond question that Lloyd Austin is  qualified for this job.   He just finished a 2-hour presentation before the Armed Services  Committee, taking our questions, in which he made it absolutely clear  that he has a keen understanding of the issues that are going to face  the Secretary of Defense and the experience and the intelligence  necessary to deal with them. He is highly qualified.   On the first question of civilian control of the military, he has  assured us over and over again of how important that is, and, more  importantly, his actions reflect that.   He has come before the House, which you do not typically have to do  in order to be confirmed to a Secretary-level position, but he has  called us and he has reached out to us in a way that, frankly, 4 years  ago, the Trump administration did not permit then-Secretary-nominee Jim  Mattis to do.   He has called countless members of the committee; he has met with us.  He has showed us that he respects what is really one of the  cornerstones of civilian control of the military, and that is the House  and the Senate. We are the ones who have oversight over the Pentagon.  He has shown that he respects that.   So I can tell you and all Members voting, without a shadow of a  doubt, I have no concern whatsoever about Lloyd Austin upholding  civilian control of the military.   And then there is the second issue: Why this person, in this  instance? Mr. Austin will be the first African American nominated.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 1  minute.   Mr. Austin will be the first African American nominated to be  Secretary of Defense, which is enormously important in and of itself.   The military has a problem with diversity. They have an insufficient  number of people of color who have been advanced to high positions, to  general and general flag officers. It is enormously important that they  address that.   In addition, in this country, we have an enormous problem right now  with White supremacy. We also have a problem within our military ranks.   Now, let me be perfectly clear: I have 100 percent confidence in our  military. But this is an issue that they do need to address, the rise  of White supremacy and White nationalism within their ranks. Having a  highly qualified African American be Secretary of Defense will be an  enormous step toward addressing that problem.   So I believe 100 percent Mr. Austin has met the criteria to be  granted this exclusion.   Lastly, I want to say, this law still matters because without this  law we wouldn't have this process. We would not have the opportunity to  question Mr. Austin in advance of his confirmation in the Senate. So  the law has upheld its meaning and its role, to maintain civilian  control of the military, by forcing this conversation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote in favor of the waiver for  Lloyd Austin, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, we are going to have process arguments all year long in  this House, but what was just said is really disingenuous. The only  reason that we didn't go through regular order, the only reason we  didn't have a public hearing, and the only reason we didn't have a vote  in our committee is because the Republicans, as we stand here right  now, have not appointed their members to the Armed Services Committee.  So, therefore, we don't have a committee.   It is the day after Mr. Biden has become President. He needs his  Secretary of Defense. I have begged the Republicans for the better part  of a month to appoint their members so we could do our job.   So for them to choose not to appoint their members and then come to  the floor crying about process, that is not really fair. We tried to do  the process right. They stopped us from doing the process right. I want  the record to reflect that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Brown), a soon-to-be member of the Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of  the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the other  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Crow).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentlewoman from Ohio.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Horsford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from the U.S. Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, from this debate, it is clear that Mr. Austin is highly  qualified to be Secretary of Defense. It is also clear that he has a  full appreciation of the importance of civilian control of the  military.   And, finally, it is clear that he is unique to this moment. His  experiences as an African-American man coming up through the military  puts him in a unique position to address the problems of White  supremacy and a lack of diversity across the military in addition to  all of the other challenges that we have heard from speakers today.   There is no question that he is qualified for this job and that he  should be given the waiver so that he can serve in this position.   Mr. Speaker, I want to close by speaking to the urgency of why we  need to do this today and how we got to this point.   When I first heard that Secretary Austin was going to be the  selection, I will confess that I was not thrilled about it, not because  of Secretary Austin--I know him, I have worked with him, and I think he  will do an outstanding job--but because I realized the responsibility  that it put on this House.    By and large--not ``by and large''--entirely, nominees are the  business of the Senate. They confirm; the President picks. But because  he picked someone who would require a waiver, we had to engage.   And I understood the urgency of getting that done, even while the  Committee on Armed Services was still in the midst of dealing with the  President's veto of the defense bill and trying to get the override  done. But I knew the urgency. We had to find a way to get it done.   And, Mr. Speaker, I want to make perfectly clear that Mr. Rogers has  been an outstanding partner in working towards the urgency of moving  this forward. The process arguments get lost in the weeds. There were a  whole bunch of things we had to do to be organized as a committee, to  be ready to meet the requirements that we had, and we tried our best to  do it.   Now, it is my humble opinion that we met those requirements even if  we didn't have a public hearing. As has been stated by many Members,  right before this vote we had 2 hours with Mr. Austin over in  committee, in which members, Republican and Democratic members alike,  were able to ask him questions and get his answers.   And I will tell you, I feel even stronger about the need to confirm  him after that conversation. Not only was he intelligent, not only was  he on point, not only did he understand the issues, but he had  something, frankly, not everybody in the Pentagon has: He seemed to  genuinely respect us. He seemed to genuinely want to answer our  questions, want to deal with us as a coequal branch of government. That  is enormously important.   But the urgency is why we are here today and why we didn't wait the  extra week or 10 days. Joe Biden is President. He doesn't have a  Secretary of Defense. Every day that goes past that he doesn't have a  Secretary of Defense is a huge problem for a variety of reasons.   Let's start with the fact that much has been made that this waiver is  problematic because we did it 4 years ago and now we are doing it  again; the exception has become the rule.   Well, if it makes anybody feel better, there have actually been four  separate Secretaries, people in the Secretary of Defense position, in  between Mattis and Austin. So it is really just, sort of, two out of  six.   That many people have churned through the leadership role in the  Pentagon. And while the people at the Pentagon have done an amazing job  fighting through that, it is still problematic to have to have that  much turnover. The disruption that President Trump brought to the  Pentagon cannot be underestimated.  [[Page H218]]    I will never forget being in the meeting in the White House when we  were talking about the pullout from Syria when someone dared to bring  up Secretary Mattis's opinion--recently departed Secretary Mattis from  the Department of Defense--and President Trump just lit in to Secretary  Mattis, called him weak, called him a terrible human being.   Meanwhile, sitting right next to him was the incoming Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, who had worked with Jim Mattis. And  this is his new boss.   Mr. Speaker, the disruption at the Pentagon has been enormous. They  need a fully confirmed Secretary of Defense immediately to begin to  thoroughly clean up that mess and get the Pentagon back to being as  effective as it needs to be.                                time  1515    Also, and I will not belabor this point at all, we have a complex  threat environment, right? Let's just say that. We heard about it on  the committee today, about China, Russia, Iran, the Middle East, North  Korea, not to mention the domestic insurrection that we all witnessed  here just a couple of weeks ago. There is an urgency to this.   If there wasn't an urgency to this, I would have waited a week and  said, okay, let's take however much time. People can figure out their  ratios, and pick their members, and whatever.   There is an urgency. So instead of having the public hearing, we had  a very, very successful briefing.   The House this time has done its job in a way that it didn't 4 years  ago when we simply took Mattis, didn't hear from him, and voted on it.   There is a minor point of whether or not we mark this up in  committee. This is not a complicated bill. Either Austin gets the  waiver and he serves, or he doesn't.   There is really nothing to mark up. It is a question for the House.  That is why we came to the full House.   This House, with the cooperation, I may say, of Mr. Rogers and all  the Members has done its due diligence, above and beyond. We have  concluded, without question, that the waiver is appropriate. Lloyd  Austin will be an outstanding Secretary of Defense. He deserves this  waiver, and our country deserves a fully confirmed Secretary of Defense  as soon as we can possibly get that done, which, for the purposes of  the House, is now.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.
