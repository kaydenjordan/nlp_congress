 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my friend and  colleague, the ranking member, for yielding this time.   This is one of those pieces of legislation that really touches your  heart.   As a veteran, I have had the opportunity to serve with some of  America's finest, and I have also experienced the loss and the families  that have lost loved ones in defense of this Nation.   But my story with the Gold Star goes back to even when I was a child.  You see, my dad was a veteran. He was a medic in World War II. He was  involved in the D-Day invasion. He went all the way through from  Normandy, through France, into Belgium, and then on into Germany.   I remember when I was young, I was going through this photo album  that my mom had, and as I was flipping through seeing the pictures that  my dad brought back from World War II, there was this interesting  picture of a banner hanging inside of a church.   And I remember when I asked her about this, because my children  recently, just a few years ago, were going through the album not long  before my mom and my dad passed away. They saw that same picture and  they asked the same question I asked: What is this? This banner had  names, various names of people, and next to the names was a silver star  or a gold star.   I remember when my children asked the question: ``What does this  mean?'' My mom, who was a teenager at the time, said: ``This banner was  in the entrance of our church, and the names on it were all the boys  from our church that were serving in the European or the Pacific  theater. And the silver star at the time indicated that they were  deployed into the combat area.''   But then she kind of got teary-eyed, and she said: ``But when it was  a gold star, it meant that they had been killed in action.''   I remember her telling about the D-Day invasion, because they knew  that something was going to happen. They knew we were going to invade,  but they didn't know exactly when. And the night of the invasion, when  President Roosevelt took to the airwaves and led the Nation in a prayer  for the invasion, her father told her to go throughout the town of  Waha, South Carolina, and gather everyone to come to the church and  pray.   She said they stayed and they prayed in the church all night long.  But she said a couple of days later, when they went back to the church,  she looked, and several of those names now had gold stars, including  the pastor, the pastor's son. I remember her telling the impact that it  had upon those families.   Many of these families are devastated, not only at the loss of their  loved one who gave their life for our freedom, but at the life they  will have to endure, the responsibilities that they will take on solely  for that family.                                time  1645    I got to know a family when I was in the State legislature whose son  was killed in Iraq during the war on terror. I was able to name an  intersection after Justin Johnson. His story went on because his family  were such patriots, even though his mom was a Gold Star Mother at that  point.   His father wanted to complete the mission for which his son started  and reenlisted back into the National Guard. Unfortunately, his unit  was not going to be deployed, so he asked to be actually transferred to  a unit that was going to deploy, which the Army did. He went and  fulfilled the mission that his son wasn't able to complete.   I have seen and I have worked with these families and know the tragic  situations they are in. And, as others have, there is actually a  wounded warrior on our staff, Chase Sanger, an Army airborne veteran,  who is one of the finest that our Nation has produced.   To be able to extend this on to the families of those heroes, I think  is not only admirable, but it is something that we should have done a  long time ago. I salute my colleague, General Kelly, for bringing this  forward. I give it my utmost support, and I think this is well overdue.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle for bringing this measure forward and giving us an  opportunity to do something so important for these families.   I am sure many of you, as you watch the television, see the different  organizations that have evolved over the past several years to provide  assistance to those families. One particular organization provides  assistance in paying off the mortgages for these families.   I bring that up just as an illustration to the aspects of what these  Gold Star families go through at the loss of their loved one. Sometimes  it is the primary income earner from the family because, quite often,  the spouse is at home taking care of the children and, all of a sudden,  they are the primary breadwinner, their loved one is gone. They are  left with these bills. They are left with, a lot of times, situations  beyond just the grief of what they are feeling at the loss of their  family member, they have to deal with these unbearable situations.   Providing them with an opportunity for the spouse or their children  to find employment in something that they feel is also meaningful,  because many of them have such a patriotic heart, they want to continue  to serve.   One of the things that I have often said to many of my veterans and  friends who have served is that when we take that oath of office, there  are a lot of things that we swear to, to uphold and defend the  Constitution of the United States, up to and including giving our own  lives, if necessary. But one thing that is not in that oath of office  is an expiration date.   Many veterans and their families, even at the end of their regular  service, still feel that need and that desire to serve. This will give  an opportunity for those family members to continue to serve their  country in a meaningful way.
