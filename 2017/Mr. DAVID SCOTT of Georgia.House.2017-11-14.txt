 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member  Waters for yielding.   First, it is very important for us to understand that flooding, Mr.  Speaker, is no longer just a coastal lawmaker's problem. Flooding is  now running rampant in every part of our country.   So I think that every Member on the floor today and every Member of  Congress needs to ask themselves a question, and that is: Are you  really willing to put your name on this bill? Are you really willing to  vote for this bill that will drastically raise premiums on your  constituents without putting the necessary guardrails in place so those  who can't afford the high costs can still buy flood insurance?   Now, one example I am talking about is this, Mr. Speaker--and I want  to make this clear. I hope that there are listeners on C-SPAN who will  tune in. Call your neighbors, call somebody. So you listen to this:  This bill, H.R. 2874, will require policyholders to pay for any  assistance they get when their States create affordability programs.   Here is an example: Mr. Duffy's bill allows for the creation of a  voluntary State-run affordability program. But here is the catch, Mr.  Speaker: there isn't one dime of funding provided in this bill to set  up and implement this program.   Instead, Mr. Duffy's bill says the cost of any discount given to  policyholders will have to be offset by fee increases on other  policyholders within the same State.   Now, Mr. Speaker, this is the Achilles' heel in this flood insurance  business. I can guarantee you that this would have a gravely negative  impact on all of us who are low to middle income.   Mr. Speaker, I made it clear to Mr. Jeb Hensarling, our distinguished  chairman; and to Mr. Duffy that we are willing to walk across party  lines.    But we offered this, as the ranking  member said, as an excellent opportunity. This summer, we spent week  after week on this bill so that we could move this bill forward in a  way that would address affordability, which was a major concern of  mine, of the ranking member's, and those of us on our side of the  aisle.                                time  1545    There is no affordability in here. It is very important for us to  point out that this plan will put an overburden on the States, and then  they have to pass it on in fees to the others.   Unfortunately, it is a terrible bill. I urge my colleagues to vote  ``no.''
