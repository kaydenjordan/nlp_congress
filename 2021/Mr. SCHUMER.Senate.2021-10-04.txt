 Take your time. I am going to get settled.    Madam President, I thank my dear friend, our majority  whip and the senior Senator from the State of Illinois, as well as  someone who was my roommate for, well, decades, I guess.                            ____________________     Madam President, on the day that this majority commenced  its work, I promised that this Chamber would meet the challenges that  face our Nation ``not with timid solutions but with boldness and [with]  courage.'' Now the 117th Congress stands at a pivotal moment in our  pursuit of this goal.   Over the past few months, both Chambers have dedicated themselves to  passing two transformative, once-in-a-generation pieces of legislation:  the bipartisan infrastructure bill and the Build Back Better agenda.   Doing big things in Congress is always hard, but we didn't choose  elected office just to pursue the easy things. In the days and weeks to  come, Senate Democrats will remain focused on passing the agenda we  promised no matter how hard the task.   All last week, I held extensive talks with the Speaker, the  President, and my Senate colleagues to bring us closer to a final  agreement on our Build Back Better agenda. We made important progress,  but there is more work to do.   So, this week, I will continue meeting with my colleagues in an  effort to produce a bill that all of us can get behind.   Last Friday, President Biden spoke to House Democrats about the path  forward for passing our ambitious agenda into law. His message was  simple: If we stick together, if we work to find a legislative sweet  spot that we can all support, then we will succeed.   He is right, and that is exactly what we are going to do.   As I explained this morning in my ``Dear Colleague,'' our new  legislative goal must be to get both the infrastructure bill and the  Build Back Better agenda done by the end of October.   The reason is simple: The infrastructure bill, for all its historic  investments, is also a reauthorization of the highway trust fund. We  passed a 30-day patch over the weekend to keep vital programs going.  But as it stands, the trust fund is set to run out of money by the end  of October.   If we are going to meet this deadline, Democrats must arrive at a  final agreement on the details of the Build Back Better agenda as soon  as possible, preferably within a matter of days, not weeks. It is the  only way we can give committees enough time to draft legislation to  ensure its privileged status in our Chamber and complete the  reconciliation process before the end of the month.   Now, none of this is going to be easy. It will require sacrifice,  compromise, and finding common ground. Nobody is going to get  everything they want.   But no matter what, our final proposal will deliver the core promise  we made to the American people: We will take bold action on climate  change, while creating millions of jobs; we will expand healthcare  opportunities and lower costs for working Americans; and we will cut  taxes for the working and middle class, while asking the wealthy to pay  their fair share.   I am confident we will be proud of the end result: a bill that will  dramatically improve the lives of every single American not just for  today but for generations; a bill that will rebuild ladders for working  people to get to the middle class, help people stay in the middle class  who are there already, and rekindle--rekindle--that sunny American  disposition so central to our national identity but seems to be fading  a bit in the last while.   This is worth a couple of hard days. This is worth many hard days.  Again, we didn't come to Washington to take the easy way out. We came  here committed to work every day, to reward the faith that the American  people have placed in us. We came here to get big things done, and that  is exactly what we will do in the weeks ahead.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on the debt ceiling, before the  end of this week, the Senate must--must--get a bill to the President's  desk to address the acute crisis of the debt limit.   President Biden was crystal clear in his speech this morning. If  Republicans don't get out of the way and let the Senate take action  now, our government will in all likelihood enter default for the first  time ever.   Sadly, the Republican position as the party of default has now become  so extreme that they have blocked every single attempt to prevent a  default from happening, putting our country in serious, serious danger.  They have gone so far as rejecting their own requests for how the debt  ceiling should be  [[Page S6881]]  raised. Their own requests for putting those in action--they are now  saying no. Why do you think? Why do you think?   Now the Republican leader has repeatedly stated that the Democrats  must raise the debt ceiling on our own, and he has directly cited  precedents of 2003, 2004, and 2006 when the Senate voted to raise the  debt ceiling by a majority vote. But what he conveniently and  repeatedly ignores--and he knows better--he ignores that in each of  those examples, the minority allowed an up-or-down vote without-- without--a partisan filibuster. In other words, the other side said:  Get us to 50 votes, and we won't make you get to 60.   That is just what we are asking for now. We are proposing the same  offer now, which Leader McConnell has cited. Let us vote to raise the  debt ceiling without a partisan filibuster. In fact, this was the  thrust of my consent request last week, which would have resolved this  Republican-driven default crisis with an up-or-down vote. Republicans  could have gotten their chance to vote no, and we could all have put an  end to this needless impasse. But given the easiest way out of the  mess, the Republicans still refuse to take ``yes'' for an answer. Now  our country is on the brink of a crisis whose consequences will  reverberate around the world.   The bottom line is, this Chamber must pass legislation to avoid a  default. Accordingly, I will soon file cloture on the House-passed  proposal that will suspend the debt limit until December of 2022. We  aren't asking Republicans to support it when it comes time for a vote;  we only ask that they get out of the way as Democrats pass it on our  own, just as the majority party did in the early 2000s. It is really  that simple. If Republicans want to vote to stop payments from going to  Social Security recipients or veterans, then be my guest, but they  ought to get out of the way and let the legislation pass the Senate.   The fact is, we don't have the luxury of waiting until October 18 to  extend the debt ceiling. Even a near miss can have dramatic  consequences. Every single day we delay taking action, we increase the  chances of doing irreversible damage to our global financial system,  our economic recovery, and trust in our country's ability to pay its  debts.   So, again, we will need to get a bill extending the debt ceiling to  the President's desk by the end of this week. We aren't asking  Republicans to vote yes even though it is debt that they incurred; we  are simply asking that they get out of the way.   I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague for his courtesy.                            ____________________     I move to proceed to legislative session.
