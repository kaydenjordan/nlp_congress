 Mr. Speaker, due to a family obligation, I unfortunately  missed today's vote series. Listed below is how I would have voted had  I been in attendance: Previous Question--``Nay''; Adoption of the Rule  Providing for Consideration of S.J. Res. 54--``Nay''; Republican Motion  to Recommit--``Yea''; and Passage of H.R. 3525--``Nay''.                            ____________________
