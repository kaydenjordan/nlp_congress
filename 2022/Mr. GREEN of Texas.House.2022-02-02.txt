 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, a proud African  American. I rise today because we are into Black History Month, the  second day, and I rise today because I am very much concerned about  history in this country. For you see, Mr. Speaker,  [[Page H334]]  there are efforts across the length and breadth of the country to  distort history and, in many instances, not to allow it to be taught.   Can you imagine Black history not being taught in this country? That  would make Black History Month more important, but my hope is that at  some point we don't need Black History Month because history will be  taught every day and there won't be a need to accentuate the things  that have happened to African Americans in this country. But the notion  that we can't teach the true history of what happened to us in the  United States of America and what happened to the people in the United  States of America is offensive.   And it is not just about African Americans, by the way. It is also  about Jewish people, not being able to teach what happened to Jewish  people. Can you imagine more than six million people murdered, and we  can't teach this in our schools? The number is not known truly. Huge  number. And what happened to them? How were they killed? They weren't  just murdered in concentration camps. Many of them were murdered in  their homes, in their yards, in the ghettos. And that can't be taught?    If we can't teach Black history, we probably won't be able to teach  the Trail of Tears and what happened to the indigenous Americans, how  they were harmed by virtue of the State itself intentionally causing  them to receive certain diseases. We won't be able to teach what  happened to the Asians who came to this country, internment camps.   Black History Month is very important to us. We have to have it, but  more than have Black History Month, we have got to have the history of  what has happened taught because those who don't learn the lessons of  history are doomed to repeat the lessons of history.   And finally this: This House needs to go on record. We need to go on  record. We need to take a stand. We need to let the world know that we  will support the teaching of history in schools. To do anything less is  to cause us to be placed in the position of having not lived up to the  promises of this country. We should do it. I hope that this House will  go on record appropriately doing so.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman, Ms.  Johnson, for the time.   Madam Speaker, Dr. King was eminently correct when he reminded us  that life is an inescapable network of mutuality tied to a single  garment of destiny. What impacts one directly impacts all indirectly.   This became perspicuously clear to us when we had a shortage of PPE  in this country. We have a strategic petroleum stockpile, in the sense  that we have oil, petroleum that is on reserve for emergencies. When we  pass this bill, we will have a strategic medical supply stockpile,  something that is desperately needed; something that this bill will  provide; something that I will vote for, and I encourage my colleagues  to do so as well.   Pass the bill.
