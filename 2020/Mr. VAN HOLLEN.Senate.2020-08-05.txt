 Madam President, I thank my colleague from New  Hampshire, Senator Hassan, for the important points she made about what  is happening in New Hampshire. In listening to her, I think each of us  could say that that holds true for our State. Certainly, what she says  holds true in my State of Maryland.   In Maryland, we are just weeks away from the opening day of school.  In other parts of the country, schools have already reopened.   I think all of us can remember back to when we were going back to  school during our K-12 years. We had a mix of excitement and anxiety.  And those of us who are parents with children shared the excitement and  anxiety of our children as they went off to school.   This year, we are facing a sense of emotions and realities that none  of us has ever experienced before. I think all of us agree that we  would like all students to be able to return to actual classrooms as  soon as safely possible. I hope we would all also agree that we want to  make sure that in returning, we don't put at risk those children,  students, teachers, or others in the school community.   We all agree that in-classroom instruction provides the best learning  environment for students, but we should also agree that students should  not be returning to classrooms if it will put them at greater risk to  their lives or their health or the health or lives of their teachers or  others in the school community.   We know that in order to reopen schools safely, we have to do two  things: We have to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in those communities  where it still exists and is still spreading, and we need much more  rapid testing capacity so that we can quickly detect and isolate  somebody who has COVID-19. We need to be able to quickly detect an  outbreak of COVID in a school, whether that be a student or a teacher,  so we can make sure that others do not get infected   In so many places, such as the majority of major school systems in my  State of Maryland, the reason they have not been able to plan to reopen  the classrooms on opening day is that the spread continues in so many  areas, and we don't have rapid, comprehensive testing. That is the  result of a failed and botched policy at the highest levels--the fact  that this administration, this President, has not put in place a  comprehensive national strategy to slow and then stop the spread.   Even today, you have to wait days and days and days to get the  results of a test. That dramatically reduces the usefulness of that  test when it comes to identifying an outbreak, doing all of the  following up to figure out who else has been in contact with that  person, and preventing the spread.   That is why so many schools, including so many in the State of  Maryland, will not be able to return to their classroom's opening day.  It is not because they don't want to--of course, they want to--but  because they don't want to put students, teachers, and the community at  risk. That is the reality we are facing at the moment.   In order to ensure that our kids, our students, get an education  beginning on the first day of school, we need to dramatically scale up  our ability to provide distance learning to those students. It is  simple common sense that distance learning for our students requires  two things to happen: No. 1, teachers need to have the necessary  equipment and training to connect via the internet to their students;  No. 2, students need to be able to connect to the internet so they can  receive the lessons from their teachers. That is simple logic, and that  is common sense.   In our country, right now, we have a major problem, a major gap, a  major inequity, and that is that millions of students, as we prepare to  begin the first day of school, don't have access to the internet. That  means they will be cut off from that form of distance learning, and  that is unacceptable, given the fact that that is the approach we have  to take at least for some period of time in many schools around the  country.   I think we should agree--and I hope we agree--that every child in our  country, regardless of his or her ZIP Code or their family's income,  should receive a high-quality, top-notch education that allows each of  those students to achieve their full potential. They can't even connect  to the internet if they can't even connect to their teachers. That,  obviously, can't happen.   In many ways, what we have seen from the coronavirus is,  unfortunately, not anything new. It is the magnification of deep,  systemic inequities that existed in our country before the outbreak of  the pandemic and have been amplified since then--inequities in our  healthcare system, inequities in various social systems, and,  certainly, inequities in our social system.   Those inequities have put students--many students--at an increased  disadvantage, primarily students from lower income families and  neighborhoods and, especially, students of color.   Before the pandemic, we used to refer to this distance learning gap  for students as the ``homework gap.'' What do we mean by the homework  gap? Well, when I was at school and we were given a homework  assignment, we pretty much needed our textbooks, and we needed our pens  and paper. But now the overwhelming majority of homework assignments  given by teachers require access to the internet to do your assignment  and to do your research.   Before the pandemic, we had millions of American students who  couldn't access the internet for the purposes of doing their homework,  and that was a serious problem. We called that the homework gap. But  now what we call the homework gap has become a full-blown learning gap.  It is not just a question of not being able to access the internet to  do our homework assignment; these millions of students can't access the  internet at all for their learning.   This is not an isolated, small problem, and it is not just relegated  to certain parts of the country. It is everywhere.   In urban communities, 21 percent of students do not have access to  adequate internet. In suburban areas, it is 25 percent. In rural areas,  it is 37 percent.   There are three reasons for this lack of access. One is lack of  access to a device, a computer device. Obviously, you need to have a  device to get on the internet.   Here is a letter I received when schools had to shut down earlier  this spring as a result of the pandemic. I received a letter from an  11-year-old Marylander who shared that his family has one computer,  which he needs to share with his sister, who is in fourth grade, while  his mom, who is a single parent, has to work full time using that same  computer. He said that his family hadn't gotten any other help with  additional electronics and that his mom, who ``is the most supportive  and strongest mom . . . can only do so much.'' That is just one example  of a student who doesn't have access to a device.   What is another reason you can't connect? Well, if you don't have an  internet connection either because you don't have a hotspot for your  cell signal or you are not otherwise connected through a wire, then you  obviously can't get the signal. So we need to make sure that we have  more hotspot devices available for more students and do our best to  build out the infrastructure to reach those who cannot be reached by  hotspots. That is a second reason: You just can't connect to the  internet and get the signal.   A third reason is that in some places, internet access is available,  but it is unaffordable. It just costs too much. We should not have any  situation where a student, during this pandemic, can't get on the  internet because his or her family cannot afford to pay for it.   Just to give you an idea of the magnitude of this problem, in the  spring, 50 million K-12 students were trying to access the internet  from home for their lessons. But 15 to 16 million of those students  either did not have access to high-speed broadband or they did not have  a device. Nine million of them lacked both access to high-speed  internet and did not have a device. This is  [[Page S4908]]  not a small problem, and it is not an isolated problem. It is a problem  we need to address now, since schools are opening in a few weeks in  Maryland and schools have already opened in parts of the country.   Here is a note I received from an elementary schoolteacher--someone  who has been in the classroom for over 20 years--during the spring when  they were trying to get their students connected:         Like thousands of my colleagues, I rose to the occasion in       transitioning to distance learning and engaging with all of       my students who had access to devices. What was disheartening       was the students whose faces I did not see--a high number of       which were my African American students.    This does hit communities of color disproportionately, but it does  hit students in every geographic area in every part of each one of our  States.   To give you an example of the disparity based on race and ethnicity,  you have 18 percent of White students who lack access to the internet,  26 percent of Latinx students, 30 percent of Black students, and 35  percent of Native American students.   I hear some people say: Well, we are going to do distance learning,  so that is not so expensive. Why do we need to provide schools with  additional help during this period of time?   The reality is, transitioning to a viable distance learning system  that helps every one of our students costs money. In fact, it is an  average of $500 per student.   In Maryland, schools are already struggling to try to connect their  students, trying to purchase these devices, trying to make sure that  they sign up families who qualify for the Lifeline service, but we are  falling short, and they need help.   That is the students. We also have learned that 400,000 teachers are  currently unable to connect to the internet because they lack  connections. School superintendents have reported to us stories of  teachers who are going to the school parking lots to access the school  hotspots to do their teaching and provide their lessons. So we have to  act urgently to address this issue. This should not be a political  matter. There should not be a debate about the need to make sure every  student can get classroom instruction via distance learning during this  pandemic.   That is just for starters. We also have schools who have to make sure  that they provide education to the special ed students. We need to make  sure that students who receive nutrition and lunches continue to be  able to receive those, and we need to make sure that community schools,  which in many of our States provide essential wraparound services, have  the resources that they need.   So let me just end by listing the key steps that we need to include  in this next emergency package that we have been working hard to do.  One are the resources to close this distance learning gap, including  the Emergency Education Connections Act which I, along with Senator  Markey and many others, have introduced. We need $4 billion to make  those connections.   I see Senator Cortez Masto on the floor, and I want to thank her for  her leadership here, as well as Senator Blumenthal and Senator Reed.   Two, we need to provide $12 billion for additional help for the IDEA  program for special ed. Three, we need to make sure that we continue  the flexibility for school lunch programs and increase the SNAP benefit  by 15 percent. Four, we need to provide the $175 billion to help all of  our K-12 schools, including our community schools.   I will end with this. Childcare facilities are really feeling  stretched and going under. If we want to have a safe and calibrated  reopening, we need to make sure that those childcare centers remain  open to parents so that they are able to go back to work--as they are  allowed to safely--and make sure that their kids are well cared for.   We have got a lot of work to do. We have been trying to have these  discussions for over 2\1/2\ months, since the House passed the Heroes  Act. This is long overdue. We hope these negotiations will conclude  quickly because many of the protections that are in place right now are  expiring.   As we do that, let's make sure that our kids, who are going back to  school in a matter of weeks in my State of Maryland--that all of them  can connect to the internet so all of them can learn.   It is simply unacceptable that millions of American kids are going to  be going back to school, just like we all remember doing at one point  in time, but they are not able to go in the classroom, and their only  way to learn is by connecting to their teachers via the internet. We  need to solve that problem and do it now.   With that, Madam President, I yield the floor to the next Senator who  is going to speak on this issue.    Mr. President, I support the referral for a committee  hearing of the nominations of Frank Dunlevy, Christopher Bancroft  Burnham, and John M. Barger to be Members of the Federal Retirement  Thrift Investment Board.                            ____________________
