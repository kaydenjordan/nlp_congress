 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the amendments en  bloc 2, which includes my amendment to support the mental health and  nutritional needs of servicemembers.   Servicemembers across the country and in my State who seek mental  healthcare often encounter outdated resources or a lack of information  on military websites. Without immediate and accurate access to mental  health providers, servicemembers and their families are left to  navigate a crisis on their own. Servicemembers already have insurance  hurdles that can make it difficult to find acceptable and covered  providers.   My amendment would help bridge this gap by requiring the military to  review all installation-level web information about suicide prevention  and behavioral health and ensure contact information is up to date. My  amendment also requires the military to certify their review to  Congress on a yearly basis.   Additionally, I urge my colleagues to support Chairman McGovern's  amendment, which would require the DOD and the USDA to collect data on  food insecurity among servicemembers. Representative McGovern's  amendment would require the Department of Defense to train and  designate a point person on all military bases to refer servicemembers  seeking nutritional assistance.   Last November, as chair of the House Agriculture Nutrition  Subcommittee, I hosted a hearing to address hunger among  servicemembers, and our witnesses pointed out the lack of consistent  data to address this issue. I support this amendment and will continue  to work with Chairman McGovern to ensure that no family, especially  military families, go hungry.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the  amendments en bloc 2 and the final National Defense Authorization Act.
