 Madam Speaker, I am going to remove my mask as I  speak. We are appropriately socially distanced here. I am grateful for  the time.   Before I begin my own remarks, I am going to yield to the honorable  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), a senior member of the Energy  and Commerce Committee, who will be departing from us soon. He is in  his last term, has announced his retirement.   It has been a pleasure to serve with you, my friend. We have a long  way to go, but it is always great to see you, and I look forward to  your remarks.         Congratulating Reverend Dr. Dale A. Meyer on his Retirement     I thank Congressman Shimkus, because as he was  speaking, I was reminded of my own Concordia College I represent, which  is a part of the consortium of Lutheran colleges, which I know is very  close to his heart. So I thank him for mentioning the gentleman.   Madam Speaker, before I begin, may I inquire as to the allotted  amount of time. Is it 30 or 60 minutes?    Madam Speaker, our world has changed. Who could  imagine just 3 short months ago where we would be right now as this  silent avenger has threatened life, the life that we knew, and we  suddenly found ourselves quarantined in our homes and apartments with  nowhere to go, no planes to catch, no appointments to make, just quiet  isolation with family and neighbors across the way.   Many friends are suffering, suffering unemployment or job  uncertainty, or the impact of the sickness directly. The trauma of this  crisis is so, so real.   With that said, Madam Speaker, I am sure all of us in this body are  doing quite a bit of reflection, adjustment, and alteration as we go  back to what I call first principles, and here is an example.   As I was reviewing my mail recently, my daily mail, a gentleman wrote  to me. He was concerned about something. It might not be about what we  will talk in a moment, our dependence on China for protective equipment  and medical supplies, it might not be the latest surge of the virus in  cities throughout America, but, nonetheless, it was important to him  that he point something out to me: The flag at one of our small post  office locations is not flying, and it hasn't been flying for some  time.   So my diligent staff actually contacted the gentleman. I believe they  reached out to the post office themselves, but it sat out there as a  lingering issue. So I decided to call the postmaster myself, and I  apologized to her. I said: I know this is highly unusual that a  Congressman would call you directly.   She said: It is about the flag, isn't it?   I said: Yes, ma'am.   She said: I don't have anybody to help me. I have the equipment to  fix it. The top of the pole is broken. I just don't have anyone to help  me.   I said: Let's get it fixed.   I called our electric system. We have a public power system in  Nebraska. They deal with us all the time on a whole variety of issues.  Their response was: We will get it fixed.   There are a couple of levels of issues here, Madam Speaker, and the  reason I tell the story.   First of all, it was important to that gentleman that that flag,  which represents us all, right behind you, the binding notion of what  it means to be an American, that people have fought and died for, the  symbol of this dignity, this nobility of tradition that defines not  only where we have been but, really, what we ought to strive to be.  Maybe he didn't think through all of that, but he just wanted the flag  to fly at a government building.                                time  1615    The postmaster had no ill will or ill intent, she just didn't have  any help. In a previous time maybe we would have just said, well, you  need to get the purchase order written, but in my own way, let's just  solve the problem.   And whether it is a person who has had a problem with their Social  Security check or their economic stimulus check, or a farmer who has  not been able to get their emergency loan, or a small business tripped  up on some aspect of the Paycheck Protection Program--which by the way,  has been a bipartisan life-send by this body--to go person by person,  business by business, I am sure that many of us have adjusted to the  new reality of serving people where they are. And maybe in some small  way in the midst of this trauma and crisis, this is a silver lining of  returning back to, first, principles versus the abstract discussions  that can sometimes consume us, and the ruckus, fighting, and pushing  and shoving over things that never seem to come to any end.   But hanging a flag in front of a post office is important, because it  is who we are and what we ought to be. And I want to thank that  constituent for calling me. Of course, in a great Nebraska way, when I  told him we got it fixed, he said: Well, is it an all-weather flag? I  said: Sir, I don't know that. We did what we could.   Madam Speaker, I want to turn back to another set of issues that  actually happened before coronavirus hit our country and hit this body  as well. One of the most basic expectations of our government is the  health and well-being of our Nation. Three months ago, this week, in a  timely subcommittee hearing--I sit on the Appropriations Committee and  two subcommittees, on State and Foreign Operations, and I am the  ranking member of the Agriculture Subcommittee, and we have  jurisdiction over the Food and Drug Administration.   So in a timely subcommittee hearing, I asked the Inspector General of  the Department of Health and Human Services this question--it is a  simple question, it is just three words--are our drugs safe? Four  words. Are our drugs safe?   This raging coronavirus has drawn much attention to this much  overlooked problem. And in the name of global profiteering, what has  happened is that we have enabled a dangerous outsourcing of  pharmaceutical production to foreign countries. A significant portion  of that outsourcing is to the very origin of the place where  coronavirus came from, China.   Over 80 percent of active drug ingredients and 40 percent of finished  drugs on the American market, from ibuprofen to reduce your fever, to  antibiotics to treat infection, they are produced outside the United  States. Even if we vigilantly inspect our domestic manufacturing  processes, we cannot possibly get a handle on drug safety when our  drugs are sourced from over 150 countries, including a significant  portion from China.   The Department of Health and Human Services, HHS, has a daunting task  in managing the spending and performance of agencies that are so large  they can be bigger than some countries' GDP. And one of those agencies  is the Food and Drug Administration, the FDA.   There is an inherent and unfair duality, however, in how FDA's  foreign and domestic inspection regimes are carried out. FDA inspectors  routinely conduct surprise inspections in America to ensure that drug  companies are producing medicine in a clean, safe, and responsible  manner.   But when it comes to foreign inspections, the FDA customarily gives  companies advance notice, often as much as 12 weeks, enabling drug  suppliers plenty of time to clean up their acts. This is  counterproductive and it is wrong, and it creates an unlevel playing  field for companies trying to manufacture drugs right here in the  United States of America.   Compounding these problems, the FDA inspectors also face obstruction,  coercion, and deception in foreign countries. In one case, a Chinese  company reportedly imprisoned an inspector in a conference room for an  hour to force her to destroy the photographs that she took of its  facilities.  [[Page H2356]]    Madam Speaker, this inadequate monitoring of foreign production of  medicine, it really does have dire consequences. In 2008, a tainted  batch of the blood thinner, heparin, which is made in China, killed  over 100 people worldwide, including 81 in America. It led to this  drug's recall.   In August of 2018, the FDA issued an alert that a Chinese  manufacturer of a thyroid medicine was recalled due to inconsistent  quality. At this hearing that I am referencing with the Department of  Health and Human Service's Inspector General, I asked: Why has so much  of our drug production moved overseas? Why?   Now, of course, in asking that question, Madam Speaker, I basically  knew the answer, it has to do with capitalization on low wages, lax  safety, environmental and labor standards in those countries. But my  fuller intention in asking the question was to probe as to whether or  not we have inadvertently, in U.S. law and regulatory structure,  perversely encouraged offshoring.   These troubling dynamics take on a special urgency given the massive  spread of COVID-19. Several months ago, the FDA identified 20 drugs  that exclusively source their active pharmaceutical ingredients or  finished drug products from China. The agency then issued an alert that  at least one Chinese drugmaker had ceased production of a human drug  due to coronavirus infection at its manufacturing facilities. So drugs  with short expiration dates are particularly vulnerable to these  supply-chain disruptions. Another level of problem.   So solving these issues can become easier when we can fully identify  and inspect foreign sources of medicine. But with the bulk of our  foreign drug supply originating from a country that suppressed news  about the coronavirus origins, its severity, and its timing, and to  this day prevents the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from  fully accessing the actual virus, I am not optimistic that we will gain  better information.   I get it, Madam Speaker, it is convenient in this moment to point a  finger at China, but we have plenty to do in our House to restore some  order here. The Inspector General promised me an answer within 2 weeks  to my question. Do you remember what it was? Have we inadvertently  through our legal or regulatory structure perversely incentivized the  offshoring of drug production from America? The Inspector General  promised me an answer in 2 weeks. I have heard nothing yet.    The reality here is that we have to change how we do public policy in  our country, just like so many other processes--business and society  are shifting. Coronavirus has caused a tectonic plate shift. We are  seeing massive spikes in the use of digital technology, which has huge  implications for telemedicine, telework, and tele-education. In a bit  of a silver lining in this time of crisis and suffering, I am frankly  proud that this body has come together to protect healthcare, to  protect individuals and families, and to protect small businesses and  farmers.   Once our body itself recovers our rhythm and order here, there are  some particularly good places to start thinking about action around our  healthcare security.   So policy question one: How much of our drugs come from foreign  sources? To solve this, we should enhance the FDA's powers to track the  ingredients. We should require labeling as to where they come from.  And, third, increase reporting requirements for the pharmaceutical  companies themselves, particularly within the precursor ingredients.   Bottom line, we need clear answers about how we oversee the foreign  production of drugs and drug ingredients. We also need the right  incentives to ensure that U.S. companies will produce more and more  drugs and drug ingredients right here, here at home in America. It is  about healthcare security. If it is made in America, we will all feel  much better about knowing that it is safe.   But going beyond these policy considerations about our healthcare  security, Madam Speaker, I want to take a moment to possibly pull back  the curtain and read into what we are experiencing now, some future  trends. It is not to diminish in any way the trauma, disruption, and  suffering that has hit our country, but there are many open-ended  questions that we are facing now. And it might be helpful to look into  what some new realities are going to be in short order.   We have adopted masks and social distancing. We casually use terms  like ``herd immunity,'' ``flattening the curve,'' and ``community  spread.'' We have also accepted a world with less noise, less urgency,  but more intimate connection with those in our immediate orbit. We  wonder what we will encounter when the doors fully open once again and  we are uncaged to see the world through an entirely new lens.   So perhaps here is a little bit of a sneak peek. First, Madam  Speaker, our relationship with work has substantially changed. For  those fortunate to still have good employment, telework has arrived.  While many Main Street businesses are really hurting, many have also  transformed themselves into online, brick-and-mortar hybrids.   Like never before, people are ordering groceries online, medical  supplies, and other essentials through their phones for pick up and  delivery. Doctors are seeing patients remotely. And in a little-known  shift, we are actually reimbursing properly for telehealth. It is here  to stay, and it is going to make some huge advances in our well-being,  and perhaps save some funds.   School, of course, has temporarily centralized in the home,  reconnecting families in important, beautiful, exciting, if not  sometimes stressful ways. The handshake may be in decline, but the  elbow bump, thumbs-up, and head nod are, of course, enjoying a  renaissance.   As we extrapolate from these changes to a world in which we are  hopeful that better treatments are right around the corner, we are  seeing less dependence on automobiles, more connectedness to the  outdoors, an increase in victory gardens, and local foods. A nice side  effect, nature is recovering. The air is cleaner. Traffic is down.  Cities feel calmer. This reality presages the aligning preferences, and  this is a fascinating fact, the economic preference curves of the baby  boom generation and the millennial generation are aligning for livable,  walkable, nurturing communities.   But even while we consider the rosier side of this predicament, we  have urgent questions. When are we getting back to normal? When can we  hug those we love? When can we visit those incapable of visiting us?  What does normal even mean?   Madam Speaker, here is one aspect of what normal may look like. A new  intrusive reality, I have an acronym for it, I call it SSTT, screening,  sanitation, testing and testing.   So let's unpack this. SSTT is a suite of best practices that will  gradually enable the full reopening of our State in Nebraska, where I  live, and our country, while ensuring those who are vulnerable,  especially the elderly and those with underlying conditions, are fully  protected.   On screening, you will see more high-tech thermal scans when you  enter large public places. As we experienced after 9/11 with the  dramatically-enhanced security screening, your temperature will be  regularly taken.   As for the next S, sanitation. I found a new respect for medical  personnel who must wear these surgical masks hours on end through the  day. They are hot. They are bothersome, as I am sure you can attest,  Madam Speaker. But they are now part of the normalization of our own  personal protective equipment routines at retail establishments, at  work, and on public transportation. You are already seeing the sneeze  guards and other physical barriers at grocery store check-out stands.  Hand sanitizer sales are not declining any time soon, as the  surprisingly fragile COVID-19 is easily killed through basic hygiene  and surface disinfectants.                                time  1630    Social distancing is a subset of sanitation. Perhaps we should change  the name. Perhaps we should call it social respect because this is what  it means. It is an embrace of a necessary constraint out of concern for  the public good, and it also lessens our own individual vulnerability.   When combined with advancing our ability to work from home if sick,  these factors are certainly lessening the disease's impact, thankfully.   New configurations for workplace foot traffic and airflow will emerge  as  [[Page H2357]]  we embrace the need to consistently and vigilantly fight this virus.  Look for TSA-style COVID prechecks at airports, on trains, and at  hospitals. Watch for new office architecture: open floor concepts and  lunch buffets being out; plexiglass partitions, staggered desks, one- way walkways will be in. Zoom is the new communal coffee break. As  offensive as this seems, look for social distancing monitors on  elevators in large office buildings.   Again, the acronym is SSTT. The first ``T'' stands for testing. There  will be a dramatic increase in onsite work testing. Early diagnosis of  those who show symptoms or who have some reasonableness to think they  may have been exposed is one way to significantly reduce the spread of  the disease.   I have been very proud to continue to work with the University of  Nebraska Medical Center. During the Ebola epidemic, we worked with the  Obama administration to help the University of Nebraska Medical Center,  which has a long history in infectious disease and virology, to build  out containment facilities just in case Ebola would impact us  significantly in America.   You might recall, Madam Speaker, that the first coronavirus cases  that came off the cruise ship went immediately to Nebraska. Our  National Guard hosted people. Those who needed to be in isolation and  then those who needed to be quarantined who had the disease went to the  University of Nebraska. That is because we have led the country in  forward-thinking as to how to create the possibility of containment for  some type of pandemic.   We have a lot more to do, such as creating a surge hospital concept  for our military and our country at large. Nonetheless, in working with  the University of Nebraska Med Center, trying to think about how we  just don't sit back and let the sick come to us but that we go forward  and use institutions that have occupational health specialists and  larger capacities to become the center for controlling the diseases  themselves in a manner that parallels the necessary public health  response that is going on.   Again, sanitation and screening are part of that and onsite work  testing.   The second ``T'' though in the SSTT is for serological testing. This  test determines whether you have developed antibodies to the virus,  which are needed for immunity. As we are discovering, a number of  people who have had the disease don't have any symptoms. They didn't  know they had it. They could have antibodies, which will help them  fight the disease, should they be reexposed in the future. Said another  way, it means a person who has had the virus recovered, and it lessens  the possibility of reinfection for them.   Both types of testing will become widespread, faster, cheaper, and  ordinary--again, helping us control the spread.   As we work toward a vaccine or effective treatment to stop the  serious effects, this SSTT suite of approaches--again, the University  of Nebraska, I am proud of them for developing this and their outreach  to the community. It may not be a panacea, but it will give us the data  and confidence to more robustly and quickly open our economy and  gradually reduce the need for strict containment measures.   It is changing a bit now, Madam Speaker, but on an earlier trip to  D.C. for some votes we took several weeks ago in which we replenished  the funds for the highly successful Paycheck Protection Program--Madam  Speaker, if you don't mind, I am going to divert for a moment because I  am proud of my State.   Again, this was a bipartisan airlift, the Paycheck Protection  Program, to help small businesses maintain personnel on the payroll  while we tried to get in front of the disease spread, creating a one- two simultaneous step to protect our healthcare system and protect our  economic well-being. The Paycheck Protection Program was vital to this  effort, widely supported by many of us, as well as the replenishment.   Nebraska has a very robust community banking system. We worked very  aggressively with the small business associations and got the word out  so we, on a per capita basis, have the largest number of loans for the  Paycheck Protection Program, which, again, is so important to the well- being of our economic vitality as we fight our way through this virus.   The point being, though, I went to get on the airplane, and I stood  in Omaha Eppley Airfield and then later at Chicago O'Hare and witnessed  this eerie stillness around me: vacant terminals, closed businesses,  nearly empty planes, a science fiction movie come to life.   Madam Speaker, the Earth has really stood still for a moment, but  perhaps in this stillness, just perhaps, we have rediscovered some  important things, and we do see some trends that will mark a new way  forward.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
