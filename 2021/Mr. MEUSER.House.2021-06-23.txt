 Mr. Speaker, we are here with over 600,000 American  fatalities from the COVID virus.   Anyone who referred to the COVID virus as the China virus, or  originating in Wuhan, has been somewhat ridiculed along the way. Yet,  the evidence continues to mount that the origins of the virus were  certainly from Wuhan and very likely from the Wuhan virology lab.   Leader McCarthy recently put out eight pillars of action, an action  plan, for what we, in a bipartisan manner, as Americans, should  mandate, should require, should pursue.   The first, number one, is declassification of intelligence; bringing  transparency to U.S. intelligence about what China knew about the  virus, about its origins, and when they knew it.   Number two, prohibit the dangerous gain of function research in and  with China.   Number three, prohibition on the National Institutes of Health that  are funding adversarial foreign governments. We need to ensure American  tax dollars don't fund foreign governments intent on harming the U.S.  and our allies.   Number four, an overhaul of the World Health Organization and  counterintelligence investigation. Transparency and clear understanding  of the inner workings of the World Health Organization is what  Americans and the world are demanding.   Number five, utilizing existing authorities to perform investigations  and launch independent investigations of COVID's origins.   Number six, visa restrictions and sanctions on any agency or  individual who there is evidence to show was involved in any form of  coverup or misleading of the general public when it comes to COVID's  origins.   Number seven, yes, waive Chinese sovereign immunity; allow families  of COVID victims to sue China for any damages.   And, unless the above is met, we relocate the 2022 Olympics from  China. The world cannot gather in China for peaceful games when we have  strong evidence to believe that this virus originated in Wuhan and was  covered up.
