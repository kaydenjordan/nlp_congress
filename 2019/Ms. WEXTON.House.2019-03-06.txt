 Mr. Speaker, our democracy isn't working the way it  should for a majority of Americans, but H.R. 1, the For the People Act,  can fix that.   This legislation will end partisan gerrymandering by creating  independent redistricting commissions, letting the voters choose the  politicians, not the politicians choosing their voters.   H.R. 1 will promote online registration, same day and automatic voter  registration, because we should be making it easier, not harder, for  people to vote.   It also prohibits arbitrary voter roll purges, expands early voting  and vote-by-mail options, and ensures the restoration of voting rights  for those who have paid their dues to society.   The right to vote is the cornerstone of our democracy. It is as  sacred as the freedom of religion and speech.   The American people want clean and fair elections, and H.R. 1 is a  once-in-a-generation opportunity to restore the faith and function in  American democracy.                            ____________________
