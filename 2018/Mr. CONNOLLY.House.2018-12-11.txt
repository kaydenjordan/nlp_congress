 Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about a troubling  development, which is called voter suppression, and its use as a tool  in political combat today. President Trump wrote the playbook on sham  claims of voter fraud, and now, sadly, my friends on the other side of  the aisle are putting that playbook to use.   During the 2016 Presidential election, then candidate Trump warned  that the election would be rigged. Once in office, the President then  made unsubstantiated assertions that there were more than 3 million  illegal votes cast in the United States, just coincidentally the margin  of popular advantage his opponent, Hillary Clinton, had over him.   The President then established a so-called election integrity  commission that alleged substantial evidence of voter fraud, found  none, and had to be disbanded. That purportedly independent commission  was headed, by the way, by Kansas Secretary of State at the time Kris  Kobach, a known proponent of voter fraud conspiracy theories that then  justified voter suppression on a large scale.   The President used his bully pulpit to claim that midterm ballots  were massively infected and called for a halt to vote counts in legally  mandated recounts in Georgia and Florida.   Here is what is really going on. When an election is too close to  call, rather than encourage the democratic process to play out by  counting every vote, Republicans are flipping through Trump's voter  fraud playbook to sow distrust in democratic processes.  [[Page H10036]]    In Florida, for example, Republican Governor Rick Scott, now Senator- elect, undermined confidence in the State's own recount process by  making his own unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud and  filed lawsuits against and called for investigations into certain  Democratic-leaning counties.   In Georgia, Secretary of State Brian Kemp refused to step down from  his role overseeing his own election to be Governor of the State. Under  his management, more than a half a million people were purged from  voting rolls in July of 2017. That election was decided by just tens of  thousands of votes. It makes a difference.   In North Carolina's Ninth Congressional District today, the State  Elections Board is investigating whether a local GOP operative  illegally collected absentee ballots and altered votes or never  submitted them. It may yet lead to, frankly, the decertification of  that election and a new special election to be called.   In Wisconsin and Michigan, the GOP-controlled, lame duck State  legislatures have pushed through a series of measures that would strip  the incoming Democratic Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary of  State of key authorities and restrict access to early voting.   We have seen this before. It is part of a pattern, unfortunately, of  voter suppression: purging voter rolls; difficult voter I.D.  restrictions; eliminating early voting; outdated and insufficient  voting machines; and long lines, especially in minority precincts.   In 2016, North Carolina closed early voting stations and, just  coincidentally, reduced African American voting by 8.5 percent, clearly  a dispositive difference.   Republican governors like Governor Scott of Florida have exercised  their discretion to restore felon voting rights in as restrictive a  manner as possible. His predecessor, Governor Charlie Crist, now our  colleague, restored voting rights to 155,000 individuals in Florida in  4 years. Governor Scott averaged just 400 per year.   In Wisconsin, a strict voter I.D. law has been credited with  suppressing the vote of more than 200,000 Wisconsin voters who were  otherwise eligible to cast a ballot in 2016.   Could that have made a difference in the electoral vote of the State  of Wisconsin?                                time  1045    These tactics undermine democracy. They are not worthy of the party  of Lincoln, and they further erode America's trust in government.   I implore my friends on the other side of the aisle: Let's win fair  or square. Let's make sure every American's vote is counted and is  treated as sacred. America will be the stronger for it.
