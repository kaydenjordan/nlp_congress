 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  career and retirement of Rev. William Willoughby III of St. Paul's  Episcopal Church in Savannah, Georgia.   William has led the St. Paul's Episcopal Church since 1987. He is a  graduate of the University of Chicago. He received his master's in  divinity from Nashotah House Theological Seminary in Wisconsin.   As well as being the reverend at St. Paul's, Reverend Willoughby  created the St. Paul's Development Corporation which provides low- income housing to Savannah residents.   The reverend also serves as the district chaplain for the Coastal  Empire Council of the Boy Scouts of America and as a commissioner with  the Chatham County Department of Family and Children Services.   Although he is retiring from St. Paul's, I am happy to hear that he  will continue serving the community and the Episcopal Church in his  retirement.   Madam Speaker, I hope Reverend Willoughby enjoys his African safari.  It is certainly well deserved. The people of Savannah thank him for his  service to our community.                            ____________________
