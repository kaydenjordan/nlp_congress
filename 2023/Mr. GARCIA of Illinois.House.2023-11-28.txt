 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Libreria  Giron, a family-run Spanish language bookstore in my district that will  be closing its doors after 50 years.   At a time when Spanish language books were hard to find in Chicago,  Ada Alicia Giron, a former elementary school teacher from Guatemala,  and her husband, Julio Giron, opened an electronic shop in 1957.   An educator at heart, Alicia Giron placed a stack of Spanish language  books in the shop next to televisions and radios, and to her surprise  became the shop's main selling point.   Libreria Giron went on to become a beacon of knowledge to immigrant  communities and at its peak expanded to 10 locations in Chicago.   As Libreria Giron prepares to close its doors for good, I would like  to thank the Giron family for their service to the Little Village and  Pilsen communities and for fostering a love of books spanning  generations.                            ____________________
