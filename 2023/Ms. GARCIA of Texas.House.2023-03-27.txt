 Mr. Speaker, I was hopeful that this Congress  would be able to work together on bipartisan permitting reform.  Unfortunately, it looks like extreme MAGA Republicans are hijacking  H.R. 1 to put polluters over people. They seek to silence the voice of  the community while doing little to nothing to lower energy costs.   Climate change is real. We need more American energy production  across the board. Oil and gas workers in my district know that energy  jobs can mean a real shot at the American Dream for working families.   This extreme MAGA proposal won't create all the energy jobs we must  to remain globally competitive, but it does do this: It increases the  deficit by $2.4 billion.   We shouldn't have to choose between dirty air and polluted water just  to meet the energy needs of the future. H.R. 1 picks winners and  losers. The wealthy and well-connected win; workers lose.   I believe in workers. House Democrats will continue to lower energy  costs for everyone and give future generations a cleaner, healthier  environment because we put people over polluters.                            ____________________
