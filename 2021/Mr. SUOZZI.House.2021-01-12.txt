 Mr. Speaker, I support invoking the 25th Amendment to  remove President Trump from office.   Former Congressman Tom Lantos, a Holocaust survivor, would often say  the veneer of civilization is paper-thin. We are its guardians, and we  cannot rest.   I was sitting right there on Wednesday when they told us to take out  our gas masks because the rioters had breached the Capitol.   I was standing right over there as the Capitol Police locked and  barricaded the Chamber doors. I heard what I thought were gunshots as  the rioters broke the windows in the main Chamber door with a metal  pipe.   I was standing right over there when the woman was shot outside the  Speaker's lobby, and the police radios rang out: ``Shots fired in the  Capitol. Shots fired in the Capitol. Everyone down.''   The veneer of civilization is paper-thin.   Thousands of people, criminals, desecrated our Capitol, breaking  windows and doors, attacking our brave officers, and vandalizing  offices. Rioters, wearing Army fatigues with Confederate and Trump  flags, donned Nazi swastikas. That and I saw one man who wore a shirt  saying: ``Camp Auschwitz Staff.''   Our President instigated this. The President's duty is to protect our  Republic and its people. He built a mob, filled it with lies, and  encouraged its fight to stop the steal. Now, we hear intelligence  reports that thousands of armed militias and white supremacists are  planning to come again on or before January 20.   My colleagues, my friends on the other side of the aisle, we must  together call upon the President to denounce this violence, to tell his  supporters to stay home.   Mr. President, you must please put America first. You must call off  this attack. And if not, you must be removed.
