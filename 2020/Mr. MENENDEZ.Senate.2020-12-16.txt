 Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, let me  thank Senator Grassley for his work on this issue, and I agree with him  that our current foreign regime is in need of updating. I look forward  to working with him and Senator Cornyn and with Senators Whitehouse and  Shaheen, who both came to speak to me about this, as well as with  Chairman Risch and the cosponsors of this legislation, on engaging in a  comprehensive effort to do just that.   FARA, the Foreign Agents Registration Act, is perhaps the most  critical tool we have for shining a light on foreign influence efforts  in the United States. Its aim is to ensure that the public knows the  source of foreign-directed efforts that are intended to influence  American public opinion, policy, and laws.   I agree with the Senator that the past few years have demonstrated  that changes are sorely needed to FARA, but they also demonstrate that  the statute may need more than a few tweaks.   And before we have determined exactly what the most needed reforms  are, it seems shortsighted to provide additional enforcement tools  before we have figured out what that regime should look like.   Indeed, adopting ad hoc changes rather than looking at more  comprehensive reform could actually create more problems down the road.  Many have noted that FARA's definitions and requirements are broad and  sow confusion over exactly when and under what circumstances an  individual must register and report covered activities. There is no  denying the nature of lobbying, influence efforts, and communication  methods have dramatically changed since FARA was enacted in 1938 or  even revised in 1966.   We live in a dramatically more interconnected and complex world  today. Foreign influence efforts and disinformation have made their way  into the top echelons of U.S. Government and this very body. It seems  only prudent that we step back and examine whether there are blind  spots in the current FARA regime.   There are a number of bills pending in both the House and the Senate  that propose reforms to FARA. Some propose a new unit altogether for  reviewing and enforcing FARA violations. Others propose additional  disclosure and registration requirements, significant changes to the  current FARA exemptions, or more electronic reporting. Yet none of  those have been given thorough or, indeed, any consideration by the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the committee of jurisdiction.   There are also a number of concerns about the current FARA regime, as  well as how it has been applied, that deserve consideration. Some  nonprofit organizations, for example, have raised serious concerns  about how FARA could be applied to them and are seeking additional  changes to this bill to ensure it is not weaponized.   And as other countries, such as Russia and Hungary, adopt their own  versions of FARA laws and look to use them to crack down on civil  society groups and nonprofits, we should be especially concerned about  the signal that any potential weaponizing of FARA sends.   The past few years have shown how critical it is that we not adopt a  patchwork approach but that we get it right.   The disturbing rise of foreign influence campaigns that use a variety  of measures to mask who is the ultimate source or beneficiary should  serve as an alarm bell for all of us. So before this body passes any  tweaks or new tools and adds to the current patchwork of FARA  regulations and exemptions, I think we should take a step back and take  a comprehensive look, and we have not done that.  [[Page S7520]]    So, respectfully, these changes should not pass this body without  careful consideration by the committee of jurisdiction. A committee  markup is the appropriate vehicle for considering such changes to  assess the ramifications of the changes in this bill and to see if  other changes are warranted.   I stand ready and willing to work with Chairman Risch, Senator  Grassley, and other colleagues to make any needed changes to FARA, but  because of all of these concerns that I have, I would object today to  passing this bill out of the Senate without first giving the committee  the opportunity to consider it and other potential reforms.   I urge my colleagues to give us the opportunity to work through this  together and ensure the Foreign Assets Registration Act is fit for the  21st century. And because of that, I do object.    Madam President, I come to the floor today and will  soon ask unanimous consent for the passage of the Daniel Anderl  Judicial Security and Privacy Act of 2020. This legislation is about  standing up for the independence of our Federal judiciary and the  safety of all of those who serve it.   Many of you already know the terrible tragedy that recently struck  Federal District Judge Esther Salas and her family in New Jersey. This  summer, an unhinged and violent individual showed up at Judge Salas's  home, impersonating a package delivery driver. When her 20-year-old son  Daniel Anderl answered the door, the assailant opened fire, taking the  life of her only child and seriously wounding her husband Mark Anderl.   Unfortunately, this tragedy is not the first attack on a Federal  judge. There was the 1979 murder of Judge John Wood in San Antonio, TX;  the 1988 murder of Judge Richard Daronco in Pelham, NY; the 1989 murder  of Judge Robert Vance in Mountain Brook, AL; the 2005 murder of the  husband and mother of Judge Joan Lefkow in Illinois.   And there have been other attacks as well. In June, 2013, Chief Judge  Timothy Corrigan was targeted by a gunman who purchased the address of  his Florida home on the internet for a mere $1.95--$1.95. The gunshot  missed his ear by less than 2 inches.   Just last month, a judge's address was circulated on social media,  urging people to gather outside his home while the judge was hearing a  high-profile case.   According to the U.S. Marshals Service, threats against Federal  judges rose by 500 percent between fiscal years 2015 and 2019. This  trend should worry all of us who care about our Constitution. An  independent judiciary in which judges can render decisions without fear  of retribution and violence is essential to the integrity of our  democracy.   Indeed, the idea that any judge at any level of government could be  intimidated undermines the very concept of the rule of law. We expect  all Americans to have respect for the rule of law, even when they  disagree with the outcome of a case or a particular ruling.  Unfortunately, that is not always the case.   Some individuals delude themselves into believing that violence is  the answer. We may not be able to eliminate hatred from someone's  heart, but what we can do is make sure that the men and women who serve  on our Federal bench do not make for such easy targets. That is why,  after Daniel's murder, I made a personal commitment to Judge Salas. I  told her that I would develop legislation, along with my colleague  Senator Booker, to better protect the men and women who sit on our  Federal judiciary, to ensure their independence in the face of  increased personal threats on judges, and to help prevent this  unthinkable tragedy--unthinkable tragedy--from ever happening again to  anyone else.   The Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy Act of 2020 is a  bipartisan, bicameral, and commonsense plan to safeguard the personal  information of Federal judges and their families. And I want to thank  my colleague Senator Booker, who has been there every step of the way,  a member of the Judiciary, and Chairman Graham--Senator Lindsey  Graham--for leading this effort with me.   Our legislation makes it unlawful for data brokers to knowingly sell,  trade, license, purchase, or otherwise provide personally identifiable  information of a Federal judge or their family.   Since its introduction, we have worked with several stakeholders,  including the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the U.S.  Marshals Office, the American Civil Liberties Union, among others.  Together, we carefully updated legislative language in order to uphold  the First Amendment right of the press to report on matters of public  concern and balance that right with our urgent need to better protect  the safety of Federal judges and their families.   Federal judges and their families will continue to be able to seek  relief through the courts for the knowing and willful publication of  their personal information, and the party responsible for the violation  will have to pay the cost and reasonable attorney's fees.   The bill enjoys widespread support among judicial and attorney  organizations, including the National Association of Attorneys General,  the National Judicial Conference, the Federal Judges Association, the  National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges, the American Bar Association,  the National Hispanic Bar Association, the National Bar Association,  and several others.   America's Federal judges must be able to render rulings without  fearing for their lives or the lives of their loved ones. We must  better protect Federal judges' personal information from those who  would seek to do them harm. That is exactly what the Daniel Anderl  Judicial Security and Privacy Act of 2020 will do. This legislation  will not bring Judge Salas's son back. But we must ensure, as Judge  Salas said, that his death not be in vain.   As she recently wrote in the New York Times, ``Daniel's death is  speaking to us, but will we listen? For the sake of my brothers and  sisters on the bench, Congress must act now. Every day that goes by  without action leaves our federal judges, our justice system and our  very democracy in danger.''   We must protect the independence of our courts, the safety of our  judges, and prevent this sort of tragedy from ever happening again.  This is a commonsense bill. It will save lives, and I urge my  colleagues to approve it without delay.   Before I ask for consent, I want to turn to my distinguished  colleague, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Cory Booker.    Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee be discharged from  further consideration of S. 4711 and the Senate  [[Page S7526]]  proceed to its immediate consideration; further that the Menendez  substitute amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to; that the  bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; and that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Reserving the right to object to the modification, I  appreciate the Senator's concern to expand the universe of people  covered by this bill, including Members of Congress. While that is a  laudable goal, I personally think it would be more appropriate to  legislate that in another bill.   This bill is for the Federal judiciary because of the special threats  they face and the importance of ensuring their independence in terms of  being able to make judgments based on the law and the facts, not upon  some fear that lurks outside of their home or outside of their  chambers.   I also understand that the amendment would strip out--and if I am  wrong, I would be happy to be corrected--would strip out the ability to  seek redressing the court as it relates to the provision that we  provide for judges. Without a threat of some damages, there is little  incentive for a data broker to remove the personal identifiable  information of a judge and his or her family. This is not about  frivolous suits. This is about protecting the Federal judiciary.   In addition to that, we had made several good-faith efforts before we  got to this point to address the concerns of my colleagues across the  aisle. We actually had the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts  engage in conversations directly with our colleagues.   My colleagues had concerns about a new grant program to States. Well,  we changed that language to a report. Senator Lee was part of those  concerns. To better understand the proper Federal role, we changed it  to a report.   They don't want to deal with some of the questions that we had for  the U.S. marshals. Again, this is about protecting the Federal  judiciary. Guess what branch protects the Federal judiciary. The U.S.  marshals. We changed that.   It never seems to be enough. It never seems to be enough. It is  unfortunate that the Federal judiciary will pay the price of this  recalcitrance, but I cannot, at this time, agree to the modification.  Therefore, I object to it.    Madam President, I just say to my colleague that I  certainly am concerned about his safety and security and, for that  fact, the safety and security of all of our colleagues. I appreciate  his concern and understand it and look forward to working with him on  that.   I will say that the other elements that Senator Lee had incorporated  into his amendment just renders the security--whether for a Member of  Congress or for the judiciary--useless, in which case, I don't want to  give false security to anybody that they are being protected if, in  fact, they don't have the wherewithal to do so.   I look forward to that opportunity.   I promised Judge Salas that her son's death will not be in vain. We  may not have achieved this tonight with Senator Booker, but we are  going to make this happen, hopefully, sooner rather than later. But we  will make this happen.  [[Page S7527]]    I yield the floor    Mr. President, I rise to call attention to the rapidly  burgeoning Islamist insurgency in northern Mozambique, which is  dragging that country into ever-increasing violence and chaos. In the  past decade, Mozambique has taken steps to resolve a decades-long civil  war and while peace remains elusive, with longstanding support from the  United States, there has been progress. This progress, when coupled  with the 2010 discovery of enormous natural gas reserves in the remote  northern province of Cabo Delgado, could have changed the development  course of the country. But a new conflict has emerged in Mozambique  that threatens all of the potential gains for the citizens of the  province and the entire country.   The origins of this extremist insurgency share traits with many  others globally: a marginalized community's grievance against corrupt  and distant rulers, fueled and brutally exploited by radical Islamist  ideologues, has allowed extremism to take root and gain traction, while  the innocent majority of the local population bears the cost. The  extremists have proclaimed allegiance to ISIS and have rapidly  developed increasingly sophisticated military capabilities;  Mozambique's poorly trained security forces have proven unable to  vanquish the group. It is an insurgency on the advance. It has seized  seizing entire towns and now controls considerable territory.   The insurgents, who have attracted foreign fighters and recently  launched attacks into neighboring Tanzania, have used horrific acts of  terror--including systematic use of arson, murder, often including  beheadings, and kidnapping--to force compliance with their aims. Their  acts have effectively displaced more than 500,000 people in Cabo  Delgado, creating a severe humanitarian crises. In 1 week in November  alone, more than 10,000 people fled to the port city of Pemba, many in  rickety, unsafe boats. A significant of these internally displaced  persons now languish in crowded, unsanitary conditions.   What can be done to solve this crisis? And what should be the role of  the United States, which today appears to be retreating from Africa?  This year has perhaps taught us more than any in recent memory that  stability and security around the world can directly impact the  stability and security of the United States. We have a sustained  interest in helping to support innocent, suffering people and promoting  stability.   The security aspect of the threat requires a security solution.  However, the Mozambican security forces have demonstrated that they  cannot effectively respond to this threat without assistance. It is  clear that they lack proper training and equipment, and a substantial  body of reporting has established that elements of these forces have  frequently committed serious human rights abuses, as well as engaged in  petty corruption targeting the local impoverished population. The  Mozambican Government must take steps to ensure that state security  forces are not only effective, but that they also engage in such a  manner that earns the trust of the population they are charged with  protecting   The good news is that the international community has begun to  respond. The U.S.'s counterterrorism coordinator recently visited  Maputo to offer our assistance to the government. European countries  have also pledged to assist with building Mozambique's security  capacities. Any such counterterrorism support must include rigorous  human rights training, as well as improvements in civil-military  relations and effective intelligence-gathering. The government should  also be pressed to reduce its reliance on local militias, who have even  less training and accountability than government troops.   The humanitarian crisis also demands immediate action. Of the half  million people who have been displaced, 41 percent are children. The  provinces of northern Mozambique that host most of these newly  displaced people are among the poorest in one of the world's least- developed countries and have little capacity to assist those affected  by the crisis. In total, more than 1.3 million people in northern  Mozambique are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance and  protection, according to the U.N. The international community must step  up and fully fund  [[Page S7535]]  the modest request of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of  Humanitarian Affairs, which has said that it requires $254 million to  provide humanitarian assistance through 2021.   Counterterrorism training and humanitarian assistance alone, however,  are not enough to defeat ISIS in Mozambique. They are only tools to  respond to the immediate crisis. To effectively address the root causes  of the conflict--the social and economic inequalities that have allowed  extremism to take hold and flourish--the Mozambican Government and  international partners must assist in reaching the country's  increasingly-alienated northern communities. The government must engage  with its northern citizens and deliver what the majority of the  population wants and expects: better governance and critical social  services. The international community can help by collaborating and  coordinating their engagement with the government on a package of  development aid that helps to address poor governance, increases  transparency and fights corruption, effectively delivers health and  education services, and fosters job opportunities and local  entrepreneurship. Mozambique and its international partners also must  scale up programs aimed at countering extremist ideology and promoting  defections from the insurgency.   Donors must also hold the government's feet to the fire on its  obligation to invest it its own citizenry, including by insisting that  the government develop its natural resources--notably the gas reserves  in Cabo Delgado--in an equitable, transparent, manner that results in  that a significant portion of prospective natural gas revenues being  invested in the provinces that host Mozambique's gas resources.   As the conflict grows in scope and intensity, the United States will  need to further develop a coordinated, interagency strategy, one which  uses all the levers of American power--diplomatic, development, and  defense--to address Cabo Delgado's military, humanitarian, and  development crisis and to work with regional partners on to both inform  and implement such a strategy.   The situation in Mozambique is dire, and unfortunately it has not  attracted an appropriate level of attention from policymakers. It is  tragic to see a country that seemed to be on the cusp of transformation  dragged back into conflict. The situation is not hopeless. The United  States and its partners can together effectively help Mozambique defeat  this insurgency and support the Mozambican people's aspirations for a  more hopeful future, but the situation is urgent. We must act now.                            ____________________
