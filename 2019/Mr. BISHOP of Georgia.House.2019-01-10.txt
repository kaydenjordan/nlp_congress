 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution  28, I call up the bill (H.R. 265) making appropriations for  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30,  2019, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, today marks the 20th day of the partial government  shutdown. Each day pushes many of our government's vital services to  the breaking point, further jeopardizing the 800,000 Federal employees  who are furloughed and the countless other Americans feeling the  shutdown's impact.   The Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies Appropriations Act is a critically important piece of  legislation for our Nation. From the food we eat to the medications we  depend on, this bill touches the lives of every American.  [[Page H389]]    It must be passed now, and the furloughed employees at these vital  Federal agencies, our farmers, our agribusinesses, and the other  Americans who are depending on their livelihoods must be brought back  to work.   Because of the shutdown, USDA has stopped making loans and grants for  rural development programs such as housing, water and wastewater  facilities, and community facilities. New grants to our universities  for agriculture research can't be made.   Across the Nation, Farm Service Agency county offices have been  closed since December 28. Farmers applying for relief from retaliatory  tariffs are in limbo, waiting for the shutdown to end. Nearly 33,000  USDA employees who are funded by this bill are currently furloughed.   At the Food and Drug Administration, more than 10,000 employees are  working without pay, while another 7,000 have been furloughed, which is  impacting everything from user fee collections to the reduction of food  safety inspections, jeopardizing the food we eat. According to USDA,  nearly 9,000 people are working without pay to inspect our meat,  poultry, and egg products.   This bill would fund the Food Safety and Inspection Service at over  $1 billion and restore our safety.   I will be the first person to admit that this bill is not perfect,  but no bill ever is. However, this is about opening the government and  putting it back to work for the American people.   This bill has passed the Senate by a vote of 92-6. There is no reason  why we should not pass this bill since it has already been adopted by  the leadership of the Senate and the Members of the Senate  overwhelmingly, so that we can put American workers back on the job.   Specifically, this legislation provides over $23 billion in  discretionary funding for USDA and FDA. That is $225 million above the  2018 enacted level.   It provides $2.73 billion for agriculture research conducted by the  Agricultural Research Service and NIFA, an increase of $114 million  from fiscal year 2018. These increases will help to ensure American  agriculture remains competitive with other nations.   The Farm Service Agency, whose county offices were shuttered on  December 28, is funded at $1.6 billion. In my district, all the county  offices are now closed. These offices are the primary line of  communication for our farmers and our ranchers, providing critical  data, processing loans, and answering questions. Without this  assistance and information, they are left in the dark when it comes to  planning for next year's harvest.   Peanut sellers and cotton growers, who suffered from Hurricane  Michael recently, are at a loss. They have product that is stored in  warehouses that they need to sell in order to get income, but they  can't get those sales accomplished without an okay from the Farm  Service Agency. Those offices are closed. Nobody is there.   This legislation also makes significant investments in rural  development by providing $3.8 billion. It takes a balanced approach  with investments in water and wastewater facilities, broadband,  housing, and rural businesses.   Again, right now, as a result of the shutdown, loans and grants that  help small towns and rural communities all across the country are not  being made.   This legislation rejects the President's proposed elimination of the  Food for Peace program and instead funds it at $1.716 billion, which is  $216 million above the House bill. The McGovern-Dole program, which was  also proposed for elimination by the President, is funded at $210  million, slightly above the House level. I might note that the House  funded both of these, contrary to the President's wishes.    Finally, this legislation funds the Food and Drug Administration at  $2.97 billion, which is $159 million above the fiscal year 2018 enacted  level, a 6 percent increase.   I would also like to point out that this bill does better than the  House in addressing the opioid crisis that is hitting every single  district in the country.   It also provides more funding for food safety than the House bill.   After nearly 3 weeks of uncertainty, it looks like the nearly 40  million people who are receiving Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program benefits will be able to keep their benefits at least through  February. However, the funds for SNAP beneficiaries, for a single  mother or a small shopkeeper, will run dry in March.   This bill, which provides $73.2 billion in mandatory funding for  SNAP, will end any doubt about this, and it will give these recipients  the peace of mind that they deserve.   Through a diverse urban-rural coalition, this legislation includes  our farmer safety net, our food and nutrition programs.   Families, farmers, ranchers, and producers go to work every morning;  so should their government.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey), who is the first female chair  of the United States House Committee on Appropriations.    Madam Speaker, I am delighted to yield 2  minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), a member of  the Committee on Appropriations and chair of the Subcommittee on Labor,  Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, and is the  former chair of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee of Appropriations.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Let me just say that, as we said before, this bill is not perfect,  but we should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Chief among  the funding in this bill is funding that is included to combat one of  the biggest public health risks today which is opioids. The bill  provides strong support for the FDA to combat this opioid epidemic.   In addition to funds provided last year, it provides $59 million to  continue the activities involved in inspecting, investigating, and  screening of opioids. As the agency that oversees these drugs, the FDA  has a vital responsibility, I agree, to make sure that the public  health impacts of opioid abuse is mitigated, but this funding is just  one part of a broad strategy to address opioids.   The committee strongly supports the FDA's role in intergovernmental  efforts to confront the crisis, but since we must move forward and open  the government, we urge adoption of this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lee), a member of the Committee on Appropriations, co-chair of the  House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee, and a long-time  advocate for the elimination of persistent poverty in America and  across the world.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   It has been said many times that we shouldn't pass this bill which  has previously been adopted by the Senate because the President will  not sign it.   Well, I believe that we have three branches of government, and it is  our obligation as the legislative branch to pass the laws. If we do our  job, then we will let the President be held responsible for his failure  to do his. We must keep this government open for the American people.  [[Page H392]]    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms.  Pingree), a member of the Committee on Appropriations and a member of  the Subcommittee for Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, at this point I would just like to say that it is  unconscionable that we will hold the American people hostage in denying  them the services and the protections of their government, the much- needed paychecks for the workers employed by these agencies, simply to  satisfy the ego of someone at the end of Pennsylvania Avenue.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Pallone), who is the chairman of the authorizing Committee on  Energy and Commerce.                                time  1315     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume to just say that the gentleman from Washington makes some  salient points. I agree with the gentleman that the Freedom of  Information Act and the SNAP retail sales language is something that we  would love to have and should be in this legislation.   Also, I look forward to working with the gentleman to take care of  that as we move forward in the 116th Congress, as well as our work on  the H-2A program, which is in bad need of repair. And persistent  poverty, the 10-20-30 program, we are happy that the gentleman is  supportive and that the committee has been supportive. We look forward  to making sure that that is implemented fully as we move forward.   But, right now, we have to open the government. We cannot afford to  let this government remain closed to continue to hurt the American  people.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Scott), who is my classmate and the chair of the Committee on Education  and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Costa), who is a member of the  authorizing House Committee on Agriculture. He represents an area in  California that is called the salad bowl of our country.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from  California an additional 20 seconds.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time  remains.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), who is a member of the House  Committee on Ways and Means and who is also the chief deputy whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the chair-designate  of Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Panetta), as I prepare to  close and urge my colleagues to open the Department of Agriculture, the  Food and Drug Administration, and all the agencies. He is a member of  the House Committee on Agriculture and Committee on Ways and Means. He  also represents the salad bowl of this country.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order on the  gentleman's motion.    Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a  point of order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  motion to recommit.    Mr. Speaker, as many know, I have been and  will continue to be an advocate and a supporter of rural broadband  expansion. I view it as an obligation to provide adequate service for  everyone, as it is vital to health, safety, the economy, and the  welfare of all of our rural communities.   The $425 million that is provided in this bill will complement the  $600 million that was provided in the FY 2018 bill, which has not yet  been spent.   USDA recently completed the program design, and it can now begin  implementing and, if this bill is enacted, awarding over $1 billion in  broadband expansion funding to the communities that need it the most.   This funding is in addition to the other programs that assist  communities in getting broadband services, including the Community  Connect Program, the Broadband Loan Program, and the Distance Learning  and Telecommunication Program.   We have funding in the works to accomplish the needs for rural  broadband. We need to pass this bill because we need to open the  government. We need to make sure that USDA and the Food and Drug  Administration and all of the agencies that are shut down will open,  and open quickly, to support the needs of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge that this motion to recommit be rejected, and I  yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H398]]     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  FY19 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related  Agencies Appropriations Act. This bill protects American families from  being kicked out into the street in the dead of winter, ensures the  safety of our skies, and quite literally, keeps our country moving.   This bill pays our hardworking air traffic controllers and reopens  our air traffic training facilities. It allows our highway safety  agencies to get back to work, including the National Highway Traffic  Safety Administration, which investigates automotive defects and  formulates automotive safety standards.   This bill ensures the National Transportation Safety Board can  continue its investigations into deadly road, rail, marine, and  aviation accidents, as well as its issuance of safety recommendations  that drive policy changes that save thousands of lives.   This bill also reopens HUD, ensuring families aren't evicted due to  this unnecessary shutdown. It enables FHA loans to be processed for  prospective homebuyers across the nation, and it protects renters who  rely on HUD inspectors to ensure safe and sanitary housing.   Finally, it allows the FAA to resume its issuance of aviator and  engineer certifications, as well as its development and testing of next  generation safety technologies.   Without these vital functions, our economy will be dragged to a halt,  and American families will be left in the cold. I will be voting yes on  this bill, and I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will do  the same.
