 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to thank the men and  women who work every day to keep our communities safe and to honor  those  [[Page H2356]]  who have given their lives in service to our communities.   As the daughter of a retired career law enforcement officer and as a  former Federal agent, I know the responsibilities, the pressure, and  the stress that can come with putting on the badge.   I stand here today during this National Police Week to honor  Virginia's Seventh District and the officers who call it home.   Across our Commonwealth, we reflect on the service and the sacrifice  of our community's law enforcement officers. As the Representative for  Virginia's Seventh District, it is my great privilege to represent so  many public servants: the men and women who have answered the call to  serve their fellow Americans, their neighbors, and our communities.   This week and every day, we remember their colleagues and friends-- those who never returned home. In their absence, our communities, our  Commonwealth, and our country have felt tremendous loss.   Today, on the floor of the United States House of Representatives, I  am honored to read the names of fallen officers from Virginia's Seventh  District. May they never be forgotten and may their service and their  sacrifice inspire their fellow law enforcement officers to continue to  serve and protect.   From the Prince William County Police Department: Police Officer  Ashley Marie Guindon, Police Officer Chris Yung, Police Officer Philip  Michael ``Mike'' Pennington, and Police Officer Paul Thomas ``Pete''  White, Jr.   From the Prince William County Sheriff's Office: Deputy Sheriff David  William Myers, Jr.   From the Stafford County Sheriff's Office:   Deputy Sheriff Jason Edward Mooney and Deputy Sheriff Ford T.  Humphrey.   From the Fredericksburg Police Department:   Police Officer Todd Allen Bahr, Officer William Franklin Mines,  Sergeant Roy Glen Wright, and Officer Ellsworth Alexander Moore.   From the Culpeper County Sheriff's Office: Captain James Anthony Sisk  and Deputy Sheriff George Robert Lillard, Jr.   From the King George County Sheriff's Office: Deputy Sheriff Craig  Lamont Brooks.   From the Caroline County Sheriff's Office: Deputy Sheriff Strother W.  ``Ted'' Lewis, Sr.   From the Greene County Sheriff's Office: Investigator Chadwick Alan  Carr and Sergeant Rodney Lee Davis.   From the Orange County Sheriff's Office: Sheriff William B.  ``Willie'' Young and Sheriff Willie C. Bond.   From the Spotsylvania County Sheriff's Office: Deputy Sheriff Bryan  Marshall Berger, Deputy Sheriff Dean Ridings, and Detective Richard Lee  Samuels.   This week, we remember these officers, these Virginians, and these  heroes. They are someone's loved one, fathers, mothers, sisters,  brothers, children. Their names are not only remembered here in the  U.S. Capitol and throughout the Halls of Congress, but their sacrifices  are honored throughout the Commonwealth of Virginia.   These officers were dedicated public servants. They were valued loved  ones across our communities, and they represented the best of Virginia.   Mr. Speaker, during National Police Week, I thank the public servants  who protect the U.S. Capitol every single day, those who stand watch  over the very function of our democracy.    I know I stand with my colleagues expressing gratitude and  appreciation for the U.S. Capitol Police.   On January 6, 2012, their heroism alongside that of the Metropolitan  Police Department protected Members of Congress, Capitol employees,  staff, and our very democracy. More than 150 police officers were  injured that day, and yet they still stand strong, committed to their  duty.   As the Representative for Virginia's Seventh District, I am proud to  represent many of the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police in  Congress, and I am committed to making sure that they have the  resources, support, financial security, and retirements they deserve  and have earned through their selfless sacrifice.   It is the least we can do in return for their professionalism, their  fervent commitment to duty, their devotion to our country, and their  work every day in the Halls of Congress.                            ____________________
