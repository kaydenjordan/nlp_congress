 Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy) for the purpose of asking the majority leader  the schedule for the week to come, I want to just make a comment.   Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, this House and, indeed, the Nation was shaken  by the horrific shooting in Alexandria. We just, unanimously, passed  the majority leader's resolution. All of us are praying for the safe  recovery of our friend and colleague Majority Whip Steve Scalise and  others who were injured yesterday.   Steve is the majority whip and I am the minority whip, and we are,  therefore, in some respects, adversaries, but we are also friends. I am  keeping him, his wife, Jennifer, and their children in my thoughts  today.   Mr. Speaker, as you probably know, Steve loves baseball. All of us  have seen the broad smile on his face as he has taken to the field as a  pinch runner in games past, wearing his University of Louisiana Ragin'  Cajun jersey and scoring runs for his Republican team.   I am saddened--and I know all of us are--that we won't be able to see  him on the field today running, hitting, and scoring; but, Mr. Speaker,  we know that Steve is a fighter, and I am sure we will be seeing him  running the bases again in next year's Congressional Baseball Game.   Mr. Speaker, tonight, I am going to wear a T-shirt that says ``Team  Scalise.'' His staff gave it to me yesterday. We took some pizza by  their office and talked to each one of them. We have had good relations  between our two offices. We have worked together on a lot of things  and, yes, we have opposed from time to time, but we are friends.   I am also keeping in my thoughts the members of the Capitol Police,  who keep us all safe. I am one of those who is blessed to have a detail  because I am one of the leaders. Members of the Capitol Police are  assigned specifically to try to make sure that I am safe--and, yes,  those around me--as Steve's detail did yesterday, courageously and  heroically.   I know the majority leader shares my view that every day that a  member of the Capitol Police gets out of bed, puts  [[Page H4932]]  a badge in their wallet or on their chest, a gun on their hip, and  leaves their home, they do so with a commitment to protect this  institution, its Members, and, yes, the public who visit their House,  their Senate, their Congress. We cannot say enough about our Capitol  Police. They are extraordinarily well trained, but, also, they are  extraordinarily courageous and committed to serving this institution,  its Members, and our country.   We are, of course, thankful for the courage and quick response of  those officers who were at the ball field yesterday, and we pray for  their full and speedy recovery. And we do the same for the staffer and  the former staffer who were also injured in that attack.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy), my friend, with whom I also have worked in a constructive  way on so many occasions for the country.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his information.   Mr. Speaker, it is a time for us to be together, to be united as  Americans, not as Republicans or Democrats, Liberals or Conservatives,  and I thank the majority leader for his leadership in that effort and  in remembering Officers Griner and Bailey and Cabrera, and all of their  colleagues in the Capitol Police, and with our prayers for Steve  Scalise and the others who have been injured. I thank the majority  leader, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I want to join my friend who has been such a  great leader in dealing with those who have associations with our  country but are not States. I join with his remarks.   The Puerto Rican election that was held overwhelmingly voted for  statehood as the option of governance they wanted to pursue. It is now,  it seems to me, the responsibility of the United States Congress and  the administration to recognize the overwhelming sentiment of the  Puerto Rican people, expressed in a free and open election.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Alaska (Mr. Young) for  his leadership on this effort, a Representative on the most recent  State.   I didn't want to take all of his time.    I yield to the gentleman from Alaska.
