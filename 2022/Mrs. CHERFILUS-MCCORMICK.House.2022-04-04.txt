 Madam Speaker, I rise to applaud my  colleagues for passing the Affordable Insulin Now Act, which will lower  costs for hardworking families by capping the out-of-pocket costs for  insulin at $35 per month. This legislation is about putting the health  of our citizens before profit.   Rising by 54 percent from 2014 to 2019, the cost of insulin has  created an affordability crisis for the 9.8 percent of Floridians  living with diabetes, which is roughly 2.8 million residents.   Nobody should be forced to choose between paying for rent and  protecting their health. More than half of Americans have less than 3  months' worth of expenses covered in an emergency fund. That total  includes one in four Americans who indicate having no emergency fund at  all, up from 21 percent in 2020, let alone to have the ability to pay  more than $300 for a single vial for those without adequate insurance.   While the Affordable Care Act has ensured access to healthcare for  Americans, the cost of healthcare remains far too high.    This legislation will ensure that Floridians with diabetes pay no  more than $35 for their lifesaving insulin each month. My constituents  in Florida's 20th Congressional District feel the effects of rising  out-of-pocket costs for their insulin. This bill provides them with  appropriate relief at a time when families are struggling to make ends  meet.   Americans currently face an average price of $98.70 for a unit of  insulin; 10 times higher than in other wealthy nations. One in four  Americans who rely on insulin have been forced to ration doses due to  high prices, a last resort with potentially fatal consequences.   Uninsured people in the United States are disproportionately from  Black, indigenous, and other communities of color. For those who do not  qualify for Medicaid, high insulin prices can be devastating, forcing  them to make impossible choices between covering different basic needs.   Unfortunately, throughout the United States, diabetes prevalence has  increased over the past two decades, disproportionately affecting low- income populations. Even with health insurance, particularly high- deductible health plans, people can face exorbitant copays and fees  that make their medicine unaffordable.   Once the Senate votes in favor of this bill, beginning in 2023,  private health plans shall cover at least one of each type of dosage  form of insulin and cap cost-sharing for a 30-day supply at the lesser  of $35 or 25 percent of a plan's negotiated price.   Among individuals with private insurance, half would save at least  $19 per month, and a quarter would save at least $42 per month.  Individuals who buy their own insurance will experience the most  savings.   This legislation comes as House Democrats continue working to advance  comprehensive reform addressing the high cost of prescription drugs. I  am committed to ensuring that we continue to protect the health of all  Americans.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass  this critical bill.                            ____________________
