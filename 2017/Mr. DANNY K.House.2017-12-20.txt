 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, think of Robin Hood in  reverse: take from the poor and give to the rich.   When you take away social safety net programs and when you take away  Medicare and Medicaid, then it reminds me of Marie Antoinette. When the  people had no bread, she said: Let them eat cake.   I was opposed to this before it was released, I was opposed  yesterday, I will be opposed tomorrow, and I will be opposed next week.  It is no good for the American people.
