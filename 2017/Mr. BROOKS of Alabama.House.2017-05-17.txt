 Mr. Speaker, as a former Tuscaloosa County  prosecutor and Madison County district attorney, I fully understand the  importance of the rule of law that, in turn, protects us from anarchy,  crime, destruction, and death. Without the rule of law, criminal brute  force prevails.   Unfortunately, leftist political forces who care more about inciting  racial division for political gain and less about crime and terror  victims regularly second-guess those who wear the uniform to protect  and serve.   For emphasis, antipolice, leftist political rhetoric has helped  incite ambush-style attacks against police in places like Dallas, Baton  Rouge, Des Moines, and Palm Springs.   I support the Thin Blue Line Act because I appreciate the sacrifice  of law enforcement officers, and because it is morally right to help  protect officers who risk their lives to protect ours.
