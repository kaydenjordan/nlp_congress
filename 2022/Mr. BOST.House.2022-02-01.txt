 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend Rodney Davis for  yielding time to me and for organizing this Special Order.   Tonight you are going to hear several words from our colleagues that  will echo the same resounding words, and, that is, Vicki Dixon should  be recognized for all that she did in her life. But most of all, she  was kind. She was a friend.   When the delegation got together, she was always there to welcome  newcomers to D.C. that she may have known from a time in Illinois.   She dedicated her life to serving our country, which she loved  deeply. In her 30-plus years here in Washington, D.C., she worked for  several Members of Congress as well as seven Cabinet Secretaries.   Vicki will be deeply missed by those of us who knew her, whether in  Illinois, Washington, or Florida, where she just retired to in the  fall. She left our Capitol community and our Nation better off than it  was before. She was loved. She will be missed tremendously.   When the Illinois delegation got together over at the club, it was  always amazing how quick she would come up to greet everyone, show  friendship and kindness, give you some advice now and again on how to  deal with this place, as crazy as it is at times.   Both Tracy and I send our prayers to her mother, Peggy; her sister,  Kristi; and all of her many nieces and nephews; and we want to say a  special thank you for how she has touched each one of our lives.
