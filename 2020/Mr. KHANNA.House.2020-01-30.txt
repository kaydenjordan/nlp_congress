 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Engel for his moral  leadership in preventing a war in Iran and his moral leadership in  stopping the war in Yemen.   This amendment is very simple. It would stop another regime change  war in the Middle East.   The gentleman from Texas says that it is dangerous, that it is  reckless, that it emboldens our enemies. Does he really believe that 27  Republicans, including Representative Gaetz, Representative Meadows,  and Representative Jordan are emboldening our enemies?                                time  0930    Does he really believe that they are divisive against the President?  I mean, they are some of the President's staunchest supporters.   It is time, in this body, that we get past the rhetoric, past the  sloganeering, and consider why 27 Republicans actually voted for this.  Perhaps it has to do with our national security. Perhaps it has to do  with reversing blunder after blunder that has cost this country  trillions of dollars and lives.   Let's consider the facts. The President says we want to have a pivot  to Asia because China is our leading competitor in the 21st century. I  agree. China's GDP, 15 percent of global GDP; the United States, at 21  percent. They are putting their money into building rail, building  universities.   You know how much Iran's GDP is of global GDP? .44 percent. Future  historians will wonder what were we thinking? What were we thinking?   They say, well, we have got to keep the Strait of Hormuz open. Well,  the Strait of Hormuz has been open since 1981. And by the way, China,  Japan, South Korea, they need 65 percent of that oil. You think they  would allow the Strait of Hormuz to close?   Why is America bearing the cost for these wars when China hasn't been  in a war since 1979?   This amendment does nothing, nothing, to restrict the Commander in  Chief to protect American interests or protect American allies. It  gives him all of the powers of the War Powers Resolution. If we are  hit, he has every authority to act and not come to Congress for  authorization.   All the amendment says is, before we get into another Middle East  war, before we waste trillions of dollars again, that we need to come  to Congress to authorize that. I hope that this body will vote for this  in a bipartisan way. I hope this time even more than 27 Republicans  will join.   And I believe actually voting for this amendment is vindicating what  President Trump ran on in 2016, which was a promise to the American  people to get out of these endless wars in the Middle East.
