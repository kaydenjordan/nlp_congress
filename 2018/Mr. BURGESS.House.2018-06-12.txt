 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, we heard about this issue in both the Health  Subcommittee that I chair as well as the Oversight and Investigations  Subcommittee on Energy and Commerce chaired by Mr. Gregg Harper.   We had a roundtable of family members who had lost family due to the  opioid crisis. They spoke very eloquently about this issue. Two in  particular stand out, Gail Smith and Lisa Daniels, both mothers who had  lost sons to the opioid crisis. Both sons had been brokered into  recovery homes that really didn't have their best interests at heart  and ultimately succumbed to their disease of addiction.    This is significantly important legislation. I obviously encourage  all of my colleagues to be supportive.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters), a valuable member of  the Energy and Commerce Committee and cosponsor of the bill before us.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5002) to expand the unique research initiatives authority of  the National Institutes of Health.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5002         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Advancing Cutting Edge       Research Act'' or the ``ACE Research Act''.       SEC. 2. UNIQUE RESEARCH INITIATIVES.         Section 402(n)(1) of the Public Health Service Act (42       U.S.C. 282(n)(1)) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``or'';        (2) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period and       inserting ``; or''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:  [[Page H5039]]         ``(C) high impact cutting-edge research that fosters       scientific creativity and increases fundamental biological       understanding leading to the prevention, diagnosis, or       treatment of diseases and disorders, or research urgently       required to respond to a public health threat.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to express my support for H.R. 5002, the  Advancing Cutting Edge Research Act.   This important bill gives the National Institutes of Health a  critical tool to help combat the opiate crisis by giving the National  Institutes of Health director more flexibility to conduct innovative  research and to spur urgently needed research on new, nonaddictive pain  medications.   By providing these authorities, the National Institutes of Health  will be able to more easily partner with innovative companies with  cutting-edge technology to address the opiate crisis and other public  health threats.   I do want to thank colleagues from Michigan, Representatives Dingell  and former Chairman Fred Upton, for leading this important initiative.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton), the principal author on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, I want to wholeheartedly agree with the comments we just  heard from the gentlewoman from Michigan. It is imperative that we  guard against the pendulum swinging too far in either direction.   One of the very first hearings I attended as the newest member of the  Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health in 2005 was a hearing on why  doctors do not prescribe adequate pain relief for their patients who  are in pain.   Now we fast-forward today, to the significant number of drug overdose  deaths, many of those attributed to opiates that this country has seen  in the past several years, and, clearly, it is important that the  committee do something. It is important that in doing something, we do  not further damage those people who are stable and depending upon a  pain medication regimen that works for them. But going forward, we need  to find, if we can, a way out of this predicament in the future for  future patients.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
