 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Community  Wood Facilities Assistance Act of 2021. My colleagues Senators Collins,  Shaheen, and Kelly are joining me as original cosponsors of the bill.   This bill will assist with the construction of facilities for mass  timber, tall wood, and other innovative wood products, in order to make  sustainable use of small-diameter timber from forest thinnings and  other needed treatments in Eastern and Western forests.   The bill will also help to create jobs in disadvantaged rural and  forest-dependent communities, and will help to reduce wildfire risk by  removing dangerous fuels that can build up.   The Forest Service reports that 80 million acres of Forest Service  lands alone are at risk of catastrophic wildfire or abnormal levels of  insect and disease infestations.   While Federal land management agencies are working to increase the  pace and scale of restoration activities, clearly we need to do more.  In California we are facing a severe drought, and even before the onset  of this most recent drought there were 150 million dead or dying trees  due to insect damage. We are truly facing a monumental challenge.   A recent comprehensive analysis by The Nature Conservancy and Bain  and Company management consultants found that creating a restoration  economy can play an important role in expanding the pace and scale of  ecologically based forest restoration. The report recommended funding  and incentives to ``bridge the gap between the cost of ecological  thinning and the economic viability of wood-processing  infrastructure.''   As the report explains, ``If more aggressive restoration targets can  be met, there will be significant need for additional processing  capacity to defray restoration costs and provide valuable end uses for  thinned material.''   Our bill responds to the challenge of developing funding measures to  improve the economic viability of wood-processing infrastructure to  reduce the cost of forest restoration and provide valuable uses for the  small diameter material.   Fortunately, we do not need to create a whole new program to improve  the economic viability of wood-processing infrastructure. The Forest  Service has two existing grant programs that can help: the Community  Wood Energy and Wood Innovations Grant Program and the Wood Innovations  Program.   These programs would benefit from amendments to increase their  utility for improving the viability of wood-processing infrastructure.  In particular, the program could benefit from higher Federal cost- shares and an increased ability to provide more funding for each  project, in addition to a higher authorization of funding overall.   More specifically, our bill will revise the Forest Service's  Community Wood Energy and Wood Innovations Grant Program, which  provides assistance to the capital cost of small wood products  facilities. Specifically, our bill would:   Increase the authorization from $25 million to $50 million per year;   Increase the maximum grant per facility from $1 to $5 million;   Increase the Federal cost-share from 35% to 50%; and   Increase the maximum size for community wood energy systems eligible  for grant funding from 5 to 15 megawatts, among other provisions.   Our bill will also revise the Forest Service's Wood Innovations Grant  Program, which provides grants for proposed innovative uses and  applications and the expansion of markets for wood products. Our bill  would reduce the minimum non-Federal cost-share from 50% to 33.3% and  makes other technical changes identified by the Forest Service.   I thank the Senators who have joined me in cosponsoring this bill,  and I urge the full Senate to promptly take up this bill and pass it as  soon as possible.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Ms. Collins):   S. 2244. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to provide  for teacher and school leader quality enhancement and to enhance  institutional aid; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions.
