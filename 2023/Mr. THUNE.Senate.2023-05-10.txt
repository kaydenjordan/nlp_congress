 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is May 10--May 10. If the President's  Treasury Secretary is correct, in 3 weeks, the United States could  reach the limit of its borrowing capacity, and--and, absent an  agreement between the President and Congress to raise the debt ceiling,  begin to default on its debts. But if you think that means the  President has gotten serious about reaching a debt ceiling agreement,  you would be wrong.   The President did invite the Democratic and Republican leaders of the  House and Senate to the White House yesterday, presumably, one would  think, to finally begin negotiating. But as it turned out, the meeting  was apparently a little more than an occasion for the President to  reiterate his position that he won't negotiate.   Here is the political reality: The President can't raise the debt  ceiling by himself. He has to work with Congress, and, more  specifically, he has to work with Speaker McCarthy and the Republican- controlled House of Representatives. That is just the reality.   The American people sent divided government to Washington last  November, and divided government requires compromise. It requires  negotiation. Frankly, it is the height of arrogance for the President  and the Senate Democratic leader to think that they are somehow the  exception to that, to think that they should be able to simply decree  what they want--in this case, an increase in the debt ceiling with no  spending reforms--and have everyone else just fall in line.   That is not the way our system of government works. I get that the  President would like things to work that way, but they don't, and the  sooner he accepts that fact the better because the fiscal stability of  our country is hanging in the balance here. Unless the President comes  to the negotiating table for real, he is going to be responsible for  the United States defaulting on its debts.   Let's talk for a minute about why the President doesn't want to  negotiate, why he is insisting on a clean  [[Page S1582]]  debt limit bill. Well, it is really quite simple. House Republicans  want to pair any increase in the debt ceiling with spending reforms,  and the President doesn't want anything that will restrain his ability  to spend. He is intent on expanding the size and reach of the Federal  Government, and spending reforms would get in the way.   What President Biden does not seem to realize, however, is that our  Nation is on an unsustainable spending trajectory. Spending under the  Biden administration has reached staggering levels. The total Federal  budget for fiscal year 2023 is up approximately 40 percent from 2019,  the last budget before the pandemic--40 percent. And under the  President's budget, over the next decade, the Federal budget would  reach a staggering $10 trillion, a 125-percent increase from its  prepandemic level. Think about it--a 125-percent increase in the cost  of government from the prepandemic level. Our country and our economy  cannot take that level of spending.   Between October and March, the Federal Government borrowed $6 billion  a day--a day. That is more than the entire 2023 budget for my State of  South Dakota. The amount of money that the Federal Government borrows  in a single day is more than the entire budget for the State of South  Dakota for the entire year. Debt at that level threatens economic  growth. It jeopardizes our national security and leaves us excessively  dependent on other countries who hold our Nation's debt, and it sucks  money away from essential government spending on things like Social  Security and Medicare and our national defense.   Just paying the interest on our debt is taking a toll on our Nation's  budget. According to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible  Federal Budget, 50 cents of every dollar our country borrows in the  next 10 years will go just toward paying interest on our national debt.  By 2028, we will be spending more on interest than on national defense.  By 2044, we will be spending more on interest than on Medicare. And by  2050, we will be spending more on interest than on Social Security.   How in the world are we going to be able to pay for these programs  and other essential government functions if we are spending that much  money just meeting the interest--the interest alone--on that massive,  going-on-$32-trillion debt?   Negotiating over the debt ceiling is hardly new. Seven of the last  ten debt limit increases have included some mix of policy or budgetary  changes rather than a simple, clean increase. And the Democrat leader  of the Senate, the same Democrat leader who is now insisting on a clean  debt limit increase, is on the record during the last administration  talking about using the debt ceiling as leverage to achieve Democrat  priorities.   So the President and the Democrat leader's outrage that they might  have to yield to the realities of divided government and actually have  to negotiate over the debt ceiling is a little hard to swallow. And it  is profoundly disturbing that, with a national debt in excess of $31  trillion and growing every day, the President and the Democrat leader  can't be brought to consider even the mildest spending reforms.   House Republicans have proposed reasonable spending reforms. The  nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget--where the  President's own Treasury Secretary used to sit on the Board, I might  add--called the Republican bill ``a serious package'' and a ``realistic  and extremely welcome first step.'' But if the President doesn't like  the House's proposed spending reforms, he should put forward his own  spending reforms.   What he should not do, however, and cannot responsibly do is continue  to refuse to engage in negotiations. If he continues to reject  compromise, if he continues to insist that it is his way and no other,  then, come June, he will be responsible for our Nation defaulting on  its debts.   The President has already spent us into an inflation crisis. Let's  hope he can see his way to negotiating before he plunges us into a  default crisis as well.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Alabama (Mr. Tuberville).
