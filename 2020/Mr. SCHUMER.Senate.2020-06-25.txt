 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the House of Representatives will pass  the Justice in Policing Act today--a comprehensive, strong bill to  bring lasting change to police departments across America and tackle  the extremely large and difficult problem of police bias, police  violence, racial bias, and the lack of transparency and accountability  in law enforcement.   Unlike the Republican policing bill, the Justice in Policing Act will  fully ban choke holds. The Justice in Policing Act will ban no-knock  warrants in Federal cases, not just study them like in the Republicans'  bill. Unlike the Republicans' bill, the Justice in Policing Act will  also bring sorely needed accountability to police officers who are  guilty of misconduct, including qualified immunity reform, use-of-force  standards, and policies to end racial profiling.   My Republican colleagues should look to the House today if they want  to see what a serious attempt at policing reform looks like and if they  want to understand why their bill failed to earn enough votes to  proceed yesterday.   The Republicans' policing reform bill failed because it was not a  serious enough effort at reform. The legislation itself was so  threadbare, so weak, and so narrow, it could hardly be considered a  constructive starting point. That is why more than 138 civil rights  organizations, which want nothing  [[Page S3279]]  more than to see progress on these issues, strongly urged Senators to  oppose the Republicans' bill. That is why the Leadership Conference on  Civil Rights called the bill ``deeply problematic'' and a ``menial,  incremental approach.'' That is why the lawyer representing the  families of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor said he was shocked that  the Republicans' bill could even be ``thought of as legislation.''   As I said the other day, I know my friend from South Carolina is  trying to do the right thing, but the problem we have and the problem  so many civil rights groups have is with the substance of the bill and  with the way the Republican leader--Leader McConnell, who controls the  floor--set up the process. The Republican majority drafted a bill on  its own, and instead of putting it through committee, where members of  both parties could analyze and amend it, he dropped it on the floor and  dared the Democrats to block it.   Let me be very clear: The debate on policing reform is only over for  those who want it to be over and for, maybe, those who never truly  wanted this debate in the first place, because the truth is, by the end  of the day today, the House will have passed the most serious policing  reform bill in decades. Here in the Senate, the Senate Democrats have  been clear that we want to sit down with our colleagues and try to  negotiate a bipartisan product that can go through committee and come  to the floor.   As I said a week ago, I know my friend from South Carolina is trying  to do the right thing, but Leader McConnell decided to go about this  the wrong way--the partisan way. Let's start over the right way--the  bipartisan way. I have no doubt we can arrive at legislation that,  unlike the bill that failed yesterday, would bring comprehensive and  lasting change that protesters, civil rights organizations, and the  families of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery demand.                                 Coronavirus    Madam President, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread and swell  across the United States. Yesterday afternoon, the New York Times  reported that new cases of COVID-19 are now at the highest levels in  the United States since the month of April, as 35,000 new cases were  identified on Tuesday alone--the third worst single day of the entire  pandemic. Hospitalization rates in Arizona and Texas have hit daily  records, and Florida is not far behind.   The rise in cases, scientists warn, is not explained by the current  rate of testing in this country. One of the main reasons our Nation has  struggled so to contain the coronavirus is President Trump's complete  mismanagement of the government's response. In the early days of the  virus, the President's lack of attention led to a shortage of PPE,  ventilators, and a painfully, damagingly slow ramp-up of testing   Here again, 4 months into the virus, as the case numbers continue to  grow in so many places, the President's lack of attention is causing a  national failure to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. The President is  gallivanting from State to State and holding political rallies in two  of the most affected areas.   The President joked--or perhaps didn't joke--about instructing his  administration to ``slow down the testing, please,'' because the number  of coronavirus cases might make him look bad. Can you believe that?  Again, the President urged the administration to ``slow down the  testing, please,'' because the number of cases might make him look bad.  Whether it was a joke or not, it is not a joking matter; it is serious  stuff.   Throughout this struggle with the coronavirus, the administration, at  best, has been late to the debate or asleep at the switch or, at worst,  has been doing things that actually harm rather than help.   There were reports yesterday that the administration will, in fact,  halt Federal funding for a number of community-based COVID testing  sites, many of which are in Texas--a State that is getting hit hard.  The administration is actually preparing to slow down the testing,  amazingly enough. A lesson from so many countries is that good, strong  testing and contact tracing is the key, but this President seems to be  blithely dancing along, going to his little events, and not paying  attention to the crisis and doing what is necessary to get a real  handle on it. We are witnessing the highest number of new cases since  April, and the Trump administration is cutting funding for testing in  some of the worst hotspots--a terrible decision at a terrible moment  but, unfortunately, not atypical of this administration's total  ineptitude.   To cap it all off, today the Trump administration is filing briefs in  the Supreme Court in an attempt to invalidate the Nation's health law  at a time when roughly 27 million Americans have lost job-based health  coverage, and their only backstops are the exchanges in the healthcare  law, but the administration is proposing to get rid of it. It is sort  of similar to yesterday, with the nomination on the floor of somebody  so anti-voting rights to go to the Fifth Circuit. A total contradiction  of what they say is what they do.   From the beginning, the President has downplayed the severity of the  disease. He has spread misinformation about how to stay safe and put  his political interests--his desire for credit and avoidance of blame-- above the medical needs and safety of the American people. As a result,  President Trump has helped put America first in the number of COVID-19  cases in the world, and unfortunately the situation is not much better  in the Senate.   It has been 2 months since the passage of the last COVID relief  legislation. The Democrats had hoped to continue the bipartisan work-- work that produced the CARES Act--in April, May, and now June but to no  avail. The House passed the HEROES Act over a month ago, which includes  hazard pay, housing assistance, extended unemployment insurance, and  aid to State and local governments. Yet, as the pandemic continued to  spread and unemployment skyrocketed, the Senate Republicans said they  felt no urgency to act immediately. There have been more than 40  million unemployment claims--another 1.5 million this week alone--and  still Leader McConnell and the Republican Senate don't feel an urgency  to act.   Leader McConnell originally said that another emergency relief bill  was likely during June. Now he is saying late July. A few days ago, the  Republican leader said:         If there is something that's going to happen, it will       emerge in the Senate; it will be written beginning in my       office.    Once again, Leader McConnell seems to prefer partisan pronouncements  to bipartisan legislating.   This is the same failed approach that delayed the CARES Act 2 months  ago and that failed yesterday on policing reform. It will only delay  another emergency relief bill, and such delays will be measured in  hospital beds, deserted storefronts, and pink slips.   There is one other point--the lack of oversight. This morning, the  GAO announced that $1.4 billion in relief checks were sent to people  who were dead. Where is the oversight? This is a $3 trillion package,  and every small bit of oversight that the Republicans have done has had  to be pushed by the Democrats. We should be having far more robust  oversight over what has happened as well as moving forward on a new  bill.   The Democrats are not going to wait until July to bring some  attention to COVID-related issues. Next week, on the floor, we will ask  our colleagues to take up some important legislation on housing and  rental assistance, hazard pay for essential workers, small business  relief, funding to help schools open safely, and aid to State and local  and Tribal governments. With cases rising in more than 20 States and  with emergency unemployment insurance for American families set to  expire, we cannot wait another month to act.   I yield the floor   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
