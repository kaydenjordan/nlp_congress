 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Croydon  Fire Company in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, which recently celebrated  its 100th year of service in our community.   Recently, the fire company celebrated with a parade and an open  house, which I had the honor to participate with them in, allowing  Croydon residents to express their gratitude and well wishes to the  brave men and women who sacrifice so much for our community.   I would like to take this time, Mr. Speaker, to show our community's  appreciation for volunteer fire companies, who often today are feeling  the squeeze of declining membership and volunteerism.   In Croydon, under the strong leadership of Chief Tom Tryon, the fire  company continues to see success. However, there is still work to be  done in order to sustain the viability of volunteer fire companies, and  we stand by their side in this mission.   I applaud the work of the Croydon volunteer fire company and their  tireless work to protect our families and our community. We wish them  all the best as they enter their second century serving lower Bucks  County and our entire community.                        Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Ovarian  Cancer Awareness Month. As policymakers and citizens, it is a time for  us to reflect on loved ones lost and to work together in advancing  bipartisan solutions to eradicate this disease. I am proud of my  neighbors in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who are doing their part to  advocate for a cure to ovarian cancer.   Turn the Towns Teal, a national campaign that spreads awareness of  ovarian cancer through the placement of teal ribbons in public  locations, recently arrived in Doylestown borough. This event brought  together thoughtful citizens, in partnership with the Doylestown Rotary  Club, dispensing nearly 400 ribbons throughout the area.   It takes several leaders to make this impactful event possible. I  would like to thank coordinator Joan Doyle for her activism, along with  the Doylestown borough mayor, Ron Strouse, and the entire Doylestown  borough council for their support in the fight against ovarian cancer.  I want to commend all volunteers who participated in Doylestown's Turn  the Towns Teal event in its 10th year of existence. We look forward to  collaborating with them to promote this noble cause throughout our  community.                       Recognizing Shared Support, Inc.     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a nonprofit  organization in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that gives individuals with  intellectual and developmental disabilities the ability to contribute  to society in a variety of meaningful and fulfilling ways.   Shared Support, Inc., in Warminster is a unique program that gives  participants work experiences in multiple settings. One of Shared  Support, Inc.'s impressive stories involves Jimmy Garcia, who assists  the residents of the Neshaminy Manor nursing home.   Recently, during a painting activity session, Jimmy was extremely  helpful in making sure the residents had the supplies they needed to  accomplish their tasks. He also took a trip with Neshaminy Manor to the  Middletown Grange Fair, assisting Warwick-based Ross Mill Farm with the  hard work of cleaning the animal pens.   I applaud Jimmy for his hard work and for being an outstanding  citizen in our community. I would also like to thank Shared Support  cofounder and CEO Christine Martin, direct care professional Mike  Hegarty, and Neshaminy Manor's activities aid Margaret Matthews for all  of their amazing work with an amazing organization. Our community  really thanks them for all the work they do.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I join my colleagues today to voice my  strong support for H.R. 6720, the Dog and Cat Meat Trade Prohibition  Act of 2018. It is critical that every single Member of this Chamber  live up to our responsibilities to be a voice for the voiceless, and  banning the individual sale of dog and cat meat is vital, clearly, to  fulfilling that obligation.   Mr. Speaker, in my district of Bucks and Montgomery Counties, as is  the case across this Nation, our pets are members of the family who  contribute greatly to our society. In particular, dogs serve as  invaluable partners in law enforcement, our military, and as service  animals.   Today, we have before us bipartisan, commonsense legislation that  protects these animals at the most basic level. It seems obvious that,  in this day and age, dogs and cats are not edible species, period.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida (Mr. Buchanan) for  introducing this vital legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support  it in a bipartisan fashion to show a united front against the horrors  of the dog and cat meat trade.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues,  Democrat and Republican alike, and House leadership to support  permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This  vital program benefits millions of Americans in innumerable ways, from  promoting recreational activity to contributing to our Nation's robust  economy, along with furthering environmental protection.   As we rapidly approach the deadline for this crucial program, which  affects 98 percent of counties here in the United States and  contributes to an  [[Page H8164]]  economy that encompasses 1 out of 15 American jobs, I urge this  Congress to take up full permanent funding for the Land and Water  Conservation Fund.   Since its establishment 50 years ago, the Land and Water Conservation  Fund has greatly benefitted my home district in Bucks and Montgomery  Counties in Pennsylvania. Treasured public lands such as Nockamixon  State Park, Tyler State Park, and cherished community venues such as  Hatfield Community Park are all just a few of the examples of the  beneficiaries of this valuable fund.   I am encouraged by the strong bipartisan support for permanent  funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I urge my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to continue its authorization and funding on  a permanent basis.   Mr. Speaker, this must be a bipartisan priority, and we must get this  done. The alternative is unacceptable.                            ____________________
