 Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about the  nomination of Judge Gorsuch to serve as the next Supreme Court Justice,  and I happened to walk in while the Democratic leader was speaking. In  the brief time I heard him comment this morning, I concluded that  basically the Democrats are against everything. They are against  everything. He knows as well as anybody that when the President sends  over a budget, it is a proposal by the President that Congress  routinely changes, arriving at its own budget priorities, working with  the White House.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Isakson).   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber  desiring to vote?

The resolution of ratification agreed to is as follows:         Resolved, (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring       therein),       SECTION 1. SENATE ADVICE AND CONSENT SUBJECT TO DECLARATIONS,                     AN UNDERSTANDING, AND CONDITIONS.         The Senate advises and consents to the ratification of the       Protocol to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the       Accession of Montenegro, which was opened for signature at       Brussels on May 19, 2016, and signed that day on behalf of       the United States of America (the ``Protocol'') (Treaty Doc.       114-12), subject to the declarations of section 2 and the       conditions of section 3.       SEC. 2. DECLARATIONS.         The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is       subject to the following declarations:        (1) Reaffirmation that united states membership in nato       remains a vital national security interest of the united       states.--The Senate declares that--        (A) for more than 60 years the North Atlantic Treaty       Organization (NATO) has served as the preeminent organization       to defend the countries in the North Atlantic area against       all external threats;        (B) through common action, the established democracies of       North America and Europe that were joined in NATO persevered       and prevailed in the task of ensuring the survival of       democratic government in Europe and North America throughout       the Cold War;        (C) NATO enhances the security of the United States by       embedding European states in a process of cooperative       security planning and by ensuring an ongoing and direct       leadership role for the United States in European security       affairs;        (D) the responsibility and financial burden of defending       the democracies of Europe and North America can be more       equitably shared through an alliance in which specific       obligations and force goals are met by its members;        (E) the security and prosperity of the United States is       enhanced by NATO's collective defense against aggression that       may threaten the security of NATO members; and        (F) United States membership in NATO remains a vital       national security interest of the United States.        (2) Strategic rationale for nato enlargement.--The Senate       finds that--        (A) the United States and its NATO allies face continued       threats to their stability and territorial integrity;        (B) an attack against Montenegro, or its destabilization       arising from external subversion, would threaten the       stability of Europe and jeopardize United States national       security interests;        (C) Montenegro, having established a democratic government       and having demonstrated a willingness to meet the       requirements of membership, including those necessary to       contribute to the defense of all NATO members, is in a       position to further the principles of the North Atlantic       Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North       Atlantic area; and        (D) extending NATO membership to Montenegro will strengthen       NATO, enhance stability in Southeast Europe, and advance the       interests of the United States and its NATO allies.        (3) Support for nato's open door policy.--The policy of the       United States is to support NATO's Open Door Policy that       allows any European country to express its desire to join       NATO and demonstrate its ability to meet the obligations of       NATO membership.        (4) Future consideration of candidates for membership in       nato.--        (A) Senate finding.--The Senate finds that the United       States will not support the accession to the North Atlantic       Treaty of, or the invitation to begin accession talks with,       any European state (other than Montenegro), unless--        (i) the President consults with the Senate consistent with       Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the       United States (relating to the advice and consent of the       Senate to the making of treaties); and        (ii) the prospective NATO member can fulfill all of the       obligations and responsibilities of membership, and the       inclusion of such state in NATO would serve the overall       political and strategic interests of NATO and the United       States.        (B) Requirement for consensus and ratification.--The Senate       declares that no action or agreement other than a consensus       decision by the full membership of NATO, approved by the       national procedures of each NATO member, including, in the       case of the United States, the requirements of Article II,       section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States       (relating to the advice and consent of the Senate to the       making of treaties), will constitute a commitment to       collective defense and consultations pursuant to Articles 4       and 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.        (5) Influence of non-nato members on nato decisions.--The       Senate declares that any country that is not a member of NATO       shall have no impact on decisions related to NATO       enlargement.        (6) Support for 2014 wales summit defense spending       benchmark.--The Senate declares that all NATO members should       continue to move towards the guideline outlined in the 2014       Wales Summit Declaration to spend a minimum of 2 percent of       their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on defense and 20 percent  [[Page S2039]]       of their defense budgets on major equipment, including       research and development, by 2024.        (7) Support for montenegro's democratic reform process.--      Montenegro has made difficult reforms and taken steps to       address corruption. The United States and other NATO member       states should not consider this important process complete       and should continue to urge additional reforms.       SEC. 3. CONDITIONS.         The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is       subject to the following conditions:        (1) Presidential certification.--Prior to the deposit of       the instrument of ratification, the President shall certify       to the Senate as follows:        (A) The inclusion of Montenegro in NATO will not have the       effect of increasing the overall percentage share of the       United States in the common budgets of NATO.        (B) The inclusion of Montenegro in NATO does not detract       from the ability of the United States to meet or to fund its       military requirements outside the North Atlantic area.        (2) Annual report on nato member defense spending.--Not       later than December 1 of each year during the 8-year period       following the date of entry into force of the Protocol to the       North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of Montenegro,       the President shall submit to the appropriate congressional       committees a report, which shall be submitted in an       unclassified form, but may be accompanied by a classified       annex, and which shall contain the following information:        (A) The amount each NATO member spent on its national       defense in each of the previous 5 years.        (B) The percentage of GDP for each of the previous 5 years       that each NATO member spent on its national defense.        (C) The percentage of national defense spending for each of       the previous 5 years that each NATO member spent on major       equipment, including research and development.        (D) Details on the actions a NATO member has taken in the       most recent year reported to move closer towards the NATO       guideline outlined in the 2014 Wales Summit Declaration to       spend a minimum of 2 percent of its GDP on national defense       and 20 percent of its national defense budget on major       equipment, including research and development, if a NATO       member is below either guideline for the most recent year       reported.
