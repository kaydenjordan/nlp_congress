 Mr. President, I extend to my colleague from Hawaii  every blessing for her successful health treatment. I know the thoughts  and prayers of every Member of the Senate are with her tomorrow and  beyond as she undertakes that healing path.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator  from Hawaii tonight. They are certainly very relevant to the issue of  healthcare here in America because each of us hopes that if a loved one  gets ill, they will have the peace of mind that they know they will be  able to get the healthcare they need and they will not go bankrupt in  the process. Yet here we are tonight debating a bill titled ``Better  Care Act.''   Better Care, has ever there been a bill in the history of the United  States of America so more perversely named than this Better Care Act  which strips care from 22 million Americans?   I was very struck by one equation of this bill; that is, that it  provides to the richest 400 Americans $33 billion over a 10-year  period. That is enough to pay for healthcare under Medicaid for 700,000  individuals--700,000 individuals. It rips the healthcare away from them  to give $33 billion to the richest 400 families. That is obscene. That  is certainly not better care.   It is hard for me to imagine that a single Member of this body would  vote to proceed to this bill, but here we are. Until we get agreement  that we are not going to proceed, we have to continue to carry on this  fight.   We know that 15 million people, CBO estimates, will lose healthcare  in the next 12 months. That is even worse than the House bill. Last  week, I came to this floor to call the Senate draft mean and meaner.  The House bill was mean. The Senate's is meaner. Now we have the CBO  estimate that says, yes, it is worse. One million more people would  lose healthcare in a short period of time.   Furthermore, the rate at which standard Medicaid is compressed-- Medicaid, as it existed before ObamaCare, that rate has increased to  further diminish healthcare, having nothing to do with ObamaCare, just  to add to the cruelty of this bill. So millions lose, but we deliver  billions of dollars to the richest Americans.   In my home State of Oregon, just the elimination of the expansion of  Medicaid, the Oregon health plan--just that would eliminate 400,000  Oregonians off healthcare.   Imagine those individuals holding hands, 400,000 Oregonians,  stretching from the Pacific Ocean to the State of Idaho. Anyone who has  driven across Oregon would realize it is 400 miles across Oregon. If  you are driving it, it is 7 hours of driving. For 7 hours, at 50 miles  an hour, 60 miles an hour, you are passing a stream of people who would  lose their healthcare just from the elimination of the expansion of  Medicaid.   My colleagues across the aisle have crafted this so as to put it  beyond the next Presidential election, beyond the 2018 election and  beyond the 2020 election. Why? They are so terrified of the impact of  this on the election they decided to postpone it until after 2018 and  2020, as if that makes it acceptable to rip healthcare from millions of  people. That type of cynical, cynical act, purely political, is not  going to be viewed well by the American public.   If you are so ashamed of this bill, if someone is so ashamed that  they want to postpone the effects beyond the next Presidential election  3\1/2\ years from now, then maybe you should be so ashamed as not to  vote to move to the bill here in the short term.   One of our colleagues across the aisle noted today: I can't imagine-- not quite the exact word-for-word, but it is close. I can't imagine  that anyone in America would have a chance to review this bill and  truly understand it in time to proceed to it this week, including  myself.   Well, that is certainly true. Has there ever been a case where a bill  profoundly affecting so many has not had the benefit of committee  deliberation here in the Senate? Are we a legislative body or are we a  dictatorship where everything is done behind closed doors  [[Page S3752]]  and then rammed through? That is not the American way, and that is not  the constitutional vision for how the Senate should work. There is  supposed to be time to consult healthcare experts and time to go home  to consult our constituents and find out how they feel.   If one is so terrified of this bill that you are afraid of your  constituents, then you shouldn't vote to proceed to the bill. If one is  so terrified you don't want to consult the experts, you shouldn't  proceed to this bill. If you are so terrified that the reaction from  the public will be so strong that it will put you in an awkward spot,  then you shouldn't proceed to this bill--because you have the  responsibility to consult with your folks back home, a responsibility  to consult with healthcare experts, to understand every nuance of this  bill.   One of those facts is going to have a devastating impact on those who  would go to nursing homes. Folks who are under Medicaid and in a  nursing home have given up their entire income and assets before they  can get Medicaid support.   I was in Klamath Falls the weekend before this last weekend, went to  a nursing home, and they said: Senator, almost 100 percent of the folks  here on long-term care are paid for by Medicaid. I thought they were  going to say 60 percent or two-thirds, because that is the national  statistic. No, in rural Oregon, in Klamath Falls, almost 100 percent.   Then we had the CEO of the Oregon Health Association reach out and  address this issue of how it is going to affect seniors. Here are his  exact words:         I was on a call early today looking at some projections of       how hard Oregon and Medicaid-funded long-term care service       would be hit. If this bill passes, it literally could force       the closure of the majority of nursing facilities in Oregon       by 2025.    One thing I can't get out of my mind. At another nursing home I went  to is a woman named Deborah. I explained I was coming by to talk to  people because I wanted to understand better the impact of this bill on  long-term care.   She said: Senator, I am paid for by Medicaid. If Medicaid disappears,  I am on the street, and that is a problem because I can't walk.   That is exactly what Deborah said. And, of course, it is a problem,  not only because she can't walk but because she needs extensive care,  which is why she is in long-term care to begin with.   The anxiety was palpable among the nursing home residents, among the  long-term care residents, because they have no backup plan, because  they had to spend down their assets before they qualified for Medicare.  Don't think of this just as ripping healthcare away from millions of  working families, millions of struggling families, millions of  children, but also from our seniors who are in long-term care, who need  extensive care, and who have given up their assets in order to qualify  for Medicaid. They used those assets to pay for it as long as they  could, and now they are on Medicaid. We are prepared to take those  folks, many of them in wheelchairs--like Deborah, unable to walk--and  throw them into the street and say: too bad.   The President called the House bill mean and indicated he wanted a  bill with more heart. This is not a bill with more heart. We should not  move to proceed to this bill.
