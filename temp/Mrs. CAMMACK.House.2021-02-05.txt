 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise before you today in opposition to this rule.  Since we began this new Congress in January--and I realize that I am  new here--I have yet to see a single action by this House that could be  interpreted as bipartisan; unifying; or, if we are being honest, a good  use of our collective time.   Our Nation is experiencing one of the worst crises in our history.  Last Congress, this body passed legislation that was quadruple the size  of all New Deal programs combined, and that is adjusted for inflation.  We are talking about $4 trillion. Today's solutions cannot be  tomorrow's problems.   Madam Speaker, I am in favor of relief for our struggling businesses,  our constituents, and our hardworking families. However, what we are  considering here today is not relief. Rather, we are garnishing the  wages of future generations. While the left is focused on charging  Members of Congress thousands of dollars for their masks falling below  their nose, mom-and-pop shops back home are having their local, State,  and now Federal Government stand in the way of them opening their doors  and getting this economy up and running.   And what of the $1.3 trillion that this body recently passed and that  this administration has yet to spend? Where is that money going?   History shows us that the most successful actions by government have  been bipartisan. It is time to let everyone, including Republicans,  have a seat at the table. Until we prioritize all--all--of our people  instead of just some coastal elites, I will not and I cannot support  the actions of this majority.
