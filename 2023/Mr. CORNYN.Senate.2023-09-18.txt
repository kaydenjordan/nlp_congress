 Madam President, the end of the fiscal year is just 12  days away, and the Senate has not yet voted on a single one of the 12  appropriations bills that have passed on a bipartisan basis out of the  Appropriations Committee.   The majority leader, who controls the agenda of the Senate and the  timing at which we consider matters, has had all year to plan and  prepare for the September 30 deadline. But here we are, less than 2  weeks before a shutdown, with no clear path to funding the government.   At the start of last week, this Chamber was preparing to take up a  three-bill minibus. In other words, having not started to vote on any  single bill, the majority leader put a bill on the floor that combines  3 of those 12 appropriations bills. This is something the Senate has  done before; but to be clear, this is not a feature of the regular  order of things. Following the regular order involves taking up and  passing each appropriation bill one at a time.   Had the majority leader taken this process seriously, he would have  had time to do that. The Appropriations Committee passed the first  funding bills on June 22, which is nearly 3 months ago. The Senate  could have been processing those funding bills at any point over the  summer. We could have followed the regular order and debated, amended,  and passed all 12 bills ahead of the September 30 deadline. Sadly, that  didn't happen, which is now why we find ourselves in this situation. It  didn't have to be this way; but, apparently, the majority leader  Senator Schumer, the Senator from New York, wanted it this way.   Diverging from regular order to take up a minibus requires unanimous  consent because it is in violation of rule XVI of the Standing Rules of  the Senate. And we know there are objections to waiving the provisions  of rule XVI, hence we are where we are today.   In politics, we sometimes talk about the art of the possible. We take  stock of different Members' positions, time constraints, procedural  hurdles, and determine what is possible, what is feasible. Now, plan A  should have been to follow the regular order and pass these bills one  at a time through regular order, as I said, consistent with the  Standing Rules of the Senate. But since that ship has sailed, we now  have to figure out what plan B is.   Like many of my colleagues, I want the Senate to work the way the  rules provide for. And finding ourselves in the predicament we are in,  which is entirely predictable, I think the best course of action is to  move forward with all three of these bills.   Each of these bills passed the Appropriations Committee unanimously.  They are products of a thorough bipartisan committee process, and they  are ready for a thorough bipartisan floor process. Unfortunately, we  know that with only 12 days to go, how this movie will end. Ultimately,  there are two choices. One is we pass a continuing resolution to give  the House and the Senate more time to work on the underlying  appropriation bills, or we will end up in a government shutdown. It  didn't have to be this way.   But if it is not possible to move forward on all three of those bills  contained in the minibus, which it currently is not possible, we need  to move forward with the Military Construction-VA funding bill. There  is no objection to doing that, and we are wasting valuable time by not  processing that appropriation bill.   But with just 12 days before the end of the fiscal year, I know we  are all anxiously watching the calendar because our country is  barreling toward a shutdown, and the American people are confounded by  the fact that the United States Senate has not even yet--even with all  this time--has not even yet started to vote on any funding bills.   Again, this is not inevitable. We didn't have to deal with it this  way. Senator Schumer could have put the first appropriations bill on  the floor in June, July, August; but here we are on September 18 trying  to map out the process for the first funding bill.   There is bipartisan bewilderment at why we have landed here. After  all, the Appropriations Committee put us in the strongest possible  position to advance these funding bills on a timely basis.   Senator Murray and Senator Collins--the chairman and ranking member  of the Senate Appropriations Committee--promised to return to regular  order, and that is exactly what they delivered. What they didn't figure  on is that their principal obstacle would prove to be the majority  leader of the Senate who sabotaged their bipartisan regular order  effort by not bringing these bills to the floor on a timely basis.   As I said, all of the appropriations process happened in June and  July, and there is no reason why it should have taken this long for the  majority leader to start mapping out the floor process. This is no way  to run a railroad, much less the U.S. Senate; and I am frustrated we  find ourselves just 12 days before a government shutdown.   So I hope we will be able to find a path to process appropriation  bills. But if that is not possible, we need to do what we can while we  can. One bill is better than nothing, which seems to be Senator  Schumer's preferred outcome--nothing. So if there is a shutdown, which  I hope there is not, it doesn't serve the interests of the American  people or either of the political parties--the House or the Senate. But  if there is, then it has to be called a Schumer shutdown.             22nd Anniversary of the September 11, 2001, Attacks    Madam President, on another matter, last week marked the 22nd  anniversary of the terrible terrorist attacks against the United States  of America on September 11, 2001. The 9/11 attacks are one of those  events that we will always remember where we were and what we were  doing--just like I remember when I was 11 years old, when John F.  Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, TX.   Even though more than two decades have passed since 9/11, the pain  our Nation endured on that day is still fresh in the minds of many  Americans and, certainly, all of us who were old enough to remember it.  We remember the images that covered the front pages of the newspaper  and the scenes we saw depicted on our television sets. We remember the  bravery of the firefighters who ran into the buildings and the Good  Samaritans who put their lives on the line to save others.   But most of all, we remember the people who lost their lives that  day--the 2,977 innocent lives, the thousands more who were injured, and  the countless people whose lives were changed in an instant.   As a country, we came together and vowed to never forget the events  of September 11 and ensure that those responsible would be brought to  justice. As part of that commitment, Senator Schumer and I introduced  legislation called the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or  JASTA, which became law in 2016. It amended the Federal law so that  foreign sponsors of terrorist attacks could be held accountable. What  this meant, in practical terms, was that the people impacted the most,  who lost families, loved ones, property, or businesses, could bring a  civil suit against the foreign nation that sponsored and financed  terrorist attacks on our soil on that day. This includes the parents  who lost their children, wives who lost their husbands. This  legislation provided a path forward for families who lost everything so  they could have their day in court. This law made clear that any  country, any person, or entity that finances terrorists for attacks on  American soil could be expected to be hauled into a U.S. court to face  justice.   There was a sigh of relief from the victims of 9/11, but over the  last several years, it has become clear that the law needs technical  fixes. Some defendants, including countries accused of financing and  sponsoring terrorism, have exploited perceived loopholes in the law to  claim total immunity from lawsuits, which was not our intention. This  flies in the face of the text, the structure, and the intent of this  law, and prevents the 9/11 families and survivors from pursuing  justice.    Earlier this year, Senator Menendez, the chairman of the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee, and I introduced new legislation to make  important technical corrections to JASTA. Actually, I think the law  doesn't need a correction, but it does deserve a clarification, where a  court listening to an argument made by a country, perhaps,  [[Page S4549]]  that financed these terrorist attacks, says: Well, it doesn't include  some categories of recovery for damages. Our bill simply clarifies who  can sue and who can be sued to ensure JASTA operates the way we  originally intended it to back in 2016.   So when Congress debated JASTA several years ago, folks were divided  into two distinct camps. In one camp were the supporters of the bill.  This included the 9/11 families, obviously, whose lives were forever  changed because of the attacks on our country. They wanted foreign  nations and entities to be held liable if they aided and abetted  terrorists, and I was proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with them and  help move this legislation through the Senate. The majority of our  colleagues in Congress--Democrats and Republicans--fell into that one  camp. We wanted to see justice for the 9/11 families.   In another camp--let's call it camp 2--were opponents of this law.  This included the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which did not want to be  held accountable for any role it might have played in spreading  terrorism or financing these attacks on American soil. It launched an  extensive lobbying campaign and promoted bogus narratives in an attempt  to defeat or weaken support for JASTA. Sadly, camp 2 included some  members of the Obama administration, which parroted a lot of the Saudi  talking points and tried to stop the bill from becoming law. As a  matter of fact, President Obama vetoed JASTA, but this legislation had  such overwhelming support, it gave way to the only veto override of the  Obama administration.   Several years have passed, and the camps haven't changed, but the  occupant of the White House has. President Biden still hasn't taken a  public position on fixing JASTA, but his administration seems to be  leaning toward camp 2, siding with the Saudis over the 9/11 families.   High-ranking Biden officials have dusted off the Saudi talking points  that we once heard from the Obama administration. One of the arguments  I have heard against this bill is that we do not enact laws that affect  pending litigation. But that simply is not true. Every statute that  amends the United States Code alters current litigation unless we state  that it is only prospective in application.   JASTA was enacted while there was an appeal pending in the Second  Circuit relating to the ability of the 9/11 plaintiffs to sue them  under the tort exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. JASTA  itself is the example of Congress viewing errors in judicial  interpretation and stepping in to fix them. It is the law we passed,  and we need to see that our intent--congressional intent--is actually  enforced by the courts. Nobody complained that we were doing this then,  and every Member of this body who was serving in 2016 voted for JASTA.  It passed twice, 100 to 0.   JASTA maintains strong bipartisan support today. My bill with Senator  Menendez to make technical corrections has that same strong bipartisan  support. President Biden and his administration need to make a  decision, is he in camp 1 or camp 2--a foreign government that is  accused of helping carry out the deadliest attack on American soil or  the thousands of Americans and families who lost everything on 9/11? It  is embarrassing that this is even a question because the correct choice  is so obvious.   Earlier this month, the families of the 9/11 victims sent a letter  urging Congress to pass this legislation to, as they wrote, ``fulfill  Congress' promise to the American People.'' That letter had more than  4,000 signatures.   I want to thank two women, in particular, who have been fierce  advocates of this legislation: Terry Strada and Angela Mistrulli. They  both lost loved ones on 9/11, and they have made it their mission in  life to ensure that victims of terrorism can finally have their day in  court. I know they will not stop fighting until they get justice, and  it has been an honor to stand alongside them and hold sponsors of  terrorism accountable.   I am disappointed that the Senate was not able to pass this bill  ahead of the anniversary of September 11, but that doesn't mean the  urgency has gone away.   The majority leader, despite our differences on other things like the  appropriations process--the majority leader was my partner on JASTA  several years ago, and he is an original cosponsor of the legislation  that I am talking about today that would make these critical technical  fixes. I know he is committed to passing this legislation, and I hope  he will put this bill on the floor soon so we can deliver on the  promise Congress made to the 9/11 families and to the American people.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
