 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of amendment No. 8  offered by Mr. Langevin to provide funding for the Department of  Defense Cyber Scholarship Program.   Our country is facing a severe shortage of trained cyber  professionals, a shortage that includes about 10,000 cybersecurity  experts in government alone, and estimated to be about 1 million  shortages throughout our economy by 2019.   We need to give young people the incentive to follow careers in  cybersecurity to learn skills such as computer coding and ethical  hacking. This amendment provides $10 million for scholarships for  associate degrees at community colleges and assists with program  execution from DOD and NSA.   I cosponsored this amendment, and I want to thank Congressman  Langevin for offering this important piece of legislation. I urge all  my colleagues to support this amendment.
