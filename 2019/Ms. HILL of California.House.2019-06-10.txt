 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3151,  the Taxpayer First Act, which is a very exciting piece of legislation  because who doesn't get excited about taxes?   However, in all seriousness, we should get excited when paying taxes  or filing our taxes becomes easier and better for the American people.   I am so thrilled to be here today to offer my support, and I am  beyond grateful that my concerns with the free file provision were  heard and acted upon.   I am beyond grateful to Congressman Lewis' leadership on this  legislation which will save the government money, protect low-income  individuals, and give the IRS resources to offer many additional much- needed services. I also want to thank the Congressman's staff and the  Ways and Means Committee staff for working with my team--who also  deserve a great deal of thanks--to make this happen. It is an  incredible example of the collaboration that can happen to positively  affect peoples' lives, and I cannot begin to express my gratitude that  such a long-term, well-respected leader such as   John Lewis took my  concerns into consideration and involved me in the process, even though  I am a lowly freshman.   The fact that we were able to get this provision resolved is showing  how Congress is changing and showing how we are taking power away from  corporations and special interests and back into the hands of regular  people. I am proud to be part of that effort.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.
