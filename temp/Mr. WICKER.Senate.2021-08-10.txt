 Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise in support of the Baldwin  amendment. I appreciate Senator Baldwin's interest in making sure that  the Coast Guard has adequate icebreaking in the Great Lakes.   I will note that there is currently no funding for the Coast Guard in  the Democrats' budget resolution, and I hope that the vote we are about  to have will show support for icebreakers. And perhaps Democrats will  regret their decision to exclude the Coast Guard from the Commerce  Committee's allocation of over $80 billion.   But I do support the amendment. The ranking member of the Budget  Committee also supports the amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3648
