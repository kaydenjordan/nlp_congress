 Madam President, this week, the Senate will continue  its work in the personnel business and confirm more of the President's  outstanding nominees to the Federal judiciary.   Since our Democratic colleagues chose last week to filibuster defense  funding and block the Senate from even considering legislation to fund  our Armed Forces, we will turn our focus to confirmations while we wait  for progress from them on appropriations.   Leading off the week, the Senate will have the opportunity to confirm  another standout Kentuckian to the Federal bench, this time to the U.S.  Court of Federal Claims.   Judge David Tapp has just about done it all since he first became a  State judge nearly 15 years ago. He has heard cases at multiple levels  of the State's judiciary, ruling on a wide range of issues. As a  volunteer drug court judge, Judge Tapp has earned national praise for  promoting long-term recovery in the courtroom. He has also developed a  sterling reputation for fairness throughout Kentucky and around the  country.   Now David will bring a lifetime of public service and achievement to  the Court of Federal Claims, where I am confident he will continue  making us all proud. I look forward to voting to confirm him later  today and hope our colleagues will join me.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on another matter, last week the  Nation saw several pivotal moments that shed light on the current state  of the Democratic Party. Here in the Senate, as I mentioned, Democrats  chose to filibuster funding for our national defense for the second  time in 2 months. This funding was agreed to in the bipartisan,  bicameral deal that Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leader signed  onto just a few months ago, but now they have walked away from the  agreement they signed and filibustered funding for our military  commanders.   Yesterday, we saw the Iranian regime celebrate--celebrate--the 40th  anniversary of the taking of the American Embassy and the beginning of  the Iranian hostage crisis. The familiar slogan, ``Death to America,''  was on full display. It was especially sobering to watch this display  and remember that our own U.S. military commanders do not have the  certainty they need for strategic planning because Democrats here in  Washington found it politically advantageous to block it.   Over in the House, Speaker Pelosi continues to stall the U.S.-Mexico- Canada Agreement. USMCA would bring tens of billions in new commerce  and create 176,000 new American jobs, but House Democrats would rather  pursue  [[Page S6366]]  political theater. So American workers and farmers are still waiting.   However, while our Democratic colleagues block these bipartisan  priorities, at least they are not shy about what they do support. We  have seen what Democrats prioritize. We remember the Green New Deal, an  effort to grab unprecedented control over American families' daily  lives. Designing, building, or furnishing a home or business? Democrats  want Washington to dictate how you do that. Commuting, traveling for  vacation, mowing your lawn? They would like you to do that without  gasoline or jet fuel sooner rather than later. Make a living producing,  refining, or delivering affordable American energy? They want you to  find another line of work whether you like it or not. That is the Green  New Deal.   There is also the matter of Medicare for None. That is the scheme  that would take the program that millions of American seniors rely on,  throw away everything except the label, and paste that onto a new, one- size-fits-all, Washington-run insurance plan that would be mandatory  for every American. Medicare, gone. Private plans and the popular  Medicare Advantage Program, gone. Every health insurance plan that  Americans get on the job, which over 180 million people depend on,  gone.   This is literally what several of the leading Democratic Presidential  contenders have endorsed--a new nationwide experiment in socialism. And  every single American--man, woman, and child--would be the subject of  this experiment, whether that is what we want for our families or not.  From this mandatory one-size-fits-all insurance plan to new price  controls that would limit lifesaving cures, our Democratic colleagues  are rallying around policies that would leave American families paying  more to wait longer for worse care. That is their prescription--paying  more to wait longer for worse care.   Then, if these plans weren't bad enough on the merits, there is the  small issue of the crushing new tax burden you would have to pile onto  the U.S. economy in order to make some effort to pay for all of this.  One leading Democrat released a breathtaking proposal last week that  illustrates the road they would like to head down. This candidate's  Medicare for None plan on its own, notwithstanding all the other  socialist plans--just the healthcare plan--would cost $52 trillion over  the first 10 years alone. That is the candidate's own estimate--$52  trillion over 10 years.   Even after cannibalizing everything the government currently spends  on healthcare, the plan's author admits there would still be a  staggering $20-plus trillion left over to finance. Other experts say it  would be more. For some perspective, if you add up every cent that is  deposited in every commercial bank across the United States of America,  that is about $13 trillion. So you could literally seize--seize--every  dollar that Americans have deposited in banks and you would have  nowhere near enough money to pay for even the first decade of this  crazy experiment. Democrats are confident they can produce this huge  sum of money through historic tax increases on job creators and on the  American people. It would be an enormous--enormous--new tax burden  dumped on the U.S. economy that would kill jobs, depress workers'  wages, and make America less competitive literally for generations to  come.   At the exact time when Republican tax reform has made the United  States more competitive and boosted prosperity here at home, Democrats  want to take us backward and make our Nation a less attractive place to  create jobs.   Here is what Larry Summers, a former Treasury Secretary under  President Clinton, wrote about this far-left plan in the Washington  Post:         [It] will discourage hiring, particularly of low-skilled       workers. . . . There is . . . the real risk of an economic       contraction following a sharp market decline.    That is Larry Summers, the Clinton Treasury Secretary. Particularly,  it would discourage hiring, particularly of low-skilled workers, and a  sharp market decline. So in order to take away employer-sponsored  insurance from 180 million Americans, Democrats want to kill American  jobs and bring the economy to a screeching halt.   Look, I would implore my friends across the aisle to put aside this  destructive socialism and join us in the current work that needs doing  right now for the American people. We have a landmark trade agreement  that needs passing. We have U.S. Armed Forces that need funding. We are  just waiting on our Democratic colleagues to show up.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture votes on the Rudofsky and Wilson  nominations occur at 12 noon on Wednesday, November 6. I further ask  unanimous consent that the confirmation vote on the Hunsaker nomination  occur at 4 p.m. on Wednesday, November 6, and that following the  disposition of the Hunsaker nomination, the Senate vote on the motion  to invoke cloture on the Nardini nomination. Finally, I ask unanimous  consent that if cloture is invoked on the Rudofsky, Wilson, and Nardini  nominations, that the confirmation votes occur at a time to be  determined by the majority leader in consultation with the Democratic  leader on Thursday, November 7.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning  business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes  each.    Madam President, this upcoming Veterans Day gives  every American the opportunity to pause and pay tribute to the many  sacrifices of those men and women who served in our Armed Forces. Out  of devotion to this country and our values, these brave servicemembers  made the world a safer place. It is a sincere privilege to extend my  gratitude to each and every one of them.   I am especially proud to recognize the nearly 300,000 American  veterans who call Kentucky home. After their military service, many of  these Kentuckians came home and continued selflessly giving to their  communities and our Nation. In particular, I would like to pay tribute  to a special Kentucky veteran today, Dan McDaniel of Kenton County. Six  days after he graduated from the University of Kentucky in 1972, Dan  became one of the final draftees his community sent into the Army  during the Vietnam war. Following his basic training, Dan was sent with  his wife, Linda, to Augsburg, Germany, as a field artillery crewman. He  [[Page S6386]]  served there until he received an honorable discharge that brought the  couple home to Kenton County.   Using his degree in social studies, Dan taught history for a short  time in Northern Kentucky. Then, a few years later, Dan and his brother  Mike started a small concrete company out of their basements. For  nearly four decades, Mike and Dan grew their business and earned  respect in Northern Kentucky and the greater region as full service  concrete contractors. In 2008, the brothers sold their business to  Dan's son, Chris, who runs the company to this day.   The family business isn't the only way Chris has followed his  father's footsteps, however. After graduating from The Citadel, Chris  served 4 years in the Army as an infantry officer. Today, he is  continuing to serve the Bluegrass State as a prominent member of the  Kentucky State Senate. Like so many veterans, both Dan and Chris  continue to make lasting contributions to their community, our  Commonwealth, and this great Nation.   So, on this Veterans Day, I am grateful to all those who served our  country in uniform. Our Commonwealth is made safer because of their  service and stronger because of their example. To Dan and Chris  McDaniel, all Kentucky veterans, and their families, it is an honor to  say thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 5 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
