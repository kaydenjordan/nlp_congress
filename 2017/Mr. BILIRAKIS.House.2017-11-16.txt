 Mr. Speaker, I have supported and continue to support  increased Federal funding for the promising research going on at the  National Institutes of Health in order to encourage more progress  addressing the Alzheimer's situation.   November is National Alzheimer's Disease Awareness Month. There are  an estimated 5.5 million Americans living with this debilitating  disease, and we know it often goes unreported or undiagnosed.   This issue is near and dear to my heart because it has touched my own  family, and I have seen firsthand the challenges of supporting a loved  one battling the disease. I have been frustrated by the lack of  progress.   Again, Mr. Speaker, together, we will improve the quality of life for  those who are suffering and work toward finding a cure. We must have  funding for the NIH to get this done.                            ____________________
