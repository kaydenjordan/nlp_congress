 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Officer  Jordan Harris Sheldon. He was killed in the line of duty during a  routine traffic stop recently. Mr. Sheldon honorably served the  Mooresville Police Department for 6 years as a K-9 officer.   I know that the Mooresville Police Department and the community are  heartbroken by this news, as am I. Our men and women in blue put on the  uniform every day not knowing what their fate could be, yet they  continue to serve their communities without question.   Madam Speaker, I consider myself extremely fortunate to be able to  represent a place like Mooresville in the U.S. Congress, and I know  that I speak for the good folks of Mooresville when I say that Officer  Sheldon will not be forgotten.   I ask Members to join me in praying for Officer Sheldon's family, the  Mooresville Police Department, and the community during this difficult  time.                            ____________________
