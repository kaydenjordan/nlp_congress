 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment is very simple. It would bar  the United States Postal Service from expanding on its current  offerings of financial services and banking products.   I think it is important that the Postal Service focus on its core  business of delivering the mail. While the idea of postal banking is  nothing new, it is still a terrible idea.   In 2015, the inspector general for the Postal Service took the highly  unusual step in proposing that the Postal Service should expand its  banking services in areas like prepaid cards, savings products, and  money orders. Since then, postal banking advocates have used the report  to argue that the Postal Service has the authority to offer more  banking products, all without congressional oversight or consent.  Recent reports indicate that these efforts include using a pilot  program to implement this awful idea. That is the reason why I am  offering my amendment.   To make things even worse, rather than proposing the idea  legislatively, the current strategy of those advocating for postal  banking is to institute the program via behind-the-scenes negotiation  between government bureaucrats and liberal special interest groups.   This amendment draws a clear, bright line that says that no taxpayer  money shall be used to subsidize these quiet attempts at making postal  banking a reality.   Proponents of postal banking argue that it would help the under- banked in this country, but the simple fact is that socialized banking  is not the answer.   Instead, we have to focus on working together in a bipartisan way  around financial innovation as the pathway toward financial inclusion.   Postal banking is a giant step backward. The Postal Service, as I  said, should focus on its core mission of delivering our mail.   Postal banking would simply create yet another government program  that fails to solve the underlying problem.   Further, if Congress does not step in and stop this now, we endanger  our small community banks and credit unions that are already in  trouble, while at the same time putting an additional burden on the  American taxpayer, who will be stuck footing the bill for this horrible  idea.   This amendment protects the American taxpayers from being forced to  finance a terrible idea called postal banking. Its passage would also  maintain the role of Congress in determining the fate of the Postal  Service and postal banking, not government bureaucrats and interest  groups.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of my amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter from the  American Bankers Association, the Credit Union National Association,  the Independent Community Bankers of America, and the National  Association of Federally Insured Credit Unions in support of this  amendment.                                                      July 18, 2018.        Dear Congressman Patrick McHenry: On behalf of our       organizations and the Americans we represent, we write to       express support of your Amendment to Division B, within the       Financial Services and General Government section of H.R.       6147. This amendment would prohibit the use of any taxpayer       funds for postal banking and financial services and prohibit       the creation of any new pilot program that would expand this       business practice through collective bargaining.        While the USPS serves an important role in delivering mail       and packages, we are concerned about expanding the Postal       Service's primary role and allowing the government to compete       with the private sector. This would include lower fees,       subsidized services and even competing based on real estate       and office location.        Consideration of expanding postal operations to engage in       banking and financial services is not a new concept. It has       been touted as a solution to help stabilize the US Postal       Service's financial practices. The cost alone to hire       additional workers and retrain existing employees to offer       banking products would further undermine the Postal Service's       budgetary issues.        Additionally, we have reservations about the ability of the       Postal Service to safeguard customers' identities and       information such as bank accounts and passwords. Regardless       of the federal agency, the government has shown it can be       slow to react to cyber threats, allowing bad actors to access       citizens' private records.        It is clear the US Postal Service's financial health is       troubling. Expanding USPS's operations to compete with       private sector banks and credit unions is not the answer. We,       the undersigned organizations, support your amendment to H.R.       6147 and encourage its inclusion in the final appropriations       legislation.            Sincerely,          Grover G. Norquist, President, Americans for Tax Reform;             Tim Chapman, Executive Director, Heritage Action; Tom             Schatz, President, Council for Citizens Against             Government Waste; Adam Brandon, President,             FreedomWorks; Brandon Arnold, Executive Vice President,             National Taxpayers Union; Kevin Kosar, Vice President             of Policy, R Street Institute; Andrew F.

[[Page H6542]]                                                       July 17, 2018.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: On behalf of       the members of the American Bankers Association, the Credit       Union National Association, the Independent Community Bankers       of America, and the National Association of Federally Insured       Credit Unions, I write to urge the adoption of Congressman       Patrick McHenry's amendment to the Financial Services and       General Government (FSGG) appropriations bill to prohibit the       U.S. Postal Service from providing banking services.        Financial institutions are strongly supportive of the       Postal Service, as one of the largest mailers of any industry       group in America. Physical mail remains an important       communications channel for banks and credit unions. Financial       institutions of all sizes use the mail to communicate with       current and potential customers, to send statements and       receive payments, and to market new products and services to       their customers. Financial companies are also a vital revenue       source for the Postal Service, generating billions of dollars       of annual revenue that supports postal infrastructure. For       these reasons, our members are committed to identifying long-      term solutions to ensure an efficient, self-sustaining, and       affordable U.S. postal system.        Postal banking is not one of those solutions. Although       there have been a number of proposals over the past few years       to turn the U.S. Postal Service into the world's largest       shadow banking system, we are very concerned that allowing       the U.S. Postal Service to provide banking services will be       beyond the Postal Service's core competencies, will raise a       number of serious regulatory and consumer protection       questions, and will present significant competitive issues       for private sector entities. Congress should encourage the       Postal Service to focus on its core business of physical mail       delivery, and not be distracted by expanding the mission to       businesses outside of the Postal Service's area of expertise.        Most significantly, postal banking does not address the       Postal Service's financial challenges, and may well make them       worse. The U.S. Postal Service agrees. The Postal Service has       strongly argued against authority to provide banking       services, noting that providing these products would almost       certainly cause it to lose money:        ``The Postal Service's mission is to provide the American       public with trusted, affordable, universal mail service. Our       core function is delivery, not banking . . . Profit margins       on these financial services businesses across the industry       are very low . . . so even if we achieved $1 billion in       revenue and executed well, our cash position would only       increase by an estimated $100-200 million, which will not       materially change our financial condition--we need to focus       on the core delivery business.''        The Postal Service went on to note that to the extent that       more affordable pricing of financial services is a primary       goal of postal banking efforts, ``[m]ore affordable appears       to mean at a lower price level than the free market provides       today . . . Since established financial services firms make a       slim margin on revenue . . . it seems unlikely that there is       any significant room to lower prices without incurring a       loss, and at a minimum, a lower profit margin.''        No doubt, postal reform is a serious topic that Congress       must confront. We encourage Congress to enact legislation       that would reduce costs and increase efficiencies to put the       U.S. Postal Service on a sound and sustainable financial path       over the long run, but the provision of banking services is       not an acceptable solution. We look forward to continuing to       work with you on postal reform efforts in the coming months,       but urge you to support Congressman McHenry's amendment to       the FSGG appropriations bill to ban the Postal Service from       providing banking services when it is on the House Floor this       week.            Sincerely,        American Bankers Association, Credit Union National       Association, Independent Community Bankers of America,       National Association of Federally Insured Credit Unions.     Mr. Chairman, I submit to you that the Postal Service,  as my colleagues across the aisle say, is a constitutional function. It  is really important that the Postal Service do its mission of  delivering the mail.   What we don't think we should do is give a government bureau, through  a nonlegislative means, the right to expand into nonessential services  for a part of the government that is bleeding money. An institution  that cannot balance its own books should not be getting into the  offering of credit or the movement of money and funds.   While I am in favor of postal reform, and while I support my letter  carriers, I do not favor postal banking. I think it is important for  this Congress to put a note down that we are in opposition to that, and  that is why I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
