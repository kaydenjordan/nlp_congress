 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address an issue of great  importance to all of our constituents: their economic livelihoods. It  has only been 6 months since President Biden took office and already  our country is moving in the wrong direction.   Under President Trump we saw unparalleled economic growth. Now under  President Biden, we are faced with more and more government spending,  fewer and fewer people going back to work, and skyrocketing inflation,  which devalues your money. You can see here, a picture is worth a  thousand words. 4.2 less percent value to your dollar today after all  the spending the government has been doing here lately.   By the end of 2020, the economy was resurgent. And since the economy  was crippled by the initial lock-downs in March and April of 2020,  there had been an improvement in the unemployment rate each month,  until this spring. After 11 months of significant job growth, the  unemployment rate increased this past April for the first time since  last year.   More Americans are getting vaccinated every day and COVID-19  restrictions are being lifted around the country. This should be a time  when the recovery reaches new heights. There were 9.3 million jobs  openings in April. That is more job openings than any other time in the  last year. But those jobs may not get filled any time soon, due to  President Biden and many of my Democrat colleagues' and  [[Page H2886]]  friends' decision here in this Chamber to continue an unsustainable  level of Federal unemployment benefits. Some workers can make more  money on unemployment than going back to work.   Commonsense dictates that if you pay people not to work, they will  take you up on it. Most people will not act against their own economic  interests by working if they can make more money staying home.   The failure of the Biden administration has forced some Governors to  act on their own. So far, 25 States have announced plans to wind down  the extra $300 a week in Federal unemployment benefits.   Governor Jim Justice in my State of West Virginia announced that our  State will join that group here this month, in June. So when Federal  leadership fails, Governors must step up and make the best decisions  for their States.   West Virginia has had a particular problem with worker shortages for  years now. Gil White, who is our State Director of the National  Federation of Independent Businesses, was asked on WV MetroNews about  the worker shortage, and he responded, ``That is not a myth; it's a  reality. I don't care if it's large business or small business  employers. I think there is a common theme that finding workers is very  challenging, to say the least.''   After a tumultuous year with government shutdowns and strict capacity  limits, the last thing small businesses need is a worker shortage that  leaves them unprepared to meet the demands of a reopening economy.   President Biden's solution to this problem, along with every other  problem, seems to be more spending of your hard-earned taxpayer  dollars. But with our budget deficit at an alarming level, and you see  it here how it is just skyrocketing, our budget deficit, more spending  will bring about more problems.   Our debt is currently $28 trillion, and our deficits have grown  substantially larger in the past year due to spending increases in  response to COVID-19. And, yet, President Biden is currently pushing  for more than $4 trillion in new spending. $4 trillion.   President Biden has proposed to build hundreds of thousands of  electric vehicle charging stations, retrofit buildings across America,  to make them greener, and a laundry list of other progressive  priorities.   Despite his sometimes moderate demeanor, President Biden's platform  is far left. President Biden made a long list of promises to the left  wing of his party, like when he said he would ``get rid of fossil  fuels.'' It should come as no surprise that his administration is  shaping up to be the most liberal in recent memory.   We should not keep borrowing money from China in order to spend money  that we don't have here in America. There is a simple solution, unwind  these expensive government programs, continue opening up the economy,  and let people earn a living again. That is our country's path forward.   Mr. Speaker, I have a couple more comments I would like to make on a  separate issue.   I rise today to address the crisis at the southern border. These  images here show children being dropped over the border fence, and show  migrants nearly drowning trying to cross the river on the border.   Ladies and gentlemen, dumping children across a fence like this into  the wilderness is not an immigration policy. That is child abuse. That  is not how we are supposed to do this. It is an outrage. If President  Trump had done that, he would be attacked everywhere.   The border crisis is a humanitarian crisis. Even the President of  Guatemala, Alejandro Giammattei, blamed the Biden administration's open  border messaging calling it ``lukewarm'' and ``confusing.''   He explained this messaging actually increases the number of  unaccompanied minors that are sent out on the journey and are  subsequently trafficked by coyotes and cartels.   Data shows that Customs and Border Patrol agents stopped over 180,000  illegal border crossings in the month of May alone, the highest in over  20 years. Look, we can have our own opinions, but we are not entitled  to our own facts.   This is a crisis, ladies and gentlemen. It is time for America's  border czar, Vice President Kamala Harris, to do her job and address  the humanitarian crisis at the border to protect to lives of these  young children.                                time  2140
