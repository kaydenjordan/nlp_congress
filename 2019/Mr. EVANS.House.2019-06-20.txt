 Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to welcome today's guest  chaplain, who is from my district. Father Shaw is the rector of the  historic African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas in Philadelphia. The  church was founded in 1729 as the first black church in the Episcopal  Church in the United States. It is also the oldest African American  church in Philadelphia.   I have known Father Shaw for many, many years. More recently, I had  the pleasure of working closely with him in the Together for West  Philadelphia initiative, which recently celebrated its first year of  working to improve health and reduce poverty for the residents of West  Philadelphia. That is just one example from his long record of working  for social justice.   I know Father Shaw has previously lived in Detroit and Chicago, but I  am glad that he has chosen to live where America began, in the City of  Brotherly Love and Sisterly Affection.                            ____________________
