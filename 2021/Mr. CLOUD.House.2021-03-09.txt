 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor a  servant-hearted leader who cared deeply for the Victoria, Texas,  community, Mayor Rawley McCoy, who passed away on March 5, 2021.   He will be greatly missed by his family, friends, and those he  represented as mayor and those of us who had the honor to serve  alongside him. A lifelong Victorian, he described our town as a  wholesome community that provided an energetic and joyful childhood.   Long before being elected mayor, he lived and worked to make our  community a better place. He was inspired to become mayor and to make  Victoria, as he said, the kind of place where future generations can  live their American dream. I will miss working with him, as I  appreciated his heart to work with and to collaborate in order to serve  people.   Mr. Speaker, Rawley once said, ``We can never become a great city  until all of us can sit at and are welcome at the table.''   My prayers are with him, his wife, their three children, and all who  had the great pleasure of knowing Mayor Rawley McCoy.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, what we are considering here today with H.R.  8 has been dubbed a universal background check bill, but in reality, it  would criminalize--let me say that again--it would criminalize the  private transfer of firearms.   As part of the march to strip Americans of their guaranteed Second  Amendment right, this gun control bill would make it a crime to sell or  transfer a firearm without first seeking permission from the almighty  Government.   The dirty secret is that the proponents of gun control, Mr. Speaker,  want you to think that this is the end of the road when, in fact, that  is not true. In 2013 President Obama's Department of Justice's National  Institute of Justice said that the effectiveness of universal  background checks depends on requiring gun registration.   So what we are witnessing here today is the first step to requiring a  nationwide gun registration in America.   The Second Amendment to the Constitution says: ``A well regulated  militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of  the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.''   In this Nation of ``We the People,'' we recognize that we as citizens  are not subjects of our government and that our inalienable rights are  not a grant from the government but a gift from God, and to that end  the Second Amendment doesn't grant us a right, but rather those  carefully crafted words acknowledge an already existing right: the  right of the people to possess a firearm.   The Constitution does not say you may or may not be able to own a  firearm, we will circle back with you, we will get back with you on  that.   It doesn't. It guarantees the right.   This bill does nothing to make communities more safe. This is another  overreaching attempt by leftist leaders drunk on unchecked power to  control the lives of freedom-loving citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose this legislation.
