 Mr. President, I rise to draw attention to one  particularly important element of the National Defense Authorization  Act, which sits before this body.   First, it is worth noting that--despite the bizarre dysfunction of  the last couple of days around here--the NDAA is usually a time each  year when the Senate looks like an actual deliberative body. We look  like an actual legislature.   Most of the typical bickering and made-for-TV sound bites get set  aside this week or two every year as we focus on the first purpose of  the Federal Government, which is to provide for the common defense.   The NDAA reveals our shared commitment to the men and women in  uniform who serve our country so well. This legislation aims to  scrutinize and annually reprioritize among the many important tasks  that are going on in the Pentagon and in the broader Department of  Defense.   If we are going to call on the men and women in the armed services  who defend our freedoms to stand ready to defend us and to go into  battle when necessary, we must equip them with the right tools to be  able to get their job done. That is what this legislation is about each  year, but it is not enough to simply be about defending against  traditional enemies and traditional threats. We also need to use this  annual occasion to pause and deeply look at new and emerging threats we  face.   When you ask national security and intelligence experts in private  and in public what keeps them up at night, as I do multiple times every  week--I ask this question of people in the SCIF. You find something  strange in this city. You have an agreement. Public and private sector  experts, legislative and executive branch folks, career folks,  political folks, whether Republican or Democratic, have widespread  agreement that the long-term domain challenge we face is that America  is woefully unprepared for the age of cyber war.   Thirty years ago, when the digital age was still in its infancy and  the first computer viruses and bugs were created, the United States did  not have a cyber doctrine to defend our interests. That was  understandable in 1986 because these were new threats. It doesn't make  any sense in 2018, and yet it is still true. We don't really have any  coherent doctrine to defend our interests. This is inexcusable.   We are, today, overwhelmingly the most advanced digital economy and  digital society in the world. Thus, we are, almost inevitably, the No.  1 target globally for cyber crime, but our adversaries are attacking us  not merely as targets of opportunity, they are also attacking us  because they sense our passivity.   State and nonstate actors alike are becoming regularly more brazen.  Year over year, from 2012 to 2013, to 2014, to 2015, and to the  present, we see this brazen action coming from China, Russia, Iran,  North Korea, and lots of jihadi nonstate actors. Yet we still do not  have a cyber doctrine to guide our planning process, we don't have a  cyber doctrine to guide our actions, and we are unprepared for the  warfare of 2020, 2025, and 2030.   How can this be? How can we lack a strategic plan, not merely to  respond to the attacks against U.S. public and private sector networks  but also to go a step further and deter them in real time? Why do we  lack this plan?   Since joining this body in January of 2015, alongside the Presiding  Officer, I have pushed for a strategic plan that clearly articulates  how we will defend ourselves against the new threats in this cyber  space. Unfortunately, this call has fallen on deaf ears in both the  legislature and the executive branch, both Democratic and Republican  administrations. There is far too little urgency. When you speak with  generals, when you speak with CIA station chiefs around the world,  nobody disputes this. Everyone knows we are unprepared, and we are  underinvested in this domain. Yet no one is really in charge.   Fortunately, we are taking a major step in this NDAA to address this  deficit in our war planning. While no one piece of legislation and no  single proposal can possibly address all of our cyber deficits, there  is, nonetheless, some very good news in this NDAA for both the public  as a whole and those of us who are losing sleep about our cyber  underpreparedness.   The legislation we are debating today, and will vote on in some form  tomorrow, includes a proposal to bring American national security into  the 21st century by establishing a Cyberspace Solarium Commission. This  Commission is modeled after President Dwight Eisenhower's 1953 Project  Solarium. At that time, as the Soviet Union was on the cusp of  achieving a devastating thermonuclear weapon, Ike recognized that our  Nation needed a clear strategy. We needed to be able to defend  ourselves and our allies against the expanding Soviet threat. This is  where both the historian and the strategist in me gets excited.   Never one to lack a plan, Eisenhower sequestered three different  teams of experts at the National War College for 6 weeks. He tasked  them with articulating a menu of large-scale, strategic frameworks for  the age of nuclear confrontation. The result of Ike's competitive  effort was a new national security directive, NSC 162/2, that charted a  course that would successfully guide U.S. policy and bureaucratic  development over many decades of the Cold War.   We desperately need similar strategic clarity today. The threats to  American security are actually even more dynamic and unpredictable than  in those early years of the Cold War. Then there were giant  technological and scale barriers to becoming a nuclear power; whereas,  today, launching a cyber attack that has global reach requires only  some coding capability, a laptop, and an internet connection.  [[Page S3928]]    This new group, the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, will be made up  of 13 members, putting cyber and national security experts, along with  many Silicon Valley types, in the same room to debate, to think  through, and to propose a comprehensive path forward to guide our cyber  policy.   One of the reasons Ike's Solarium Commission worked so well was  because there was urgency and focus. Under this Cyberspace Solarium  Commission, there will be a deadline for the delivery of a  comprehensive plan with blue sky freedom to reenvision all current  bureaucracies and organizations across our cyber plan and response  units within 1 year.   By September 1, 2019, this Commission would be delivering to both the  President's Cabinet and to the defense and intelligence committees of  the Congress a comprehensive plan to guide cyber security policymaking  going forward.   We cannot continue to stand idly by waiting for a massive cyber  attack to occur and then figure out how we will use that as a catalyst  to begin future planning. We should be planning and prioritizing before  the crisis. For 30 years, we haven't yet developed or committed to a  serious strategy. Now is the time to act, and this NDAA represents one  of the best innovations we have had; that we can set up this national  Cyberspace Solarium Commission to report back, within 1 year, a  comprehensive plan.   Thank you.                            ____________________
