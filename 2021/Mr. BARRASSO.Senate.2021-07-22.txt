 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to oppose the  nomination of Tracy Stone-Manning to be the Director of the Bureau of  Land Management.   This morning, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted  on her nomination. Every Republican on the committee voted no. Before  our business meeting was over, Senator Schumer came to this floor, to  that desk, and he praised this nominee to the skies. President Biden  and the Democrats have wrapped their arms around this nomination, and  they won't let go.   So the question is, Who is this nominee whom the Democrats are  embracing and every Republican voted against? Well, Tracy Stone-Manning  is a graduate student who collaborated with ecoterrorists. Now, these  are people who hammered hundreds of metal spikes--500 pounds of metal  spikes--into trees in our national forest in Idaho. This is the kind of  metal spike that they used--10 inches long, very thick; 500 pounds of  these into the national forest.   Tree spiking involves nailing, hammering these rods into a tree. What  happened? Why did they do that? Well, they want to stop progress in  terms of logging. They want to stop progress in terms of firefighting.  Because if a logger or a firefighter were to hit this rod with a chain  saw, the chain saw would shatter. Devastating injuries have occurred as  a result. If the saws used in timber mills or sawmills were to hit one  of these as they are planing through the tree to produce boards, the  entire blade shatters. It has been described to me by someone who has  worked in one of these mills--it is like a hand grenade going off,  damaging people all around in the vicinity. Well, the results can be  fatal, and there are examples around the country where this has  actually happened. Now, even the Washington Post has labeled tree  spiking as ecoterrorism.   Tracy Stone-Manning, as a member of a radical group, edited, typed,  and then anonymously sent a profanity-laced letter threatening the U.S.  Forest Service. Here are just a few quotes from the letter.   She typed:         You bastards go in there anyway and a lot of people could       get hurt.    She typed:         I would be more than willing to pay you a dollar for the       sale, but you would have to find me first and that could be       your WORST nightmare.    This is the letter she typed to the U.S. Forest Service. She then  mailed this threatening letter to the target of the tree spiking, and  the target was the U.S. Forest Service.   She and her circle were investigated. They were investigated for  their involvement with this ring of ecoterrorists and this ecoterrorist  attack that actually occurred to the U.S. forest. She was subpoenaed.  She was ordered to give hair sampling, palm sampling, handwriting  sampling, and fingerprint samples to the investigators.   She knew full well who the tree spikers were, and she could have  easily gone to the authorities to identify them. She didn't. She  covered it up for 4 years. She refused to cooperate with investigators.   Recently, within the last couple of months, Tracy Stone-Manning came  before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. She came  for her confirmation hearing. Since that hearing and the statements  that she made to the committee and affidavit she swore under oath and  signed,  [[Page S5035]]  since that time, in the last couple of months and more recently than  that--actually last week in one case--several people involved in her  original case have come forward to the press and to the committee to  set the record straight from the record and the story that she told the  committee at the time.   So the lead investigator on this case wrote a letter to Chairman  Manchin and to me. I am the ranking member on the committee. That  investigator, who I will tell you has worked as a special criminal  investigator for the U.S. Government for 28 years, has been a longtime  member of the U.S. military, served in Vietnam, and retired as a  criminal investigator because of death threats made to him and to his  family by the group who worked on this ecoterrorism--he retired from  that. But he wrote to the committee. He came forward, and he said that  she was the nastiest of suspects. He said that not only did she have  knowledge of the plan to spike the trees, he said she was one of the  planners.    He wrote to us and said:         It became clear that Ms. Stone-Manning was an active member       of the original group that planned the spiking of the Post       Office Timber Sale.    So there he is, a criminal investigator. Then just last week, one of  the convicted tree spikers, one of the people who actually went to jail  because of that--he came forward in an interview in the press. In an  interview with E&E News, the convicted tree spiker confirmed that Tracy  Stone-Manning knew of the plan to spike the trees, in his words, ``well  in advance.''   Now, according to the investigator's letter, Ms. Stone-Manning's lack  of cooperation actually set back their initial investigation many  years. Eventually, when she was identified and received an  investigation target letter, she had to make a decision. The lead  investigator said she only agreed to testify after she was caught and  after her lawyer negotiated an immunity deal.   Tracy Stone-Manning--she helped plan the tree spiking. She covered up  for the terrorists and their activity for years. She refused to  cooperate with authorities, and she only testified when she was caught  and given immunity.   After all this, she created a story and lied to our committee about  the incident. On a sworn affidavit to her committee questionnaire, she  said it was an alleged tree spiking and that she was not the subject of  an investigation.   I specifically asked her: Did you have personal knowledge of,  participate in, or in any way directly or indirectly support activities  associated with the spiking of trees in any forest during your  lifetime? Her response under oath was no.   Both the cop, the criminal investigator, and the criminal, the man  who went to jail as the group went to jail for this--they both came  forward after her hearing to say that Tracy Stone-Manning was lying to  the Senate.   Over the past 30 years, she has made contradictory statements about  the ecoterrorist incident and the network. In 2013, she told a Montana  State Senate committee that she was intimidated into sending the letter  by a stranger. Yet, in courtroom testimony, she admitted that the tree  spikers were her friends. She was one of the ring leaders of the group.   There are many qualified Democrats who could run the Bureau of Land  Management. Within the Federal Government, this is the group who  oversees one-eighth of all the land in the United States. It is  astonishing to me that Democrats are digging in to defend a proven liar  and an ecoterrorist collaborator.   So Senator Schumer came to the floor today and made it very clear  that he is going to support this deeply flawed nominee. Will other  Democrats do it as well? Will other Democrats who have millions of  acres of BLM land in their States--will they join him?   Things have certainly changed, and it is interesting what has  happened to the Bureau of Land Management and the nominees, because  President Obama's BLM Director, Bob Abbey, came forward. He said that  her actions should disqualify her from leading this important Agency.  We are talking about President Obama's Director of the Bureau of Land  Management says her history and her past and her activities should  disqualify her.   One Biden administration official admitted to NBC News--this was in  the last week--her nomination was described as ``a massive vetting  failure''--``a massive vetting failure.''   Now, there is going to be more to say about this nominee when an  attempt is made to discharge her out of the committee, if they get to  that point, a cloture vote on the floor, and again, a vote on  confirmation. Lots to be said. More information will come out.   It is just hard for me, as the ranking member of that committee, to  imagine a nominee more disqualified than Tracy Stone-Manning. She has  collaborated with ecoterrorists, she has lied to the Senate, and she  continues to harbor truly extremist views that most Americans find  reprehensible.   I strongly oppose her nomination. I urge all of my colleagues to do  the same. Tracy Stone-Manning is unfit to serve.   I yield the floor.
