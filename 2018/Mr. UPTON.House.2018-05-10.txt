 Mr. Chairman, I particularly commend  John Shimkus, the  chairman of the subcommittee, who helped shepherd this bill through;  Chairman Walden; Ranking Member Pallone and others; Mr. Tonko. It is  truly a bipartisan work of art; 49-4 is what this bill passed in our  committee.   I can remember way back when when President Reagan was in office and  signing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act in the Rose Garden. He said: We  are going to keep our promise. The Federal Government is going to take  care of nuclear waste. That is going to happen.   Well, here we are now nearly 50 years later. I can remember the  Upton-Towns bill back in the 1990s, a bill that did very much along the  lines of what this bil does. We came within just a vote or two of  having it overridden by the U.S. Senate, stopping it in its tracks. So,  decades later, here we are again.    In my district, we have two nuclear plants. Both of them have run out  of room in their storage, so they have dry casks that are literally a   John Shimkus baseball throw away from Lake Michigan.   Every one of these 100-some sites across the country is in an  environmentally sensitive area, and at some point they are going to run  out of room. In Michigan, we have got two other sites that also have  dry casks in addition to the two in my district.   So we spent nearly $40 billion. Enough time has gone by. We need to  deal with this. And for those who are against this bill, your  alternative is just keeping it there--just keeping it in California,  just keeping it on that pristine river, just keep it on the Great Lakes  for however long. That is not the answer. This bill is.   Because it is bipartisan, I am confident that not only will we have  the votes to get this thing through today, but we are going to get it  ultimately to the President.   So, again, I want to thank our leadership on both sides of the aisle  for getting this thing done.
