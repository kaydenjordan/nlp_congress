 Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today, I am pleased to honor Malvagio's Restaurant as the Idaho Small  Business of the Month for April 2022.   Malvagio's Restaurant brings a taste of Italy to Coeur d'Alene with  their sampling of hand-crafted wood-fired pizzas, pastas, salads, and  breads. With a dream of bringing their community together with food and  a passion for the tradition of wood-fired cooking, owners Svitlana and  Matthew Petersen dedicated a year to perfecting the craft and designing  an innovative, mobile wood-fired oven. Using this unique oven as the  cornerstone of their restaurant, the couple founded Malvagio's in 2016.   In the 5 years since Malvagio's first opened its doors, the  restaurant has become a mainstay of the Coeur d'Alene community. While  they have brought smiles to countless faces in their mom-and-pop  restaurant, the Petersen's mobile wood-fired oven has allowed the  business to branch into catering. Today, Malvagio's pizzas are a common  sight at weddings, parties, and other celebrations across northern  Idaho. Thanks to this growth, the restaurant now employs eight Idahoans  and is the official dealer of Forno Bravo wood-fired ovens in Idaho.   Malvagio's success is matched only by the Petersen's dedication to  giving back. As the world watched Russia's invasion of Ukraine,  Svitlana--a Ukrainian native--and Matthew began serving an authentic  Ukrainian dish at Malvagio's. During the week of March 2, 2022, all  proceeds from each purchase of a cup of borscht, a Ukrainian beetroot  soup, were donated to Ukrainian humanitarian needs. By virtue of these  efforts, Malvagio's has raised thousands of dollars in support of  Ukraine and has become a champion of Idahoan entrepreneurship and  philanthropy.   Congratulations to Svitlana, Matthew, and all of the employees at  Malvagio's Restaurant for being selected as the Idaho Small Business of  the Month for April 2022. You make our great State proud, and I look  forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
