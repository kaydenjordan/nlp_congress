 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday, new data showed what Texans  have known and felt for months: that inflation simply is not letting  up. Last month, prices were up 8.3 percent from a year ago.   Economist Larry Summers, a well-known former president of Harvard  University and member of Presidential Cabinets, said that this CPI  report, Consumer Price Index report, confirms that the United States  has a serious inflation problem.   Rent is up 6.7 percent. If you go to the grocery store to feed your  family, groceries are 13.5 percent over what they were last year. If  you are a senior citizen suffering through the hot Texas summer and  need your air-conditioner to work overtime, electricity to make that  air-conditioner run is up 16 percent. Of course, that is just since  last August, just a year ago, when we were already battling runaway  inflation.   But here is an even more shocking figure: Since President Biden took  office on January 20, 2021, prices have risen 13 percent. So 13 cents  out of every dollar that you earn--poof--has gone away. You are that  much poorer. Your standard of living has been decreased by 13 percent.   Inflation, of course, far outpaces wage growth, meaning the average  American has effectively been handed a pay cut. A single paycheck  doesn't go nearly as far today as it did a year ago.   This is exactly what was predicted by leading economists when our  Democratic colleagues ran off with the taxpayer credit card at the end  of last year. They abused the rules of the Senate to spend an  additional $2 trillion in the name of COVID relief even though less  than 10 percent of the money was directly related to the pandemic.   I want to differentiate between what we did together on a bipartisan  basis to deal with COVID when we spent nearly $5 trillion on a  bipartisan basis. There is no doubt this was a grave emergency, a  public health emergency, economic emergency. We did what we had to do,  and we got through it. But even after that, our Democratic colleagues  couldn't seem to kick the spending habits and unilaterally spent an  extra $2 trillion. As I said, even though 10 percent of that money was  related to the pandemic, 90 percent, then, was unrelated.   Then the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which the President was  celebrating yesterday when the stock market fell 1,200 points--this  partisan bill amounts to another $240 billion in unnecessary spending,  while raising taxes at the same time.   As I said, our colleagues ironically call this bill the Inflation  Reduction Act, and the White House chose yesterday--the day that the  latest disappointing inflation figures were released--to celebrate its  passage.   Inflation Reduction Act is false advertising. The Penn Wharton  economic review of the Inflation Reduction Act said there is no  reduction of inflation for at least 2 full years, and, indeed, it may  actually get worse. But we all knew this intuitively, that if you keep  spending this much money, you are basically pouring gasoline on the  inflation fire. It is going to get worse and worse and worse, and  middle-class working families all across this country have gotten hurt  as a result.   Since our Democratic colleagues took control of both Houses of  Congress and the White House, Texans' lives have gotten harder, not  easier. Inflation I have spoken to has skyrocketed, real wages have  fallen, and our economy has fallen into a recession.   Now, this is one of the other curious things about defining terms.  Our Democratic colleagues want to argue about whether two consecutive  quarters of negative GDP are actually a recession or not. Well, they  were when Republicans were in charge, but apparently when Democrats are  in charge, that definition doesn't apply.   Much as they tried but failed to convince the American people that  the Inflation Reduction Act would actually reduce inflation, it didn't,  and it won't anytime soon.   Well, we know that the response to inflation by the Federal Reserve  has been to raise interest rates, and they are projected to raise them  at least three-quarters of 1 percent or 75 basis points, which will  also slow down the economy and hurt job creation. So it looks like even  more pain is coming.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print my bill  for introduction in the Congressional Record. The bill requires a study  of the programs, acquisitions, and budget of the Department of Defense.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4853         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``American Defense Programs,       Logistics, and Acquisitions for our Nation's Security Act of       2022'' or the ``American Defense PLANS Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. STUDY OF THE PROGRAMS, ACQUISITIONS, AND BUDGET OF                     THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE.         (a) In General.--The Secretary of Defense shall seek to       enter into an arrangement with a federally funded research       and development center under which the center will--        (1) conduct a study of the programs, acquisitions, and       budget of the Department of Defense; and        (2) make recommendations with respect to how the Department       can ensure that program development cycles and acquisition of       new technologies within the Department can best keep pace       with the increasing rate at which technologies acquired for       programs of the Department become outdated or are replaced by       new technologies.        (b) Report Required.--Not later than one year after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit       to Congress a report on the study required by subsection (a).                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print my bill  for introduction in the Congressional Record.
