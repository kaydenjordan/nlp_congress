 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment funds ongoing efforts to assess the  viability of using low-enriched uranium fuel in naval reactors,  including those in aircraft carriers and submarines, something this  Congress has supported for many years now.   The United States has demonstrated strong leadership to minimize, and  wherever possible all but eliminate, the use of highly enriched uranium  for civilian purposes. Doing so reduces the risk of nuclear terrorism  and makes clear that the accumulation of HEU is solely for nuclear  weapons purposes, undercutting any nation's argument that they need it  for anything else.   Using low-enriched uranium, or LEU, in naval reactor fuel can bring  significant national security benefits with respect to nuclear  nonproliferation, lower security costs, and put naval reactor research  and development at the cutting edge of science. Pursuing the  development of LEU fuel offers the opportunity to achieve  transformational progress on fuel technology.   Additionally, unless an alternative using low-enriched uranium fuel  is developed in the coming decades, the United States will have to  resume production of bomb-grade uranium for the first time since 1992,  ultimately undermining U.S. nonproliferation efforts.   Using LEU for naval reactors is not a pipe dream. France's nuclear  Navy already has converted from using HEU to using LEU fuel for its  vessels. We must evaluate the feasibility of a similar transition for  the U.S. Navy and take into account the potential benefits to the U.S.  and international security of setting a norm of using LEU instead of  nuclear bomb-grade material.                                time  1600    As America confronts the threat of nuclear terrorism and as countries  continue to enrich uranium for naval purposes, the imperative to reduce  the use of HEU will become increasingly important over the next several  decades.   As such, as I said, Congress has sought to advance these efforts in a  bipartisan, bicameral way over the last several years by evaluating the  potential of utilizing LEU fuel in reactors for U.S. Navy aircraft  carriers and submarines.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5623]]         Mr. Chair, let me say that we can't fear the future. We  must invest in research and development.   I want to point out that the then-chair, the Naval Reactors Director,  Admiral Richardson, testified before the House Armed Services  Committee. He said, with current technology, ``the potential exists  that we could develop an advanced fuel system that might increase  uranium loading and make low-enriched uranium possible while still  meeting some very rigorous performance requirements for naval reactors  on nuclear-powered warships.''   To address the concerns of my colleague, I want to mention that this  House has already included $20 million for this research in the Energy  and Water appropriations package that passed the House on June 19,  which also included a $15 million increase to NNSA Federal salaries and  expenses over fiscal year 2019.   These spending levels have already been set by the House. This  amendment simply matches the authorization level with the House-passed  appropriations level.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time remains on both  sides.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Foster), who is the House's only nuclear physicist.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this en bloc package, and I would  also like to speak in favor of en bloc package No. 10, which includes  four of my amendments.   The first would mandate that the President provide Congress with a  copy of National Security Presidential Memorandums related to military  operations in cyberspace.   Congress has a vital role to play in ensuring that offensive cyber  operations do not inadvertently undermine stability in cyberspace.  Unfortunately, the White House has continuously stymied our efforts and  attempts to conduct this constitutionally-protected oversight, refusing  to provide important policy documents that took effect nearly a year  ago.   Ironically, I have largely supported the administration's more  forward-leaning posture, but regardless of my feelings towards the  underlying strategy, it is unacceptable that the White House continues  to stonewall our attempts to oversee sensitive operations. This  amendment will stop that obstruction.   A second amendment ensures that new software acquisition pathways  will include cybersecurity metrics. I strongly support updating how the  Pentagon buys software, but it is important that we have explicit  measures of the security of the code that we are buying.   Now, I hope that this amendment will both drive the adoption of  metrics related to common software weaknesses and lead to broader  changes, such as increased use of type-safe programming languages.   Finally, this package includes two amendments related to our Special  Operations Forces.   The first extends by 3 years a relatively new irregular warfare  authority, which is designed to address threats in the gray zone below  the level of armed conflict in order to gauge its use and  effectiveness.   The second would strengthen requirements that the Department notify  Congress before exercising a counterterrorism authority referred to as  127 Echo. This authority has proven its worth over the last decade, but  I believe that we must continue to improve our rigorous oversight to  ensure appropriate use.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this en bloc package and my  amendments in en bloc package No. 10.
