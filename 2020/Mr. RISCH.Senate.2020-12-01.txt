Transmittal No. 20-84       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Modernized Bradley M2 components which are       considered to contain sensitive technology are as follow:        a. Exportable version of the Second Generation Thermal       ``Night Vision'' Viewer, also known as the Second-Generation       Forward Looking infrared (SG-FLIR). For the Modernized       Bradley M2, the SG-FLIR system includes:        (1) Improved Bradley Acquisition Subsystem (IBAS) is a       second-generation forward looking infrared (FLIR) and an       electro-optical/TV imaging system. The IBAS has direct-view       optics (DVO) and the eye-safe laser rangefinder (ELRF). The       IBAS interfaces with the Bradley fire control system and can       be used for surveillance and as a back-up engagement sight       for the commander.        (2) Commander's Independent Thermal Viewer (CIV) is another       version of the second-generation forward looking infrared       (FLIR) and an electro-optical/TV imaging system. The CIV       allows the commander to scan for targets and maintain       situational awareness while remaining under armor and without       interfering with the gunner's acquisition and engagement of       targets.        (3) High Definition (HD) Long-Wave SG-FLIR sight is       currently under development for the Bradley Fighting Vehicle.       The HD Long-wave FLIR is being developed as an eventual       upgrade to the capability of the IBAS and CIV. This case may       include the non-recurring engineering costs associated with       developing an exportable version of HD Long-wave FLIR for       International use.        b. Exportable version of the Drivers Vision Enhancer (DVE),       the ``Night Vision'' Viewer utilized by the Bradley drivers       is a passive thermal imaging system, or ``night vision''       device used to enhance a driver's viewing capabilities while       operating during degraded visual conditions, such as       darkness, fog, smoke or dust. It provides for an improved       situational awareness, applicable to both driving and       surveillance. The DVE system consists of a Display Control       Module (DCM), Sensor Module (SM), and Pan and Tilt Modules       (PTM). The DVE is currently available in the standard and       wide (DVE-Wide) configurations. The DVE-Wide provides drivers       with wider fields of view.        c. Exportable version of the Inertial Navigation Unit (INU)       is a navigation device that uses motion sensors or       accelerometers and rotation sensors or gyroscopes to       continuously calculate the position, the orientation, and the       velocity of Bradley vehicle without the need for external       references. It is a supplementary, and complementary to the       global positioning system (GPS). In the event of a lack of a       GPS signal, the INU maintains position, velocity, and       situational awareness.        d. The Radio Frequency TOW 2A (RF) Missile (BGM-71E-4B-RF)       is a direct attack missile designed to defeat armored       vehicles, reinforced urban structures, field fortification  [[Page S7134]]       and other such targets. TOW Missiles are fired from a variety       of TOW Launchers in the U.S. Army, USMC and FMS customer       forces. The TOW 2A RF missile can be launched from the same       launcher platforms as the existing wire-guided TOW 2A missile       without modification to the launcher. The TOW 2A missile       (both wire and RF) contains two tracker beacons (Xenon and       thermal) for the launcher to track and guide the missile in       flight. Guidance commands from the launcher are provided to       the missile by the RF link contained within the missile case.       The hardware, software, and technical publications provided       with the sale thereof are unclassified. However, the system       itself contains sensitive technology that instructs the       system on how to operate in the presence of countermeasures.        e. The Radio Frequency TOW 2B (RF) Missile (BGM-71F-3-RF)       is a fly-over shootdown missile designed to defeat armored       vehicles. TOW Missiles are fired from a variety of TOW       Launchers in the U.S. Army, USMC and FMS customer forces. The       TOW 2B RF missile can be launched from the same launcher       platforms as the existing wire-guided TOW 2B missile without       modification to the launcher. The TOW 2B missile (both wire       and RF) contains two tracker beacons (Xenon and thermal) for       the launcher to track and guide the missile in flight.       Guidance commands from the launcher are provided to the       missile by the RF link contained within the missile case. The       hardware, software, and technical publications provided with       the sale thereof are unclassified. However, the system itself       contains sensitive technology that instructs the system on       how to operate in the presence of countermeasures.        f. The Radio Frequency TOW Bunker Buster (BB) Missile (BGM-      71H-1-RF) is a variant of the TOW 2A that replaces the TOW 2A       warhead with a high explosive blast-fragmentation warhead.       The bulk charge warhead is effective against reinforced       concrete walls, light armored vehicles, and earth and timber       bunkers. Guidance commands from the launcher are provided to       the missile by the RF link contained within the missile case.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems which might reduce weapon system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that Croatia can provide       the same degree of protection for the sensitive technology       being released as the U.S. Government. This sale is necessary       in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national       security objectives outlined in the enclosed Policy       Justification.        5.
