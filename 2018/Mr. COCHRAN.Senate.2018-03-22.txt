 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to express  my deep gratitude for the honor given to me by the people of  Mississippi to represent them in Washington.   I leave the Senate with confidence that our enduring Constitution  guards our country from human error, empowers our citizens to achieve  greatness, and shines as a beacon of freedom and liberty for the world.  [[Page S1899]]    I am optimistic about the future of our great Nation and in the U.S.  Senate's role in determining that future.   While in Congress, I have served with nine Presidents during times of  conflict and peace. We have debated policies from trade to taxes to  terrorism. We have engaged in heated arguments. But even in full  disagreement, I believe all our motivations begin at the same point:  the sincere desire to serve our States and country.   No one remains in the House or Senate who was here when I first took  office in January 1973, but I am particularly thankful for the  friendship and leadership of the senior Senator from Vermont, Mr.  Leahy. He and I have fought side by side with each other and sometimes  face to face against each other, always with friendship and respect.   I am also grateful to have served with honorable Senators from my  State. My colleague, Senator Wicker, has been a friend and a strong and  effective advocate for our State. We have worked together not only in  the Senate, but also when he served as a U.S. Representative. Former  Majority Leader Trent Lott continues to be a voice in our national  conversation. And the late John C. Stennis provided a witness to  integrity when I first joined this body. His signature is above my  signature at this desk.   It is a tradition in the Senate, like schoolchildren used to do, to  sign the drawers of our desks. Senator Stennis signed this desk drawer.  He noted the beginning of his service in 1947 and added a dash. He  never filled in the date signifying the end of his Senate service in  1989. Perhaps there is symbolism there, that our service does not end  when we depart this Chamber.   I have been honored by this body to serve as chairman both of the  Appropriations and Agriculture Committees. I am thankful to my  colleagues, past and present, and to the committee staff for assisting  in crafting responsible funding priorities for our country and for  developing strategic agriculture policy to ensure the best use of our  natural resources to provide affordable and healthy food for our  citizens and people around the world.   I thank my talented and dedicated staff, many of whom have worked for  many years in service to our country. All of us in this body know we  could not achieve our priorities without exceptional staff. I have  staff members who have served the Senate since my first term. I have  one staff member, Doris Wagley, who was already in the office working  the very first day I showed up for work in the House of Representatives  in 1973. Whether they have been here for 45 years or a shorter tenure,  I am grateful for their good assistance.   I ran my first Senate reelection campaign in 1984, largely on  constituent service. I will always be proud of my State staff for their  work on behalf of Mississippians. State staff help us keep our promises  to our veterans, find opportunities for small businesses, ensure the  elderly or infirmed receive care, and cut through bureaucracy. I am  sure members of your State staffs, like my staff, have hearts for their  fellow citizens, regardless of their political affiliation.   All our citizens have the right to be heard and to have a voice in  their government. I believe our job as their servants is not to tell  others what to think or tell others what to do. Our job is to represent  them. I have endeavored to do that the best way I possibly could; and  now the time has come for me to pass the power granted by the people of  Mississippi, the power of service, to someone else.   When John Sharp Williams of Mississippi left the Senate, he delivered  a farewell speech at a dinner organized by the Mississippi Society of  Washington. It is sometimes called the ``Mockingbird Speech.'' While I  do not share some of the cynicism of that speech, there are sentiments  I can appreciate. Here is an excerpt of that speech given March 3,  1923:         I am going back to Yazoo City and to my old home on a rural       free-delivery route. I want to get up again each morning as I       hear the rooster's crow . . . and as night and the time for       bed approaches, I will listen to the greatest chorus of       voices that man ever heard, music that will charm me and make       me ready for repose, the voices of my mockingbirds trilling       in the trees. And in that way I want to live the rest of my       life, and when the end comes, I hope to be carried out of the       house by my neighbors and laid to rest among my people. Now,       some may say that is not a very wonderful future, all of this       I have mapped out for myself, but I say there is merit in       calm retirement . . . Perhaps it is a sign that I ought to       retire, for retirement brings repose, and repose allows a       kindly judgment of all things.    I will now return to my beloved Mississippi and my family and friends  there. I will miss this stately Chamber and this city. I will not miss  this power or politics. I will miss people: you, my colleagues. I will  treasure your courtesy and kindness. I trust, if your travels bring you  to Oxford, MS, you will not hesitate to visit and join me for a  refreshment on the porch. We can listen to the mockingbirds together.   Thank you.
