 Mr. Speaker, we all agree that every American should be  compensated for the quality of their work and not face discrimination  in the workplace based on race, color, national origin, religion, or  sex.   That is why Congress passed the Equal Pay Act in 1963 and broader  nondiscrimination laws under title VII of the Civil Rights Act the  following year.   However, unlike those bills, H.R. 7 offers no new protections. It is  simply a messaging bill to score political points.   What will the bill actually do? For job creators, they can expect  more lawsuits and more regulatory burdens.   While limiting legal options for women by changing EPA class action  lawsuits from an opt-in system to a mandatory opt-out system, H.R. 7  allows trial lawyers to pursue unlimited compensatory damages, making  it nearly impossible for employers to defend against frivolous  lawsuits.   Additionally, it requires employers to make intrusive data  disclosures to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regarding  the sex, race, and national origin of employees and, for the first  time, the hiring, termination, and promotion data of those employees,  ultimately posing a threat to workers' privacy.   The compliance costs to satisfy these requirements can total more  than $600 million a year. We have already seen a number of small  businesses forced to close this year because of COVID lockdowns, and  now my Democratic colleagues want to impose more regulatory burdens on  businesses that were lucky enough to survive.   Thankfully, my colleague from New York, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik,  has a solution that will actually address pay discrimination and  support women in the workplace. The Wage Equity Act protects workers'  privacy by encouraging voluntary pay analysis while bolstering women's  employment through the creation of a grant program for women in college  or career and technical programs to provide negotiation skills  education.   I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 7 and work with Republicans on  meaningful legislation to ensure all workers have the opportunity and  wages they deserve.                                time  1315
