 Mr. Speaker, a day that the farmers of Pennsylvania's  11th Congressional District have been looking forward to is finally  here. Today marks the day the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or  USMCA, goes into effect.   Over a year ago, I stood here in the Chamber and said one thing I can  tell you about the farmers of the 11th District is that they adapt and  hold on to hope that better times are yet to come. With the USMCA now  in effect, better times are indeed on the way.   I am very proud to represent Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional  District. It is the number one district for agricultural production in  Pennsylvania.   The USMCA is a win for farmers, with a number of provisions included  that will give the farmers in my district a level playing field and  open new  [[Page H2993]]  markets as well. These reforms were critical for the district, which,  by the way, is the number two producer of eggs in the Nation and also a  top dairy producer.   So, again, I would like to thank the President and his administration  for their willingness to listen to the farmers in my district and to  ensure that USMCA is a win not only for farmers, but for manufacturers  and employees in my district as well.                            ____________________
