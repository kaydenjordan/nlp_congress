 Madam President, today the prayers of the Senate extend  to all of those impacted by the deadly tornadoes that broke out across  the South and Midwest over the weekend. We pray and mourn especially  for the people of Kentucky, where far too many lives have been lost and  the full extent of the damage has yet to be determined.   Over the weekend, President Biden declared a state of emergency in  Kentucky, authorizing FEMA to coordinate disaster relief and provide  emergency assistance. He also announced he will travel this week to  Kentucky to assess the damage and receive briefings of recovery  efforts.   It is likely that the storms from this weekend will go down as some  of the worst tornado outbreaks on record, and with heavy hearts we will  continue to monitor rescue and first response efforts in the coming  days.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.
