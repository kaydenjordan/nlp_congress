 Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from the  great State of Iowa for bringing forth her three r's. I think they are  very succinct. They are the message that certainly I want to convey  with my colleague from the great State of Florida here today: respect  the science, reopen the schools safely, and return students, teachers,  and learning to the classroom.   A year ago, we were only just starting to realize what COVID-19 was  about, almost a year to this date practically. Yet no one could have  foreseen that many children would leave their classrooms in 2020 and  still not have returned in March of 2021.   Fortunately, during these past few months, we have come a long way in  our knowledge of COVID-19. We knew little about how the virus spread  when most schools closed last March, but now experts have had the  opportunity to learn more about the spread of the disease, specifically  as it would spread in a K-12 school environment.   At the end of January, the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, published data showing that in-person learning for K-12  students with limited in-school COVID-19 spread is, indeed, possible.  The schools studied adhered to the public health practices many of us  have followed--wearing a mask, social distancing, washing hands,  avoiding large groups, and quarantining after exposure to the virus.   Since this data was released, CDC has gone on and issued additional  guidance for reopening our schools. This guidance focuses on many of  the same public health strategies as well as cleaning facilities and  additional ventilation.   In addition to the improved knowledge of how COVID-19 affects our  schools, we also have safe and effective vaccines. By enabling our  teachers and other education professionals to have the vaccine on a  priority basis, we continue to forge ahead with reopening our schools.   Yesterday, Dr. Clay Marsh, who is our State's coronavirus czar--he  has done an incredibly great job. He has also led our efforts in our  successful vaccine efforts. And I want to remind the Nation that West  Virginia is No. 1 in vaccine distribution per capita. We have done a  fantastic job.   Dr. Marsh said yesterday:         The classroom is a safe place to be.    He continued by saying:         The K-8 classroom--there is a tremendous amount of really       good data to suggest that it is even a safer place to be than       staying in your community.    Following these comments, our State's board of education voted in  favor of our students in kindergarten through eighth grade returning to  a full 5-day, in-person learning. It had some blended, some in class,  and some at home.   While data we have seen makes a very compelling case for why we can  get children safely back into the classroom with the right mitigations,  other realities make it even more necessary.   With the option of remote learning at home, there are still many  children--especially in States like mine, West Virginia--who struggle  with connectivity. Despite robust funding from Congress to attempt to  address these issues, the digital divide is very real, and it begins to  exacerbate the have-and-have-not phenomenon. As a result, these  children can be affected for years.   I hear concerns from parents all over my State. Last year, I had a  Mercer County principal tell me that many of the students' parents in  their class had to drive their students to a parking lot of a fast food  restaurant so they could get Wi-Fi so they could do their homework.   A constituent from Lewis County recently wrote to my office  expressing her frustration with balancing her work with also the remote  learning that her children are doing. To make matters worse, they can't  get on the internet at the same time in their home.   Another parent from Berkeley County wrote to me with a heartbreaking  story about how her daughter cries at the computer because she requires  extra help on certain assignments. Parents helping their children on  schoolwork can only go so far. In-person attention is absolutely  necessary and something that the internet can't solve through a Zoom  meeting or a video meeting or what a lot of this is--going to certain  assignments on your computer where there is nobody to interact with  whatsoever.   These are very real concerns that parents have, a fear that their  children will fall behind and are falling behind without access to  their schoolwork.   Even more disturbing are the concerns I have heard from child abuse  advocates throughout our State. The heightened stress, school closures,  loss of income, and social isolation from this pandemic have increased  the risk of child abuse and neglect. Yet, without the safe space of the  school and the watchful eyes of our teachers and other caring  professionals, I fear too many children are falling through the cracks  and would have nowhere to turn   Last week, our West Virginia DHHR deputy secretary said there were  8,000 fewer referrals to child protective services this year in our  State. Sadly, we know it is not because it is not occurring; it is  because teachers and school employees aren't there to notice the abuse  and neglect and report it. This is where our teachers are so incredibly  caring and invaluable.   According to data from the CDC, between April and October of 2020,  emergency departments nationwide have experienced a rise in the share  of total visits from children with mental health needs. In my State of  West Virginia, our State board of education has reported a spike in  attempted suicides in Cabell County.   In addition, parents have had to make hard decisions as they attempt  to balance their careers with their children's education, especially  more difficult for those parents of younger children who can't leave  their child at home for any period of time as they are doing their  schoolwork.   As more workers are being asked to physically return to their  workplaces, the lack of in-person learning and adequate childcare is  hindering many from returning to work. This is especially true for many  women who work outside the home. In fact, many women are having to quit  their jobs as a result.   According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the January  jobs report showed that some 275,000 women  [[Page S843]]  left the workforce, while about 71,000 men left the workforce. Overall,  approximately 2.4 million women have left the workforce since last  February. This has been a common and unfortunate trend we are seeing as  a result of the pandemic, and I know for certain it is definitely tied  to the fact that schools have not reopened.   West Virginia's State superintendent said recently:         There is absolutely no substitution for a teacher in the       lives of a child.    He continued by saying:         There is no substitution for what that means to the       community and the families--not just for the academics but       for the social, emotional, [and] physical well-being.    He is absolutely right, and this is just another reason why it is so  important for our children to return to school safely.   At the same time, I know there is no one-size-fits-all solution.  State leaders, local governments, school administrators, and parents  must take this data and these recommendations and apply them to the  realities they see in their own communities.   Congress has provided $68 billion in resources for K-12 schools that  they could use last year, which schools could use to implement these  strategies. For these, this may mean continuing some form of remote  learning. For others, including my State of West Virginia, it means  bringing every K-8 student to a 5-day school week.   Before I conclude, I want to take a moment to thank the teachers, the  parents, and the students who have adjusted and readjusted over the  past years.   Despite the many challenges--whether they are technical, logistical,  or emotional challenges--you have tried to make it work the best you  can, and for that we are all very grateful. But now we have to do the  three r's. We must look at the data, listen to the stories, and look at  the realities in our classrooms and in our communities.   Get our children back to school. Respect the science. Reopen the  schools safely, and return students, teachers, and learning to the  classroom, where it should be.   I yield the floor.
