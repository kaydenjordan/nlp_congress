 Mr. President, it is such an honor and such a pleasure  to be with my fellow Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Cotton, as we rise to  honor Pine Bluff Detective Kevin Collins, who died while in the line of  duty, on Monday, October 5, as a result of injuries he sustained.   Detective Collins was a passionate person about law enforcement and  serving the citizens of Pine Bluff. He served his community not only as  an officer of the law but also as a mentor and a leader.   It was reported that he had wanted to be a police officer since he  had been 3 years old. In an interview with the Pine Bluff Commercial in  2018, he said: ``Ever since I was little, I saw law enforcement as a  service and something I could be proud of.'' He worked his entire life  to achieve that dream, and it came true 5 years ago when he was hired  by the Pine Bluff Police Department on June 8, 2015.   He was first assigned to the patrol division, and he worked his way  up to the violent crimes unit. Detective Collins loved being a police  officer, and he enjoyed building relationships with the men and women  he worked alongside as well as with the citizens whom he served.   His colleagues appreciated his enthusiasm, his hard work, and  dedication, which he demonstrated each and every day both in and out of  uniform.   Detective Collins was passionate about making a difference in the  lives of others. As a mentor to at-risk boys during the department's 2- week Youth Empowerment Camp, he was a role model for teens--encouraging  good behavior and reinforcing the importance of making good decisions.   In his short time with the Pine Bluff Police Department, he had a  long list of successes that include taking a large number of guns off  the streets and earning the department's Officer of the Year for 2017  for his actions in saving a 95-year-old resident while responding to an  apartment fire.   Detective Collins lived a faithful life devoted to Christ as a member  of New Life Church Pine Bluff.   Pastor Matt Mosler says Detective Collins had a great heart for  service. He took that heart for service and put his faith into action,  taking the initiative to make his community better.   We rely on law enforcement officers like Detective Collins to keep  communities safe, to keep us safe. His death is a tragic reminder of  the risk law enforcement officers face each day when they put on their  uniform and leave the comforts of their homes and their loved ones to  serve and to protect.   Detective Collins was a true hero. Our hearts break for his family,  his colleagues at the Pine Bluff Police Department, and community  members. I pray they will find comfort from the outpouring of support  for this beloved brother in blue.   Senator Cotton, I yield to you.    Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to  an outstanding Arkansas educator, Susanna Post, who was named the 2021  Arkansas Teacher of the Year.   Susanna has demonstrated her excellence in educating during her  tenure as a math and business technology teacher at Belle Point  Alternative Center in Fort Smith, AR.   Susanna launched her teaching career in North Carolina after  graduating from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville in 2002,  where she earned a degree in mathematics and computer science. She left  the classroom temporarily after a family relocation when she entered  the business world and worked as petroleum analyst and senior  engineering technician at multiple oil and gas companies.   We are fortunate that she wanted to return to teaching as she has  been a trailblazer during her time at Belle Point, quickly accruing a  long list of achievements. Susanna developed the school's first coding  club and also facilitated a Lindamood-Bell literary intervention group.  She is also the primary leader for the school's Culture Project Week, a  program that uses project-based activities to strengthen relationships  among students, faculty, and community. Her devotion to educating  future generations has benefitted not only Belle Point, but the entire  school district. In addition to serving on the district's secondary  math curriculum development team, she also created an ACT prep program  in collaboration with other district leaders. Susanna's leadership is  equally evident in the classroom, where she implemented a unique  project-based learning approach using her experience from the business  world.   Her passion for and commitment to education is demonstrated by her  own education. She completed two master's programs while teaching at  Belle Point. In 2017, she earned a master's degree in secondary  education and teaching from the University of Central Arkansas. In  2020, she received a master's in rural and urban school leadership from  the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.   I would like to offer my congratulations to Susanna Post for her  determination, devotion, and commitment to her students and to  education. I am encouraged by her efforts to inspire our next  generation of leaders and her drive to help them succeed.                            ____________________
