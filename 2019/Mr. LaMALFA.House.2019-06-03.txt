 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the hard work  being done by a crowd-funded organization called We Build the Wall.   Because Congress has failed to pass legislation that will secure our  border and fund the construction of physical barriers where they are  needed, these folks have taken the initiative.   We Build the Wall, led by Air Force combat veteran and triple amputee  Brian Kolfage, has raised over $23 million in private donations to help  secure the southern border and began construction in New Mexico over  the Memorial Day weekend.   Now, rumors were circulated about the group, but they are fulfilling  their promise. After first being told their permits were in order, the  mayor of Sunland Park and his administration were flip-flopping, and  their incompetence has threatened to put the brakes on the whole  project--but it only delayed it 36 hours. They now have been cleared to  resume the construction.   We know there is a crisis at the southern border. Madam Speaker, I  thank Brian Kolfage and We Build the Wall for their selfless commitment  to our great country.   It is too bad it has to come to this, but it is also inspiring, in a  way, that citizens came forward to do the job of the U.S. Government  and secure our sovereign border themselves.   This Congress should do better for our border security and for our  American citizens.                            ____________________
