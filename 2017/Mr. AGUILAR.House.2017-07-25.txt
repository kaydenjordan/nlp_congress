 Madam Speaker, the appropriations bills we are talking  about today should be about providing critical funds to keep our  servicemembers safe, take care of our veterans, and support necessary  defense programs. It should not be about helping President Trump keep a  campaign promise that has no grounding in reality.   House Republicans' reckless decision to force the American people to  pay for a wall that does nothing to increase our security or to solve  real problems facing our immigration system is both wasteful and  counterproductive.   This wall will cost American taxpayers $1.6 billion. That is $1.6  billion that could go toward helping veterans or getting our  servicemembers the resources they need to stay safe while they risk  their lives defending our country.   Rather than come to the table to work on meaningful bipartisan and  long-term solutions to fix our broken immigration system, House  Republicans would rather give American families' paychecks to President  Trump so he can build this wall.   We are here to do the people's work. Building this wall doesn't do  the people's work. It soothes the President's ego at the expense of  American families.   I urge my colleague to oppose this bill if this dangerous and  divisive policy rider is included.                            ____________________
