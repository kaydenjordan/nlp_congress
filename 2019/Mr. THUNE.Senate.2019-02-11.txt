 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, imagine going into a U.S. prison and  announcing that a substantial number of the prisoners had to be  released immediately--no exceptions, even if the prisoners in question  had participated in serious crimes or committed violent offenses. That  is an unthinkable scenario, and no one would seriously suggest going  into our Nation's prisons and immediately releasing thousands of  prisoners, including violent offenders onto the streets. Yet that is  exactly what Democrats are proposing as part of a border security  agreement.   Over the weekend, Democrats proposed capping the number of illegal  immigrants who could be detained by Immigration and Customs  Enforcement. Incredibly, they are refusing to allow an exception to the  cap for violent criminals. Under Democrats' proposal, if Immigration  and Customs Enforcement needed to detain more than 16,500 violent  criminals in the interior of our country, they simply wouldn't be able  to do it. Instead, immigration enforcement officers would have to  choose which violent criminals to release back into our communities.  Think about that.   Obviously, everyone who has come here illegally has broken our laws,  but in a lot of cases in question, we are talking about people who have  violated other laws, like laws against assault, rape, murder, theft,  drug trafficking, and more. We are talking about limiting law  enforcement's ability to make sure that those individuals are detained.   It isn't just about future detentions either. If the Democrats'  enforcement cap went into effect, Immigration and Customs Enforcement  would be forced to release criminals already in detention onto our  Nation's streets.   Additionally, there are an estimated 180,000 criminal illegal aliens  in the United States who currently are not in custody.   So, under the Democrats' proposal, not only would Immigration and  Customs Enforcement be forced to release violent criminals, for all  practical purposes, it would also be prohibited from trying to take  additional dangerous criminals off of our streets.   Let's be very clear about what we are talking about here. We are  talking about limiting the ability of a law enforcement agency to  enforce criminal laws. No administration of either party would accept  an arbitrary limit on the number of criminals it would be able to  detain. No administration would or should sign off on a law that would  force law enforcement agencies to leave violent criminals on our  Nation's streets.   As of a couple of days ago, the Republicans, I would say, were  encouraged by the bipartisan nature of the negotiations to prevent  another government shutdown. Then the Democrats came forward with this  absurd proposal to limit law enforcement's ability to detain even  dangerous criminals.   Are Democrats trying to derail negotiations with a poison pill at the  eleventh hour and force another shutdown? The question has to be asked  since no one could seriously think that any President of either party  would sign a deal that would limit his administration's ability to  enforce the law.   We still have a few days left. I hope the Democrats will abandon this  preposterous proposal to release dangerous criminals onto our Nation's  streets. We can achieve a deal to avert another shutdown, but we can't  do it by jeopardizing law enforcement's ability to protect the American  people.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
