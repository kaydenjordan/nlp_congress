 Mr. Speaker, it is an incredible honor to stand today in  honor of the legacy of the Reverend Billy Graham.   The population of the United States when Reverend Graham was born was  103 million. Over the course of his life, Reverend Graham spoke to more  than twice as many people who existed in the country the day he was  born in person about the greatest gift that one can ever be given, and  that is the gift of eternal life and salvation by a Creator so  benevolent as to look the other way on the undeniable sins of each of  us.   So as I look to try to leave an impact on the world, I understand  that people far greater than me have left far greater an impact than I  could ever leave. I want to use Reverend Graham's words in closing to  honor Reverend Graham not for who he was, but for his commitment to his  Savior Jesus Christ.   Reverend Graham said: When wealth is lost, nothing is lost. When  health is lost, something is lost. And when character is lost, all is  lost.   Reverend Graham said: The greatest legacy one can pass on to one's  children and grandchildren is not money or material things accumulated  in one's life, but a legacy of character and faith.   I think most appropriately, in closing, he said: I look forward to  death with great anticipation to meeting God face to face.   Finally, he said: I haven't written my own epitaph. I am not sure I  should. Whatever it is, I hope it will be simple and it will point  people not to me, but to the God that I served.   I thank Billy Graham, and I pray God would send us more. Amen.
