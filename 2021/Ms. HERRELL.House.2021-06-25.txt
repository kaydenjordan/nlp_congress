 Mr. Speaker, I rise also in strong opposition to this  resolution, as it is yet another attempt by my Democratic colleagues to  nickel and dime the most essential industry in my district out of  business.   The energy policies of the Biden administration have been a complete  and utter disaster. American jobs are being lost and gas prices are  soaring due to a retreat from the policies of the Trump administration  that created American energy dominance.   Small and midsize oil and gas producers employ tens of thousands of  New Mexicans and contribute millions of dollars in revenues to my  State's budget. These essential businesses are the ones that will be  most negatively impacted by the passage of this resolution.   Small and midsize producers are already under attack by the ban on  new oil and gas leases on Federal lands put in place by this  administration, which a Federal judge ruled to be illegal just last  week.   Instead of approving foreign pipelines and implementing duplicative  and costly regulations, which strengthen the hands of our enemies, this  administration and this House should be focused on creating jobs here  at home and lowering energy costs for all Americans.   I, and many other of my Republican colleagues, have put forward  commonsense pieces of legislation to ensure economic and environmental  sustainability for our constituents. This legislation does just the  opposite.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose this legislation and to  join us on this side of the aisle in fighting to continue the American  energy dominance agenda of the previous administration that resulted in  a cleaner environment and a vibrant economy.
