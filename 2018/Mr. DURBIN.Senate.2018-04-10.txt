 Mr. President, last Friday, America lost a good and  gracious person, a statesman, and many of us in the Senate lost a  personal friend.   Senator Daniel Akaka was as kind and decent a man as you would ever  meet in life. For 3\1/2\ decades, Danny Akaka served the people of  Hawaii in the U.S. Congress with dignity, humility, and deep caring.   The Hawaiian concept of ``aloha'' isn't a quality that many think of  when they think of politicians. ``Aloha'' means mutual regard and  affection. It means extending warmth and caring with no obligation in  return, no strings attached. Danny Inouye, that giant of Hawaii and its  history, once called Danny Akaka ``a true ambassador of aloha.''   When Danny Akaka announced in 2011 that he would not run for  reelection to the Senate, then-Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie said:         The words aloha and Akaka are interchangeable. Daniel Akaka       is Hawaii.    Now, at age 93, Senator Akaka is gone. I first met him in 1983. I was  a newly elected Member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Then we  sat together on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture,  the two of us next to one another down at the far end of the table.  Danny had 6 years' seniority on me. We served together, worked  together, laughed together, traveled together, and came to be friends.   Here was a man, a great politician, who didn't have a personal ego.  Politics was always about someone else, about helping other people. In  fact, he went out of his way to avoid the spotlight. But don't think  for a minute that he was weak. I have memories seared in my mind-- certainly October 11, 2002, when 22 Members of the Democratic caucus in  the Senate voted against the resolution authorizing President Bush to  invade Iraq--the Iraq war resolution Danny Akaka opposed. I can recall  that it was nearly 1 in the morning when that rollcall ended and he  left the floor after that historic vote. Soft-spoken, yes. Capable of  making hard, meaningful, courageous decisions, certainly. That was a  lonely road. I believe history has judged it to be the right vote.   Danny Akaka's vote, like so many, was deeply influenced by his own  experience in the U.S. military. At 17 years of age, he witnessed the  Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Two years later, after serving as a  welder and diesel mechanic with the Army Corps of Engineers, he entered  Active Duty with the Army and served in several areas across the  Pacific.   After the war, he used his GI benefits to go to college, and only  later did he realize he was still carrying a wound from that war--post- traumatic stress disorder. He said that earning a bachelor's and  master's degree in education and working as a public school teacher and  principal--his first profession--helped him to cope with PTSD.   In politics, his second career, he used his influence to help other  members of the military, veterans and their families.   In 2008, as chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee,  Senator Danny Akaka cosponsored the post-9/11 GI bill of rights. That  new GI bill of rights included a provision that I asked Danny to  include to improve care for veterans wounded by another of the often- invisible wounds of war--traumatic brain injury. Senator Akaka's  leadership helped to pass that important new law.   Two years later, then chairman of the Veterans' Committee, I appealed  to Danny Akaka again for another provision. It was an idea actually  authored originally by Senator Hillary Clinton of New York. It was  called the Caregivers Program. The idea was to allow family members of  disabled veterans to care for them at home, to provide necessary  medical care and support in a home setting that they all wanted to be  in. It was the right thing for our veterans, the right thing for our  budget, and the right thing for America. Danny Akaka embraced it and  became a leader on the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services  Act of 2010, providing those family members with training and modest  stipends. The stipends amount to only a fraction of what would have  been spent on these veterans had they been in a different setting  sponsored by the government.   Well, Danny Akaka is gone, but his legacy of service lives on in  millions of veterans and military families whose lives are better  because of his quiet but fierce commitment.   In 1996, Senator Akaka spearheaded an effort to require reevaluation  of the service records of Asian Americans who had fought in the 442nd  Regimental Combat Team and the 100th Division during the war.   As a result of Danny Akaka's perseverance, almost two dozen Medals of  Honor were bestowed posthumously on Asian-American veterans, many of  them Japanese Americans. The most prominent recipient was his  colleague, Senator Danny Inouye, who had lost an arm during World War  II fighting for the United States in Italy. It was a long overdue  justice for heroes whose courage had been largely ignored for decades  because of racism, and Danny Akaka helped to make it happen.   In 1993, Danny Akaka helped to bend the arc of the moral universe  another time when he and Senator Inouye successfully pushed through a  resolution in which the Federal Government apologized for its role in  overthrowing the Hawaiian monarchy a century earlier.   As a child, Danny Akaka listened to his parents speak their Native  Hawaiian language in whispers. They didn't want Danny and his seven  brothers and sisters to hear them because of the Territorial law  allowing children to be punished if they spoke their Native Hawaiian  language in school. That little boy, little Danny Akaka, grew up to be  the first Native Hawaiian ever elected to the U.S. Senate. Danny Akaka  was a champion of Native Hawaiians and Native Americans, a champion of  good government and the men and women who do that work in government.   He was a deeply spiritual and religious man, who once considered  following his brother into the ministry but instead decided to help  others in his own way as a teacher and a public servant. His was a life  well lived.   Last night, I had a telephone conversation with Danny's wife, Millie  Akaka--what a team, 69 years of marriage. They were just a few weeks  away from celebrating their 70th anniversary. They were inseparable. He  was the Senator, but she was the driving force in his public career.  She managed every one of his campaigns. She knew everyone in every  direction. She never forgot a name, and she was always  [[Page S2023]]  there to finish his sentences. We talked for a long time last night  about the times when we were able to get together--my wife Loretta,  Millie, and Danny--and the good times we had and the great people we  met in the process. I also talked about the time when Danny came before  the Senate Democratic caucus luncheon. We used to have a great  tradition, where every few weeks Senators would get up and just tell a  little bit about their personal lives--things that don't make the  headlines.   I still remember Danny Akaka's presentation. He talked about growing  up in a very modest family but having a mother with a very caring  heart. His mother just couldn't stand to see someone who was struggling  to find a home or a meal. She was always inviting someone in. Even  though they didn't have a lot themselves, they were always sharing with  people. She would say: Bring them over to dinner, Danny. Let's meet  them.   Then, after they met them, they would offer them a room. Danny told a  story of people who came and lived in his home with him--perfect  strangers who became part of their family and lived with them for  months and even years. Some of those people whom they befriended went  on to greatness. One was a medical doctor who became famous and never  forgot the kindnesses extended by the Akaka family.   His mother's lesson was learned by Danny Akaka. It was shared with us  in the Senate. It was an indication of truly a caring heart and a  person who was really prepared to serve every day of his life.   I join my colleagues in expressing our condolences to Danny's wife  Millie, to their five children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.  May your love and memories be a comfort in this time of loss.   To my friend, Senator Danny Akaka: Aloha and mahalo. Farewell and  thank you.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  and the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Duckworth) are necessarily absent.
