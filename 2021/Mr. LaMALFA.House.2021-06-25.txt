 Mr. Speaker, China, led by the Chinese Communist Party,  has inflicted more damage and suffering on the world and even its own  people than is even calculable.   Accountability for its action, or timely inactions, on the Wuhan  virus is necessary. Transparency in how research labs conduct business  is essential in holding those responsible that allowed the leak of  extremely dangerous byproducts that have cost multitudes of lives and  inflicted many trillions in economic harm upon the world.   The U.S. must zero out its dependence on China for so much of what we  use and need in everyday life. We must produce our own pharmaceutical  products, our own rare-earth products from our own mines, our own  manufacturing.   We must prohibit the gain-of-function research that likely led to the  Wuhan virus being unleashed on the world.   Overhaul the World Health Organization and our relationship with it.   Prohibit National Institutes of Health funding to those who don't  have the United States and American peoples' best interests and  wellness at heart.   Reimpose visa sanctions on China.   And, certainly, why give China a legitimate stage to the world via  the Olympics?   The Olympics rightly should be rebid and moved in time for 2022 to  countries that respect and revere human rights and right to basic  freedoms from oppression. Otherwise, we give it all a green light and a  tacit stamp of approval.                            ____________________
