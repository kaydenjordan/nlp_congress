 Mr. Speaker, last week after many months of hard work by  staff and Members here in a bipartisan fashion, amazingly in this  atmosphere here, we introduced the Farm Workforce Modernization Act  legislation. This will really clean up the process for ag labor in this  country, something desperately needed. It will be  [[Page H8944]]  better for the workers, better for the farmers, and much better for the  rule of law.   With the problems we have on our border, the problems with  immigration as it is these days, at least the ag worker section will be  able to be much better monitored and much better regulated, and indeed,  much better off for the workers themselves not having to live in the  shadows.   This legislation modernizes the H-2A program. It stabilizes wages,  institutes a merit-based system for ag workers to eventually earn legal  status after years of proven work and consistent employment in the U.S.  ag industry.   So when you look at the whole package here, where we stand right now  with the disarray in nonofficial status that we have, this is going to  be a vast improvement, and I urge people to get behind that.                            ____________________
