 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to  the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act. It is funny, in this  town, rehabilitation is a word we use to kindly describe a bailout. For  normal people, rehabilitation is a word that would conjure up the idea  that perhaps today we are attempting to fix or improve the $638 billion  pension problem before us.   This bill would, more accurately, be called the bailout for  multiemployer pensions act, because this bill does not contain any of  the needed reforms to change the unsustainable trajectory of these  plans.   What does the bill do instead? It creates a new Federal Government  bureaucracy. It allows for billions of dollars of loans to be just  forgiven. It provides loan terms that actually encourage not paying  down the principal of these loans.   So to be clear, and to make no doubt, we do have to fix this pension  problem, but real progress will only come from a careful, deliberate,  and bipartisan process, and this bill was not designed to be  bipartisan.   In committee, Republicans were actually blocked from offering  amendments that would have improved this bill. So here we are today,  taking up floor time for a one-sided bill that does not fix the problem  and that will not become law.   When the majority wants to make real progress, I will be here, ready  to fix the problem, ready to roll up my sleeves, ready to invest the  bipartisan effort needed to make meaningful reforms. Until then, I will  vote ``no'' on the bailout.
