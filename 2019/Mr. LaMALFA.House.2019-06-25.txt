 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize June as  Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month.   Alzheimer's disease affects more than 5 million Americans. It is also  our Nation's most expensive disease.   We have got to continue working toward finding a cure for  Alzheimer's; but, in the meantime, we have to cut down on preventable  hospitalizations and lower the cost of care. That is why I cosponsored  the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act last Congress, which  President Trump has since signed into law. This bill will help educate  community members and doctors on dementia detection, diagnosis, and  symptom management.   This Congress, I cosponsored the bipartisan Younger Onset Alzheimer's  Act, to ensure younger people dealing with dementia or other symptoms  have access to the counseling and support they need.   I urge my colleagues, family, friends, and neighbors to do their part  and know the warning signs of Alzheimer's disease. Education and  awareness can make a huge difference in a person's life.                            ____________________
