 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1097, I  call up the bill (H.R. 5129) to amend the Community Services Block  Grant Act to reauthorize and modernize the Act, and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 5129, the Community Services Block  Grant Modernization Act of 2022.  [[Page H4933]]     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bipartisan  legislation, H.R. 5129, the Community Services Block Grant  Modernization Act of 2022.   In 1964, Congress first established the Community Action Program to  support locally driven anti-poverty efforts.   Today, community action agencies, or CAAs, form a network of more  than 1,000 organizations with a dedicated mission of assisting people  in finding their way out of poverty.   These agencies provide services and programs that meet the unique  needs of our local communities by helping individuals and families with  low incomes achieve economic stability, secure meaningful employment,  and adequate education, gain and improve job-related skills, obtain  housing, access childcare, and participate in the community.   During our legislative hearing on updating the community services  block grant, Katherine King Galian, the director of Family and  Community Resources at Community Action in Washington County, Oregon,  told us the story about Patricia.   Patricia lost her job and her home in the fall of 2019. Facing  unaffordable rent and a rising risk of homelessness, she turned to  Community Action and she got the support she needed.   At Community Action of Washington County, she accessed career  coaching, help affording needed materials for her nursing curriculum,  and other services that helped Patricia and her family get back on  their feet. Patricia's story is just one of many from all across the  United States where community action agencies have been helping low- income Americans get back on their feet for decades.   Unfortunately, the community services block grant program, CSBG, has  not been reauthorized since 1998, the year Google was founded, and John  Glenn flew the Discovery space shuttle mission. We are long overdue for  Congress to pass a comprehensive reauthorization of this significant  law.   Our bill continues the long tradition of broad bipartisan support for  this program and makes important improvements to update CSBG. It will  reauthorize CSBG for 10 years--the longest period in its history--which  will provide critical stability to our local service providers.   Recognizing that there are many more families like Patricia's who can  be served by CSBG, our bill strengthens funding for community action  agencies and raises the program's income eligibility threshold to  expand access to their important services.   I also highlight a provision championed by my friend and colead,  Congressman G.T. Thompson, to create broadband navigator projects so  community action agencies can assist their clients in accessing  internet services and connected devices that are necessary for  learning, finding employment, and other basic activities of everyday  life.   Finally, the bill will modernize the statute to strengthen  accountability and performance requirements, putting CSBG on solid  footing so the program can continue to meet the complex and changing  needs of low-income individuals in communities without changing the  local control that is such an important part of CSBG's success.   I very much appreciate the productive collaboration with my  bipartisan partner from the Education and Labor Committee, Congressman  Thompson, and his staff, in leading this legislation.   I also thank our other Education and Labor Committee coleads,  Representatives DeSaulnier, Stefanik, and Comer for leading us in this  effort. I must also knowledge Congresswoman Betty McCollum, who led  early iterations of this proposal in prior Congresses and has joined us  this session to build on her foundational work to get this across the  finish line.   Additionally, David Bradley, the CEO of National Community Action  Foundation has been instrumental in offering his expertise to help us  bring this bill to the floor today.   Finally, and importantly, I would thank Chairman Scott and his  dedicated staff, particularly, Theresa Thompson, Jessica Schieder,  Emily Hopkins, and Carrie Hughes, for working with us to bring this  bill. I also thank my staff, Allison Smith, Jack Arriaga, Andrew Dunn,  and Rachael Bornstein, who worked diligently on this bill from drafting  and introduction through the committee markup.   I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  this important bill to renew our Nation's commitment to reducing  poverty through community action.   Additionally, I include in the Record letters by the National  Community Action Foundation, National Association of Counties, and  National Association for State Community Service Programs in support of  passing the Community Services Block Grant Modernization Act of 2022.                                                 National Community                                                Action Foundation,                                                       May 10, 2022.      Hon. Suzanne Bonamici,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Glenn Thompson,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Rep. Bonamici and Rep. Thompson: We are writing to you       today to share our enthusiastic endorsement of your       bipartisan legislation, HR 5129, the Community Services Block       Grant (CSBG) Modernization Act of 2022.        As you know, CSBG touches virtually every community in the       United States. With 90 percent of each state's CSBG       allocation being distributed to local Community Action       Agencies (CAAs), our communities rely upon this unique       flexible funding. CAAs use it to combat poverty and promote       self-sufficiency, respond rapidly to unforeseen crises such       as natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic and implement       gap-filling activities that address unmet community needs.       Additionally, CAAs use CSBG to organize and support other       local charities and community-based initiatives, ensuring       services are streamlined and not duplicative. Without CSBG,       every single community in America would be hurt.        Your bill would codify critical updates to the program. It       provides security and reliability to communities across the       country by authorizing CSBG for 10 years and ensuring money       flows in a timely manner. The crucial modernizations included       in HR 5129, such as the new broadband navigator initiative,       will increase CAAs' ability to respond to emerging needs. We       are also pleased to see the emphasis on quality performance       at the federal, state and local level and that the essential       nature of CSBG as a locally-controlled program is retained       and bolstered.        Because of HR 5129's local impact in almost every county in       the country, we join in support of the bill. We hope Congress       passes this essential piece of legislation quickly, thereby       strengthening each community in America.

Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy:        On behalf of the National Association of Counties (NACo),       the only organization representing the nation's 3,069       counties, parishes, and boroughs, I write to urge you to pass       the bipartisan Community Services Block Grant (CSBG)       Modernization Act (H.R. 5129) led by Reps. Suzanne Bonamici       (D-Ore.), Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.), Betty Mccollum (D-Minn.),       Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.) and James       Comer (R-Ky.). While CSBG continues to receive funding       through the annual appropriations process, it has not been       reauthorized since 1998, making it overdue for substantive       changes that could increase its ability to serve vulnerable       county residents. Counties support H.R. 5129, which would       strengthen funding and local administration of eligible anti-      poverty programs focused on housing, health, employment,       income and civic engagement.        CSBG, which supports local agencies in activities that       mitigate the root causes of poverty, represents a unique and       effective partnership between counties, states, federal       government and community organizations. CSBG-eligible       activities vary depending on local needs, but often include       services related to educational attainment, accessing and       maintaining employment and self-sufficiency, household budget       management, obtaining adequate housing and promoting greater       community participation. In FY 2019, the CSBG network       operated in 99 percent of the nation's counties through over       1,000 eligible public or private entities to serve 10.2       million individuals living in poverty, including 3.2 million       children.        The CSBG Modernization Act would strengthen these efforts       through both the reauthorization and authorization of       appropriations that create more program certainty and allow       Congress to provide additional funding to meet our nation's       growing needs. The bill specifically reauthorizes the program       for 10 years and authorizes appropriations of $1 billion per       year for the first five years and ``such sums as necessary''       for the following five years. Counties also support the       proposed change of H.R. 5129 that would make permanent a       COVID-era flexibility that allowed states to use CSBG funding       to provide services to individuals earning up to 200 percent       of the federal poverty line, allowing the program to reach       more people in need.        The CSBG Modernization Act would additionally create a       federally administered Community Action Innovations Program       to invigorate the CSBG network's ability to test new       approaches to reducing poverty. The bill strengthens local       control and responsiveness to local needs through strategic       plans that set goals and create an action plan for meeting       community needs. It would also authorize Broadband Navigator       Projects as a new federal discretionary program available to       Community Action Agencies. Increased internet access has       major implications on socio-economic well-being and service       delivery.        NACo supports these efforts to expand public-private       partnerships and close the digital divide to provide reliable       high-speed broadband services, especially in rural       underserved areas.        Passing this bipartisan bill would ensure CSBG is meeting       the current needs of counties and local communities through       fully funded evidence-based program activities. During the       COVID-19 pandemic, CSBG has played a key role in providing       crucial services for struggling Americans including helping       communities access personal protective equipment, vaccines       and other health services and school supplies for remote       learning. As the nation recovers from the economic impacts of       COVID-19, we are long past due for Congress to pass a       comprehensive reauthorization of CSBG as it is vital to anti-      poverty efforts across the country.        Now that the CSBG Modernization Act (H.R. 5129) was voted       out of the U.S. House Education and Labor Committee on a       bipartisan basis, NACo strongly urges the U.S. House of       Representatives to pass this legislation as soon as possible.            Sincerely,                                                     Matthew Chase,                                                Executive Director.  [[Page H4936]]                                          ____                                     National Association for State                                     Community Services Programs,                                                        May 9, 2022.      Rep. Nancy Pelosi,      House Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Rep. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Rep. Steny Hoyer,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Rep. Bobby Scott,      Ed & Labor Committee Chairman, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Madam Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Minority       Leader McCarthy, and Chairman Scott: My name is Jeannie       Chaffin, and I am the Interim Executive Director of the       National Association for State Community Services Programs       (NASCSP). NASCSP is the sole national association charged       with advocating for and enhancing the leadership role of       States in the administration of the Community Services Block       Grant (CSBG) and Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP)       across all 50 states, Washington D.C., and five U.S.       territories.        As the membership association for all Community Services       Block Grant State Offices, we are intimately familiar with       the current CSBG Act, how it has helped individuals and       communities in all corners of the Nation and how it can be       improved upon. We are excited that the CSBG Modernization Act       is moving forward and has such strong bipartisan support with       more than 125 cosponsors from more than 25 states and the       District of Columbia. We are incredibly grateful for such a       strong showing of support for CSBG.        I am writing to you today not simply out of gratitude but       also to express our support for the CSBG Modernization Act       (HR 5129). The Act changes the eligibility criterion from       125% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) to 200% of the FPL,       enabling the funding to reach more households in need,       especially as we recover from the nationwide impact of COVID-      19. Important language is also included in the Act that       provides for the ongoing eligibility of clients so that they       do not lose assistance as they work toward achieving their       goal. This is critical to households' ability to exit poverty       meaningfully and sustainably. The State Offices that are       responsible for overseeing this funding and ensuring it is       thoughtfully spent fully and enthusiastically support these       changes in CSBG.        While our network is excited for and supportive of the       aforementioned language, we also have a few concerns and must       note our primary concern below. As partners in the work of       CSBG, State Offices carry a great deal of responsibility.       States provide oversight of CSBG funds via monitoring,       contract management, policy development, and evaluation of       results. As State Offices fill these various roles, we       recognize that there are aspects of the CSBG Modernization       Act of 2021 that could be refined to support the efficient       and effective implementation of CSBG at the state and local       levels.        We recommend revising grant obligational requirements in       Section 679 to `date of obligation' and removing language       that refers to `available for expenditure' as it creates an       unrealistic requirement on State Offices to release funding       in extremely short periods of time (30 days). We recommend       focusing on continuous funding to Eligible Entities over       prescriptive timelines (Sec. 679(a)(2)(A) and Sec.       679(a)(2)(A)(i)). We believe this addresses concerns about       any gaps in funding while simultaneously acknowledging that       each state has its own policies, procedures and regulations       that dictate how funding is distributed from the federal to       local level.        We are deeply committed to the success of the CSBG and know       just what a difference it makes in communities across the       country. It is through the cooperation of all stakeholders,       from the Federal level to Eligible Entities and, of course,       State Offices, that make the great work of CSBG possible, and       as such we want to be sure that the Modernization Act enables       all to be successful partners. Thank you for your support of       CSBG and considering our suggestions for improvements.            Sincerely,                                                   Jeannie Chaffin,                                Interim Executive Director, NASCSP.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), who is the chairman of the Education and Labor  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New Mexico (Ms. Leger Fernandez), who is a member of Education and  Labor Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), who is a member of the Education and Labor  Committee and a lead cosponsor of the legislation.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Madam Speaker, we all agree that the inclusion of faith-based  organizations and faith leaders is important for the community action  network. In fact, they have a long history of being involved with  community action since the very beginning of the war on poverty in the  1960s, and I have no doubt that they will continue to do their  important work.   In recent years, the Supreme Court has made clear that religious  entities cannot be excluded from participation in publicly funded  programs because of their religious status. This legislation, despite  what the ranking member and others claim, would not change that.   We are here today to reauthorize and modernize the community services  block grant program, which is almost 20 years past its authorization  expiration.   I also note that the bipartisan bill introduced in the previous  Congress, the 116th, also removed the charitable choice provision with  broad bipartisan support, and H.R. 5129 reflects the same sensible  compromise on this issue.   In fact, some Members would have liked the legislation to go further  to expressly address other nondiscrimination issues, but I did not take  that approach as we crafted the bill because I wanted to maintain the  bipartisan agreement we reached to make real progress toward the much- needed reauthorization of CSBG.   Twenty years is too long for this program, our community action  agencies, and the communities they serve. It is too long for them to  wait for us to reach an agreement, and we have reached an agreement.   Additionally, Madam Speaker, for 60 years, community action agencies  have had relationships with faith-based organizations. The involvement  of faith-based organizations in community action programs long predates  the charitable choice provision, and their involvement will continue  without this controversial provision.   We also know that HHS regulations have existed for nearly 20 years  incorporating many of the same principles. Eliminating the duplicative  charitable choice provision in CSBG allows us to move forward with a  reauthorization that is vital to so many of our agencies  [[Page H4940]]  and allows HHS to apply a single set of rules across programs.   This is a distraction that should not prevent us from moving forward  with this reauthorization and maintaining the bipartisan consensus we  have achieved.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Coalition  Against Religious Discrimination, a broad and diverse group of leading  religious, civil rights, labor, and health organizations supporting the  removal of the charitable choice provision from the community services  block grant program.                                               The Coalition Against                                        Religious Discrimination,                                                       May 11, 2022.        Dear Representative: As members and allies of the Coalition       Against Religious Discrimination (CARD), we write to support       the changes in H.R. 5129, the Community Services Block Grant       (CSBG) Modernization Act of 2022, that would remove       charitable choice, a highly controversial policy.        CARD is a broad and diverse group of leading religious,       civil rights, labor, and health organizations that formed in       the 1990s to oppose adding charitable choice to social       service program authorizations. Since then, CARD has       continued to advocate for strengthening the constitutional       and legal safeguards that apply to such partnerships in this       and other social service programs. We appreciate the       important role that religiously affiliated organizations       historically have played in addressing many of our nation's       most pressing social needs, including in some cases, with the       use of government funds; indeed, many members of CARD know       this firsthand. We also recognize that the separation of       church and state is the cornerstone of religious freedom.        Contrary to claims of its supporters, charitable choice       provisions did not remove any ``barriers'' to participation       for faith-based providers. Faith-based organizations       partnered with the government to provide services long before       the addition of charitable choice to the Community Services       Block Grant programs. Charitable choice instead changed the       rules. But faith-based organizations should follow the same       rules as all other providers, and effective government       collaboration with faith-based entities does not require       government-supported discrimination.        Charitable choice removed traditional church-state       safeguards that applied to social service providers that       accept taxpayer funds. It allows taxpayer-funded faith-based       organizations to discriminate in hiring, including by       undermining state and local nondiscrimination protections,       and threatens the rights of beneficiaries when delivering       services.        People in need should never be faced with the stark choice       between accessing the services they need or retaining their       religious freedom protections. And no one should be forced to       choose between conforming to a religious litmus test or       losing a government-funded job.        Charitable choice does not protect religious freedom,       rather it uses the guise of religious freedom to justify       discrimination against employees and put people who need       government services at risk of harm. Thus, we support the       removal of the charitable choice provisions from the CSBG       authorization.

Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), the chairman of the Education and Labor  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a Statement of Administration  Policy from the Executive Office of the President supporting H.R. 5129  and praising the legislation's commitment to ensuring that communities  have the tools they need to address poverty and achieve economic  mobility.                     Statement of Administration Policy    H.R. 5129--Community Services Block Grant Modernization Act of 2022--                 Rep. Bonamici, D-OR, and 126 cosponsors         The Administration supports the poverty-fighting goals of       H.R. 5129, the Community Services Block Grant Modernization       Act of 2022, to provide states, territories, and Tribes with       resources for critical community services. This legislation       will reauthorize the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG)       for a decade and help ensure that communities have the tools       they need to fight poverty and build economic mobility.        The CSBG has been supporting tribal and local governments       and community organizations across the country for over 50       years with funding to help them serve low-income individuals       and families. Local administration of some of the most       essential community programs--such as job training and       placement, food and nutrition assistance, Head Start, housing       and homelessness assistance, and the Low Income Home Energy       Assistance Program--is supported by CSBG funds. While these       services and strategies have always been key to helping       Americans get ahead and stay ahead, the COVID-19 pandemic       underscored just how vital it is to invest in the       organizations that deliver them. Faced with unprecedented       demand and the operational challenges of the pandemic, the       more than 1,000 organizations supported by CSBG continued       working to help low-income communities address housing and       food insecurity, provide high-quality early childhood       education, and support individuals re-entering the workforce.       Now, as this Administration works to build a strong and       equitable recovery, it is more important than ever to invest       in locally based solutions to the causes and conditions of       poverty in communities.        The CSBG update proposed by this Act would result in       greater equity for Tribes, expanded income eligibility data       modernization, strengthened performance management, and       support for community-based services and strategies. In       addition, this Act would support new broadband navigator       efforts and continues critical support for community economic       development and rural development activities. And       reauthorizing CSBG for the first time since 1998 would       provide organizations and the millions of families they serve       with the confidence and stability to make the long-term       investments communities need.        The Administration looks forward to working with Congress       to ensure that this bipartisan legislation achieves its       purposes, continues expanding opportunity for all Americans,       and ultimately is enacted.     Madam Speaker, I thank Representative McCollum for  supporting H.R. 5129. I am thankful for her leadership in the 116th  Congress' legislation to reauthorize CSBG and her continued strong  support for this program.   Madam Speaker, I also include in the Record letters from various  organizations, individuals, and localities supporting this bipartisan  legislation to reauthorize this community services block grant.                                                             LOA,                                        Roanoke, VA, April 19, 2022.      Hon. Suzanne Bonamici,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Glenn Thompson,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Rep. Bonamici and Rep. Thompson: I am writing to you       today to share my endorsement of your bipartisan legislation       that supports community action agencies, including Total       Action for Progress (TAP). I have the pleasure of serving on       TAP's board. H.R. 5129, the Community Service Block Grant       (CSBG) Modernization Act of 2022 is important to me and our       community.        As you know, CSBG touches virtually every community in the       United States. With 90 percent of each state's CSBG       allocation being distributed to local Community Action       Agencies (CAAs), our communities rely upon this unique       flexible funding. CAAs, like TAP, use the funds to combat       poverty and promote self-sufficiency, respond rapidly to       unforeseen crises such as natural disasters and the COVID-19       pandemic and implement gap-filling activities that address       unmet community needs. Additionally, CAAs use CSBG to       organize and support other local charities and community-      based initiatives, ensuring services are streamlined and not       duplicative. Without CSBG, every single community in America       would be hurt.        Your bill would codify critical updates to the program. It       provides security and reliability to communities across the       country by authorizing CSBG for 10 years and ensuring money       flows in a timely manner. The crucial modernizations included       in H.R. 5129, such as the new broadband navigator initiative,       will increase CAAs' ability to respond to emerging needs. We       are also pleased to see the emphasis on quality performance       at the federal, state, and local level and that the essential       nature of CSBG as a locally-controlled program is retained       and bolstered.        Because of H.R. 5129's local impact in almost every county       in the country, I join in support of the bill. It is hoped       that Congress passes this essential piece of legislation       quickly, thereby strengthening each community in America.

With 90 percent of each state's CSBG       allocation being distributed to local Community Action       Agencies (CAAs), our communities rely upon this unique       flexible funding. CAAs use it to combat poverty and promote       self-sufficiency, respond rapidly to unforeseen crises such       as natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic and implement       gap-filling activities that address unmet community needs.       Additionally, CAAs use CSBG to organize and support other       local charities and community-based initiatives, ensuring       services are streamlined and not duplicative. Without CSBG,       every single community in America would be hurt.        Your bill would codify critical updates to the program. It       provides security and reliability to communities across the       country by authorizing CSBG for 10 years and ensuring money       flows in a timely manner. The crucial modernizations included       in H.R. 5129, such as the new broadband navigator initiative,       will increase CAAs' ability to respond to emerging needs. We       are also pleased to see the emphasis on quality performance       at the federal, state and local level and that the essential       nature of CSBG as a locally-controlled program is retained       and bolstered.        Because of H.R. 5129's local impact in almost every county       in the country, we join in  [[Page H4942]]       support of the bill. We hope Congress passes this essential       piece of legislation quickly, thereby strengthening each       community in America.            Sincerely,                                                    Melissa Blanar,      Director.                                   ____                                                    City of Roanoke,                                             Office of the Mayor,                                  Roanoke, Virginia, April 18, 2022.      Hon. Suzanne Bonamici,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Glenn Thompson,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Bonamici and Thompson: We are writing       to you today to share our endorsement of your bipartisan       legislation that supports community action agencies,       including Total Action for Progress (TAP) which assists       citizens in our jurisdiction. HR 5129, the Community Service       Block Grant (CSBG) Modernization Act of 2022.        As you know, CSBG touches virtually every community in the       United States. With 90 percent of each state's CSBG       allocation being distributed to local Community Action       Agencies (CAAs), our communities rely upon this unique       flexible funding. CAAs, like TAP, use the funds to combat       poverty and promote self-sufficiency, respond rapidly to       unforeseen crises such as natural disasters and the COVID-19       pandemic and implement gap-filling activities that address       unmet community needs. Additionally, CAAs use CSBG to       organize and support other local charities and community-      based initiatives, ensuring services are streamlined and not       duplicative. Without CSBG, every single community in America       would be hurt.        Your bill would codify critical updates to the program. It       provides security and reliability to communities across the       country by authorizing CSBG for 10 years and ensuring money       flows in a timely manner. The crucial modernizations included       in HR 5129, such as the new broadband navigator initiative,       will increase CAAs' ability to respond to emerging needs. We       are also pleased to see the emphasis on quality performance       at the federal, state, and local level and that the essential       nature of CSBG as a locally-controlled program is retained       and bolstered.        Because of HR 5129's local impact in almost every county in       the country, I join in support of the bill. It is hoped that       Congress passes this essential piece of legislation quickly,       thereby strengthening each community in America.            Sincerely,        Members of Roanoke City Council, Roanoke, Virginia:      Mayor Sherman P. Lea, Sr.,        Mayor.      Patricia White-Boyd,        Vice-Mayor.      William Bestpitch,        Council Member.      Vivian Sanchez-Jones,        Council Member.      Joseph Cobb,        Council Member.      Stephanie Moon Reynolds,        Council Member.     Madam Speaker, millions of families and individuals  across our country benefit from the locally driven antipoverty programs  and services backed by the community services block grant program. We  are here today to make sure it continues to meet their needs and the  unique needs of our communities.   I am pleased that the House is taking up this long-overdue update to  the community services block grant program with strong bipartisan  support.   CSBG enables community action agencies to be innovative, leverage  public and private resources for their communities, and cost- efficiently administer many programs, including Head Start, LIHEAP,  nutrition assistance, weatherization, job training, housing, and  assistance for those experiencing homelessness.   This bipartisan legislation will strengthen funding for community  action agencies, raise the CSBG program's income eligibility threshold  to expand its important services; promote innovation in the CAA network  through a federally administered community action innovations program;  and, importantly, modernizes accountability, which is an important part  of the bill, and performance standards.   The bottom line is that this legislation will better help low-income  individuals and families achieve economic stability and access housing,  childcare, utility assistance, employment, and other services.   I, once again, urge my colleagues to support this important  bipartisan bill to renew our Nation's commitment to reducing poverty  through community action, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to section 11 of House  Resolution 1097, I rise to offer amendments en bloc No. 1.    Madam Speaker, these amendments en bloc containing  additional Democratic amendments from my colleagues continue to improve  the implementation of the community services block grant program and  strengthens partnerships with communities served by this program.   Ms. Escobar's amendment adds entities who support innovative  community-based approaches and research-driven responses as partners  for community action agencies in their work to broaden the resources  directed to eliminating poverty.   Ms. Adams' amendment clarifies that institutions of higher education,  including HBCUs, TCUs, and MSIs, can be considered as partners for CSBG  projects.   Mrs. Hayes' amendment ensures that States provide notice on their  website that CSBG services are offered at no cost and information about  fraudulent activity related to CSBG.   Mr. Horsford's amendment adds language regarding Federal activities  on place-based poverty alleviating strategies, clarifying that they can  address health inequities.   Ms. Houlahan's amendment updates the use of funds to include  behavioral health needs that an eligible entity may use CSBG funds for.   Ms. Jackson Lee's amendment requires the Comptroller General to  conduct a study to identify the uses, programs, and activities that  have the greatest impact and uses of funds under the program.   Ms. Moore's amendment authorizes States to use their statewide funds  to ensure that eligible entities have the necessary supports to address  food insecurity needs of low-income individuals, families, and  communities.   Mr. Payne's and Ms. Tlaib's amendments ensure that CSBG funds can be  used for home repairs for health and safety, energy, and water for low- income individuals.  [[Page H4944]]    Mr. Payne's amendment clarifies that CSBG funds can be used to  address emergency needs, including emergency needs due to a national or  public health emergency.   Ms. Pressley's amendment ensures that eligible entities take into  account trauma prevention and mitigation when establishing partnerships  to promote healthy communities.   Ms. Tlaib's, Mr. Payne's, Ms. Newman's, Ms. Barragan's, and Mr.  Torres of New York's amendments add a requirement for the State to  describe how the State and eligible entities will coordinate programs  related to utility and water assistance services.   Mr. Torres of New York's amendment revises the reporting requirements  of the Community Action Innovations Program to include an analysis of  best practices for reducing poverty.   And Ms. Wild's amendment requires that eligible entities post their  strategic plan, community needs assessment, and community action plan  on their website.   These amendments en bloc contain commonsense proposals that  strengthen the underlying bill. I thank my colleagues for their  contributions. I strongly urge support of the amendments en bloc and  the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Nevada (Mr. Horsford).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes), a member of the Committee on Education  and Labor.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Madam Speaker, once again, I reiterate that these amendments en bloc  contain commonsense proposals that strengthen the underlying bill. I  appreciate my colleagues for their contributions and their strong  support of improving access to services, combating poverty, and  uplifting low-income people in our communities.   I strongly urge support of the amendments en bloc and the underlying  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to section 11 of House  Resolution 1097, I rise to offer amendments en bloc No. 2.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to these amendments en  bloc. The amendments contained in this en bloc are either a distraction  from the bipartisan work we are doing today or fundamentally undermine  the improvements we are putting forth in this legislation. Notably,  this en bloc includes yet another Republican attack on women's rights  and liberty.   Instead of focusing on what we have accomplished together to  strengthen this program in a bipartisan way, some of my colleagues  across the aisle are trying to further divide us. Madam Speaker, it has  been 24 years since the last reauthorization of the community services  block grant program in 1998.  [[Page H4949]]  Our communities need a comprehensive reauthorization, not a partisan  controversy that will delay the urgent need to renew this program.   From the beginning of the program, community action agencies have  addressed the health needs of low-income individuals in their  communities, particularly important to rural communities. The 1964  Economic Opportunity Act, which first authorized the community action  program, the predecessor to CSBG, specifies that such program shall be  conducted in those fields with the purposes of this part, including  employment, job training and counseling, and health, indicating that  health has always been and continues to be a core part of addressing  poverty conditions that is the central mission of these agencies.   Additionally, this en bloc would seek to strip out language from H.R.  5129 allowing CAAs, community action agencies, to serve individuals up  to 200 percent of the Federal poverty line.   Congress supported, in a bipartisan manner, allowing community action  agencies to serve individuals up to 200 percent of the poverty line to  provide flexibility during the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, for  example, the FY 2022 Labor/HHS appropriations bill, and the recently  passed omnibus all included an allowance for CAAs to serve individuals  up to 200 percent of the poverty line.   The CSBG statute, which we know now is more than 20 years out of  date, sets the income eligibility for CSBG services at 100 percent of  the official poverty line or 125 percent if the State chooses.  Currently, the very low-income eligibility criteria--this is equivalent  to about $27,180 for a single person in 2022--for CSBG creates a cliff.  Individuals will be cut off from public assistance and services as soon  as they make a dime over the income threshold.   We must remember that community action agencies are unique, as they  do not operate a single program. Rather, CAAs operate and often  coordinate an array of Federal, State, and local programs, all with  varying eligibility requirements. For example, more than half of  community action agencies operate the Weatherization Assistance  Program. That uses 200 percent of the poverty income guidance as the  eligibility criteria.   I will share a story of Daniel from North Dakota. When the pandemic  struck, Daniel was working in a fast-food restaurant, and his hours  were reduced. With his employment income, he is above the statutory 125  percent, but below the 200 percent flexibility Congress has provided  with bipartisan support. Unfortunately, Daniel's housing was unstable,  and he was couch surfing. He received case management to assist with  his housing search. Through CSBG funds provided under the CARES Act, he  received assistance with a security deposit in February of 2021. With  this assistance, Daniel has maintained stable housing for over a year.   Madam Speaker, Daniel's story is just one example of why raising the  Federal poverty level eligibility to 200 percent is so critical to this  legislation. Unlike the underlying legislation, these amendments en  bloc would weaken CSBG, or it offers solutions in search of problems.    One of the needless proposals in this en bloc actually duplicates the  current funding restriction in the bill and statute for voter  registration activities which, of course, are nonpartisan activities.   Madam Speaker, we are here today to support a bipartisan CSBG  reauthorization and the important work of community action agencies in  our communities. These amendments en bloc would move us backward. I  strongly urge my colleagues to reject these amendments in this en bloc  and support the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have a lot to say in response to the  gentleman, but I am going to take a deep breath and say, this is a bill  about helping to lift low-income Americans out of poverty. It is a  bipartisan bill we have been working on for many years. It is time to  update the community services block grant program and help lift low- income Americans in Oregon and across the country out of poverty.   I oppose these amendments en bloc, and I encourage my colleagues to  oppose them. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I continue  to reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, again, I reiterate my strong opposition to this en  bloc amendment and support for the underlying bill.   This bipartisan bill is about improving services for our communities  through community action, and these efforts are long overdue.   Unlike the underlying bill that enjoys broad bipartisan support and  reflects the input of stakeholders who represent these agencies and  their vital work in our communities, this en bloc amendment ignores  what we have accomplished together to strengthen this program and seeks  to further divide us.   Rather than addressing the real needs of low-income individuals, this  en bloc amendment attacks women's reproductive rights at a time when  they are under attack nationally.   The sponsors of this en bloc amendment have injected controversy into  a policy on voter registration, which is nonpartisan. Head Start has  had a nearly identical policy for the last 40 years with little  evidence of a problem.   Together, these amendments all failed in our bipartisan committee  markup, and they should again.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject this en bloc  amendment and support the underlying bill. I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Gottheimer for  his amendment and for his leadership in addressing the needs of our  country's veterans.   Madam Speaker, this amendment will help community action agencies  meet the needs of veterans, particularly homeless veterans.   Although many community action agencies already implement other  Federal programs serving veterans, this amendment will emphasize that  all eligible entities are able and equipped to serve veterans and their  communities.   Again, I thank my colleague for offering this amendment, and I thank  the ranking member for supporting it as well.
