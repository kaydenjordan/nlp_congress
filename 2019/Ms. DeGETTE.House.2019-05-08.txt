 Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. Another week, another  school shooting, this time right outside my district at the STEM  Highlands Ranch School.   My heart aches for everybody there, but you know something? That is  so far from enough.   People say it is too soon, we can't talk about gun safety, but you  know what? Tell that to the survivors of Columbine, only 7 miles away  from STEM Highlands, who have been waiting for 20 years for it to be  time.   Tell that to the Sandy Hook parents.   Tell that to the thousands of parents around this country who have  lost their children in school shootings and just simply shootings on  street corners.   The time has come. We need commonsense gun safety legislation, and we  need it now. Until then, the blood of these children and all of the  other children are on all of our hands.                            ____________________
