 Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from Maine  speaking about the virtues of wild Maine blueberries. They happen to be  one of my favorite foods--obviously, the lobsters as well.   I agree with him that there appears to be an arbitrary distinction  with these support payments that are supposed to compensate farmers for  the trade war with China, which I think, unfortunately, is necessary to  get China to conform to a rules-based system when it comes to  international trade.   Certainly, in the interest of preserving the wild Maine blueberry, I  am happy to offer any services I might be able to provide to support  our colleagues from Maine.                            ____________________     Madam President, over the weekend, we marked 1 year since  the leaders of the United States, Mexico, and Canada signed the U.S.- Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement. This modern trade agreement will replace  the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which has been the  guiding force for North American trade for the past quarter of a  century.   When NAFTA was created, its goal was to remove barriers that impede  free and fair trade and provide economic benefits to all three  countries. By any measure, NAFTA has been an overwhelming success, but  a lot has changed in 25 years since NAFTA went into effect, and it is  time to bring North American trade into the 21st century. That is  precisely what the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, USMCA, will do.  It preserves the hallmark provisions of NAFTA, like duty-free access to  Mexican and Canadian markets, and adds measures to modernize the  agreement. The USMCA provides strong protections for intellectual  property, which is critical to protecting the incredible innovation  that Americans do right here at home. It also cuts redtape that is  preventing countless small businesses from tapping into foreign  markets, and it accounts for e-commerce and digital products, something  unheard of 25 years ago, at a time when governments around the world  are proposing all kinds of new taxes on e-commerce.   It is actually the first free-trade agreement with a digital trade  chapter. That is why a lot of folks call this NAFTA 2.0. It is better.  It is stronger. It modernizes the original NAFTA.   We have been told by the experts that the USMCA will lead to  increased wealth and jobs here in the United States--about 176,000 new  jobs. That is  [[Page S6846]]  on top of the 13 million jobs currently supported by trade between  Canada, the United States, and Mexico.   It is expected to have a positive impact on every industry sector of  the U.S. economy and a more than $33 billion increase in our exports-- things we grow, like wild Maine blueberries, and sell overseas, things  we make and manufacture.   This isn't just a win for our farmers, manufacturers, and consumers;  it is a win for our entire country. Coincidentally, it is also a big  win for Texas. Our State has the 10th largest economy in the world, and  it is the engine behind much of our country's trade. In 2018, we  exported more than $137 billion in goods and services to Canada and  Mexico. With the passage of the USMCA, that number will go up.   I think the only question left is, When will we get a chance to vote  on it? Mexico approved the deal in June. Canada is moving toward  ratification soon, so the only remaining hurdle is the green light from  Speaker Pelosi and the House of Representatives. We heard early on that  House Democrats had some concerns with the agreement, but we were told  by the administration--Ambassador Lighthizer, for example--that he  thought the negotiations with the House were going well and were being  done in good faith. Mexico has made commitments related to some of the  labor provisions that were a concern to our Democratic colleagues.  President Lopez Obrador even wrote a letter to the Speaker last week  affirming that they will fulfill the promises they made. Speaker Pelosi  has said repeatedly over the last year that progress was being made and  that we are close to a deal and that she hopes we will vote soon. We  have heard that over and over and over but still no vote.   Here we are. More than 365 days have gone by since this agreement was  signed, and the House still hasn't had a vote. Rather than working to  iron out the final details so we can get the USMCA moving before  Christmas, the Speaker kicked off the week in Spain talking about the  Paris accord and climate change. Unfortunately, our Democratic  colleagues seem to want to talk about anything and everything other  than the priorities we should have in the Congress. Whether they want  to be absorbed by impeachment mania or they want to talk about climate  change in London, in Paris, they want to talk about anything other than  the work that is right here in front of us that we need to get done:  things like the USMCA, things like lowering drug prices for consumers,  things like an infrastructure bill and improving our highways and  bridges, reducing traffic--which we all hate on a bipartisan basis-- addressing some of the root causes of the mass violence incidents,  including mental health challenges that many people face who are a  danger to themselves and others, and things like how can we get people  who should be conducting background checks on firearm purchases--making  sure that the laws on the books are being enforced. Those are all  things we can and should be doing.   Apparently, that is not the priority for the Speaker. For an entire  year now, House Democrats have kept American farmers, businesses,  workers, and consumers waiting. With each day that goes by, while the  USMCA waits in purgatory, the American people are missing out. We know  that the longer this goes on, the closer this gets into the active  election season of 2020, the less likely it is that we are actually  going to have the bandwidth to get it done. I don't understand why our  Democratic colleagues are putting new American jobs on hold. Are they  saying we don't need this increased wealth that this trade agreement  will bring? Is that really their argument? Are they telling the  American businesses that they really don't care about leveling the  playing field? Is that the message we are supposed to get from this  lack of activity, this inaction?   With House Democrats working overtime in the futile effort to remove  the President from office and undo an election, they are squandering  what may be our biggest opportunity this Congress. Unfortunately,  partisanship has broken out and obstructed bipartisan desire to get our  work done, including the USMCA.   I mentioned some of the other things we could and should be doing. A  few weeks ago, the minority leader, the Democratic leader,  singlehandedly blocked a bipartisan bill that the Senator from  Connecticut, Senator Blumenthal, and I introduced that would bring down  prescription drug prices. This bill passed--sailed through--the Senate  Judiciary Committee on a bipartisan, unanimous vote. Yet, when we  brought it to the floor, our Democratic colleague the minority leader,  who called this a good bill and well-intentioned, objected to its  passage.    Then there is the appropriations process that had been thrown into  chaos. In August, we had an agreement on spending caps for the next 2  years. We thought we had overcome the biggest hurdle to getting our  work done in order to make sure our military was funded and to make  sure that we were meeting the other financial obligations that the  Federal Government has to meet, but our Democratic colleagues walked  back on the commitment they had made in August over a 0.3-percent  disagreement on Federal spending. That is right--0.3-percent of what  the Federal Government spends. That is what caused them to backtrack on  their agreement. They have now kept our military waiting for the  funding and the stability it needs to keep our Nation safe.   They have also defeated, at least temporarily, a bipartisan--nearly  unanimous--prescription drug bill that would bring down prescription  drug costs, and it is hard for me to understand why.   I would like to be able to head home for the Christmas holidays with  some good news--good news for the Texans who are eager to see the USMCA  ratified. Generally speaking, I am a ``glass half full'' kind of guy,  not a ``glass half empty,'' but I am losing confidence that we will see  progress on the USMCA before Christmas. The longer this goes on, the  less likely we will actually find the opportunity to get it done.   It seems to me that impeachment mania has consumed this Congress and  rendered our colleagues on the other side incapable of focusing on  anything other than removing President Trump from office. Time is  running out, and I hope the USMCA doesn't become the latest casualty to  land in Senator Schumer's legislative graveyard.   At some point, we have to put politics aside and do what we were sent  here to do, which is to make progress that will benefit the American  people. Let's hope we can do that during this holiday season before it  is over.
