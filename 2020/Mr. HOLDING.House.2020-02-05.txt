 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Eddie Bridges  of Greensboro, North Carolina.   Members of Congress rarely get the opportunity to honor those who  have truly dedicated their lives to the public good. That is because it  is increasingly  [[Page H772]]  rare to encounter those who are truly selfless, truly dedicated to a  cause larger than themselves, and who truly care about preserving the  best of our natural resources for future generations. Greensboro's  Eddie Bridges is such a rare person.   Madam Speaker, Eddie is an unselfish leader whose love of the  outdoors and sportsmen's community has led him to become one of the  most effective conservation leaders in the history of North Carolina.   On behalf of North Carolina's congressional delegation, I want the  world to know what an impact Eddie has made and to thank him in this  official salute, which nobody has ever deserved more.   Madam Speaker, Eddie founded the North Carolina Wildlife Habitat  Foundation, which raised $5 million and has funded $1.5 million in  conservation projects across North Carolina.                                time  1045    Eddie has been the driving force behind wildlife resource  improvements that will benefit future generations forever. Thanks to  Eddie's persuasive abilities and creative thinking, he has recruited  the State of North Carolina and others to join him--to the tune of  millions of dollars in projects--to improve wildlife restoration, water  quality, and habitats statewide.   Eddie's foundation has funded, for example, a quail habitat project  in the Sandhills Game Land, a bass habitat project at Jordan Lake, a  North Carolina State University black bear research project in Hyde  County, and created the Frank A. Sharpe Junior Wildlife Education  Center in Guilford County.   We can all thank Eddie Bridges for the idea to create the North  Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission's Wildlife Endowment Fund, which  currently has $130 million in assets and has funded $70 million for  wildlife restoration and habitat improvements.   Madam Speaker, Eddie also helped create the State waterfowl stamp and  State income tax checkoff for nongame and endangered wildlife, which  together have raised $10 million for nongame wildlife and waterfowl  projects. The endowments founded by Eddie have raised more than $200  million to preserve and improve our natural habitat areas.   Eddie served 12 years on the North Carolina Wildlife Resources  Commission after being appointed by Governor Hunt. He has received top  national awards, including the Field and Stream Conservation Hero of  the Year Award, the Budweiser National Conservationist of the Year  Award, the prestigious Feinstone Award, the Thomas L. Quay Wildlife  Diversity Award, and the Chevron Conservation Award. Last year, Eddie  was inducted into the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame.   But talk to Eddie and he will tell you these awards aren't about him;  they are about his desire to give something back. As Eddie said to the  Wilmington Star-News last January: ``It's about much more than me. It  honors the 1 million men, women, and children who hunt and fish and  inject more than $1.3 billion into North Carolina's economy every  year.''   An accomplished athlete at Elon University, a leader in the sportsman  community, and a hunter and angler legend, conservationist Eddie  Bridges has made a positive impact on North Carolina's natural  resources like no other before him.   Madam Speaker, on behalf of the entire delegation, I wish to thank  Eddie for his years of service, his incredible resource development to  strengthen our State's wildlife, and the educational impact on our  youth and future generations. It is truly an honor to know Eddie and to  recognize him today.                            ____________________
