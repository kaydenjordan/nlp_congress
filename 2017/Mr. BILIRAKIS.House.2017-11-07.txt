 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 918) to amend title 38, United States Code, to direct the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish mental health care to certain  former members of the Armed Forces who are not otherwise eligible to  receive such care, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 918         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veteran Urgent Access to       Mental Healthcare Act''.       SEC. 2.

(a) In General.--Chapter 17 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended by inserting after section 1720H the       following new section:       ``Sec. 1720I. Expansion of mental health care for certain         former members of the Armed Forces         ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall furnish to former       members of the Armed Forces described in subsection (b)--        ``(1) an initial mental health assessment; and        ``(2) the mental health care services authorized under this       chapter that the Secretary determines are required to treat       the mental health care needs of the former member, including       risk of suicide or harming others.        ``(b) Former Members of the Armed Forces Described.--A       former member of the Armed Forces described in this       subsection is an individual who meets the following criteria:        ``(1) The individual is a former member of the Armed       Forces, including the reserve components, who--        ``(A) served in the active military, naval, or air service,       and was discharged or released therefrom under a condition       that is not honorable except--        ``(i) dishonorable; or        ``(ii) bad conduct discharge;        ``(B) has applied for a character of service determination       and such determination has not been made; and        ``(C) is not otherwise eligible to enroll in the health       care system established by section 1705 of this title by       reason of such discharge or release not meeting the       requirements of section 101(2) of this title.        ``(2) While serving in the Armed Forces--        ``(A) the former member was deployed in a theater of combat       operations or an area at a time during which hostilities       occurred in that area;        ``(B) participated in or experienced such combat operations       or hostilities, including by controlling an unmanned aerial       vehicle from a location other than such theater or area; or        ``(C) was the victim of a physical assault of a sexual       nature, battery of a sexual nature, or sexual harassment (as       defined in section 1720D(f) of this title).        ``(c) Non-Department Care.--(1) In furnishing mental health       care services to an individual under this section, the       Secretary may provide such mental health care services at a       non-Department facility if--        ``(A) in the judgment of a mental health professional       employed by the Department, the receipt of mental health care       services by that individual in facilities of the Department       would be clinically inadvisable; or        ``(B) facilities of the Department are not capable of       furnishing such mental health care services to that       individual economically because of geographical       inaccessibility.        ``(2) The Secretary shall carry out paragraph (1) pursuant       to section 1703 of this title or any other provision of law       authorizing the Secretary to enter into contracts or       agreements to furnish hospital care and medical services to       veterans at non-Department facilities.        ``(d) Setting and Referrals.--In furnishing mental health       care services to an individual under this section, the       Secretary shall--        ``(1) seek to ensure that such mental health care services       are furnished in a setting that is therapeutically       appropriate, taking into account the circumstances that       resulted in the need for such mental health care services;       and        ``(2) provide referral services to assist former members       who are not eligible for services under this chapter to       obtain services from sources outside the Department.        ``(e) Information.--The Secretary shall provide information       on the mental health care services available under this       section.

[[Page H8551]]      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 918, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 918, as amended, which  was introduced by my friend and longtime committee member, the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Coffman).   Mr. Speaker, there have been a number of different names for stress- related military health conditions throughout our Nation's history:  battle fatigue, combat stress reaction, shell shock, post-traumatic  stress disorder.   Too often we see military personnel returning home with difficulties  adjusting to civilian life. For many returning servicemembers, these  stressors affect one's postdeployment, especially those receiving other  than honorable discharges.   Under current law, military personnel who separate under this status  are not eligible for healthcare benefits or general services typically  offered to honorable or generally discharged veterans through the  Department of Veterans Affairs.   Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear, I firmly believe that discharge  status is an important tool for military leadership, a tool which helps  preserve order and discipline among the ranks. Removing the proverbial  bad apples from the bushel is key to maintaining a cohesive unit  structure.   However, there also seems to be an evolving trend of soldiers who  receive other than honorable discharges as a result of their military  experience, rather than simply being a bad or ineffective soldier.   In fact, according to the Medal of Honor Society, there are no fewer  than eight Medal of Honor recipients who have received other than  honorable discharges. H.R. 918, as amended, would provide that those  combat veterans who receive other than honorable discharge statuses  would be eligible to receive critical mental health assessments and  services from the Department of Veterans Affairs. It is only right, Mr.  Speaker.   Again, I appreciate the hard work and forward thinking of my friend  from Colorado, who is also a veteran, Mr. Coffman. I urge my colleagues  to support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I agree with the ranking member 100  percent. This needs to be done. It is long overdue, and thanks to my  good friend, Mr. Coffman, it is going to get done.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Coffman).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, once again, I encourage all  Members to support this legislation. Let's get it through the Senate,  as well, and get it on the President's desk, as he supports it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1133) to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize  the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide for an operation on a live  donor for purposes of conducting a transplant procedure for a veteran,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1133         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Transplant Coverage       Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION TO PROVIDE FOR OPERATIONS ON LIVE                     DONORS FOR PURPOSES OF CONDUCTING TRANSPLANT                     PROCEDURES FOR VETERANS.         Section 101 of the Veterans Access, Choice, and       Accountability Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-146; 38 U.S.C.       1701 note) is amended by adding after subsection (t) the       following new subsection:        ``(u) Transplant Procedures With Live Donors and Related       Services.--        ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), in a       case in which a veteran is eligible for a transplant       procedure from the Department, the Secretary may provide for       an operation on a live donor to carry out such procedure for       such veteran, notwithstanding that the live donor may not be       eligible for health care from the Department.        ``(2) Other services.--Subject to the availability of       appropriations for such purpose, the Secretary shall furnish       to a live donor any care or services before and after       conducting the transplant procedure under paragraph (1) that       may be required in connection with such procedure.        ``(3) Use of non-department facilities.--In carrying out       this subsection, the Secretary may provide for the operation       described in paragraph (1) on a live donor and furnish to the       live donor the care and services described in paragraph (2)       at a non-Department facility pursuant to an agreement entered       into by the Secretary under this section. The live donor       shall be deemed to be an individual eligible for hospital       care and medical services at a non-Department facility       pursuant to such an agreement solely for the purposes of       receiving such operation, care, and services at the non-      Department facility.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 1133, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1133, as amended, the  Veterans Transplant Coverage Act of 2017.   This bill is meant to remove an unnecessary barrier to care for  veterans in need of transplants involving a living donor.   Last year, Mr. Charles Nelson, a 100 percent service-connected  veteran from Texas, sought a kidney transplant through the Department  of Veterans Affairs with Mr. Nelson's nonveteran son, Austin, serving  as Mr. Nelson's live donor.   Rather than travel from his home in Texas to VA transplant centers in  either Nashville, Tennessee, or Portland, Oregon, Mr. Nelson requested  to receive his transplant at the University Hospital in San Antonio  using the Choice Program. However, his request was denied by VA because  Austin was not a veteran, and, therefore, VA did not believe the  Department had the authority to pay for this portion of the transplant  procedure with Choice funds.   Mr. Nelson eventually received his transplant in San Antonio using  his Medicare benefits, private donations, and personal savings to cover  the cost of his and Austin's care.   To prevent any other veterans from being unable to access transplant  care in the community under Choice, H.R. 1133, as amended, would amend  the Choice Program to allow VA to pay for any care or services a live  donor may require to carry out a transplant procedure for an eligible  veteran, notwithstanding that the live donor may not be eligible for VA  healthcare.   I thank my friend from Texas, Congressman Carter, for his dedication  to solving this problem for his constituent, Mr. Nelson, and for  veterans and families across the country. This is how Congress should  work. He is a great representative, and I am really proud to serve with  him.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 1133, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, once again, I urge my  colleagues to pass this very important bill. I encourage the Senate to  pass it as soon as possible so we can get it on the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1900) to designate the Veterans Memorial and Museum in  Columbus, Ohio, as the National Veterans Memorial and Museum, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1900         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Veterans Memorial       and Museum Act''.       SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL VETERANS MEMORIAL AND MUSEUM.         (a) Designation.--Subject to the condition described in       subsection (b), the memorial and museum that is, as of the       date of the enactment of this Act, being constructed on an       approximately 7-acre area on West Broad Street, Columbus,       Ohio, bounded by the Scioto River and the Scioto Greenway,       shall be designated as the ``National Veterans Memorial and       Museum''.        (b) Withdrawal of Designation.--The designation under       subsection (a) may be withdrawn no earlier than five years       after the date on which the museum opens the public, pursuant       to an Act of Congress, if the progress and operation of the       museum are found to be unsatisfactory based on the report       submitted under subsection (c).        (c) Report to Congress.--        (1) In general.--As a condition of the designation under       subsection (a), the director of the memorial and museum       described in that subsection shall submit to Congress a       report on the memorial and museum by not later than the date       specified in paragraph (2). Such report shall include each of       the following:        (A) The projected budget for the memorial and museum for       the five-year period beginning on the date the memorial and       museum is expected to open to the public.        (B) A description of the outreach conducted by the memorial       and museum to veterans across the United States to receive       input about the design and contents of the memorial and       museum.        (C) A description of the process by which decisions are       made about the contents of the exhibits displayed at the       memorial and museum.        (D) A description of the organizational structure of the       memorial and museum.        (E) A copy of the bylaws and rules of the memorial and       museum.        (F) A list of any organizations or entities that have       accredited the memorial and museum.        (2) Deadline for report.--The date specified in this       paragraph is the earlier of the following dates:        (A) The date that is 90 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act.        (B) The date that is 30 days before the date on which the       memorial and museum is first open to the public.        (d) Effect of Designation.--The national memorial and       museum designated by subsection (a) is not a unit of the       National Park System, and the designation of the national       memorial and museum shall not be construed to require Federal       funds to be expended for any purpose related to the national       memorial and museum.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1900, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1900, as amended.   H.R. 1900, as amended, would designate the Veterans Memorial and  Museum in Columbus, Ohio, as the National Veterans Memorial and Museum.  The national designation is appropriate because this will be the only  memorial and museum in the Nation that will honor our veterans  throughout our Nation's history.   Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished ranking member, Mr. Walz, of  course, for working with the bill sponsor; and our chairman, Chairman  Roe; and, of course, Mr. Stivers, who is the bill's sponsor; and me, to  ensure that the Veterans Memorial and Museum will maintain the highest  standards after it receives the national designation.   H.R. 1900, as amended, will require the museum to provide a report to  Congress that would include information on its organizational and  financial projections.   The bill specifically states that, after 5 years, if the memorial and  museum is not operating satisfactorily, then Congress may withdraw the  national designation. We hope that doesn't happen.   Moreover, H.R. 1900, as amended, makes it clear that the museum and  memorial is not affiliated with the National Park System, and that the  bill does not authorize Federal funds for the museum.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 1900, as amended, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the ranking member. We  had a little issue in committee, but we didn't stall the bill. We  worked that out and moved forward. So let's get the Senate to pass it  now after we pass it today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Stivers), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Davidson).    Mr. Speaker, again, we need to teach our children the  value of military service so they can appreciate it. These are our true  American heroes. I am looking forward to visiting Mrs. Beatty in  Columbus.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mrs. Beatty and, of course, General  Stivers for doing such a wonderful job in getting this bill done, and I  also thank the ranking member.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2123) to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the  ability of health care professionals to treat veterans through the use  of telemedicine, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2123         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans E-Health and       Telemedicine Support Act of 2017'' or the ``VETS Act of       2017''.       SEC. 2. LICENSURE OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS OF THE                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS PROVIDING                     TREATMENT VIA TELEMEDICINE.         (a) In General.--Chapter 17 of title 38, United States       Code, is amended by inserting after section 1730A the       following new section:       ``Sec. 1730B. Licensure of health care professionals         providing treatment via telemedicine         ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any provision of law       regarding the licensure of health care professionals, a       covered health care professional may practice the health care       profession of the health care professional at any location in       any State, regardless of where the covered health care       professional or the patient is located, if the covered health       care professional is using telemedicine to provide treatment       to an individual under this chapter.        ``(b) Property of Federal Government.--Subsection (a) shall       apply to a covered health care professional providing       treatment to a patient regardless of whether the covered       health care professional or patient is located in a facility       owned by the Federal Government during such treatment.        ``(c) Construction.--Nothing in this section may be       construed to remove, limit, or otherwise affect any       obligation of a covered health care professional under the       Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.).        ``(d) Covered Health Care Professional Defined.--In this       section, the term `covered health care professional' means a       health care professional who--        ``(1) is an employee of the Department appointed under the       authority under sections 7306, 7401, 7405, 7406, or 7408 of       this title, or title 5;        ``(2) is authorized by the Secretary to provide health care       under this chapter;        ``(3) is required to adhere to all quality standards       relating to the provision of telemedicine in accordance with       applicable policies of the Department; and  [[Page H8557]]         ``(4) has an active, current, full, and unrestricted       license, registration, or certification in a State to       practice the health care profession of the health care       professional.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the       beginning of chapter 17 of such title is amended by inserting       after the item relating to section 1730A the following new       item:  ``1730B. Licensure of health care professionals providing treatment via                telemedicine.''.        (c) Report on Telemedicine.--        (1) In general.--Not later than one year after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall submit to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the       Senate and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives a report on the effectiveness of the use of       telemedicine by the Department of Veterans Affairs.        (2) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall       include an assessment of the following:        (A) The satisfaction of veterans with telemedicine       furnished by the Department.        (B) The satisfaction of health care providers in providing       telemedicine furnished by the Department.        (C) The effect of telemedicine furnished by the Department       on the following:        (i) The ability of veterans to access health care, whether       from the Department or from non-Department health care       providers.        (ii) The frequency of use by veterans of telemedicine.        (iii) The productivity of health care providers.        (iv) Wait times for an appointment for the receipt of       health care from the Department.        (v) The reduction, if any, in the use by veterans of in-      person services at Department facilities and non-Department       facilities.        (D) The types of appointments for the receipt of       telemedicine furnished by the Department that were provided       during the one-year period preceding the submittal of the       report.        (E) The number of appointments for the receipt of       telemedicine furnished by the Department that were requested       during such period, disaggregated by Veterans Integrated       Service Network.        (F) Savings by the Department, if any, including travel       costs, of furnishing health care through the use of       telemedicine during such period.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2123.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2123, the Veterans E- Health and Telemedicine Support Act of 2017.   I believe that telemedicine represents the future of healthcare  delivery, and I am proud of the fact that the Department of Veterans  Affairs is a longtime leader in telemedicine.   Through VA's many different telehealth modalities, VA doctors and  nurses have been able to better serve veterans in remote, rural, or  medically underserved areas and veterans with limited mobility or other  issues that make it difficult to travel to and from the VA medical  facilities for needed appointments and follow-up care. Importantly,  veterans who have had experience accessing care through telemedicine  have demonstrated improved healthcare outcomes, including decreases in  hospital admissions.   It is my hope that all veterans would have access to VA telemedicine  when and where appropriate. However, the continued expansion of  telemedicine across the VA healthcare system has been constrained by  restrictions on the ability of VA providers to practice telemedicine  across State lines without jeopardizing their State medical license.   H.R. 2123, the Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support Act of  2017, would remove those constraints by authorizing the VA providers to  practice telemedicine at a location in any State, regardless of where  the provider or patient is located. This would provide VA clinicians  the statutory protection they need to continue providing high-quality  telehealthcare to veteran patients across the country without fear of  penalties imposed by the State medical licensing boards.   I am grateful to my friend and colleague, Representative Glenn  Thompson from the great State of Pennsylvania, for his leadership on  this issue and for bringing this important bill forward.   I am also grateful to my fellow committee member, Representative  Julia Brownley of California, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Health, for her work and advocacy on VA telemedicine.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  2123, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), who is the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Coffman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  the great State of Michigan (Mr. Bergman).    Mr. Speaker, this puts the veterans first, as the  gentleman said; and, again, the veteran has a choice as to whether to  use telemedicine or go to see the doctor, because it doesn't work for  everyone.   But, in any case, this is a great bill. It puts the veteran first. I  urge my colleagues to pass this particular bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2601) to amend the Veterans Access, Choice, and  Accountability Act of 2014 to improve the access of veterans to organ  transplants, and for other purposes, as amended.  [[Page H8559]]    The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 2601         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Increased Choice       for Transplanted Organs and Recovery Act of 2017'' or the       ``VICTOR Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. ORGAN TRANSPLANTS UNDER THE VETERANS CHOICE PROGRAM.         Section 101(b)(2) of the Veterans Access, Choice, and       Accountability Act of 2014 (Public Law 113-146; 38 U.S.C.       1701 note) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (C)(ii), by striking ``or'';        (2) in subparagraph (D)(ii)(II)(dd), by striking the period       and inserting ``; or''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:        ``(E)(i) requires an organ or bone marrow transplant; and        ``(ii)(I) has, in the opinion of the primary health care       provider of the veteran, a medically compelling reason to       travel outside the region of the Organ Procurement and       Transplantation Network, established under section 372 of the       National Organ Transplantation Act (Public Law 98-507; 42       U.S.C. 274), in which the veteran resides to receive such       transplant at a medical facility of the Department; or        ``(II) faces an unusual or excessive burden in receiving       such transplant at a medical facility of the Department,       including--        ``(aa) geographical challenges;        ``(bb) environmental factors, including roads that are not       accessible to the general public, traffic, or hazardous       weather;        ``(cc) a medical condition of the veteran that affects the       ability to travel; or        ``(dd) other factors the Secretary determines appropriate,       including the preference of the veteran to receive such       transplant at a non-Department facility.''.       SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.         The amendments made by this Act shall take effect on the       later of--        (1) October 1, 2018; and        (2) the date of the enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that at all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2601, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2601, as amended, the  Veterans Increased Choice for Transplanted Organs and Recovery, or  VICTOR, Act of 2017, which is sponsored by my good friend and fellow  committee member, Dr. Neal Dunn from the great State of Florida.   The VA healthcare system has offered solid organ transplant services  since 1962 and bone marrow transplant services since 1982 through the  VA Transplant Program, which manages 13 transplant centers across the  country.   However, since Congress created the Choice Program in 2014 to address  access to care concerns at VA medical facilities, the committee has  heard an increasing number of complaints about the VA Transplant  Program from veterans who are concerned about the lengthy travel  required for many veterans to reach a VA transplant center and  bureaucratic barriers to receiving transplant care closer to home.                                time  1545    According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, a  greater distance from a VA transplant center was associated with a  lower likelihood of receiving a transplant and a greater likelihood of  death among veteran transplant patients.   That can't happen. This is unacceptable, in my opinion. H.R. 2601, as  amended, represents a commonsense solution. That is what we are all  about today: commonsense solutions for our true heroes. It would  require the VA to consider whether there is a medically compelling  reason to require a veteran to travel outside the organ procurement and  transplantation network region that the veteran resides in to receive a  transplant from a VA transplant center, or whether the veteran faces an  unusual or excessive burden in receiving a transplant from a VA  transplant center before referring a veteran to a VA transplant center,  rather than to a community transplant center.   This would greatly increase access to transplant care in the  community for veteran transplant patients living far from VA transplant  centers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Dunn), the sponsor of the bill and my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Bost).    Mr. Speaker, I encourage all the Members to support  this great piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3634) to amend title 38, United States Code, to ensure that  individuals may access documentation verifying the monthly housing  stipend paid to the individual under the Post-9/11 Educational  Assistance Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3634         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Securing Electronic Records       for Veterans' Ease Act of 2017'' or the ``SERVE Act of       2017''.       SEC. 2. PROVISION OF MONTHLY HOUSING STIPEND INFORMATION                     UNDER POST-                    9/11 EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OF THE                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         Section 3313 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by       adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(j) Provision of Housing Stipend Payment Information.--      The Secretary shall furnish to individuals receiving       educational assistance under this chapter documentation that       verifies the amount of the monthly housing stipend the       individual receives under this section. The Secretary shall       make such documentation available to the individual using an       internet website in the same manner the Secretary provides       documentation verifying compensation and other benefits       furnished by the Secretary to individuals.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks, and include  extraneous material on H.R. 3634.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3634, the Securing  Electronic Records for Veterans' Ease Act of 2017, or SERVE Act.   Under the post-9/11 GI Bill, eligible servicemembers, veterans, and  their dependents are provided a monthly allowance that is based on the  cost of living where they are taking the majority of their classes at  the E-5 with dependents rate.   For many students, this living stipend payment can be their only  source of income, and proving that they will receive this payment while  in school is important for them to show income for the purposes of  renting an apartment or home while they are in school. It makes sense.   The SERVE Act would help address this problem and would require the  Secretary to electronically provide documentation that verifies the  amount of the monthly housing stipend an individual receives under the  GI Bill. This would allow beneficiaries to use this documentation as  proof of income when applying for housing.   Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that will help  student veterans secure housing and would eliminate roadblocks to a  student veteran's academic success. I thank Mr. Jim Himes of  Connecticut for introducing this particular bill. It has my support.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsor of the bill, Mr.  Himes, first of all, for holding the roundtables and the town halls-- they mean so much--and identifying the problem. We are solving it here  today, so I appreciate all of the support for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3705) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to require  the use of certified mail and plain language in certain debt collection  activities, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3705         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Fair Debt Notice       Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS NOTICE RELATING TO                     DEBT COLLECTION ACTIVITIES.         (a) Debt Notification Letters.--The Secretary of Veterans       Affairs shall collaborate with veterans service organizations       to write a standard letter to be provided to individuals who       the Secretary determines owe debts to the Department of       Veterans Affairs. Such letter shall be written in plain       language and shall include a notice of the debt and a clear       explanation of--        (1) why the individual owes money to the Department of       Veterans Affairs; and        (2) the options available to the individual.        (b) Delivery of Letters.--The Secretary shall develop a       method by which individuals may elect to receive debt       notification letters by electronic means and shall ensure, to       the extent practicable, that the letter developed under       subsection (a) is delivered to intended recipients who have       made such an election by both standard mail and by electronic       means and to intended recipients who have not made such an       election only by standard mail.        (c) Notice to Congress.--        (1) Notice of completion.--Upon completion of the letter       required under subsection (a), the Secretary shall submit to       Congress notice of the completion of the letter.        (2) Progress reports.--If the Secretary has not submitted       the notice required by paragraph (1) by the date that is 90       days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the       Secretary shall--        (A) submit to Congress a report describing the progress of       the Secretary toward implementing subsection (a) and an       explanation for why the letter has not been completed; and        (B) every 30 days thereafter until the submittal of the       notice required by paragraph (1), submit to Congress an       update to the report under subparagraph (A) that includes an       additional explanation for the failure to complete the       letter.        (d) Study; Report.--        (1) Study.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall conduct       a study on the process by which the Department of Veterans       Affairs notifies veterans of debt collection efforts. Such       study shall include--        (A) an analysis of the scope of the problem of veterans not       receiving debt collection notices;        (B) a description of any non-legislative actions the       Secretary could take to reduce the number of incorrect or       unknown addresses of veterans in the databases of the       Department and a timeline for adopting such actions; and        (C) an estimate of the costs associated with sending debt       collection notices by certified mail.        (2) Report.--Not later than 12 months after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to Congress       a report on the study conducted under paragraph (1).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H.R. 3705, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3705, as amended, the  Veterans Fair Debt Notice Act of 2017, introduced by Congresswoman  Pingree from Maine.   This bill would help ensure that beneficiaries who have received an  overpayment from VA clearly understand why the Department believes the  veteran owes the money.   Under VA's current practice, when the Department determines that a  beneficiary may have received an overpayment, it sends a letter to the  beneficiary that explains why the debt was created and how the veteran  can dispute or mitigate the debt. But if VA doesn't have the veteran's  current address, the veteran may miss important deadlines. For example,  if the beneficiary intends to request a full waiver of the debt but  does not request that waiver within 30 days of the date of the letter,  VA may take action to withhold benefits until the waiver request is  adjudicated.   Sound confusing?   It certainly is. We can't have that for our veterans.   Another issue is that some veterans find the language used in the  letters to be unclear and confusing. I am sure that is true, too. It is  only fair that the veteran understands why the Department believes he  or she owes the money. It is the least we can do.   H.R. 3705, as amended, would require VA to develop a new notification  letter that explains in plain language how the alleged debt was created  and what actions the veteran can take to dispute or mitigate the debt.   In addition, the bill would direct VA to study and report to Congress  on its current debt collection process, including how many veterans are  not receiving debt collection notices because of incorrect addresses.  The report would also describe the steps VA will take to reduce the  number of incorrect addresses in the Department's databases.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let's pass this good bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3949) to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for  the designation of State approving agencies for multi-State  apprenticeship programs for purposes of the educational assistance  programs of the Department of Veterans Affairs, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3949         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Apprenticeship and       Labor Opportunity Reform Act'' or the ``VALOR Act''.       SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF STATE APPROVING AGENCIES FOR MULTI-                    STATE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS.         Paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of section 3672 of title       38, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:        ``(1)(A) The State approving agency for a multi-State       apprenticeship program is--        ``(i) for purposes of approval of the program, the State       approving agency for the State in which the headquarters of       the apprenticeship program is located; and        ``(ii) for all other purposes, the State approving agency       for the State in which the apprenticeship program takes       place.        ``(B) In this paragraph, the term `multi-State       apprenticeship program' means a non-Federal apprenticeship       program operating in more than one State that meets the       minimum national program standards, as developed by the       Department of Labor.''.       SEC. 3. ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENT FOR                     ASSISTANCE FOR APPRENTICESHIP AND OTHER ON-JOB                     TRAINING.         Section 3680(c) of title 38, United States Code, is amended       by striking ``shall have received--'' and all that follows       through ``person's certificate,'' and inserting ``receives       from the training establishment a certification''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H.R. 3949, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3949, as amended, the  Veterans Apprenticeship and Labor Opportunity Reform Act, or the VALOR  Act.   This bill, introduced by Mr. Khanna, Mr. Arrington, and Mr. O'Rourke,  would help streamline the approval of national apprenticeship programs  for the use of GI Bill funds, which is very important.   Once a national apprenticeship is GI Bill approved, veterans are  eligible for tiered payments that help them complete the program that  leads to a successful career.   This bill also helps eliminate an out-of-date requirement that  created unnecessary paperwork for a veteran to complete before they  could get paid for work completed during the apprenticeship.   Mr. Speaker, this is another commonsense, bipartisan bill that will  help employers become approved under the GI Bill and ensure the student  veterans secure placement in apprenticeship programs that lead to  employment.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Arrington.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Khanna and all the  sponsors, including Chairman Arrington, as well, for recognizing the  problem and solving it. This is the way Congress should work.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage support for this particular bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill  [[Page H8564]]  (H.R. 4173) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a  study on the Veterans Crisis Line, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4173         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Crisis Line Study       Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. STUDY ON EFFICACY OF VETERANS CRISIS LINE.         (a) Study.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall conduct       a study on the outcomes and the efficacy of the Veterans       Crisis Line during the five-year period beginning January 1,       2014, based on an analysis of national suicide data and data       collected from the Veterans Crisis Line.        (b) Matters Included.--The study under subsection (a) shall       address the following:        (1) The efficacy of the Veterans Crisis Line in leading       veterans to sustained mental health regimens, by       determining--        (A) the number of veterans who, after contacting the       Veterans Crisis Line and being referred to a suicide       prevention specialist, begin and continue mental health care       furnished by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; and        (B) the number of veterans who, after contacting the       Veterans Crisis Line and being referred to a suicide       prevention specialist, either--        (i) begin mental health care furnished by the Secretary but       do not continue such care; or        (ii) do not begin such care.        (2) The visibility of the Veterans Crisis Line, by       determining--        (A) the number of veterans who contact the Veterans Crisis       Line and have not previously received hospital care or       medical services furnished by the Secretary; and        (B) the number of veterans who contact the Veterans Crisis       Line and have previously received hospital care or medical       services furnished by the Secretary.        (3) The role of the Veterans Crisis Line as part of the       mental health care services of the Department, by       determining, of the veterans who are enrolled in the health       care system established under section 1705(a) of title 38,       United States Code, who contact the Veterans Crisis Line, the       number who are under the care of a mental health care       provider of the Department at the time of such contact.        (4) Whether receiving sustained mental health care affects       suicidality and whether veterans previously receiving mental       health care furnished by the Secretary use the Veterans       Crisis Line in times of crisis, with respect to the veterans       described in paragraph (3), by determining the time frame       between receiving such care and the time of such contact.        (5) The effectiveness of the Veterans Crisis Line in       assisting veterans at risk for suicide when the Veterans       Crisis Line is contacted by a non-veteran, by determining, of       the number of non-veterans who contact the Veterans Crisis       Line looking for support in assisting a veteran, how many of       such individuals receive support in having a veteran begin to       receive mental health care furnished by the Secretary.        (6) The overall efficacy of the Veterans Crisis Line in       preventing suicides and whether the number of contacts       affects the efficacy, by determining--        (A) the number of veterans who contact the Veterans Crisis       Line who ultimately commit or attempt suicide; and        (B) of such veterans, how many times did a veteran contact       the Veterans Crisis Line prior to committing or attempting       suicide.        (7) The long-term efficacy of the Veterans Crisis Line in       preventing repeated suicide attempts and whether the efficacy       is temporary, by determining, of the number of veterans who       contacted the Veterans Crisis Line and did not commit or       attempt suicide during the following six-month period, the       number who contacted the Veterans Crisis Line in crisis at a       later time and thereafter did commit or attempt suicide.        (8) Whether referral to mental health care affects the risk       of suicide, by determining--        (A) the number of veterans who contact the Veterans Crisis       Line who are not referred to, or do not continue receiving,       mental health care who commit suicide; and        (B) the number of veterans described in paragraph (1)(A)       who commit or attempt suicide.        (9) The efficacy of the Veterans Crisis Line to promote       continued mental health care in those veterans who are at       high risk for suicide whose suicide was prevented, by       determining, of the number of veterans who contacted the       Veterans Crisis Line and did not commit or attempt suicide       soon thereafter, the number that begin and continue to       receive mental health care furnished by the Secretary.        (10) Such other matters as the Secretary determines       appropriate.        (c) Rule of Construction Regarding Data Collection.--      Nothing in this section may be construed to modify or affect       the manner in which data is collected, or the kind or content       of data collected, by the Secretary under the Veterans Crisis       Line.        (d) Submission.--Not later than May 31, 2019, the Secretary       shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the       House of Representatives and the Senate the study under       subsection (a).        (e) Veterans Crisis Line Defined.--In this section, the       term ``Veterans Crisis Line'' means the toll-free hotline for       veterans established under section 1720F(h) of title 38,       United States Code.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4173, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4173, as amended, the  Veterans Crisis Line Study Act of 2017, offered by my friend and  committee member, Representative Jim Banks of Indiana.   Mr. Speaker, the Veterans Crisis Line, or VCL, was established in  2007 as a partnership between the Department of Veterans Affairs, the  Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and the  National Suicide Prevention Hotline.   According to the Government Accountability Office, as of May 2016,  the Veterans Crisis Line has answered over 2.3 million calls, over  55,000 texts, and dispatched emergency services over 61,000 times. As  these statistics show, the Veterans Crisis Line is an incredibly  valuable resource for veterans. However, while the VA tracks and  evaluates statistics such as these for quality and access metrics, it  does not currently process them through any meaningful form of data  analytics as it relates to the effectiveness of the program.   So, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4173, as amended, the Veterans Crisis Line  Study Act of 2017, would direct the Secretary to evaluate the efficacy  of the VCL with respect to continuity of VA mental health services  using the same anonymous data points as are currently collected by the  VCL. Research and data analysis of these anonymous data points would  utilize the growing national availability of statistics regarding  suicides to better evaluate the impact of the VCL and potentially  highlight opportunities for outcome improvements.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that evaluating the VCL effectively requires a  focus on the full continuum of mental health services provided by VA  once a veteran first contacts the VCL or establishes a need for mental  health services.   Again, it is important to note that, under this legislation, the  privacy of the caller is to be honored, and the VCL is directed to  continue collecting data points in exactly the same manner as they  currently are.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this great bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Banks), who is the main sponsor of this particular bill, a  great bill that has saved lives.   I also appreciate Representative Walz for sponsoring the bill. I  remember when he did it. We came in together.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Coffman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Iowa (Mr. Young).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I support this great bill. And see how we  are doing this? This was set up, the crisis line was set up a few years  ago. We are improving upon that, and hopefully we are going to save  lives.   Again, I appreciate--I am really proud to serve on this committee. I  have served on the committee. We have served on it together. We came in  together, and we made our veterans, our true heroes, a priority.   I appreciate you, sir. You take the politics out of it. Chairman Roe  takes the politics out of it. I like to think I do, too, and all the  members of the committee do, and we put our veterans first. This is a  moral committee, as you said. It is a moral committee.   I hope the children are watching this right now because, you know,  there is a lot of gridlock in Washington, but we work together. They  are not high-profile bills, but they are very important bills to our  heroes. So, again, I am very proud to manage these bills today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
