 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for having this  Special Order on such a crucial time in our history.   You don't have to look hard to see the devastation left behind from  the wokeism movement currently plaguing our beloved country. Our  schools and our universities, our esteemed and feared military, our  government on every level, and our history itself are being  contaminated by those pushing socialism and division under the guise of  being morally woke.                                time  2000    Webster's dictionary defines the word ``woke'' as being ``aware of  and actively attentive to imparted facts and issues, especially issues  of racial and social justice.''   Well, I can tell you with absolute certainty that I am woke to the  following:   First, I am woke to the fact that innocent men, women, and children  across the country are being hurt and killed because of the left's call  to defund the police around this Nation.   I am woke to the fact that Democrats are more than willing to spend  your hard-earned tax dollars on housing and free handouts for illegal  aliens, but cannot be bothered to care for our homeless and our  veterans.   I am woke to the fact that the Critical Race Theory is racist in  itself.   And, lastly, I am woke to the fact that painting America as a racist  nation is wrong on every level and a slap in the face to those of every  color, every ethnicity, and creed who courageously paid the ultimate  sacrifice so Old Glory could wave boldly and freely for years to come.  Now I am hearing calls from the far left and those who are woke to  replace our beloved Old Glory.   Where has common sense gone?   If the left truly wants to discuss social justice, I encourage them  to talk to the countless minority business owners who watch their  life's work be looted and burned in front of their very eyes last year  because of woke ideologies.   Go talk to the engineer who was fired and can't pay his bills now  because President Biden has foolishly blocked the Keystone pipeline. Go  talk to the migrant woman who was assaulted and raped during her trek  to the southern border of the United States because Joe Biden and  Kamala Harris told her to come here and invited her here.   I could go on, but here is the bottom line: If we don't stand firmly  against this movement, America, whose mighty wings have fought to  defeat evil tyrants, communism, and Nazism in order to lift freedom- loving people out of the hands of oppressors all over this world, could  soon be a socialist dictatorship herself and completely unrecognizable  to all who love her and fought for her and died for her. And a world  without a free America is a dark world indeed.
