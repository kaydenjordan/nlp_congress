 Madam Speaker, my, my, my.   The Republican attacks on reproductive freedom never end. The latest  target: our servicewomen in the military. Many of our over 500 military  bases are located in States that now ban or severely restrict abortion.  That is why the Department of Defense established a travel allowance  for servicemembers and dependents who need to go to another State to  access an abortion.   Now, shamelessly, the Republicans are seeking to block that effort.  These military women leave their homes, families, and friends. They  train hard. They have dreams and goals.   We trust them with Black Hawks and Special Ops. We should trust them  with the very personal decision of whether or when to start a family.  They stand for our freedom. It is time for us to stand for theirs.                            ____________________
