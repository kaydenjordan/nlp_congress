 Madam Speaker, over the past few weeks, we have seen the  reports of decommissioned sorting machines, removal of postboxes, and  the cutting back of hours for the U.S. Postal Service employees.   In my district of Sacramento, I have never seen such an outcry, an  outrage amongst my neighbors and constituents.   This is serious business. We are feeling the effects of delayed mail  delivery and seeing the real-life consequences of these operational  changes: Financial documents are late; prescriptions are stuck in  transit; and we worry about our future ballots being counted.   That is why this administration's attacks have alarmed so many  Americans. We recognize it is about more than just getting letters from  A to B. It is about the fabric of our democracy.   The Postmaster General has made his political preferences and  business interests no secret. The U.S. Postal Service should not be  manipulated as a political or business tool.   Hundreds of millions of Americans across this country rely on the  Postal Service for lifesaving medications, Social Security benefits,  paychecks, and mail-in ballots. The Delivering for America Act will  help ensure that those services continue as needed.   This bill takes critical steps to halt the damage being done, while  providing $25 billion to put the Postal Service back on track.   While the Postmaster has recently claimed that he will halt  operational changes until after the election, he has also stated he has  no intention of recommissioning sorting machines and postboxes that  have already been shuttered. The damage has already been done, and it  is unacceptable.   We must pass the Delivering for America Act to provide emergency  funding and put protections in place to support reliable mail delivery  for all Americans.   As I said, this is serious business. The post office is important for  the fabric of America.
