 Madam Chair, I rise for the purpose of engaging in a  colloquy with the chairwoman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on  State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs on the policy  restricting travel and communications of United States Government  personnel to Nagorno-Karabakh. Madam Chair, I want to thank Chairwoman  Lowey for the opportunity to discuss this important issue.   I had proposed an amendment to Rules that would prevent funds from  being used to implement an official ban on U.S. diplomatic efforts with  the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, or the Republic of Artsakh, as it is  commonly referred to by its citizens.   At present, only a handful of highly specialized U.S. officials  connected to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe,  or OSCE, Minsk Group, are allowed to travel to Nagorno-Karabakh or to  engage directly with officials who represent that territory.   Madam Chair, it is far past time that the United States take a more  engaged role in the region to finally end this decades-long conflict.  We must remain committed to strengthening the ceasefire in Nagorno- Karabakh, removing barriers to dialogue, and resolving  [[Page H4559]]  status and security issues that have hindered discussions in the past.   Allowing direct, open dialogue and our diplomats to have a presence  on the ground, as necessary and when safe, is the only way for the  United States to help bring this conflict to a resolution. And,  ultimately, it would go a long way towards producing a long-lasting,  more democratic future for the people of Nagorno-Karabakh.   Madam Chair, I thank Chairwoman Lowey, who has been very supportive  of Armenia and protecting Nagorno-Karabakh for as long as I have known  her. We came to Congress the same year. We traveled to Nagorno- Karabakh. She really is a champion of the region. So I thank her for  the opportunity to discuss the intent of my amendment and look forward  to working with her and her staff to that end.
