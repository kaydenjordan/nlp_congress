 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5615) to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit  a plan to make Federal assistance available to certain urban areas that  previously received Urban Area Security Initiative funding to preserve  homeland security capabilities, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5615         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Security       Capabilities Preservation Act''.       SEC. 2. PRESERVATION OF HOMELAND SECURITY CAPABILITIES.         (a) Plan.--        (1) In general.--Not later than one year after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland       Security, acting through the Administrator of the Federal       Emergency Management Agency, shall submit to the Committee on       Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of       the Senate a plan, informed by the survey information       collected pursuant to subsection (b), to make Federal       assistance available for at least three consecutive fiscal       years to certain urban areas that in the current fiscal year       did not receive grant funding under the Urban Area Security       Initiative under section 2003 of the Homeland Security Act of       2002 (6 U.S.C. 604) and require continued Federal assistance       for the purpose of preserving a homeland security capability       related to preventing, preparing for, protecting against, and       responding to acts of terrorism that had been developed or       otherwise supported through prior grant funding under such       Initiative and allow for such urban areas to transition to       such urban areas costs of preserving such homeland security       capabilities.  [[Page H1308]]         (2) Additional requirement.--The plan required under       paragraph (1) shall also contain a prohibition on an urban       area that in a fiscal year is eligible to receive Federal       assistance described in such paragraph from also receiving       grant funding under the Urban Area Security Initiative under       section 2003 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. In such a       case, such plan shall require such an urban area to promptly       notify the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management       Agency regarding the preference of such urban area to retain       either--        (A) such eligibility for such Federal assistance; or        (B) such receipt of such grant funding.        (b) Survey.--In developing the plan required under       subsection (a), the Administrator of the Federal Emergency       Management Agency, shall, to ascertain the scope of Federal       assistance required, survey urban areas that--        (1) did not receive grant funding under the Urban Area       Security Initiative under section 2003 of the Homeland       Security Act of 2002 in the current fiscal year concerning       homeland security capabilities related to preventing,       preparing for, protecting against, and responding to acts of       terrorism that had been developed or otherwise supported       through funding under such Initiative that are at risk of       being reduced or eliminated without such Federal assistance;        (2) received such funding in the current fiscal year, but       did not receive such funding in at least one fiscal year in       the six fiscal years immediately preceding the current fiscal       year; and        (3) any other urban areas the Secretary determines       appropriate.        (c) Exemption.--The Secretary of Homeland Security may       exempt the Federal Emergency Management Agency from the       requirements of subchapter I of chapter 35 of title 44,       United States Code (commonly referred to as the ``Paperwork       Reduction Act''), for purposes of carrying out subsection (b)       if the Secretary determines that complying with such       requirements would delay the development of the plan required       under subsection (a).        (d) Contents.--The plan required under subsection (a)       shall--        (1) establish eligibility criteria for urban areas to       receive Federal assistance pursuant to such plan to provide       assistance for the purpose described in such subsection;        (2) identify annual funding levels for such Federal       assistance in accordance with the survey required under       subsection (b); and        (3) consider a range of approaches to make such Federal       assistance available to such urban areas, including--        (A) modifications to the Urban Area Security Initiative       under section 2003 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 in a       manner that would not affect the availability of funding to       urban areas under such Initiative;        (B) the establishment of a competitive grant program;        (C) the establishment of a formula grant program; and        (D) a timeline for the implementation of any such approach       and, if necessary, a legislative proposal to authorize any       such approach.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 5615, the  Homeland Security Capabilities Preservation Act.   In the wake of September 11, there was a recognition that cities  across the Nation could be targeted for terrorism and that they did not  have the resources to develop core capabilities to prevent, protect  against, and respond to terrorist attacks and other catastrophic events  on their own.   Starting in 2003, cities across the Nation began receiving dedicated  counterterrorism grant funding from the Department of Homeland  Security's Urban Area Security Initiative grant program.   The UASI program, as it has come to be known, provides first  responders with the tools, resources, and training they need to safely  and effectively protect their communities.   At its height, the UASI program funded approximately 60 cities.   In recent years, however, the number of cities receiving funding from  the program has been reduced to, on average, 30 each year.   While support to cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago has  remained constant, year-to-year fluctuations in grant funding levels  and changes in DHS' risk formula have resulted in some cities losing  funding unexpectedly.   As a result, cities like Orlando, Las Vegas, and Omaha face  uncertainty year after year about whether they will receive UASI  funding or will be forced to try and maintain core homeland security  capabilities on their own.   The sudden loss of Federal support places great strain on cities that  often lack the resources to cover such unexpected costs.   My bill, the Homeland Security Capabilities Preservation Act, which  is cosponsored by my friend from Nebraska (Mr. Bacon) recognizes the  importance of preserving capabilities achieved with Federal grant  dollars, particularly given how dynamic the terrorism threat landscape  is today.   It directs DHS to develop a plan for how to support the transition of  costs associated with maintaining homeland security core capabilities  achieved through UASI investments.   Specifically, my bill would direct DHS, acting through FEMA, to  survey current and former UASI cities regarding their capabilities that  were achieved through UASI grant funding that are at risk of being  reduced or eliminated without Federal assistance.   Additionally, the bill would require DHS, if needed, to submit a plan  on how to make Federal assistance available to former UASI  jurisdictions to take on the costs of preserving UASI-funded homeland  security capabilities, including legislation.   This plan is the first step to ensure that all cities have the  capabilities they need to secure themselves from terrorist threats.   Madam Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, I am  prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 5615 is the first step in ensuring that cities  that fall on and off the UASI list will have the opportunity to  preserve their capabilities that were built out with the funding  provided by the program.   Enacting H.R. 5615 is timelier now more than ever, particularly given  how dynamic the terrorist threat landscape is today.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5615, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  [[Page H1309]]  bill (H.R. 5616) to require reporting regarding accreditation of basic  training programs of the Department of Homeland Security, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5616         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Basic Training       Accreditation Improvement Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. REPORTING ON BASIC TRAINING PROGRAMS OF THE                     DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY.         (a) Annual Reporting.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the       Secretary of Homeland Security shall report to the relevant       congressional committees on the accreditation status for each       basic training program within the Department of Homeland       Security, including information relating to the following:        (A) The date on which each such program achieved initial       accreditation, or in the case of a program that is not       currently accredited, the reasons for not obtaining or       maintaining accreditation, the activities, if any, taken to       achieve accreditation, and an anticipated timeline for       accreditation of such program.        (B) The date each such program most recently received       accreditation or reaccreditation, if applicable.        (C) Each such program's anticipated accreditation or next       reaccreditation date.        (D) The name of the accreditation manager for each such       program.        (2) Termination of reporting requirement.--Annual reports       under paragraph (1) shall terminate when all basic training       programs of the Department of Homeland Security are       accredited.        (b) Lapse in Accreditation.--        (1) In general.--If a basic training program of the       Department of Homeland Security loses accreditation, the head       of the relevant component of the Department shall notify the       Secretary of Homeland Security not later than 30 days after       such loss.        (2) Notice to congress.--Not later than 30 days after       receiving a notification pursuant to paragraph (1), the       Secretary of Homeland Security shall notify the relevant       congressional committees of the lapse in accreditation at       issue, the reason for such lapse, and the activities underway       and planned to regain accreditation.        (c) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Accreditation.--The term ``accreditation'' means the       recognition by a board that a basic training program is       administered, developed, and delivered according to an       applicable set of standards.        (2) Accreditation manager.--The term ``accreditation       manager'' means the individual assigned by the component of       the Department of Homeland Security to manage accreditation       activities for a basic training program.        (3) Basic training program.--The term ``basic training       program'' means an entry level program of the Department of       Homeland Security that is transitional to law enforcement       service, provides training on critical competencies and       responsibilities, and is typically a requirement for       appointment to a law enforcement service job or job series.        (4) Reaccreditation.--The term ``reaccreditation'' means       the assessment of a basic training program after initial       accreditation to ensure the continued compliance with an       applicable set of standards.        (5) Relevant congressional committees.--The term ``relevant       congressional committees'' means the Committee on Homeland       Security and the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs and the Committee of the Judiciary of       the Senate.       SEC. 3. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.         The Under Secretary for Science and Technology of the       Department of Homeland Security shall carry out research and       development of systems and technologies to enhance access to       training offered by the Federal Law Enforcement Training       Centers to State, local, Tribal, and territorial law       enforcement, with particular attention to law enforcement in       rural and remote communities, for the purpose of enhancing       domestic preparedness for and collective response to       terrorism and other homeland security threats.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, today, I rise to urge my colleagues to support H.R.  5616, the DHS Basic Training Accreditation Improvement Act of 2021.   Every year, DHS onboards thousands of new officers who all must  successfully complete basic law enforcement training programs.   As a former police chief with 27 years of law enforcement service, I  have seen how training saves lives.   Unfortunately, at DHS, several of the basic training programs  tailored to component officers are not accredited.   In some cases, programs have been unaccredited for several years.   Unaccredited programs include: the U.S. Border Patrol Academy, the  Customs and Border Protections' Field Operations Academy Officer Basic  Training program, and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services'  Officer Basic Training program.   In 2019, the head of the Department's Federal Law Enforcement  Training Centers testified before the Homeland Security Committee that  accreditation is important because it ``assigns rigor to training  processes'' and ``results in the best product.''   H.R. 5616 seeks to improve the quality of the training provided to  all new DHS officers.   It does this by requiring the Department to report to Congress on the  accreditation status of each of its basic training programs.   For those programs that are not accredited, it requires DHS to  report: the reasons for not obtaining or maintaining accreditation; the  activities, if any, taken to achieve accreditation; and the anticipated  timeline for accreditation of the program.   Further, H.R. 5616 requires DHS to continue to report to Congress  annually until all DHS basic training programs are accredited.   H.R. 5616 also directs DHS to engage in research to help State,  local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement officers better access  the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center training opportunities,  including those that enhance national preparedness and response to  terrorism.   I introduced this bill in October to direct DHS to prioritize  improving its basic training programs to maintain a higher standard of  excellence for new officers and position them to effectively safeguard  the American people, our homeland, and institutions.   Madam Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, February 7, 2022.       Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,       Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.         Dear Chairman Thompson: This letter is to advise you that       the Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 5616, the ``DHS Basic Training       Accreditation Improvement Act of 2021,'' that fall within our       Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us on       those provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection to       your including them in the bill for consideration on the       House floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to       forgo action on H.R. 5616, with the understanding that we do       not thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.         In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.         Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.             Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,       Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                   Washington, DC, February 7, 2022.       Hon. Jerrold Nadler,       Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.         Dear Chairman Nadler: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 5616, the ``DHS Basic Training Accreditation Improvement       Act of 2021.'' I recognize that the Committee on the       Judiciary has a jurisdictional interest in H.R. 5616, and I       appreciate your effort to allow this bill to be considered on       the House floor.         I concur with you that forgoing action on the bill does       not in any way prejudice the Committee on the Judiciary with       respect to  [[Page H1310]]       its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or similar       legislation in the future, and I would support your effort to       seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any       House--Senate conference involving this legislation.         I will include our letters on H.R. 5616 in the Committee       report on this measure and in the Congressional Record during       floor consideration of this bill. I look forward to working       with you on this legislation and other matters of great       importance to this Nation.             Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,                          Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security.     Madam Speaker, I have no more speakers, I am prepared  to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, our top priority, as Members of Congress, is  protecting the safety and security of the American people.   We have no room for error when it comes to keeping Americans safe.   H.R. 5616 prioritizes the quality of training DHS offers its newest  officers and ensures that State, local, and Tribal law enforcement  entities have better access to trainings that will make American  communities safer.   I thank my colleagues on the Homeland Security Committee for  unanimously supporting H.R. 5616.   Madam Speaker, I urge the rest of my colleagues to support H.R. 5616,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5681) to authorize the reclassification of the tactical  enforcement officers (commonly known as the ``Shadow Wolves'') in the  Homeland Security Investigations tactical patrol unit operating on the  lands of the Tohono O'odham Nation as special agents, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5681         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Shadow Wolves Enhancement       Act''.       SEC. 2. RECLASSIFICATION OF SHADOW WOLVES AS GS-1811 SPECIAL                     AGENTS.         The Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is       authorized--        (1) to reclassify the GS-1801 tactical enforcement officers       (commonly known as ``Shadow Wolves'') assigned to the       Homeland Security Investigations tactical patrol unit       operating on the lands of the Tohono O'odham Nation, as of       the date of the enactment of this Act, as GS-1811 special       agents, upon the successful completion of--        (A) the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center's Criminal       Investigator Training Program; and        (B)(i) Customs Basic Enforcement School, if the officer was       hired before March 2003; or        (ii) U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland       Security Investigations Special Agent Training, if the       officer was hired during or after March 2003;        (2) to classify any Shadow Wolves who are assigned to the       unit referred to in paragraph (1) after such date of       enactment as GS-1811 special agents upon the successful       completion of the training described in paragraph (1); and        (3) to classify as GS-1811 special agents upon the       successful completion of the training described in paragraph       (1) any Shadow Wolves who are hired as part of a comparable       unit (regardless of location) established after such date of       enactment with the approval and consent of the appropriate       Indian tribe.       SEC. 3. EXPANSION OF SHADOW WOLVES PROGRAM.         Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to       the Comptroller General of the United States, the Committee       on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate,       and the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives a strategy for--        (1) retaining existing Shadow Wolves;        (2) recruiting new Shadow Wolves; and        (3) expanding comparable units referred to in section 2(3)       to appropriate areas near the international border between       the United States and Canada or the international border       between the United States and Mexico, with the approval and       consent of the appropriate Indian tribe.       SEC. 4. GAO REPORT.         Not later than 1 year after receiving the strategy required       under section 3 and annually thereafter for the following two       years, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       submit to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental       Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Homeland Security       of the House of Representatives--        (1) an assessment of the effectiveness of such strategy;       and        (2) any recommendations for improvements to the strategy       that the Comptroller General determines to be appropriate.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5681, the Shadow  Wolves Enhancement Act.   This bipartisan legislation, sponsored by the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Katko), the ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee,  seeks to resolve limitations to career advancement and pay equity for  Native American officers, a part of the Shadow Wolves program.   Shadow Wolves are officers that form ICE Homeland Security  Investigations' tactical patrol unit. These officers operate in the  Tohono O'odham Nation, located in southern Arizona, and track human and  drug smugglers along Tribal lands.   Since 1974, the Tohono O'odham Nation has allowed Shadow Wolves to  patrol its lands to stem the flow of illicit activity within the  region. This elite unit leverages both technology and the traditional  art of tracking to detect footprints, tire tracks, and clothing  associated with smuggling operations.   Over the last few years, Shadow Wolves have increasingly expanded  their operation beyond tracking to investigative work and support  response.   Under current law, Shadow Wolves can only be hired as tactical  officers in a lower pay grade, although most of the officers have  completed special agent training.   H.R. 5681 reclassifies Shadow Wolves as special agents upon  successfully completing the law enforcement training requirements. H.R.  5681 also directs DHS to establish a strategy for preserving the Shadow  Wolves and expanding comparable units with the consent of relevant  Native American Tribes.  [[Page H1311]]    By passing this bipartisan bill today, this body is prioritizing the  development of a diverse and equitable Federal workforce. I urge my  colleagues to join with the Tohono O'odham Nation and the Shadow Wolves  officers and support H.R. 5681. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   H.R. 5681 is about enhancing equity and career opportunities for  Native American officers that currently serve as Shadow Wolves in  Sells, Arizona.   These officers are currently limited in pay and opportunity by their  classification, despite having the appropriate training for  advancement. This legislation addresses that problem.  [[Page H1312]]    For this reason, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5681, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 658) to authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to work  with cybersecurity consortia for training, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 658         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, now more than ever it is critical that State and local  governments, along with the private sector, prioritize their  cybersecurity preparedness. The threat of cyberattacks continues to  grow, and with the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, we are reminded  yet again of the importance of stronger cybersecurity.   Since 2004, DHS has partnered with the National Cybersecurity  Preparedness Consortium, a group of universities that conduct research  and training to help entities better prepare for cyber risks. This  legislation will authorize the consortium to help strengthen our  Nation's cybersecurity preparedness.   More specifically, S. 658 authorizes DHS to partner with a consortium  of nonprofit entities to provide training to first responders, develop  curriculums for training programs, conduct cross-sector exercises to  defend and respond to cyber threats, and help incorporate cyber risk  into State and local emergency plans.   Last year, Congress provided $1 billion in new grants to State and  local governments to strengthen their cybersecurity. Ensuring they have  access to advice and support to develop their cybersecurity  preparedness plans is an additional step we can take to enhance our  Nation's cybersecurity.   Additionally, Chairman Thompson offered an amendment during the  committee markup that strengthened the bill by ensuring that DHS can  partner with more than one consortium; adding the inclusion of HBCUs,  MSIs, and community colleges as a factor in the selection of a  consortium; and promoting greater geographic diversity among  participating institutions.  [[Page H1313]]    All communities across the Nation need to prioritize cybersecurity  preparedness. These changes should ensure that DHS partners with a  diverse range of institutions to better assist the many different types  of State and local governments that would benefit from enhanced  cybersecurity preparedness.   I thank Senators Cornyn and Leahy for their leadership in authorizing  this legislation and for working with the Homeland Security Committee  to make improvements to this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, the best time to prioritize cybersecurity is before  you experience a cyber incident. Cybersecurity preparedness is  essential, yet most State and local governments do not have the  experience, expertise, or resources to do it alone. They need a Federal  partner.   Enactment of S. 658 delivers on that partnership through a network of  consortiums across the country.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 658, as amended,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
