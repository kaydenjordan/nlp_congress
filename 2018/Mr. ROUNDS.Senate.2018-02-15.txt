 Mr. President, while I enjoy the humor that my colleague  from Arkansas has expressed, this is an important bill. What we have  done is what the President has asked for.   No. 1, this provides $25 billion for a border security system.   No. 2, it addresses the issue of DACA. It takes care of 1.8 million  young people who want to be citizens of the United States 10 to 12  years from now. It does not provide a citizenship opportunity for their  parents.   I yield at this time to my colleague, the Senator from Maine.    Mr. President, I, too, would like to echo the comments by  Senator Collins and Senator King on the intent of the provision and our  commitment to move this date back to the beginning of the year. This  provision is needed to ensure that we are providing a deterrent.  Individuals who come to the U.S. after a particular date must know that  we are going to focus resources on their deportation just like we will  focus on felons and other criminals and those who pose a threat to our  Nation's security or public safety.
