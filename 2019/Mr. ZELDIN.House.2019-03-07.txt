 Mr. Speaker, let's all be honest with each other. We are  here today, right now, because of anti-Semitic rhetoric from one Member  of this Chamber said again and again and again. We would not be on this  floor right now otherwise to discuss this topic.   If that Member were a Republican, that Member's name would be in this  resolution, and this resolution would be all about condemning anti- Semitism, and it would be done so forcefully.   That Member in January had to apologize for talking about a hypnosis  of Israel that they had over the entire world. That Member had to  apologize in February for saying: If you support Israel, it must be  because you are bought off by Jews. That Member called it an  unequivocal apology even though she filled it with equivocation.   Now we are back again this time by the Member saying that, if you  support the U.S.-Israel relationship, that you must have pledged  allegiance to a foreign government--except this time that Member is  refusing to apologize.   Even if you gave that Member every benefit of the doubt that she had  no idea what she was doing, why now wouldn't she be apologizing? Why  would she be more emboldened to refuse an apology altogether?   I, apparently, am giving Representative Omar more credit than the  Speaker is because I don't believe she is naive. I believe that she  knows exactly what she is doing.   It is an American value, by the way, to have reasonable, legitimate  criticism of a government, whether it be the U.S. Government, Israel,  or any other government. It is not an American value, though, to be  hurling anti-Semitic rhetoric.   Anti-Semitism must be condemned, unequivocally and emphatically.   We have Members of this Chamber who associate with Louis Farrakhan,  who says: ``Hitler was a very great man.'' Let's talk about a double  standard.   In January, we all came to this Chamber. We condemned white  supremacy. We named a Republican Member. We kicked that Member off of  his committees; he can't serve on the Small Business Committee. But  this Member will continue to serve on the House Foreign Affairs  Committee.  [[Page H2550]]    But, no, now we can't come here and just emphatically, solely,  forcefully condemn anti-Semitism and name names. But if it was a  Republican, we would.   It is time to call out these statements for what they are: pointed,  bigoted, unreasonable, illegitimate, anti-Semitic.    I commend my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have been  speaking out about all this anti-Semitism. A few Members come to mind:  Chairman Engel, Congressman Deutch, Congressman Nadler, Congresswoman  Lowey, Congressman Gottheimer.   Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I believe, to  their core know how very wrong this is.   There are many other Members to name as well, and I would be remiss  if I didn't take this opportunity to say thank you to each and every  one of them, because support of Israel, support of Jews, standing  against anti-Semitism has been bipartisan in the past. It should be  bipartisan today, and it should be bipartisan for every moment in the  future.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I rise today alongside Mr. Rose, Mrs.  Maloney, Mr. Nadler, Mr. King of New York, and others, to urge the  immediate passage of the Never Forget the Heroes Act, introduced by  Representatives Carolyn Maloney, Nadler, and King, which would fully  fund and extend the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund authorization through  2090.   Representatives Maloney, Nadler, and Peter King have been stalwart  advocates of this effort fighting on behalf of 9/11 victims and their  families since the beginning, and it is thanks to their leadership that  we passed the Zadroga Act, creating the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund  and why we are still here fighting today.   I can't thank enough and praise enough the leadership of  Representatives Maloney, Nadler, and King on this very important issue  on behalf of the victims of September 11.   James Zadroga was one of those fearless leaders who rose up on 9/11.  He was also the first NYPD officer whose death in 2006 was connected to  toxic exposure at the World Trade Center site. The James Zadroga 9/11  Health and Compensation Act was later signed into law in 2011 to help  our 9/11 first responders.   Madam Speaker, 5 years later, the Zadroga Act was permanently  reauthorized and included $4.6 billion for the 9/11 Victim Compensation  Fund over 5 years, which was established to provide compensation for  the victims of 9/11 and their families, and it continues to provide  compensation for those suffering from 9/11-related illnesses decades  later and their loved ones.   First responders who worked on the pile day and night aiding in the  search, rescue, and cleanup efforts were breathing toxic debris and ash  that are now known to have caused over 50 different types of cancer.  However, last month, the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund issued an  alarming report, which stated its funding was insufficient to  compensate all claims, and the fund would have to make severe cuts to  awards across the board.   This is unacceptable. And regardless of party affiliation, regardless  of which district or State you come from, it is imperative that this  legislation is passed and sent to the President immediately to become  law so we can ensure these victims receive the compensation they  deserve.   This isn't a one-off issue. This isn't just a New York issue. This  isn't a Democratic or Republican Party platform or political football.  This is a responsibility we all shoulder as Americans, first and  foremost. It is the spirit of our Nation, and it is who we are as a  people.   It is important to remember that 9/11 first responders live not only  in New York, but in 433 out of 435 congressional districts across this  country.   These were the very men and women who, in the face of evil, were  willing to put it all on the line to help save their fellow Americans,  who ran into the towers as everyone else ran out. It is unconscionable  that time and again they have been forced to plead their case as to why  they are worthy of our support.   People who came down when the Zadroga Act was first getting  authorized--sick--weren't there to fight in 2015 when it was  permanently reauthorized because they had passed away due to their  injuries.   People who were here in 2015 when that fight was made for the Zadroga  Act to be permanently reauthorized are not here today to fight for the  Victim Compensation Fund because they passed away and succumbed to  their injuries.   We should not make them take dozens of trips down here to Washington,  D.C., begging for support. Let them stay where they are and take care  of their health. That is most important.   It is so important that we immediately passed the Never Forget the  Heroes Act, which will ensure these heroes receive the support they  have more than earned.   This past September 11, 17 years since the attacks, we came together,  as we always do, to remember those who were taken from us that day. But  this year marked an especially harrowing occasion. By the end of 2018,  more people had died from 9/11-related illnesses than were killed on  September 11.   Tonight, we are going to hear from the authors of the Never Forget  the Heroes Act, Representatives Carolyn Maloney, Peter King, and Jerry  Nadler, and so many others from both sides of the aisle, on why this  legislation is important for the victims of 9/11, for their  communities, and for our Nation.   In addition to those who are joining us this evening, there are also  so many activists and outside organizations fighting on behalf of 9/11  victims and working to ensure they receive full compensation: Jon  Stewart, who has traveled to Washington countless times to fight for  them and was just here last week; John Feal, from my district, and the  FealGood Foundation; and so many more, including the great advocates  from organized labor, especially law enforcement and first responders  in New York and nationwide.   From everyday men and women in my district to us on the floor of the  House of Representatives, it is up to each and every one of us to never  forget the men and women whom we lost that day, those whom we have lost  since, those suffering from 9/11-related illnesses, and their families.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn  B. Maloney), a fellow New Yorker who has been a stalwart champion of  this legislation going all the way back to the passage of the Zadroga  Act.   I know our 9/11 first responders, their families, those suffering  from 9/11-related illnesses, and all those affected by this dark moment  in our Nation's history are so grateful to Mrs. Maloney for her  tireless work on behalf of them.    Mrs. Maloney really inspires us all. And when she said  that these 9/11 victims, their families are counting on us, they  certainly know that they can count on her.   So I thank Congresswoman Maloney for leading this effort for so many  years. She has been a great champion in this cause, and it is great to  assist her however I can. That is why Congressman Rose and I wanted to  be here coleading this Special Order on a bipartisan basis to support  Congresswoman Maloney, Congressman Nadler, and Congressman King, who  have been the champions of this effort.                                time  2000     Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments.   Madam Speaker, next, I am going to yield to my friend from New Jersey  (Josh Gottheimer), who is really a leader in so many different forms.  He co-chairs the Problem Solvers Caucus. If I had to make a pitch for  the bill that should be at the top of the list for every caucus--there  are many caucuses here in this Chamber--this should be an important  priority, if not number one on the list, but I would put a pitch in for  number one. He is a great Member, and I have a lot of respect for him.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Gottheimer).    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Gottheimer for his  words and his leadership with what is a bipartisan caucus here in the  House of Representatives where people from all across the entire  country come together. As the name of the caucus says, you just want to  solve problems. You want to make your time here in Congress worthwhile.  You want to be able to go back to the voters 2 years later and say this  is what I did during my term, and have something positive, productive,  and constructive to show for it.    The fact that the gentleman dedicates so much of his energy toward  solving problems, building bridges, and bipartisanship is to be  commended. I thank the gentleman for who he is, and for his efforts  here on the floor tonight.    Madam Speaker, next, I get to introduce an amazing  colleague who was here in the Chamber, a Member of Congress, during the  attacks on September 11. He was here in the days afterward, the years  when the Zadroga Act was still getting passed and reauthorized, and  here now during this fight for the September 11th Victim Compensation  Fund.   He has been there every single step of the way since day one, and he  is really an amazing Member of Congress and leader, really on the  global stage. I just got back from the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, and  he is leaving his mark on human trafficking and other issues around the  globe.   At this time, on this really important issue tonight, I yield to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith).    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Smith for his words  tonight and pointing out that special master's report that just came  out, which really stresses the urgency to get this done immediately.  That is tough and unacceptable news for all those victims to read that  report, and for the advocates, so I thank the gentleman for his  leadership.   Congressman Smith from New Jersey is fighting hard on behalf of his  constituents on this issue and for all 9/11 families.   Tonight's Special Order, I just asked Kevin from my team here to  see--it  [[Page H2575]]  might be a fun fact as to when was the last time that there was a  bipartisan Special Order in the Chamber. I don't know, is this even a  first?    I am leading tonight's event with Congressman Max Rose of Staten  Island, who is our next speaker. Congressman Rose is a freshman who was  elected to represent a great congressional district in New York. I  represent the greatest congressional district in New York.   Staten Island, I know, is a pretty special place as well, and  Congressman Max Rose is a military veteran. I have a tremendous amount  of respect for him, for his military service.   Right after World War II, almost 100 percent of the House was made up  of military veterans. Right after Vietnam, it was a little over 75  percent. I think it was about 77 percent right after Vietnam. Now the  number is less than 1 in 5. We have to get that number up. Republicans,  Democrats, conservatives, liberals, anywhere you are in the 50 States,  it is good to have more vets here in Congress. I thank the gentleman  for running, for serving, and for co-leading tonight's Special Order.   The gentleman contacted me as soon as he was elected after the  November election to talk about different ways that we can work  together, and it is great that our bipartisan Special Order here  tonight is for this particular cause. It is an honor to lead tonight  with him.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rose), the  freshman Congressman from Staten Island.    I didn't realize Congressman Rose is a Purple Heart too.    I  didn't realize Congressman ROSE is a Purple Heart too. Mr. ROSE of  New York. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time for that one.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his service in  the military and for his new service he just started here in the House.  I had to throw in the Army, too, knowing that we do have another  speaker here who is a Navy helicopter pilot, if I understand correctly.  We have got a couple of Army folks in the House. I thank the gentleman  for his service to our country going back many years, even though he  just started here in the House 2 years ago.    Madam Speaker, our next speaker tonight also had a  distinguished career serving in government before joining Congress. He  rose up the ranks at the FBI. He is a very well-respected member of the  FBI who believes in law enforcement and the rule of law. He also loves  our military so much that over the course of years, every single year  for Christmas we have been able to travel to Iraq or Afghanistan, going  to the Middle East, to visit the troops as we did this past Christmas,  all over Kuwait on Christmas Day.   The FBI was impacted greatly on 9/11. They went into the towers as well while many people were running  out. So I thank Brian, not only for his service with the FBI, but for  his continued fight for all of those first responders, as we should  remember those FDNY and the NYPD who went in to the towers. There were  many other types of law enforcement who ran in as well, including many  FBI agents.   On behalf of all those FBI agents, I thank the gentleman for  continuing the fight. It is great to have another State Representative  from Pennsylvania.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Fitzpatrick).    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Fitzpatrick for  setting his goals with cosponsorship not just high but also  appropriately. Every Member of this Chamber should be cosponsoring this  bill so, hopefully, we will get those numbers up a lot, but much credit  to Congresswoman Maloney, to Congressman Nadler, and to Congressman  King, for the advocates from the outside, especially across the New  York City metropolitan area, we are already starting strong with 150  cosponsors.   The next speaker is a United States Naval Academy graduate. She was a  helicopter pilot. She is a new Representative from New Jersey's 11th  District, and she is hitting the ground running with important  leadership on this issue fighting for her constituents. There is a  story to be told to Members of Congress who maybe weren't here in 2015  or even 5 years before that when Congressman Nadler, whom we will be  hearing from next, was getting the Zadroga Act first passed, a lot of  Members were new in 2015 when we were permanently reauthorizing the  Zadroga Act. Now, if you look back to 2015, we have a lot of new  Members who weren't here in 2015. The education, as we talk to people  who live far away from where we live in New York and New Jersey, they  might not even know what the Zadroga Act is. They might not know what  the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund is. That is why it is great to see  Congressman Rose and Congresswoman Sherrill leading the fight to  educate their fellow freshman and others to make sure that they  cosponsor this effort.    I thank the gentlewoman for her service. I kind of apologize for my  Go Army joke before. I won't mention the three-game winning streak that  Max and I have going. Hopefully that didn't bring the gentlewoman down  too much before we hear her great remarks tonight.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Ms.  Sherrill).    Madam Speaker, I will get back to the gentlewoman in  December on that one. We will see if we keep the winning streak going.   I thank the gentlewoman again for her service, for her remarks  tonight, and for running for office. I look forward to working with the  gentlewoman on this.   The next speaker certainly needs no introduction. He is last but  certainly not least, someone who has been a rock solid presence, a  voice, a leader, a fierce advocate for all 9/11 victims and their  families, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, and someone  who is not just one of the main three who have been leading this effort  with Congresswoman Maloney and Congressman King, but really right back  to the very beginning, since September 11, 2001, so personally on  behalf  [[Page H2577]]  of my constituents back home on the east end of Long Island, for all 9/ 11 victims, their families, thank you to Chairman Nadler for his  leadership.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler),  who is the chair of the House Judiciary Committee.                                time  2030     Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler for his remarks  tonight and for his leadership through the years. It is a very  important voice from New York City, from Ground Zero, and something  that couldn't have possibly impacted the heart of his district any more  than what was the largest attack on our soil on September 11, 2001.   Yet the silver lining of that attack was seeing the spirit, the  fight, the grit of his constituents, of my constituents, of  constituents from 433 out of 435 districts in our entire country who  responded after September 11, 2001.   A lot of Members of this Chamber don't realize that 9/11 first  responders came from almost every single congressional district  represented here.  [[Page H2578]]    But it was all throughout Chairman Nadler's district on September 11,  2001, that we saw people going into danger while everyone else was  running out, and it reminded us of the strength of New Yorkers, the  pride and strength and courage of Americans.   There has certainly been great sacrifice since but, most importantly,  sacrifice from those who have been victims because of September 11,  2001, either due to the attack that day or service in our military.   As we are here tonight, there are 9/11 first responders who are very  sick, and I just want to, right before we close, share one quick story.   This is a constituent of mine from East Hampton. This is a single  mother, a sole provider of her 12-year-old son, who lived and worked  within blocks of the World Trade Center on 9/11 and during the  aftermath.   She said: ``My colleagues and I saw it as our patriotic duty to show  the terrorists that they could not destroy our neighborhood and way of  life.''   I think, many times, people forget that, in the aftermath of 9/11, we  were not only tending to Ground Zero, but we were rebuilding the spirit  of our Nation.   It is thanks to Americans like this constituent of mine and her  coworkers and all those who faced the unconscionable horror, who did  not cower in fear, that our Nation rose stronger than ever.   In late 2017, she was diagnosed with stage III ovarian cancer, which  has never occurred on either side of her family.   Her coworker at the time of 9/11 developed prostate cancer, and three  of her coworkers now have an extremely rare skin condition.   In response to learning that the fund is running out of money and  would cut claims by 70 percent, she said: ``I don't think I can  properly express in writing how devastated I feel. Even worse, I feel  extremely distraught over the others who are in the same situation as  me or who are about to find they are . . . as they will, too, receive a  devastating diagnosis like mine.''   The one other story is Kevin from Smithtown. I represent a district  that is just over 50 miles from Ground Zero, and fighting for my  constituents who were affected by September 11 is my job, but it is  also very personal.   Kevin is a former NYPD officer who said he ``picked up human remains  for 2 days, without any hesitation, because at the time that is what  had to be done.''   He continued to work on and around the pile for close to 12 months.   In January of 2018, Kevin was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's diffuse  large B-cell lymphoma and underwent 6 months of chemotherapy, which  left him with devastating symptoms that will stay with him the rest of  his life.   He wrote to me about how he missed many important moments and family  functions with his children and loved ones. He said: ``To give out  awards reduced by 70 percent is a slap in my face and all others that  are now suffering,'' and he is right.   When he was working the pile day and night for months on end, he  wasn't thinking about himself or what this might mean for his future.  He was thinking about our Nation. He was committed to getting the  remains of victims of 9/11 home to those who survived them.   Kevin was there for us, and it is important for all of us to step up  to the plate for him.   Lastly, I thank Congresswoman Maloney, Congressman King, and Chairman  Nadler for taking the lead on this legislation yet again. I thank  Congressman Rose for coleading tonight's Special Order. Hopefully, it  is the start of something new and that we will see more often:  bipartisan Special Orders on the floor of the House of Representatives.   I think our constituents back home all across America want to see  more of us working together to get good things done. It makes them feel  good that their government is working for them.   But I will tell you, with regards to the 9/11 Victim Compensation  Fund, it is not until this Chamber, the Senate, and the President signs  it that this is done, fully funded, that we are going to be able to  take credit for anything good and right, because this needs to actually  get over the finish line.    Tonight is just another positive step. Everyone signing on as  cosponsors is a positive step. And I hope that everyone who is  watching, whether you are a Member of this Chamber, you are a staffer  of a Member of this Chamber, or you are an advocate, that you get  involved, cosponsor, to get our numbers up.   I thank Madam Speaker for her leadership tonight with this effort,  for presiding over the Chamber during this very important hour, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
