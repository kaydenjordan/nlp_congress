 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize the  accomplishments of Mr. Brian Johnson of Aurora, Colorado, founder of  the nonprofit organization, WarriorNOW. Brian is an Army veteran who  served in Iraq and personally grappled with suicide after leaving the  service.   He founded the nonprofit organization, WarriorNOW, to help veterans  get through the same struggles that he faced after coming home. His  approach to combating veteran suicide is to connect at-risk veterans  with peer mentors. Brian has developed a mentor certification program  to ensure that every veteran receives quality mentorship and to ensure  that the mentors are supported as well.   In the wake of COVID-19, Brian saw how the pandemic led to worsening  PTSD anxiety, depression, and substance abuse throughout the entire  veteran community. As a result, he created Daniel's Room, a virtual  nightly check-in that began with Daniel, a veteran who Brian was  working with who was struggling with substance abuse.   Thus far, WarriorNOW has served over 800 veterans in Daniel's Room.   I would like to thank Brian Johnson and his organization, WarriorNOW,  for  [[Page H6909]]  their tireless support of Colorado's veterans.                      Honoring the Life of Mikaela Lakin     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mikaela Lakin, an  Aurora Police Department officer who lost her life in an off-duty  motorcycle accident on September 18, 2020.   Mikaela was a dedicated officer with the Aurora Police Department  when she died at the age of 24. A proud Coloradan, Mikaela loved all  the outdoor activities our State has to offer, including camping,  hiking, and snowboarding.   She will be deeply missed by her mother, Stephanie Renken; her  brother, Alexander Lakin; her father, Michael Lakin; her grandparents,  Connie and Steve Ostroha; and her beloved dog, Quentin.   She impacted the lives of so many with her outgoing and welcoming  spirit and positive outlook. Officer Lakin should be remembered for her  commitment to those in need and for the unwavering support she provided  to her friends, family, and community.   May she rest in peace.                           Honoring Natural Helpers     Mr. Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize the  accomplishments of the Aurora Natural Helpers program and its steadfast  commitment to the community.   Aurora is an increasingly international and diverse city in  Colorado's Sixth District. With the creation of the Office of  International and Immigrant Affairs and the launching of the second  phase of their Immigrant Integration Plan, Aurora is quickly becoming a  national leader in the field of immigrant integration.   Launched by the city of Aurora in collaboration with local nonprofits  in 2016, the Aurora Natural Helpers program trains leaders from  immigrant refugee communities so they can help integrate their  community members.   Trained Natural Helpers are equipped to provide information and  resources to newly arriving immigrants and refugees on topics including  city services and private assistance.   With the support of local partner organizations, more than 150 people  from 25 countries have been trained, and crucial immigrant and refugee  leadership has been fostered and empowered.   I would like to thank all of those involved in the Aurora Natural  Helpers program for their dedication to our community. Their hard work  connecting communities in Aurora to crucial resources not only ensures  that immigrants and refugees in the Sixth District have the opportunity  to thrive but that their leadership also comes from within.                                time  1015                   Recognizing Tri-County Health Department     Mr. Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize the Tri- County Health Department as a recipient of the National Association of  County and City Health Officials 2020 Model Practice Award. The Tri- County Health Department serves the three counties in my district:  Adams, Arapahoe, and Douglas.   As we work to address the COVID-19 crisis, this recognition is a  reminder of the many ongoing public health initiatives led by our city  and county health departments, achievements they make despite  challenging and adverse conditions. This award recognizes programs  demonstrating excellence in response to a critical local public health  need.   As part of this year's public health award series, Tri-County Health  Department received one Model Practice Award and two Promising Practice  Awards. The Model Practice Award was awarded to Tri-County's project on  partnering with local businesses on workplace health and well-being.   I would like to thank the professionals of Tri-County Health  Department for their many contributions to public health. Both before  and during the pandemic, their programs and services have been  instrumental in protecting the public health and well-being of our  community.                            ____________________
