 Mr. Speaker, I rise as a cosponsor of the bipartisan H.  Res. 11.   In 2002, during the Second Intifada, after the massacre in Hebron, I  had the great, good fortune of meeting in Jerusalem with Shimon Peres,  of blessed memory. He explained why a two-state solution is the only  path to peace, and I will never abandon his dream of a two-state  solution.   U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334, however, pushes the hope of a  two-state solution farther away for three reasons:   One, it discourages direct negotiations between Israel and the  Palestinians.   Two, it fails to distinguish between ``long accepted'' and ``more  controversial'' settlements. ``Long accepted'' settlements, such as the  long established Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem, in the Jewish  Quarter, places like the Western Wall, and the ``consensus''  settlements versus ``more controversial'' hilltop settlements in the  West Bank, such as Amona, settlements that even the Israeli Supreme  Court has declared illegal.   Three, it fails to explicitly condemn the number one impediment to a  two-state solution: anti-Israel terrorism.    Mr. Chair, had I been present, I would have voted ``nay''  on rollcall No. 12.                   Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Grijalva
