 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand against anti-Semitism.   I stand before you as a Republican Member of Congress to address the  issue that transcends party lines and touches the very core of who we  are as Americans.   Anti-Semitism is a pernicious form of hatred that has persisted for  far too long in our world. It undermines the principles of tolerance,  acceptance, and compassion that we hold dear as Americans.   It is deeply troubling and entirely unacceptable that a colleague on  the other side of the aisle has labeled Israel a racist state.   We must be resolute in our efforts to combat this hate and be  unequivocal in our condemnation of anti-Semitism in all of its forms  from all persons.   The Jewish people have shown incredible resilience and strength as  they have faced unimaginable suffering throughout history--from the  horrors of the Holocaust to the persistent prejudice that seeks to  marginalize them today, as the Jewish people have been unjustly  targeted.   Let us join hands in solidarity, Mr. Speaker, with our Jewish  brothers and sisters and make it our mission to combat and eradicate  anti-Semitism once and for all.                            ____________________
