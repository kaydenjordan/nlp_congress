 Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to act to reauthorize  and extend the Violence Against Women Act.   Enacted back in 1994, the Violence Against Women Act has provided  invaluable support and resources to women impacted by domestic violence  across Minnesota and across our country. It has funded hundreds of  thousands of dollars in grants to groups like the Minnesota Coalition  Against Sexual Assault, and Cornerstone Advocacy Services, which  provides counseling and therapy services to victims.   The Violence Against Women Act, Mr. Speaker, is critical to  preventing domestic violence and sexual assault and helping victims get  the treatment and justice they deserve.   I have authored a provision that has been included in past  reauthorizations.   For decades the Violence Against Women Act has been reauthorized with  strong bipartisan support, but it expires at the end of this month, and  I urge my colleagues in joining me in calling for its extension,  because victims of domestic violence are counting on it.                            ____________________
