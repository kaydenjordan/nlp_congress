 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, for every American who is old enough to  remember, the attacks of September 11, 2001, can be recalled as if they  happened yesterday. It is one of those rare, almost generational  moments that stand in the forefront of our Nation's collective memory.  I am confident that if we lined up all 100 Members of the Senate and  asked them where they were that morning, they could tell you.   I was in Austin, at home, on the telephone talking to then-Governor  Perry, now the Secretary of Energy. My wife got my attention and said:  Hold on. You are going to want to see this.   I turned to look at the television just as the second airplane hit  the World Trade Center. I don't have to tell you; we all remember the  heartbreak, confusion, and anger that welled up in all of us as we saw  those images.   In the days and months and years since the attack, we vowed as a  nation to ``never forget'' the events of September 11. I think that is  one of the pivotal moments in our Nation's history. We will never  forget the 3,000 lives that were lost that day, the loved ones they  left behind, or the courage demonstrated by the brave first responders  who came from across the country to help in the aftermath of those  horrific attacks.   Today, Members of the Senate had an opportunity to vote on  legislation to turn that promise to ``never forget'' into something  tangible. I am proud that we have now permanently authorized the 9/11  Victim Compensation Fund. This fund was created to support those who  answered the Nation's call to help on 9/11 and in the months that  followed that attack.   Now, nearly 18 years later, first responders from across the country  are being diagnosed with cancers, respiratory diseases, and other  illnesses because of their dangerous work on that day. For them, each  day serves as a tragic reminder of the heartbreaking images most of us  just witnessed on a television screen.   The legislation we passed today is the Never Forget the Heroes:  Permanent Authorization of the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund Act. As  the name suggests, it permanently authorizes funding to support those  American heroes who led lifesaving recovery operations following the  attacks on 9/11. As I suggested, many of the diseases that affect these  men and women, such as cancers and respiratory diseases, may not have  become apparent for years after 9/11. It is the nature of these  diseases.   Ensuring the longevity of this fund is critical to providing these  heroes with the resources they need, whether that life-changing  diagnosis comes today or 50 years from now. It is part of our  commitment as Americans to support our first responders and the heroes  who ran not away from but toward the danger on that fateful day.   Throughout my time in the Senate, I have worked to support our first  responders who were there for our communities during the most difficult  times. The 9/11 first responders represent the very best of America,  and they deserve every ounce of assistance we are able to provide.   This legislation received 402 votes in the House of Representatives  and 97 votes here in the Senate, something nearly unheard of these  days. I appreciate our colleagues who have been  [[Page S5009]]  working to get this legislation passed to provide these men and women  with some peace of mind. I am proud to be one of the cosponsors, and I  am now glad it is headed to the President's desk for his signature.                           Prescription Drug Costs    Madam President, a survey last summer found that many Texans are  struggling to afford the rising cost of their healthcare. Three out of  five surveyed reported forgoing or postponing care because of the cost  barrier. That includes cutting their pills in half, skipping doses, or  not filling a prescription because they simply couldn't afford to do  so. With healthcare costs on the rise, things aren't expected to get  any easier unless we do something about it.   The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimated that between  2018 and 2027, customers can expect to see prescription drug spending  increase by an average of 6.1 percent a year. That is a faster increase  than hospital stays, doctors' visits, or any other healthcare  expenditure. There seems to be bipartisan agreement that something must  be done. But the real question is what that something is: What are your  ideas about how to make that something a reality?   Many of our progressive Democratic friends have embraced Medicare for  All as the solution to the problems that exist in our healthcare  delivery system. Their proposal, though, would kick about 180 million  Americans off of their private insurance and force them into one big  government-run plan. It would drain the vital program that seniors have  relied upon for more than a century and replace it with a watered-down  version that would result in long waiting lines for inferior care. The  government would tell you what clinic you had to go to, what doctor you  could see, and what prescriptions you could actually take. You would  lose your freedom and power to decide what is best for you and your  family when it comes to your healthcare. You would have to simply take  what you could get on somebody else's schedule.   Last but not least, Medicare for All would completely bankrupt our  country. I think this approach is akin to having a pipe burst in your  house, but instead of repairing it, tearing the whole thing down and  rebuilding it from scratch. It is unaffordable. It is unpopular. It is  unnecessary and goes against all logic.   Don't get me wrong. Our healthcare system is not perfect, but  Medicare for All is actually worse, and it would create more problems  than it would solve.   Instead, I support targeted reforms that have been offered by a  number of our colleagues here--most on a bipartisan basis--to lower  healthcare costs and to give people more choices in terms of what fits  their needs the best. On Thursday, the Senate Finance Committee will be  marking up a package of bills that will aim to reduce prescription drug  costs for seniors and families. Last month, the Senate HELP Committee  overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan bill to reduce out-of-pocket  healthcare costs and increase transparency and eliminate surprise  medical bills. A few weeks ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee, on  which I serve, unanimously reported out legislation that would keep  pharmaceutical companies from gaming the patent system.   All of these reforms are intended to repair the problems that exist  without completely leveling the existing healthcare system. For  example, the package that passed the Judiciary Committee included a  proposal I introduced with our colleague from Connecticut, Senator  Blumenthal, called the Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act. This  bill takes aim at two practices often deployed by pharmaceutical  companies to stomp out competition and protect their bottom line.   First, this bill targets a practice called product hopping. When a  company is about to lose exclusivity of a product--that is, when their  patent is about ready to run out--they often develop some sort of minor  reformulation and then yank the original patented drug off the market.  That prevents generic competition. There is no doubt that legitimate  changes have warranted a new patent, but, too frequently, we are seeing  this deployed as a strategy to box out generic competition.   About 90 percent of the drugs we all take are generic and not branded  drugs under a patent. That means we get less expensive drugs that are  just as effective as the original branded product. That is the way our  system is supposed to work, by making generic drugs more readily  available and affordable. By defining product hopping as anti- competitive behavior, the Federal Trade Commission would be able to  take action against those who engage in this practice.   Our bill would also target something known as patent thicketing by  limiting the patents companies can use to keep competitors away. Some  drug companies like to layer on patent after patent in an attempt to  make it virtually impossible for biosimilar manufacturers to bring a  competing product to market. While the patent on the actual drug  formula may have expired, there are still, in some cases, hundreds of  other patents to sort through that discourage competition.   This bill would limit the number of patents these companies can use  and streamline the litigation process so that companies are spending  less time in the courtroom and, hopefully, more time in the laboratory  developing lifesaving innovative drugs. Competitors would be able to  resolve patent disputes faster and bring their drugs to market sooner.  Of course, better competition means better prices for patients.   It is also good news for taxpayers. Just last week, we received the  cost estimate of this bill from the Congressional Budget Office, and  they found it would lower Federal spending by more than one-half  billion dollars over 10 years. This is just the savings to the Federal  Government under Medicare and Medicaid. There would undoubtedly be  additional significant savings for consumers with private health  insurance.   The Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act does not prevent  manufacturers from making improvements to their products, and it  doesn't limit patent rights. It also doesn't hamper innovation, and it  doesn't spend money we don't have on a system we don't really want. It  simply stops those who knowingly game and abuse our patent system.   Our country is proudly a leader in pharmaceutical innovation, partly  because we offer robust protection for intellectual property. When you  create a new drug, you are granted a patent, an exclusive right to sell  that drug for a period of years. But this legislation ensures that  those who game the system--the bad actors--are no longer able to take  advantage of these innovation protections in order to maintain their  monopolies at the expense of the American people after their patent  should have expired.   I believe there is more we can do to improve our healthcare system  and bring down out-of-pocket costs for the American people, but instead  of tearing down the whole house, let's make the repairs we actually  need.
