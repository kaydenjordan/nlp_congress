 Mr. President, reserving the right to object.   Colleagues, what is happening at the border right now is not just  another policy matter to me; it is personal.   When I see the young Latino children, alone in an unfamiliar setting,  being spoken to by law enforcement and other authorities in a language  that they don't understand, I actually can't help but think of my three  boys. My boys are the same ages as many of the kids presenting  themselves at the border seeking asylum.   They look just like those kids. I see the fear and desperation in the  eyes of the children at the border, and I don't have to imagine how my  boys would look and feel under such circumstances. I have tasted that  already.   In 2018, we were on a family trip in Arizona--June of 2018. It was  the height of Trump's cruel family separation. We took a detour to  Tornillo, TX, to demand humane treatment of the children who were being  intentionally separated from their parents by the previous  administration.   On the way there, I tried to prepare my boys, mentally and  emotionally, for what they were about to see. And it was my youngest  son, Diego, who was 3 years old at the time, who turned to me and said:  Dad, Donald Trump is putting kids in cages. We got to go help them.   My heart broke. Imagine how the children on the border today are  feeling. Imagine how scared they must be. Consider how traumatic their  young lives have already been and how anxious they are for the basic  safety and comfort that so many people take for granted.   Let's think of their parents' anguish, to be so desperate to protect  their children, to be so afraid for their safety, let alone their  future, that they make the heartbreaking decision of sending them on a  dangerous 2,000-mile journey to the U.S. border all alone, knowing that  as risky and as dangerous as that journey is, it is safer than to stay  in their own community.   Let's be clear. These are children. These are families, not that are  well-off, trying to game the system. These are families who are  desperate. Their communities have been ravaged by hurricanes, the  COVID-19 pandemic, and in so many cases, decades of violence. Their  families are threatened by gangs with torture and murder if they stay  home. Asylum seekers aren't just seeking a better life. Many are simply  just trying to stay alive.   Too many policymakers act like asylum seekers are just choosing to  come here, when there is really no choice at all.   So I am deeply disappointed to see so many Members of Congress, both  in the House and in the Senate, depicting desperate, young children at  the border as some sort of threat to our Nation. As though 15,000  practically orphaned children trying to assimilate into our country of  330 million is some sort of existential crisis for our Nation.   The real crisis is the immigration laws that are so broken that  children have to make a treacherous 2,000-mile journey to seek asylum  here. The real crisis is that this situation distracts us from the more  than 11 million undocumented immigrants who have been living in the  United States for years, working and paying taxes in communities all  across America while living  [[Page S1729]]  in constant fear of deportation. They are our neighbors, our teachers,  our nurses, our grocery store workers, our childcare providers. They  are the essential workers whom we have all thanked each and every day  throughout this pandemic who live in constant fear that their lives  will be upended and their families ripped apart at any moment,  depending on the politics of the day in Washington.   The real crisis is that we have strayed so far from our founding  principles as a Nation of immigrants and that we have strayed so far  from the creed emblazoned on the very statue that we erected to welcome  immigrants into New York Harbor saying:         Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning       to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore.       Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me, I lift my       lamp beside the golden door!    So I am disappointed but, sadly, not surprised that this resolution  is nothing more than a cynical attempt to perpetuate the semantic  nonsense of the day. Our constituents didn't send us to the Senate or  to Congress to identify problems. They sent us here to develop and  enact solutions.   I am more than willing to sit down with my colleague here to try to  come up with some solutions to address what is happening at the  border--solutions that address the lack of resources and the broken  processes left by the previous administration, solutions that recognize  the fundamental humanity of these desperate children and families who  simply want to live to see their next birthday, and solutions that stay  true to the values of this Nation.   I have an amendment to the resolution at the desk to strike the text  of the Inhofe resolution and to insert the following:         Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that our       outdated immigration laws and the lack of a pathway to       citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants who       form the backbone of communities across the United States       constitutes a crisis and that the United States Senate must       take up immigration reform this year.    I ask that Senator Inhofe's request be modified as follows: that the  Padilla substitute amendment at the desk to the resolution be  considered and agreed to; that the resolution, as amended, be agreed  to; and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate.    I object.    Reserving the right to object, Madam President, I share  my colleague's desire to prevent child trafficking. Trust me, as a  parent, I know it is a laudable goal. But as drafted--as drafted--this  bill would create enormous and instant chaos at airports around the  country and every other port of entry.   As written, it would require every foreign family who seeks admission  to the United States, even just for a family vacation, to have a third  party witness a test to their affiliation or else submit to a DNA test.  I can't imagine any of our airports have the resources to implement  this. It would simply lead to the same chaos we saw after the  implementation of President Trump's Muslim ban, or worse, it would  overwhelm our law enforcement officials and create bottlenecks at  customs for citizens and noncitizens alike, not to mention the many  legal and ethical questions as it pertains to genetic privacy and the  storage of that information.   I would be more than happy to sit down with my colleague from  Tennessee in the context of a larger discussion about immigration  reform to see how we can ensure that we include provisions to prevent  child trafficking, but I don't think this bill as drafted will actually  accomplish that goal, and so I object.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
