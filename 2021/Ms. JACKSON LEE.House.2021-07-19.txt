 Madam Speaker, most of the colleagues of this House  know that I have introduced H.R. 40, the Commission to Study Slavery  and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act, which can  be defined as repairing.   I read to my colleagues an assessment of the U.N. Human Rights chief  in a landmark report, launched after the killing of George Floyd in the  United States, urging countries worldwide to do more to help end  discrimination, violence, and systemic racism against people of African  descent and to make amends to them, including repair, reparations.   That word strikes fear in most people's hearts and minds because they  don't take a moment to understand what ending systemic racism and  institutional racism is or what repairing is. Repairing is a global  concept. It means that if you have been harmed or there is something  broken, you fix it.   When you think about racism in the United States, it is something  broken. There are many ways to address it: dealing with education and  healthcare, dealing with the economy of people who have an enormous  wealth gap, but breaching the gap and bringing people together.   I ask my colleagues for us to move forward on H.R. 40 because it is  healing legislation, and it will bring Americans together.                            ____________________
