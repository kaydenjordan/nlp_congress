 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to salute a dedicated public  servant and friend. After working for a series of Members of the House,  including Representative Bill Goodling, Rob Green first served the  Education and Workforce Committee from 1995 to 2001. Rob rejoined the  committee 4 years ago and was an invaluable leader of the GOP workforce  team until his recent retirement.   As director of workforce policy, Rob worked tirelessly to protect the  rights of workers and employers alike. He has dedicated years of his  life to fighting for free market principles and to seeing that our  country stays a self-governed republic. Whether we have been in the  majority or in the minority, Rob has made addressing Federal overreach  a top priority and has never been afraid to hold Federal agencies  accountable.   Rob's consummate professionalism when working with Members of  Congress as well as Democrat staff allowed us to pass bipartisan bills  such as the Retirement Improvement and Savings Enhancement Act, RISE,  which will help many Americans prepare for a more secure future.   Rob's work was also pivotal in helping us pass a ban on surprise  billing. This fight for transparency in our medical system has been a  passion of Rob's and will help millions of struggling Americans.   Rob's influence extended way beyond the committee. GOP leadership  also relied on Rob to shape policy in the labor arena, ensuring that  the American worker's voice gets heard. His relationship with lawmakers  and staff throughout the House allowed the committee to flourish and  accomplish a tremendous amount.   Too often populist lobbies have an out-sized influence over politics  in Washington. Rob's work on this committee ensured that the voices of  job creators and small business owners were heard.   This is a difficult day for me as I relied on Rob's expertise and  keen eye for strategy to further this committee's mission. Thankfully,  his expertise will live on in the team that he has led and mentored for  4 years.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Rob for his many accomplishments and for his  selfless service to this country. It is because of dedicated public  servants like Rob standing in the gap and defending our Republic that  we have a chance at reclaiming the vision our Founding Fathers had for  this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I truly congratulate Rob on his retirement. He has  earned it.                            ____________________
