 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to  introduce America to First Baptist Church Indian Trail in the person of  Pastor Mike Whitson, who opened us in prayer.   Pastor Whitson celebrated this past month his 40th anniversary in the  pulpit at First Baptist.   Indian Trail? You may ask, what is Indian Trail? It is a small town,  I would say, immediately east of Charlotte, North Carolina, except that  is not quite right. The mayor of Stallings, North Carolina, is in the  gallery. Stallings is immediately east of Charlotte, and Indian Trail  is immediately east of Stallings.   It is a small town, and in its midst, the institution of First  Baptist Church has over 7,000 members. In the course of the pastorate  of Mike Whitson, more than 7,000 people have been baptized, and they  have two satellite campuses.   In 1992, they began the Metrolina Christian Academy, which now  matriculates 1,477 students in one of the largest K-12 private schools  in our State. There is ministry after ministry--to the county jail, a  Russian language ministry. Where God undertakes to do His will, it can  be in the most unexpected of places.    It was related in the church's celebration of Mike's pastorate and  his 40th anniversary that, in the early days, Mike would surprise  everyone, certainly the men of the church, when he would bid them a  farewell by saying: I love you.   At first, they were taken aback, but after a time, they began saying  to Pastor Whitson: I love you.   That is what Pastor Whitson has meant, and the work of the Lord  through him and in him is a masterful thing for the Nation to behold.   It is my honor to have had him here in the House Chamber today.                            ____________________
