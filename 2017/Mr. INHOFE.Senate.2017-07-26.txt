 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  recognized in morning business for as much time as I shall consume.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    Mr. President, there seems to be some confusion. I will  take whatever time you designate is left. I wanted to talk longer.   The things the Senator from South Carolina was talking about are  pretty amazing. I look at my State of Oklahoma. Did you know our  premiums in the State of Oklahoma under ObamaCare have tripled? They  have gone up 201 percent.   When you look and you see the options that are out there, what really  disturbs me--I understand one big difference between Democrats and  Republicans is Democrats are disciplined, Republicans aren't, so they  are all voting against any kind of a change. I guess they all love  ObamaCare.   I can assure you, though, if you look at the charts the Senator from  South Carolina was showing, you would wonder why in the world they  would all be gathering around when they would dramatically benefit by  taking one of the alternatives to ObamaCare.   I didn't come down to talk about that, but I have to say, from a  State where our premiums have gone up--tripled--you stop and you ask:  What is this going to look like when we get the new bill done?   We don't know exactly what it is going to look like. It is going to  have the individual mandates done away with. It is going to have the  taxes reduced. It is going to have block grants going to the States.   Look at my State of Oklahoma. That will increase the amount of money  that will be coming in, with less taxes, by 200 percent. I dare say,  there are a lot of Democrats who would find that in the same situation.   One last note about that, as I go back and I work around the State, I  find there are a lot of people who are saying: I don't like this  alternative.   I would only say, not just in Oklahoma but anywhere in the Nation, if  you oppose what is going to be the alternative, what you are saying is,  you would rather have ObamaCare.                     Commending Attorney General Sessions    Mr. President, actually, I came to the floor for a different reason.  It is probably the most awkward situation I have been in before. Since  they cut me down to 8\1/2\ minutes, I will have to come back to the  floor and embellish a little bit more. I am in an awkward situation.  First of all, I believe that we have a President in President Trump who  is doing a great job.   I look around and I see what is happening to us. We are now a leader  in the free world again. All kinds of things have happened that are  very good. Yet I have to say the Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, if I  could single out three people in the U.S. Senate whom I respect more,  he would be among those.   I am fortunate enough to have known him since the middle eighties,  back during the Reagan administration. I knew him very well when he was  elected the first time in 1996. Here is a guy who is an outstanding  guy, who does things, gets things done. Look at his accomplishments as  Attorney General. In that short period of time, what he has done is, he  has been working to crack down on immigration. He has performed some  real miracles there, and he has worked on protecting law enforcement.  In fact, a law enforcement group came out and singled him out as the  most prominent and most popular Attorney General we have had.   Look what he has done in his time, what he has introduced. Child  abuse--he did the Child Abuse Act. He did it himself. Nobody else  helped him. His quote was: ``There is no higher duty than protecting  our Nation's children.'' The Prison Rape Elimination Act, the first  Federal law dealing with sexual assault on prisoners. A lot of those  are young prisoners. We all know the stories. He is the guy who passed  that, and nobody else was in on that deal--just him. Forensic sciences,  he has been able to be a champion there.   I would have to say that the major thing he did during the time in  his early years was that he was the one who was standing up against  segregation. He was the one who single-handedly put himself in a  situation where he was taking on the bad guys, and he was desegregating  the schools in Alabama. He was key to the prosecution of the Klansmen  for abducting and killing a Black teenager. We all remember that. Who  was that? Who did that? That was Jeff Sessions. So he gets things done.  He was the one who was responsible for bankrupting the Klan in his  State of Alabama. Here is a guy who has the sensitivity. I have never  known a person I could respect more. That is what bothers me.    I think we have a President who is doing a good job, and the only  area where I disagree with him--he has this fight going with Jeff  Sessions.   Let me just say this: There is no one I hold in higher regard. He is  about the most knowledgeable person, compassionate person, and  honorable person we could have in that job.   When there is more time on the schedule, I will come back and  elaborate a little bit more on my hero Jeff Sessions and how he ought  to remain in that office and do a great job for the United States.   With that, I will comply with the request and yield my time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.
