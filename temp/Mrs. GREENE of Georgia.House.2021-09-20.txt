 Madam Speaker, I have introduced Articles of  Impeachment on President Joe Biden. The reason why I have done so is  for his disgraceful actions having to do with Afghanistan: abandoning  Americans and arming a terrorist nation, the Taliban, which is treason:  giving aid and comfort to our enemies.   I have also introduced Articles of Impeachment for the national  security crisis created at our southern border which today is actually  being invaded.   But heading into this week, perhaps the most evil and disgusting  thing that is going to happen in this 117th Congress is the bill that  is going to be introduced that makes it a Federal law to allow abortion  up until the day of birth.   This wall says: In God We Trust. And if that is the case, then this  Congress will reject this evil bill and protect the innocent unborn. If  this Nation becomes a nation where we have such a Federal law that can  kill a baby up until the day of birth, then God will no longer provide  protection in His grace over America.
