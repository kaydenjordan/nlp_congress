 Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my vote in  opposition to the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act.   First, I would like to thank Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed  for including the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act in  this defense authorization bill.   I worked with Senator Cornyn to develop this important piece of  legislation to update the role of the Committee on Foreign Investment  in the United States, CFIUS.   Our bill would expand CFIUS's authority to review foreign investments  in the United States and potentially block those that pose a risk to  our national security. I hope our bill is retained by the conferees and  included in the final defense authorization bill so that it can become  law.   The defense bill we are considering today also authorizes funding for  a number of programs critical to California's defense industry. That  includes funding for three ships: two oilers and an additional  expeditionary support base ship. All three are vital to the  shipbuilding industry in southern California.   The bill also continues production of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter  and F-18 Super Hornet aircraft, which, when coupled with the B-21  Raider, will help maintain California's edge in aerospace.   However, I am deeply disappointed that the defense authorization bill  also includes two nuclear weapons-related provisions that I strongly  oppose.   The first is the inclusion of $65 million to develop a new low-yield  submarine-launched ballistic missile. I vehemently oppose the  development of any new nuclear weapons, and I oppose the funding  included in this bill for that purpose.   I remember when the United States dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima  and Nagasaki. It is seared into my memory.   My greatest hope is that humanity will never see the use of nuclear  weapons again. My deepest fear, however, is that so-called low-yield  nuclear weapons make such a repetition more--not less--likely.   The Trump administration has argued that it needs new nuclear weapons  to respond in kind to a potential Russian first-use of a low-yield  weapon. That line of argument makes clear that the Trump administration  is contemplating actually using nuclear weapons to fight ``limited''  nuclear wars. We are kidding ourselves if we think there is such a  thing as a ``limited'' nuclear war.   We should listen to the wise words of Secretary of Defense Jim  Mattis, who said in February: ``I don't think there is any such thing  as a `tactical nuclear weapon.' Any nuclear weapon used any time is a  strategic game-changer.'' That is particularly true with the low-yield  weapon included in this bill. We already have 1,550 strategic nuclear  weapons. We have hundreds more low-yield weapons.   We are building new nuclear ballistic missile submarines, new long- range bombers, new intercontinental ballistic missiles, new nuclear  cruise missiles, and new fighter aircraft capable of delivering  advanced gravity bombs. We are also making investments to extend the  life of our existing warheads.   We have a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear deterrent. We do not  need to build new nuclear weapons, particularly for President Trump.   While I oppose this new low-yield weapon, I appreciate that it has  been the subject of considerable congressional debate and requires an  explicit congressional authorization to develop. However, that explicit  congressional authorization to develop new nuclear weapons will no  longer be required if this defense bill becomes law.   That is because, during the Senate Armed Services Committee's markup  of the bill, Senator Cotton offered an amendment to eliminate all  existing restrictions on the development of new, low-yield weapons.   His amendment, which passed on a party line vote, would allow the  Secretary of Energy to develop new weapons simply by requesting funding  to do so. Removing these restrictions is an abdication of our  constitutional and moral responsibility to oversee spending on the  world's most dangerous weapons. I cannot support this change to  Congress's authority, and therefore I am compelled to vote against the  defense authorization bill because of it.   As this bill moves forward, I urge the conference committee to reject  the Cotton amendment and retain longstanding restrictions on the  development of new low-yield nuclear weapons.  [[Page S3980]]    Congress should not cede its authority over weapons that have the  capacity to destroy us all to President Trump.   Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution  recognizing--and commending--the Golden State Warriors for overcoming a  battle-tested season to prevail as the 2017-2018 NBA World Champions.   After going 16 and 5 in the postseason and sweeping the Cleveland  Cavaliers in the NBA Finals, the Warriors have become back-to-back  champions for the first time in franchise history, and have won three  championships in the past four years.   They are now appropriately considered an NBA dynasty, and can easily  lay claim to being the team of this decade. They are also now  recognized as one of the greatest teams ever assembled. And what is  frightening for the rest of the league, is that it appears this team is  far from finished.  [[Page S3985]]    These playoffs helped bring out the best in these Warriors. After a  tough seven game series in the NBA Western Conference Finals against  the Houston Rockets, the team strung together a dominant performance in  the Finals against the Cavaliers. Their brilliant performance in the  finals was marked by just how beautiful this team plays. From the  superstars on the team to the last person on the bench, the team  exhibited dynamic teamwork, selflessness, and infectious joy.   Their on-court style, which I have come to enjoy so much, is a  reflection of the entire organization. I want to commend everyone who  is a part of the organization--the video interns, the training staff,  the owners, the coaches, the players and fans. They all deserve a  tremendous amount of credit for winning again this year with  consistency and class.   Although at times it has appeared too easy for the Warriors, this  season has been anything but easy. It was a season marked by constant  struggle and obstacles. When starters were sidelined due to injury  throughout the season and playoffs, bench players stepped in and  stepped up, revealing, yet again, the team's depth and heart.   And when the Warriors were pushed to the brink of elimination, they  pulled together as a team and strung together two gutsy wins to make it  back to the NBA Finals for the fourth straight year.   It was indeed a grueling season. For four years now, they have been  the ``hunted'' rather than the ``hunter,'' and absorbed the best shots  from teams around the league. When things got tough throughout the  season and the players and coaches could have pointed fingers at each  other, this team never gave in. They kept fighting and fighting until  they made it back to the mountain top, together.   What I am equally proud of about this team is that it has been a  positive force within the Bay Area community since 2012. Over the past  several years, the Warriors Foundation has awarded $6.2 million in  grants to support educational initiatives in Alameda and San Francisco  Counties. The Foundation, along with individual players, have also  refurbished over 70 basketball courts throughout the Bay, creating safe  and beautiful places for our young people to play. They are a team that  not only plays the right way on the court, but they are also a team  that makes the right impact off of the court.   So, to reigning two-time NBA Finals MVP Kevin Durant, Steph Curry,  Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Coach Steve Kerr, Coach Brown, Joe  Lacob, Peter Guber, Rick Welts, Bob Myers and all of the players,  coaches, staff, family, friends and fans, I say, thank you.   Thank you for making California proud both on and off the court, and  congratulations on a job well-done for a second year in a row.   The only question now is, ``can you make it three?''   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
