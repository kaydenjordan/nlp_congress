 Madam Speaker, I would like to state for the  record the prior remarks shared were inaccurate.   The fact of the matter is, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act actually  resulted in more revenues to the Treasury. Let's not forget that. And  the fact of the matter is, a growing economy will do far more for the  American people than new government programs that we can't afford.   We are standing here now, and of course, I think we should make good  on our debts and make good on our obligations. This bill is not the  solution. Instead of focusing on basics of governing, the majority has  chosen to spend the past 10 months kind of arguing here and there--a  lot actually--first passing their $2 trillion inflation catalyst at the  beginning of the year, and now arguing among themselves how to spend  another $5 trillion.   This bill is clearly not the solution. This bill isn't bipartisan. It  was brought to the floor solely by Democrats and reflects their take- it-or-leave-it approach to governing. It does nothing to address our  Nation's spending problem. It is a blank check which allows the  majority to spend as much as they want in the coming months  unrestrained by a true debt limit for the duration of this Congress.   Democrats control government and can immediately raise the debt  ceiling right now. There is a better way, however, than this particular  bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.
