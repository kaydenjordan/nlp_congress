 Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember Alaina  Housley, a wonderful young woman from my district who was murdered in  the mass shooting in Thousand Oaks.   Alaina was a bright, dedicated, and inspiring student who was so  excited to have voted for the first time this year. She was in her  freshman year at Pepperdine and had so much of her life ahead of her.  She was deeply loved by family and friends, and her death is a huge  loss for our entire community.   Over the last week, vigils and marches have been held in her honor in  her hometown of Napa. She will never be forgotten.   Mr. Speaker, I have committed to her parents that I will do  everything I can to address violence in our communities. We will honor  her senseless death with action.   May she rest in peace.                            ____________________
