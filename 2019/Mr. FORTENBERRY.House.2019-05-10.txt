 Madam Chair, first, let me thank Chairman Visclosky  for the time and for his efforts here, as well as the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Cunningham), for offering this very important  amendment to the bill.   Madam Chair, it is pretty jarring when you stand in your district at  a major piece of America's military infrastructure, Offutt Air Force  Base, and it is a third underwater.   Offutt Air Force Base is also home to Strategic Command, which is the  command that is in charge of our nuclear enterprise here and around the  world.   In March of this year, a furious slurry of soil and water and ice  rushed down the Platte and Elkhorn Rivers. It crossed over the  Missouri, hit the Iowa levee, blew it out, dug a 62-foot hole, and then  water began to come back up the Missouri River.   Offutt Air Force Base sits at the confluence of the Platte and  Missouri Rivers, and this is what forced the flooding.   I am very grateful, again, to my colleagues for recognizing that this  is a disaster that needs national attention, along with the other  natural disasters that have hit our country, particularly Tyndall Air  Force Base, as well.   This amendment provides the funds to the Air Force operations and  maintenance accounts to rebuild essential military infrastructure in my  district and around the country. It will help us rebuild hangars and  other buildings at Offutt, and this is in dire need.   I am pleased that my colleagues have recognized that this package,  $120 million of which could potentially go to Offutt, is also essential  for helping our Nation rebound from the various natural disasters that  have hit us.    Madam Chair, I would like to first recognize and  thank my good friend, the chair of the Subcommittee on Agriculture,  Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies,  my leader, Mr. Bishop from Georgia, for yielding me time. I also want  to thank my colleague, Representative Axne from Iowa, for working in  partnership together on this important amendment.   Madam Chair, this is tough stuff. This was one of the most  destructive weather events in our lifetimes. It was a perfect storm of  factors that enabled and caused the dislocation and distress across  many States and multiple communities where I live.   In Nebraska and in Iowa, lands that were soaked by autumn rains were  frozen solid, and then they were covered in snow. Then this bomb  cyclone hit us with a lethal mix of blizzard, rain, and an enormous  quantity of water, ice, and collected topsoil. It all sped down our  rivers, creeks, and reservoirs, bursting through dams, levees, and  other structures designed to hold the torrent back.   As I said in our previous debate, it is pretty jarring to stand on a  ridge and look at an Air Force base one-third under water which, again,  sits at the confluence of the Missouri and Platte Rivers overlooking  Iowa and Nebraska. The Corps of Engineers said to me that our levee  system looks like Swiss cheese.   Now, Madam Chair, while our Midwest constituents are known for their  hardiness, individuals in our communities can't solve the problem alone  through just State or local resources. We need a partner with the  Federal Government to repair badly damaged watersheds so vital to our  Nation's environmental security.   The amendment adds $310 million to the $125 million in the bill.  Approximately 60 percent of the funds will go to the damage caused in  the Midwest floods as well as communities impacted by Hurricanes  Florence, Harvey, and Michael.   On the ground, Madam Chair, in both of our States this program will  help restore the scarred lands. This important relief will repair and  reshape eroded stream banks, repair water control structures, repair  levees, and restore conservation priorities.   Our communities are getting back on their feet, but we need this  program quickly to address serious and long-term damages to the  infrastructure and our land.   Madam Chair, I thank my colleagues for their consideration.                                time  1100
