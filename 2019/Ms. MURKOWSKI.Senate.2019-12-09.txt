 Mr. President, I rise today to say how pleased I am to  join with the Senator from New Hampshire in introducing S. 2942, a bill  to revise the tax treatment of certain contributions to the capital of  corporations.   S. 2942 corrects a provision in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that  disqualified government grants to corporations from treatment as tax- free contributions to capital. The provision resulted in the imposition  of income tax on all such grants. At the same time, a companion  provision in the act imposed income tax on ``contributions in aid of  construction,'' CIAC, to regulated water utilities, reversing a  longstanding rule of prior law that shielded regulated water utilities  from tax on such payments. The term CIAC refers to payments--from  either governmental sources or other sources that are used by a utility  to expand its physical plant.   Our bill corrects the TCJA, first, by restoring the tax exemption for  CIAC received by water utilities. That change will ensure that  Alaskans, along with all water utility customers around the country,  who make payments to a water utility to help the utility expand its  service territory or otherwise improve its physical plant will not  thereby saddle the utility with a tax charge that could translate into  an increase in rates for water service or that, alternatively, could be  passed back to the payer of the CIAC.   There is no plausible basis for taxing CIAC received by water  utilities and thereby saddling the utility and its customers with the  tax charge. CIAC does not at all resemble normal taxable income  received by a business in exchange for goods or services. In fact, our  bill specifically precludes the utility from including CIAC in its rate  base and thereby earning a return on it.   The treatment of CIAC as taxable income might not matter if water  utilities could expense the cost of the capital improvements funded  through CIAC. The expensing deduction would offset the income. But  under the TCJA, regulated utilities do not qualify for expensing. Thus,  they incur the tax on the receipt of CIAC and pass the tax on to the  payer of the CIAC.  [[Page S6901]]    One unintended consequence of the taxability of CIAC, coupled with  the ineligibility of regulated utilities for expensing, is the creation  of an unjustifiable incentive for the development of water  infrastructure outside regulated utilities--i.e. outside the companies  that are best equipped to build and manage the infrastructure. The  incentive exists because non-utility corporations, unlike regulated  utilities, qualify for expensing and can thus eliminate the tax on the  receipt of CIAC. Our bill eliminates the incentive by restoring the tax  exemption for CIAC received by regulated water utilities.   The other correction our bill makes in the TCJA is to reverse the  rule in the act that treats all government grants to corporations as  taxable income. Under prior law, government grants that were not in the  nature of ordinary purchases of goods or services could qualify as tax- free contributions of capital.   The TCJA failed to distinguish among different types of government  grants in writing the new rule. For example, there is no apparent  reason why government grants made to spur investment in rural broadband  infrastructure should be taxable. The effect of the tax is to reduce  the value and effectiveness of the grants. Nor should tax logically be  imposed on grants intended to spur investment that would protect the  environment or public health, including Investment in water  infrastructure.   There are, of course, types of government grants that could probably  be taxed without adverse consequences. One example would be grants made  to influence corporate decisions on the location of corporate  headquarters or facilities.   To create a simple starting point, our bill simply eliminates the  TCJA rule taxing government grants. As the Finance Committee and  leadership consider the issue, we anticipate that, this time around,  they will take the time to consider more carefully which types of  grants should be taxable and which should be tax-free. At a minimum,  the broadband and environmental grants described above should be tax- free, but there are probably many similar types of grants that should  have the same treatment.   Mr. President, I look forward to working with the Senator from New  Hampshire and with the members of the Finance Committee to craft  sensible corrections to the TCJA to restore the tax exemption for CIAC  received by water utilities and restore the tax exemption for  government grants received by corporations where the grants are  demonstrably in the public interest.                            ____________________
