 Mr. President.    Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in support of the  nomination of U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah Boardman to be a U.S.  district judge for the District of Maryland.   Judge Boardman was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee on  June 10. I have recommended Judge Boardman, along with Senator Van  Hollen, to President Biden, and I strongly support her nomination.  Judge Boardman was nominated to fill the future vacancy created when  Judge Richard Bennett, appointed by President Bush in 2003, announced  his intentions to take senior status upon the confirmation of his  successor. President Biden nominated Judge Boardman for this position  on March 30, and the Judiciary Committee held her confirmation hearing  on May 12.   Shortly after the November 2020 Presidential election, I worked with  Senator Van Hollen to establish a judicial selection committee in  Maryland. We used an open application process with public advertisement  and communicated closely with the State, local, and specialty bar  associations in Maryland. In particular, we sought out a highly  qualified and diverse applicant pool.   Our committee interviewed everyone who submitted an application,  which involved several dozen interviews. Senator Van Hollen and I  personally interviewed several finalists before making our  recommendations to the White House.   I strongly agree with President Biden's request that Senators  consider nominating individuals whose legal experiences have been  historically underrepresented on the Federal bench, including those who  are public defenders, civil rights and legal aid attorneys, and those  who represent Americans in every walk of life. Judge Boardman fits that  request.   Judge Deborah Boardman was born in Silver Spring, raised in  Frederick, and lives in Baltimore. She received a B.A. from Villanova  University. After graduating from college, she accepted a Fulbright  scholarship to study in Amman, Jordan. She received her J.D. from the  University of Virginia School of Law. After law school, she clerked for  a Federal judge in the Eastern District of Virginia, known as the  ``rocket docket'' for the speed of its caseload.   Judge Boardman brings tremendous experience to the courtroom as a  sitting U.S. magistrate judge in Maryland since 2019, which is the same  Federal judicial district in which she would become a district judge,  if confirmed by the Senate. She already handles a heavy caseload in our  Federal court.   As a magistrate judge, Judge Boardman presides over civil cases by  consent of the parties, resolves civil discovery disputes, conducts  settlement conferences, and presides over preliminary criminal  proceedings. Additionally, she administers the District of Maryland's  Social Security appeals docket.   In civil cases before her by consent of the parties, Judge Boardman  rules on motions to dismiss, resolves discovery disputes, decides  whether a case should proceed to trial, and presides over bench and  jury trials. These cases have involved claims of unemployment  discrimination in violation of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of  1964, the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Rehabilitation Act;  claims under 42 United States Code 1983, the Fair Labor Standards Act,  the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act; qualified and sovereign  immunity defenses; and State law claims stemming from contract disputes  and personal injuries.   As you can see, she has broad experience in regards to her tenure as  a magistrate judge. She has previously served as the First Assistant  Federal Public Defender of Maryland. During her 11-year tenure with the  Federal Defender's Office, Judge Boardman represented individuals in  both the Greenbelt and Baltimore courthouses that were charged with  Federal crimes.   She also has experience in private practice, as she served as a  litigation associate at Hogan Lovells, formerly known as Hogan &  Hartson, in Washington, DC, from 2001 to 2008. During  [[Page S4720]]  those years, Judge Boardman worked exclusively on civil matters. She  has experience both on the civil side and criminal side. She  represented a wide range of corporate and individual clients in State  and Federal courts. Specifically, she counseled insurance companies,  universities, and healthcare and pharmaceutical companies, among  others, in business and contract disputes.   As a fifth-year associate, the firm selected Judge Boardman to serve  as the senior pro bono associate in its nationally recognized pro bono  department. She managed the firm's largest pro bono cases full-time and  appeared in Federal and State courts as the lead attorney in several of  these pro bono cases.   She tried a wrongful eviction action before a DC jury. She was lead  counsel on a 3-day evidentiary hearing on habeas corpus petitions in  the circuit court for the city of Norfolk. She argued numerous  discovery motions before the U.S. magistrate judge in the District  Court for the District of Columbia in an unemployment discrimination  class-action lawsuit.   The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal  Judiciary gave Judge Boardman its highest, unanimous ``well qualified''  recommendation after evaluating her integrity, professional competence,  and judicial temperament.   As Judge Boardman said at her confirmation hearing, she is the  daughter of the American Revolution on her father's side and a first- generation American of Palestinian descent on her mother's side. Her  father was born in New York and was drafted to serve in the U.S. Army  in the Vietnam war and then went on to be a successful businessman. Her  mother was born in Ramallah, a Palestinian city in the West Bank. She  immigrated to the United States in the 1950s with her parents and eight  brothers and sisters when she was just 13 years of age. She spoke no  English. When she began attending public school in suburban Maryland,  she then learned, of course, English and went on to a successful career  as a beautician.   Judge Boardman has testified that her parents taught her the value of  hard work, the importance of education, the value of family, and the  need to be generous to those who are less fortunate in life.   In my discussions and meetings with Judge Boardman, I have some  impressions that stand out from her as a person. She is fully committed  to public service through her diverse professional career as a lawyer,  law firm partner, public defender, and now a U.S. magistrate judge. She  regards being a sitting judge as the ultimate and highest calling of  public service in the legal profession. She wants to inspire the  public's confidence in the judiciary and to hear parties' concerns  compassionately, while upholding her duty to fairly apply the law. Now  as a U.S. magistrate judge, Judge Boardman has told me she understands  the absolute importance of adjudicating disputes neutrally and fairly.   She clearly has the temperament for this position. She has told me  that she is naturally curious and tries to avoid making assumptions.   Judge Boardman shared with me that her internal compass directed her  toward service. Judges are first and foremost public servants, but they  hold certain powers over individuals' lives. She understands that. In  her view, a district court judgeship is much more than achievement; it  is a serious public responsibility which requires a judge to put the  public first as they uphold the rule of law.   Numerous individuals wrote to me on Judge Boardman's behalf,  including several sitting judges, law firm associates, and colleagues  from her service in the public defender's office. They unanimously  praise Judge Boardman's courtroom skills as a litigator, in particular  praising her courtroom presence, sharp legal and analytical skills in  both written and legal advocacy, and her high level of professionalism,  excellent temperament, and unfailing courtesy to all parties.   As a person, I have repeatedly been told by those who know her well  that Judge Boardman is the best kind of person to be a judge. She is  smart, patient, kind, and tough when she needs to be. She is a hard  worker. She sees all sides of an argument and is always fair and  professional in her treatment of others.   I was delighted to recommend the nomination of Judge Boardman to  President Biden, along with Senator Van Hollen. Judicial nominees must  meet the highest standard of integrity, competency, and temperament.  Judge Boardman will safeguard the rights of all Marylanders and all  Americans, uphold the Constitution and rule of law, and faithfully  follow the judicial oath to do equal right to the poor and to the rich.  I am confident that Judge Boardman will serve the people of Maryland  very well once she is confirmed.   I urge my colleagues to vote for the confirmation of Judge Boardman,  who is an outstanding judicial nominee from Maryland. She is already a  sitting U.S. magistrate judge on the U.S. District Court for the  District of Maryland, where she has served with district judges. I look  forward to her continued public service to Maryland and to the Nation.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise in recognition of LGBTQ Pride Month  of 2021. For more than 50 years, Pride Month has offered us a chance to  celebrate lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer--LGBTQ-- Americans and to reflect upon the progress that our Nation has made in  how we treat this community in law, policy, custom, and everyday life.  It also is an opportunity to redouble our efforts to end enduring  discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.   President Biden promptly issued a Presidential proclamation  recognizing June of 2021 as Pride Month. With the authorization of  Secretary of State Antony Blinken, U.S. diplomatic missions around the  world are displaying the pride flag as a clear visual representation of  American values. On the very first day of his administration, President  Biden issued an executive order on preventing and combating  discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation. This  decision has already driven new policies at the agency level making an  important difference in real people's lives, from protecting  transgender individuals seeking safe shelter to reversing the  [[Page S4726]]  Trump-era ban that prohibited transgender people from serving in the  military. It is clear that LGBTQ Americans can count on the Biden- Harris administration to do everything possible to champion fundamental  human rights on their behalf.   The bad news is that while we see progress at a Federal level, the  Human Rights Campaign assesses that 2021 is the worst year in terms of  State-level anti-LGBTQ legislation in recent history. Governors have  signed 17 anti-LGBTQ bills into law, already exceeding the 15 anti- LGBTQ laws passed in 2015, which held the previous record in recent  history. There are even more bills waiting Governors' signatures or  veto override votes. Most of these bills shamefully target transgender  children. These bills and laws are untethered from trends in real  public opinion. Recent polling from Gallup finds that support for same- sex marriage is at a new high of 70 percent of all Americans. A PBS/ NPR/Marist poll published in April revealed that two-thirds of all  Americans oppose legislation to ban transgender student athletes from  joining sports teams that match their gender identity, a number that  barely changes across partisan lines.   The American people clearly agree with the principle expressed in  President Biden's executive order: ``All persons should receive equal  treatment under the law, no matter their gender identity or sexual  orientation.'' It is as simple as that.   When it comes to human rights, civil rights, and being treated with  dignity and respect, everybody in this country, regardless of where  they live, should receive equal treatment. The House of Representatives  passed the Equality Act in February to prohibit discrimination based on  sexual orientation and gender identity in education, employment,  housing, credit, Federal jury service, public accommodations, and with  regard to receiving Federal financial assistance. These protections  build upon and align with the Supreme Court's landmark decision 1 year  ago in Bostock vs. Clayton County, which affirmed that the sex  discrimination prohibition in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 also applies  to discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. That  ruling states, ``it is impossible to discriminate against a person for  being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that  individual based on sex.'' We still urgently need to pass the Equality  Act, however, to apply this interpretation to all areas of civil rights  law and to apply protections against discrimination based on sex,  sexual orientation, and gender identity to a broader scope of entities.  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the legislation and will work  to advance it this Congress.   As Harvey Milk said, ``It takes no compromise to give people their  rights. It takes no money to respect the individual. It takes no  political deal to give people freedom.'' This Pride Month, I urge my  colleagues in the Senate to join me in supporting the Equality Act to  ensure that we protect the human and civil rights all Americans. Our  government should do all it can to promote equality, compassion, and  empathy--not discrimination, bigotry, and hate.                            ____________________
