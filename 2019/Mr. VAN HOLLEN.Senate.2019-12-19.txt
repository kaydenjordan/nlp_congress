 Mr. President, today the Senate passed H.R. 1865, one  of two appropriations packages needed to fund the Federal Government  for fiscal year 2020.   Eight appropriations bills are part of this consolidated  appropriations bill--eight bills that fund programs which impact every  part of our lives--and I am pleased that we have made several strong  steps to better serve the American people.   For Maryland and the Chesapeake Bay, the bill provides a historic  level of funding for EPA's Chesapeake Bay program and continued funding  for the dredging needs of the Port of Baltimore. In addition, the bill  provides funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to resume oyster  restoration work in the bay. These are hard-fought wins, and I  appreciate the work of those in the Maryland and Chesapeake Bay  delegations to help get this done.   After years of Republican opposition, this bill finally funds  critical gun violence research at the Centers for Disease Control. Gun  violence is an epidemic, and we should be engaging our best minds to  find solutions to keep the American people safe. I am also pleased that  the bill includes funding for the CDC to research sexual abuse  prevention and for the Agency for Healthcare Research Quality to  support diagnostic error research--issues I have worked on in the  Appropriations Committee. The bill also includes important increases  for medical research at the National Institutes of Health and delivers  funding to implement the Childhood Cancer STAR Act.   H.R. 1865 includes a funding increase for the Infant and Early  Childhood Mental Health Program, which helps develop, maintain, or  enhance infant and early childhood mental health promotion,  intervention, and treatment programs for children at risk of  developing, showing early signs of, or having been diagnosed with  mental illness. The bill also includes funding to continue the National  Adoption Competency Mental Health Training Initiative, which helps  child welfare and mental health workers better understand and address  the mental health needs of children, youth, and their families moving  toward or having achieved permanency through adoption or guardianship.   I am also very pleased that the bill continues the Federal funding  commitment to WMATA. I, along with Senator Cardin and our colleagues  from Virginia have introduced a WMATA reauthorization bill that would  authorize an additional 10 years of Federal funding. WMATA is the  Nation's transit system, and maintaining our Federal support is  essential for the local economy and for the people who live and work  here. Given the significant Federal ridership, it is incumbent on us to  ensure the Federal Government pay its fair share.   The bill fully funds a housing mobility demonstration project that  Senator Young and I have worked to develop. I look forward to the  results of the program as we look to expand housing vouchers and give  families a safe and stable place from which to build their futures. The  bill also funds the community development block grant and HOME  Partnership Program, two crucial economic development programs that  were eliminated in the President's budget.   I am pleased that the bill rejected a number of the President's cuts  to education and actually boosts funds for afterschool and student  support programs. It increases funding for title I and IDEA, two  foundational programs that help students in underserved areas and those  with disabilities have the resources they need to get a good education.  The bill expands access to early education by increasing funds for the  child care and development block grant and provides more K-12  wraparound services with boosts to the Full Service Community Schools  and Promise Neighborhoods Programs. The bill increases the Pell grant  and continues funding for Senators to pay their interns--an initiative  I have worked closely on with Senators Murphy, Schatz, Collins, and  Murkowski.   While the bill is mostly focused on domestic policy, I appreciate the  inclusion of language I authored to hold Saudi Arabia to the ``gold  standard'' section 123 agreement as a condition for Export-Import Bank  financing for U.S. nuclear exports. We should not be transferring  sensitive nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia without the establishment  of strong nonproliferation guardrails. I am also pleased that the bill  retains my provisions to sanction foreign government officials  responsible for the detention of American citizens and locally employed  staff of U.S. diplomatic missions, urges the Indian Government to  reverse course in Kashmir, bans the sale of arms to Turkish President  Erdogan's bodyguards, and mandates comprehensive oversight of the  administration's travel ban and refugee resettlement policies. In  addition, this legislation provides critical humanitarian and  development assistance for our partners and allies around the world,  despite President Trump's repeated attempts to cut the foreign  assistance budget dramatically.   Importantly, H.R. 1865 includes a 10-year reauthorization of the  Patient-  [[Page S7198]]  Centered Outcomes Research Institute, PCORI. When PCORI was first  created, there was broad agreement about the critical need for  comparative effectiveness research, CER. The CER research being done  through PCORI is helping to generate more personalized, more reliable  research that is directly relevant to individual patients and doctors.  There are significant evidence gaps about what medical treatments and  services are most clinically effective and for whom. We need more  information, and that information must quickly get into the hands of  patients and providers so they can make better-informed decisions about  their health care. PCORI-funded research is helping to fill that gap,  and I am pleased that this bill will allow it to continue for another  decade.   The bill also includes important policy improvements contained in the  PCORI Reauthorization Act, S. 2897, legislation I introduced with  Senators Warner, Cassidy, and Capito. H.R. 1865 will ensure that PCORI- funded research is designed to take into account and capture the full  range of clinical and patient-centered outcomes, including the  potential burdens and economic impacts of various medical treatments,  items, and services like out-of-pocket costs and nonmedical costs to  patients and families. Additionally, it adds a requirement that the  Government Accountability Office report on any barriers that  researchers funded by PCORI have encountered in conducting studies or  clinical trials, including challenges covering the cost of any medical  treatments, services, and items.   I am, however, disappointed that this bill eliminates Medicare's  contribution to the PCOR Trust Fund. Medicare beneficiaries benefit  greatly from PCORI-funded research. This includes a number of projects  that have focused on helping older adults and their caregivers make  better-informed decisions about their health care options, as well as  research on diseases and conditions that disproportionately impact  beneficiaries. I am concerned that divesting Medicare dollars sends a  signal to PCORI that Congress is not interested in this critical  research continuing to be funded. I am pleased that this bill increases  the mandatory appropriation to help make up for the loss of Medicare  funds, but Congress must maintain this investment over the full length  of the authorization.   I am pleased that H.R. 1865 includes a number of other bills that I  am proud to cosponsor, including the CREATES Act, the Patient Access to  Cellular Transplant Act, and the Protecting Beneficiary Access to  Complex Rehab Technology Act.   While I support much of this bill, I am deeply troubled by some of  its provisions.   I have serious concerns about parts of the tax extenders provisions  of the package. It is unfortunate that following on the heels of a tax  cut for wealthy households and big corporations that increased the  national debt by nearly $2 trillion, the tax changes in this bill  increase deficits by a further $426 billion. While I support some of  the changes, we should have paid for them by scaling back wasteful tax  breaks for those at the very top. And some of them represent additional  giveaways to industry without sufficient benefit for everyday  Americans. Moreover, I am extremely disappointed that the tax extenders  package did not include tax measures for energy storage, solar energy,  offshore wind, and electric vehicles. This represents a lost  opportunity to take even small steps to address the climate crisis, and  I urge my colleagues to address these clean energy tax measures early  next year.   I am disappointed that the bill drops House language preventing the  Department of Agriculture from physically relocating the Economic  Research Service, ERS, and National Institute of Food & Agriculture,  NIFA, outside of the National Capital Region. The relocation and  reorganization will impact the quality and breadth of the work these  agencies support and perform--work that is critical to informing and  supporting U.S. agriculture, food security, and rural development. I  appreciate that the bill includes no additional funding for the move,  and I hope that the Secretary of Agriculture will with us in Congress  to repair the damage that this relocation scheme has done.   While I do have concerns about aspects of this bill, I believe it  supports critical health, education, and infrastructure needs. I  appreciate the hard work of Senators Shelby and Leahy and their staffs  in crafting the bill and their support for many priorities I have  pushed for on behalf of my constituents in Maryland. It is an honor to  serve on the Appropriations Committee, and I look forward to continuing  our work to responsibly fund the government and its services for the  American people in the coming fiscal year.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak on the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020.   The National Defense Authorization Act conference agreement provides  crucial resources to our Armed Forces and our national defense,  including a pay increase for our men and women in uniform. I am proud  that the Congress was able to come together on a bipartisan basis to  pass this legislation to support our servicemembers, strengthen our  national security, and invest in critical projects in my home State of  Maryland.   While I have serious reservations about a number of items included in  this legislation and am particularly disappointed by the exclusion of  important priorities like the DETER Act to prevent Russian interference  in our elections, I believe that, on balance, this NDAA will strengthen  our national security. For that reason, I voted in favor of it.   With this bill, the Federal Government will now provide 12 weeks of  paid parental leave to its workforce. We have been fighting for years  to provide paid family and medical leave to workers throughout the  country. Now the Federal Government will finally start to lead by  example. Paid leave will reduce employee turnover costs for the Federal  Government and help agencies continue to recruit and retain top-notch  talent into the civil service. I was proud to help secure this, and we  need to keep fighting until all workers around the Nation receive paid  family and medical leave benefits.   The NDAA also repeals the military widow's tax. Currently, military  widows and widowers who qualify for the VA's dependency and indemnity  compensation are forced to take a dollar-for-dollar offset from the DOD  Survivors Benefits Plan benefit, even though their retired spouses  elected to pay into the program. No other Federal surviving spouse is  required to forfeit his or her Federal annuity because military service  caused his or her sponsor's death. This is fundamentally unjust. In  September, I met with a constituent and military widow who was  subjected to this offset after the loss of her husband. Hearing her  story hardened my resolve to ensure that we got this done this year,  and I am proud of the Congress for coming together to repeal this  offset.   Critically, this legislation also includes the Otto Warmbier North  Korea Nuclear Sanctions and Enforcement Act, which I introduced with  Senator Toomey. This legislation offers foreign banks and firms a stark  choice: continue business with North Korea or maintain access to the  U.S. financial system. Within 120 days of enactment of the law, this  legislation mandates sanctions on the foreign banks and companies that  facilitate illicit financial transactions for the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea. North Korea continues to perfect its ballistic  missile capabilities and produce more fissile material for nuclear  weapons. Our aim is to cut off North Korea's remaining access to the  international financial system and create the leverage necessary for  serious nuclear negotiations to achieve the goal of the  denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.   The NDAA also includes bipartisan legislation that tracks the  provision Senator Graham and I included in Senate Foreign Operations  appropriations bills over the years to prohibit the transfer of the F- 35 Joint Strike Fighter to Turkey until President Erdogan relinquishes  the Russian S-400 air and missile defense system. Turkey has recently  started testing the S-400 missile system, and they have said the system  will be operational early next year. The administration must not only  continue blocking the transfer of the F-  [[Page S7199]]  35s, but--as Senator Graham and I indicated in a recent letter to  Secretary Pompeo--it has a legal duty to impose economic sanctions on  Turkey.   The NDAA also includes a version of a bill Senator Cotton and I  introduced to prevent the President from removing Chinese  telecommunications giant Huawei from the Commerce Department's Entity  List without certifying to Congress that it is complying with U.S. laws  and the administration has mitigated the threat Huawei poses to our  national security. While I was disappointed that our original bill was  watered down, the final version is still better than the status quo.   This bill also includes a number of measures I introduced to ensure  that we give proper recognition to Americans who have bravely served  our country in combat. One of them is Col. Charles McGee. Colonel  McGee, a distinguished Tuskegee Airman who recently celebrated his  100th birthday, is a living aviation legend and an American hero. From  World War II to Korea, Colonel McGee flew more combat missions than any  other pilot in the service of his country. The first African American  to command a stateside Air Force wing and base, this Marylander's  service to our Nation is truly remarkable. That is why I worked with  the Air Force and introduced legislation to authorize the honorary  promotion of Colonel McGee to brigadier general. And today, on a  bipartisan basis, the Congress has authorized this honor. Colonel McGee  makes all Marylanders proud and reminds us all of what it means to  serve.   The conference report also includes the bipartisan World War I Valor  Medals Review Act, which I introduced with Senator Blunt. This  legislation directs the Department of Defense to review the service  records of minority service members who fought during World War I and  who may have been passed over for the Medal of Honor because of their  race or ethnicity. Many of these individuals have never received proper  recognition for their acts of valor.   Take, for example, William Butler of Salisbury, MD. In 1916 he was  living in Harlem, where he enlisted in the New York National Guard. His  regiment landed in France on Jan. 1, 1918. Sargent Butler received the  Distinguished Service Cross and the French Croix de Guerre for his  bravery in rescuing several members of his regiment from their German  captors. Sargent Butler killed 10 Germans, took a German prisoner,  freed all the American prisoners, and brought them back to safety. He  returned home to a hero's welcome. The Baltimore Afro-American called  him ``Maryland's Greatest Hero.'' The New York Tribune called him a  ``hero among heroes.'' He and the rest of the Harlem Hellfighters  marched through New York City. Upon his return to Maryland, his small  community gave him a gold watch as a token of their respect and  appreciation. But despite a recommendation for the Medal of Honor, he  never received it. In 1947, after losing the ability to work, he took  his own life. He was buried at Arlington--with a typo on his tombstone.   The living descendants of these veterans deserve to know that their  government, despite its past failings, recognizes their heroism. I am  very proud of the Congress for coming together to honor those who chose  to serve their country, even at a time when their country did not treat  them as equal citizens. In doing so we demonstrate that it is never too  late to right a historical wrong.   I would also like to commend the Valor Medals Review Task Force,  jointly established by the United States Foundation for the  Commemoration of the World Wars and the George S. Robb Centre for the  Study of the Great War, which has worked tirelessly to identify World  War I veteran service records for this review. I applaud the NDAA  conferees for encouraging the Secretaries of the military departments  to consult with the Valor Medals Review Task Force to identify those  service records that warrant further review to determine whether such  veteran should be recommended for an upgrade to the Medal of Honor for  valor.   The NDAA also addresses serious concerns with the oversight of  privatized military housing. Over the past year, I have engaged with  leaders at Fort Meade and Aberdeen Proving Ground as they have  addressed woefully inadequate maintenance by private housing  contractors. The NDAA includes key provisions of the Ensuring Safe  Housing for Our Military Act, of which I am a cosponsor. This includes  withholding payment of the basic allowance for housing under certain  circumstances, the creation of a Tenant Bill of Rights and the position  of Chief Housing Officer, a uniform code of basic standards for  privatized military housing, and access for tenants to an online work  order system, among other improvements.   Lastly, I am pleased that the bill includes language requiring  congressional notification and a 120-day waiting period before the  President gives notice of his intent to withdraw from the New START and  Open Skies treaties.   While I am pleased with many of the provisions included in this bill  and voted for its passage, I do have significant reservations.   First, the unchecked growth in the defense budget is unsustainable,  and the continued use of the overseas contingency operations budget to  fund elements of the Pentagon's regular base budget activities with war  funds is a blatant abuse of the budget process. We have a duty to  ensure the readiness of our forces, and I support efforts to rebuild  our Armed Forces after years of costly overseas engagements. But  massive spending increases without clear strategic direction do not  make us safer, and the use of off-budget accounts to boost Pentagon  spending is a disservice to our children and grandchildren, who will  pay for these spending increases regardless of whether or not they are  properly accounted for today. Especially in a post-Budget Control Act  environment, where we are not constrained by artificial caps, we need  to be thoughtful about our spending choices, recognize that every  dollar spent on defense is a dollar not spent on health care,  education, workforce training, and other critical areas of need. And we  need to use OCO in a responsible manner consistent with its original  purpose, and not as an off-budget slush fund.   Second, I am extremely disappointed by the Congress's failure to act  to prohibit U.S. military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen. This  brutal war has raged for more than 4 years. Thousands have lost their  lives in this conflict. Millions are displaced from their homes. The  cycle of desperation, destruction, and death continues unabated.  Earlier this year, Congress voted to end U.S. support for the war in  Yemen--legislation that President Trump vetoed. The refusal of  Republicans to address this issue as part of the NDAA is shameful.   Third, this legislation supports the President's effort to spend $1.3  trillion dollars on nuclear weapons. It contains no prohibition on  fielding low-yield nuclear warheads on submarine-launched ballistic  missiles, near-full funding for research and development on INF-range  missiles, near-full funding to build new ICBMs and associated warheads,  and full funding to retain the B83 megaton gravity bomb, which the  Obama administration had intended to retire as part of its  modernization efforts. And while it affirms the benefits of legally- binding verifiable limits on Russian strategic nuclear forces, it does  not explicitly endorse the extension of New START. This, like so much  else in this bill, is a missed opportunity. Senator Young and I have  introduced bipartisan legislation urging a 5 year extension of the New  START agreement, and the Senate should pass it expeditiously.   Fourth, Republicans blocked a provision in the House NDAA that  prevented the President from waging a war with Iran without an explicit  authorization from the Congress. President Trump's Iran strategy has  been blind unilateral escalation with no end goal. That is why his  actions have produced exactly the opposite result of what his so-called  ``maximum pressure'' campaign intended. President Trump has dismembered  the multilateral coalition that forged the Iran deal. He has frayed our  alliances in Europe and empowered our adversaries. All the while, the  administration has raised the specter of a possible military  intervention with Iran. By blocking this provision, Republicans are  enabling the President to subvert Congress's constitutional prerogative  with respect to decisions of war.  [[Page S7200]]    Finally, Majority Leader McConnell blocked the inclusion the  bipartisan DETER Act, which I introduced with Senator Rubio to deter  future Russian interference in U.S. Federal elections. The DETER Act  sends a clear message to Russian President Putin or any other foreign  adversary: If you attack American elections, you will face severe  consequences. Leader McConnell blocked this measure from the NDAA, even  though the Senate unanimously passed a resolution in the fall  instructing the NDAA conferees to support its inclusion. In addition,  Republican leadership removed a related provision in the House-passed  NDAA imposing sanctions on Russian sovereign debt in response to  interference in U.S. elections.   Leader McConnell's decision to block the DETER Act and the House  sanctions on Russian sovereign debt effectively green-lights Russian  interference in future U.S. elections. It is a gift to Russian  President Vladimir Putin and a subversion of the clear desire expressed  by both Chambers of Congress to hold Russia accountable for future  interference. It reinforces Putin's belief that the costs of attacking  our democracy are low and the rewards are great. It is a dereliction of  his duty, as a representative of the people, to protect our Nation from  foreign adversaries. I will continue fighting for the passage of the  DETER Act. The next national election is less than a year away, and we  must make clear to Putin that Russia will pay a steep price if they  interfere in another election.   While I am strongly opposed to some of the provisions in this bill  and disappointed by the omission of others, I believe that, on balance,  the NDAA will strengthen our national security and advance other  important national priorities. For that reason, I voted in support of  final passage.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Yvette Lewis  for her excellent service as part of my team in support of the people  of Maryland. Yvette has been our director of external relations and  community outreach in my Senate office since I began my service in the  Senate. In that capacity, she has organized forums throughout Maryland  to provide support to our veterans, our senior citizens, and others.  Her signature program was organizing consumer protection forums across  our State so we could alert Marylanders to the wide array of schemes  and scams designed to cheat consumers out of their hard-earned money.  She has been deeply committed to the principle that the health of our  entire State depends on the success of all our communities.   I have had the pleasure of knowing Yvette for over a decade and am  grateful for all her good works in our State and beyond. She is a  longtime resident of Bowie, MD, and has worked for years in public  service and civic engagement. She has previously worked as the  president of the Voter Empowerment Action Project. Moreover, she has  also served on the White House Commission for Presidential Scholars.  Additionally, she has an accomplished background in music as an opera  singer and music teacher in Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and  Montgomery county schools. Yvette is married to Ed Lewis, and they have  two children, Shannon and Eric.   Various events have led to a sudden vacancy in the position of the  chair of the Maryland Democratic Party. Yvette was the consensus choice  as the right person for the job at this moment. While we will miss her  on Capitol Hill, I am glad that her enormous talents will also be put  to good use in her new role.                            ____________________
