 Mr. Chairman, before I begin, I want to thank the  chairman, our members, colleagues, and the leadership for being so  understanding.   Tomorrow, I will be heading back to south Florida to be there in case  this horrible storm does head our way. Again, everyone has been  incredibly supportive and shown great solidarity. I am exceedingly  grateful for that.   I rise today to express the strongest possible support for this bill.  I applaud the leadership of Chairman Frelinghuysen for making it  possible to consider it on the floor today.   I would like to highlight some of the vital issues in this bill.   The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related  Agencies division provides $56.5 billion in discretionary budget  authority. That is $1.1 billion below the fiscal year 2017 enacted  level, but it is $8.6 billion above the budget request.    We have targeted transportation and housing funding to essential  investments in safety, infrastructure, and assistance for our most  vulnerable citizens: the elderly; the disabled; and, yes, America's  heroes, our veterans.   We also had to prioritize by reducing or eliminating nonessential  programs and scaling back administrative accounts.   For the Department of Transportation, the bill includes $17.8 billion  in discretionary appropriations and $76.7 billion in total resources.  That includes support for the FAST Act obligation limitations.   The Federal Aviation Administration is funded at $16.6 billion, Mr.  Chairman. We provide this increase to keep advancing NextGen programs  with over $1 billion and to continue to operate the safest, most  complex, most advanced air traffic control system in the world.   The bill reflects FAST Act priorities for highways, rail, and  transit. It includes $45 billion in road and bridge funding from the  highway trust fund, which is almost $1 billion above fiscal year 2017  levels. This funding will provide much-needed improvements to America's  highways and bridges.   The bill provides $2.2 billion to the Federal Railroad Administration  to continue our commitment to rail safety and to make critical  infrastructure investments. This includes FAST Act rail infrastructure  investments to address the state of good repair backlog, which we  really need to address.   As a reflection of tough choices, Mr. Chairman, our funding level for  transit Capital Investment Grants is $600 million below the 2017 level.                                time  1745    But we have, and this is important, included funding and direction to  keep upcoming projects in the pipeline.   For housing programs, we work to ensure that we continue assistance  to our most vulnerable population. The bill includes $38.3 billion for  Department of Housing and Urban Development. The bill also includes  significant increases to keep pace with inflation, almost $1 billion  above last year, for direct rental assistance to maintain, again,  housing for those who are currently served.   Homeless assistance remains a top priority in this bill. We included  funding at the enacted level and well above the budget request.    Mr. Chairman, the bill restores a number of programs  that Members, frankly, from both sides of the aisle made sure that we  were aware of.   The bill restores a number of community development programs that  were proposed for elimination in the budget request, including CDBG and  HOME. Again, we listened to Members from both sides of the aisle, and  we made sure that that was a priority in this bill. These programs,  again, support decisionmaking at the local level where it should be.   Before I close, I want to thank the hardworking and talented staff  who helped put this together, the subcommittee staff. I was going to  read their names, and again, I know I am running out of time, but I  think this is the best staff anywhere in Congress. I also want to thank  my personal staff, my chief of staff, Miguel Mendoza, who is the deputy  chief of staff as well, and from the minority staff, Joe Carlile and  Angela, and so many others who have worked hand-in-hand with my  committee staff. And I would be remiss if I did not, in particular,  thank Mr. Price, the ranking member. He has been great to work with,  work cooperatively. I ask for your favorable support of this bill.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to section 3 of House  Resolution 500, as a designee of Chairman Frelinghuysen, I rise to  offer en bloc No. 2 as part of the consideration of H.R. 3354. The list  of the amendments included in the en bloc is at the desk and has been  agreed to by both sides.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Knight).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    If the gentleman would be all right with that, I  would be willing to agree to his amendment. As long as we can move the  process quickly, I would agree to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, let me thank the gentleman for bringing  up this amendment. He has worked awfully hard, and I am a huge admirer  of his.   Here is the problem: in the committee, we have actually gone line by  line to identify cuts in salaries and expenses at HUD and DOT, and as a  result, most administrative accounts are at or below the 2017 levels.  By the way, that is one of the ways that we achieved $1.1 billion in  savings, again, below the 2017 budget.   When you do it across the board, it could affect safety programs, it  could actually have unintended consequences. So while I am grateful for  the chairman's hard work, I would urge a ``no'' vote at this time, and  I look forward to continuing to work with the gentleman to make sure  that his concerns are addressed in this bill and in future bills.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he may consume  to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment. This Essential Air Service program ensures that  small and rural communities have access to the national air  transportation system. The program is vital to small businesses and  farming communities and rural communities and rural entrepreneurs.   So the amendment would cut off air service to many rural communities  and would put economies of many of our small towns potentially at risk.  I thank the gentleman for his passion, but I would urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman for  bringing this up. This is something that I have got to give a lot of  credit to the ranking member as well. This is a program that we are  very familiar with. I look forward to working with the Member from  Michigan on a program that I think a lot of us support, clearly I  support, and the ranking member supports. I want to thank him for  bringing it up.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for bringing  this up. This is something he has done a lot of work on and he knows  this issue very, very well. I think this is a well-done amendment. I  welcome the amendment, and I wholeheartedly support it.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, let's first get one thing straight:  This is a cut in infrastructure investment, authorized by the FAST Act,  which was passed by this body by a vote of 359-65. It is an authorized  program in the FAST Act. This is not, by any stretch of the  imagination, an earmark.   This amendment proposes a cut of $474 million from the Federal  Railroad Administration State of Good Repair program. This program was  created to address the state of good repair backlog in our intercity  rail transportation system. That backlog, by itself, is estimated to be  at a whopping $38 billion.   This program replaces or, frankly, rehabilitates any publicly owned  or Amtrak-owned infrastructure and will ensure intercity rail service  is safe, reliable, and ready to support economic and population growth.  It is not, by any stretch of the imagination, an earmark. It is an  authorized program.   Now, let me address the funding shift. Again, I respect the  gentleman, but I respectfully oppose what the gentleman is proposing.   We have already allocated significant resources to the new search  program, which I support, consistent, again, with the President's  request. We have chosen to allocate funding for other projects,  consistent with the wills of Congress of this House with the FAST Act  that benefit both commuter and passenger rail and make significant  returns on investment for our country, particularly, by the way, for  our economy.   So we are funding transit infrastructure to get our economy moving,  literally. And, as a nation, we have to address our critical  infrastructure assets, which is why this was authorized by Congress in  the FAST Act--I repeat.   This amendment would undermine that effort, so I would respectfully  urge a ``no'' vote on the gentleman's amendment.    I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Lance).    Mr. Chairman, as the designee of Chairman  Frelinghuysen, pursuant to section 3 of House Resolution 500, I move to  strike the last word for the purpose of debate.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Nadler).    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. King).    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana  (Mr. Visclosky), the ranking member of the Defense Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, I think we know this issue. I  strongly oppose the amendment, and I would urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would shut down, as we  have heard, all 15 of Amtrak's long-distance routes and all 28 State- supported routes.   Now, let me tell you, the gentleman from Alabama is absolutely very  consistent, he is sincere about trying to reduce the Federal deficit,  and I commend him for that.   Now, here is the problem. This amendment results not in savings but  in increased costs of $423 million. I want to repeat that. This  amendment would have the effect of increasing costs by $423 million. It  would stop all revenues associated with the national network  immediately, but costs would continue to accrue for years, and in  addition, some costs that were paid for from the national network  account would now simply be shifted to the Northeast corridor account.   So, for instance, assets that are shared by both long distance and  Northeast corridor, like stations or tracks, are funded under each  account proportionally. These costs that were formerly paid by the  national network would still need to be paid. So, again, this amendment  actually costs more money.  [[Page H7050]]    I know that, obviously, is not the intent, because I know the  gentleman from Alabama, and I can say that, is absolutely sincere.   This is something that we have to realize. This bill is not just  arbitrary decisions. We held hearings, and we carefully scrubbed each  account to make sure that the reductions that we made were responsible  and that they were actually going to result in reductions.   So, again, this is not the right way to do it. This would actually  increase costs. It is not prudent to eliminate an entire transportation  option.   By the way, furthermore in this case, as I mentioned before, it would  actually cost even more so to do so. So I would respectfully urge a  ``no'' vote.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he would consume  to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    I want to thank the gentleman for bringing this  issue up and just let him know that we are ready to accept his  amendment. So if he would just yield back, I will accept this  amendment. I want to thank the gentleman for bringing it up.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, let me first reassure the gentlewoman  that I support the mission of Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation. As  a matter of fact, this bill that we are on provides $140 million, the  same amount that was provided in 2017. We are not rolling that back at  all.   The reduction from FY16, however, reflects the elimination of the  National Foreclosure and Mitigation Counseling program. Now, this  program was to be a 1-year program when it began in 2007 in response  to, obviously, the foreclosure crisis at the time. Again, this 1-year  program then continued on for 9 years.   Now, recognizing that the economy improved, obviously, significantly,  and foreclosure numbers continued to decline, Congress discontinued the  NFMC program, again, in fiscal year 2017. In fact, the prior  administration proposed elimination of the NFMC in its budget request  for the very same reason.   So in 2016--let's put this in perspective. Foreclosure filings were  at a 10-year low and declined to 14 percent below the 2015 level. The  foreclosure rate has stayed within a historically normal range for 3  years. So, further, the NRC has integrated foreclosure mitigation  counseling into its other counseling programs, eliminating the need for  a separate program. So, again, you know, we scrubbed these accounts.  For those reasons, I respectfully would urge a ``no'' vote on this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, we have scrubbed this bill for savings  in overhead and administration, and I want to thank the gentleman for  always bringing up these important issues. We have funded vouchers at a  level that meets HUD's commitment to those currently receiving  assistance, many of whom are elderly and disabled. I know obviously  that is not what the gentleman is going after, or both. But again, we  scrubbed this bill, and we think that the funding is where it needs to  be at this stage. I would respectfully urge a ``no'' vote on this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he may consume  to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's concern,  and I look forward to working with him and also with HUD to address  this issue, and I want to thank him for bringing this up.   Mr. Chair, I accept the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would cut funding as  was explained to what I believe is a vital HUD program that houses 1.2  million low- and very low-income households across the country. Now, a  majority of those households include folks with either disabilities or,  frankly, folks who are elderly. The average household income is less  than $12,000.   This funding level would not allow HUD to renew all expiring housing  contracts with private owners. It also would cause some other issues of  instability in that program, that platform, and it could cause housing  providers to leave the program.   The gentleman has, I think, some very valid points about some of his  concerns with all of these government programs. I just don't think this  is the right way to do it.   Mr. Chair, again, I would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept this  amendment. If the gentlewoman is willing to yield back the balance of  her time, I am more than willing to accept her amendment. I want to  thank the gentlewoman for bringing it up.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, we have taken a responsible and  thorough approach to HUD's funding. We have actually reduced HUD's  budget by $487 million below last year. We have done so while keeping  as a priority, for example, housing assistance to the most needy among  us: the elderly, the disabled, our veterans. This amendment would  potentially hurt some of these vulnerable citizens.   Again, the across-the-board approach goes against, frankly, what I  think we  [[Page H7060]]  have to be doing in government, which is do the tough work and go line  by line and identify lower priority or functioning programs for  reductions so that we can then target resources to where they are  actually most needed.   Let me just give you a few examples, Mr. Chairman, of where we have  targeted resources: CDBG, veterans' voucher renewals, vouchers for the  disabled. I cannot agree to an amendment that would, again, cut those  programs across the board.   Also, another issue, which I know is not the Honorable Member's  intent, but I understand CBO has scored this amendment at zero savings.  If we had a lot of time, we could talk about why. So, again, it is  actually not even achieving what the gentleman is trying to achieve.   I do thank him for his passion in looking out for the taxpayers. I  think that is a very needed thing here in Congress. But I respectfully  urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
