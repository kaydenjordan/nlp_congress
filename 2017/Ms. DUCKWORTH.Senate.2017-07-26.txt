 Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Casey's  motion protecting people with disabilities.    Mr. President, I speak in support of Senator Casey's  motion protecting people with disabilities.   It is appalling that the Republican Party is working to strip  healthcare from the disability community on the very anniversary of the  day when we passed monumental legislation that improved the lives of  Americans with disabilities.   It was 27 years ago that the Americans with Disabilities Act--one of  the most important pieces of legislation of our time--was signed into  law, and it is a shame that as we celebrate our great achievement for  equality, we are moving backward rather than building on the progress  our community has worked so hard on to make it so Americans with  disabilities can live healthy, productive, independent lives. We cannot  afford to move backward, and I will not sit quietly by and let that  happen and neither will my constituents.   I have heard from thousands of Illinoisans who are struggling to  understand why lawmakers are considering ripping away the care that is  keeping them alive and allowing them to be independent and productive  members of our community. I want to share just one of their stories  with you.   It is about a woman by the name of Jessica Baker, from Mascoutah, IL.  Nearly 10 years ago, when she was a healthy and young 19-year-old, her  entire life changed. Jessica was driving on the highway on a foggy  morning. Because of the lack of visibility on the road, a truckdriver  ahead of her ran through two cars. Jessica, just feet behind the truck,  never saw the brake light go off. She struck that semi-truck and became  part of a 20-car pileup. This young, healthy woman's life completely  changed in an instant.   Jessica is now 29 years old and is a quadriplegic. She depends on  Medicaid for her healthcare needs. She is living an independent life  and has done well under the ACA. Now she fears she will lose her care  that the law has helped her to receive. Jessica was a healthy, vital  person whose life changed in an instant.   I understand how that feels. I went from being a soldier--one of the  most physically fit people among my peers--to becoming wheelchair  bound. So many of our brave men and women take that risk every single  day, and we must be completely honest with ourselves as any American's  life can change in the blink of an eye. The healthy can become sick,  and the able-bodied can become disabled in a single moment. Any one of  us can end up at the mercy of our healthcare system.   After her accident, Jessica had to fight for her life and relearn how  to live as a thriving young person. Now Senate Republicans and  President Trump are threatening her life by eliminating her access to  care. As proud as I am to be a part of the Senate Chamber, which passed  the monumental ADA, I am also appalled by what the Republicans in this  body are doing today.   Yesterday's vote to proceed on a debate on a bill that would rob tens  of millions of their health insurance is utterly shameful. It would  jeopardize a program that 1 in 10 veterans, 2 out of 3 nursing home  residents, and children with autism, Down syndrome, and special needs  depend on. That is simply unacceptable. Senate Republicans have done  everything they can to hide their legislation from the American people,  crafting it in secret, behind closed doors. However, one thing remains  clear; that the fight to protect healthcare is not over.   This is the time for the American people to keep speaking up, to make  their voices heard, and Senate Republicans must listen. They must  listen to their constituents and to the most vulnerable among us, like  the members of the disability community who have been here day after  day, literally, fighting for their lives. Day after day, I see people  who come into my office who say: Save me. Save my child. Save our  lives.   That is why I am working every single day to not only push back  against these Republican efforts to strip away care from those who need  it the most  [[Page S4262]]  but also to bring people together on commonsense improvements to our  current healthcare system. We cannot be a nation that says: If you are  sick or ill, we are going to leave you behind. That is simply not who  we are. We are the greatest democracy on the face of the Earth, and we  do not leave our most vulnerable behind.   Thank you.
