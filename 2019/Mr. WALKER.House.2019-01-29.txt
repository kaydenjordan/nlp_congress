 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  introduce extraneous material into the Record on the topic of this  Special Order.    Madam Speaker, tonight is a reminder of exactly whose  House this belongs to. We hear much in the political circles as far as  who makes the call and who gets to speak when. Today, customarily, is a  very unique and special day had our President not been disinvited.   Well, tonight we will have a few Members speaking on the importance  of hearing from the Members that Americans have elected to talk about  the issues of the past 2 years, and some of the things that we need to  accomplish over the next couple of years.   We have some wonderful speakers this afternoon and this evening, to  be able to share some of the topics that are important to our  constituents as well as to all Americans.   The first speaker I would like to introduce to you is Mr.   Mike  Johnson, who represents the Fourth District of Louisiana, and is  currently leading the largest caucus in all of Congress as chairman of  the Republican Study Committee.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his wonderful  words of wisdom and inspiration.   A lot of times in the House, we hear politicians say, even throughout  our State, that we are doing things for the people. And I guess, to  some degree, some of that is okay. But for us to be successful, I think  we have to get back to the place that we are doing things with the  people. No one embodies that more in the House than past chairman and  ranking member of Ways and Means, Mr. Kevin Brady.   In taking a moment of personal privilege here, I get a chance to meet  lots of figures: lots of politicians, lots of Presidents, kings, and  queens throughout this country--and throughout this world, actually-- but few people I have ever met who carried the servant spirit and the  servant heart more than our top Republican on Ways and Means.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady),  proudly representing Texas' Eighth District.    Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking Republican on our Ways  and Means Committee, Kevin Brady, for the wonderful service that he  continues to display not just to the good people of the Lone Star  State, but to all Americans.   We had a lot of retirements this past election, but not all the  adults left the building. We have a wonderful veteran and former Korean  veteran--actually, OB/GYN doctor, who delivered nearly 5,000 babies-- the ranking member, past chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. I  ask Phil Roe from Tennessee to share a few things on his heart; because  there are few people who have had his experience level, and I believe  it would behoove us all to listen to the words of wisdom from Mr. Phil  Roe.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. David P.  Roe).    Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. Phil Roe for sharing. The  gentleman is one of the heroes around here. He not only talks the talk,  but he walks the walk.   Speaking of somebody who walks the walk, that is  Dan Crenshaw from  Texas' Second District, a 10-year Navy veteran, a lieutenant commander.  He is one bad dude. I would probably use a different expression, but my  mother may be watching at this particular time.   ``Saturday Night Live'' made him famous, but his work already has put  him out as one of our leaders. It is my privilege to introduce and to  hear from the former lieutenant commander.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas, Mr.  Dan  Crenshaw.    What a privilege it is for me to serve with Lieutenant  Commander  Dan Crenshaw, two Bronze Stars a Purple Heart. He has  sacrificed much for this country and serves with honor and integrity.   Speaking of service, somebody who serves next door to my district in  North Carolina is the past chairwoman and top Republican on our  Education and Labor Committee. If there is anyone who works any harder  among the 434, 435 Members, I have not met that person yet. It is my  privilege to honor and to acknowledge her.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina, Ms.  Virginia Foxx.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Foxx for sharing  her heart and our continued pro-Israel stance.   There are few who would be able to speak more to that issue than one  of our two Jewish Members in the House, the co-chair of the House  Republican Israeli Caucus and an Iraqi war veteran. Some would say he  has three beautiful daughters, but I think he just married well and has  two children. He serves on our Foreign Affairs Committee and is a  classmate of mine from the 114th Congress. It is my privilege to  introduce and to hear from him.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York, Mr. Lee  Zeldin.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, you can see why Representative Lee Zeldin is  thought so highly of in the United States House of Congress. I  appreciate his remarks and, even more, his passion.   When we talk about going through some tough things in life, I don't  believe there is anyone that I know who can relate to the journey that  our whip, Representative   Steve Scalise, has been through.   I will never forget getting word that Thursday, and we did not know  for sure whether Representative Scalise would actually make it through  the day, but somehow he did. The thing that I remembered most is his  gift with policy. There are lots of things that he does well. The thing  that I will always remember is how he let his faith shine through all  of this darkness.   I yield to Louisiana's finest and our whip, Representative   Steve  Scalise.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Whip, Representative   Steve  Scalise, for his example and courage in standing up for what is right  and true.   Many Members whom I have run across in this House are studious in  their work, but I don't know of any more than Representative Gary  Palmer.   In this town, there is probably a dinner every night somewhere. Mr.  Palmer chooses to take his time going back to his office, preparing for  the next day, constantly reading and staying informed.   I was born in the State that he represents. I lived there only 6  months. We have a mutual love for the Crimson Tide. It is my privilege  to acknowledge and yield to Representative Gary Palmer from Alabama.    Madam Speaker, as I enter my fifth year serving in these  hallowed Halls, I am still in awe of the sacred duty we have been  given. We are truly the people's House. However, I believe that the  people's House should give a voice to every single American, including  the unborn.   This past Congress, we were able to pass, in the House, two major  bills protecting life. The Born-Alive Protection Act and the Pain- Capable Child Protection Act both affirmed the humanity of the unborn  and our firm belief that they are worthy of protection. Sadly, these  bills were not taken up in the Senate, and with the new Democratic-led  House, their future is uncertain.   But each January gives us hope. It is a critical time to talk about  the importance of life and what it means to all Americans. Not only  does the beginning of the year bring new goals and ambitions, but it  contains important events that celebrate life, justice, and human  potential.   Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., whose life we recently celebrated, knew  this potential. He said that any person cannot succeed if he or she is  willing to ``sacrifice the future of his children for immediate  personal comfort.'' He also professed the value and hope of every  single human life.   We also witnessed tens of thousands of marchers just recently  arriving from all across America to march and boldly speak for those  who can't speak for themselves.   Last week, we saw what my friend Benjamin Watson says is a ``sad and  evil day.'' Throughout history, there are pivotal moments that sober us  up to the point of engagement. Such a moment happened 1 week ago as we  watched the New York State Assembly celebrate expanding the path for  late-term abortions in their State.   Mr. Watson said this: ``It is a sad and evil day when the murder of  our most innocent and vulnerable is celebrated with such overwhelming  exuberance.''   This law allows for abortion up to birth, practically without limits.  It authorizes the legal murder of a fully viable human baby. This is  what was being celebrated. This is why the Freedom Tower was lit bright  pink on a cold winter's night.   That celebration is now seared into our Nation's conscience, and many  are now realizing, more than ever, that we should not, that we must  not, that we cannot look the other way. Even our sleeping churches are  beginning to awaken to this just and righteous cause.   New York already faces a cataclysm. In New York City, more than 500  abortions are performed for every 1,000 births. These numbers are more  staggering for African American babies, more of whom are now aborted  than actually born.   The Governor of New York has even suggested that those who are pro- life are not--and get this--welcome in his State.   I support federalism and the idea that New York can make its own laws  for New York. My question is not a legal one, but a moral one. How long  will our American society allow this injustice? Can we expect the new  House Democratic majority to continue down this path? Will there be  consequences?   As my friend Kay Cole James likes to say: ``The right to life is the  most fundamental of all civil rights.''    To revive the American Dream, we must reclaim America's soul. That  means standing with the majority of the American people who reject the  Federal funding abortions; that means putting the life and health of  women and babies ahead of the desires of abortion giants like Planned  Parenthood.   But in many cases, we must also regain our credibility in valuing the  birth at all stages of life. Do we care--tough question. Do we care, 20  weeks after the baby is born, as much as we value the baby 20 weeks  before birth?   In closing, Mark Twain said this: The two most important days are  when you are born and when you find out why. How many babies, how many  children will never get to discover either?   Please continue to stand for those who have no voice. In the name  that is everything just, never stop raising yours.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
