 Mr. Speaker, what happened today on this floor was a  massive tax break for the wealthiest people in our country.   Over half of the tax dollars will go to people in the upper 1 percent  of the income strata. The big pot of gold at the end is eliminating the  inheritance tax by the year 2024, so that the heirs of the richest will  get millions and hundreds of millions and billions in tax relief.   This bill should have been geared toward the middle class. The middle  class is getting tip change from a cheap restaurant, while the  millionaires and billionaires are getting away with no AMT tax, changed  rates at the top, and inheritance tax changes.   They get the money. The middle class gets shafted. It is a con job.  It is a shame.                            ____________________
