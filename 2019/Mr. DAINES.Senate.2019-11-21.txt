 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Parker Walter of Madison County for his extraordinary  bravery in the face of danger.   In late September, the American Red Cross awarded 6-year-old Parker  Walter with a Certificate of Extraordinary Personal Action from their  National Lifesaving Award Program. This was the first time in 20 years  that a Montanan has received the distinguished Lifesaving Award from  the American Red Cross. Parker heroically saved his 4-year-old brother  Cooper from drowning when he slipped into a rushing irrigation ditch  behind their home. Parker immediately screamed out to his mother and  grandmother to alert them and quickly ran over to pull his younger  [[Page S6753]]  brother from the ditch. Parker's swift action and response saved  Cooper's life.   It is my honor to recognize Parker for his incredible lifesaving  action. Parker has made all of Montana proud for his bravery.                            ____________________
