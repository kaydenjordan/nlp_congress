 Mr. Chairman, back home, all Texans agree the 10 most  terrifying words and the biggest lie people can hear is ``I'm from the  Federal Government, and I'm here to help.''   On that viewpoint, H.R. 1, which is called the For the People Act,  should be called the ``For the Big Government Act'' or, more  accurately, the ``Big Lie Act.''   Texas 22 does not want to have $6 of Federal tax dollars given to  subsidize small donors and match every dollar they raise. They prefer  that $6 of their money be used for new roads, deeper ports, Border  Patrol, safe schools, and hurricane prevention.   Texas is being swarmed by Californians. They are coming for jobs, a  low State income tax--zero--and a friendly environment for businesses.  Just like we don't want a tax on plastic straws, Texans sure as heck  don't want to follow California's same-day registration.   I ask my colleagues, respect the Constitution, respect the 10th  Amendment, respect States' rights, and vote against this terrible bill.
