 Mr. Speaker, today, we, unfortunately, are enduring our  government's second longest government shutdown since 1981.   I realize that some call it a partial government shutdown, but let me  tell you, there is nothing partial about the lost wages that our  Federal workers are encountering, there is nothing partial about the  lost income that our small business owners are enduring, and there is  nothing partial about the lost services that my farmers in the salad  bowl of the world will experience during this shutdown.   That is why it has fallen on all of us in this Congress to make whole  the victims of the shutdown. And it starts today by passing this  Agriculture Appropriations act.   As a member of the House Agriculture Committee, I was proud to have  passed and have signed into law the 2018 farm bill. But if this  shutdown doesn't end soon, there are many provisions of that farm bill  that will not be implemented.   Why? The USDA is closed, the Farm Service Agency is shuttered,  agricultural research is suspended, organic certification programs are  stopped, and families may not get their benefits through the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.   Those are just part of the problems with this partial government  shutdown, a shutdown in which all of our farmers will be affected. That  is why all of us in this government must do our job and live up to our  responsibility to govern. Some may call it a charade. We call it  governing. That is why I ask my colleagues to pass this Agriculture  Appropriations Act.
