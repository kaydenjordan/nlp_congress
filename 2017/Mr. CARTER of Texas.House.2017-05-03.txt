 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this  legislation. The Homeland Security division of this bill contains $42.4  billion to fund the Department of Homeland Security. This amount  includes $1.5 billion in additional funding as proposed by the  President in his budget amendment. That is the largest boost to border  security funding in nearly a decade. This bill is a sizable down  payment on our promise to secure our borders, enforce our immigration  laws, and keep our citizens safe.   This bill includes 39,324 detention beds, an increase of more than  5,000 over the previous number. This additional capacity will allow our  immigration officials to end catch and release once and for all. Forty  miles of upgraded fencing are in this bill. This upgraded barrier will  stem the flow of drugs, smugglers, and illegal immigrants across our  border, and give our Border Patrol agents the time they need to make an  arrest.   Also included is $87 million of enhanced surveillance and radars so  Border Patrol agents can more effectively detect illegal crossings, 26  miles of new road construction, and 758 miles of road improvements. I  hear time and again from our agents on the border that they not only  need to detect illegal crossings, they must reach them to arrest them.  These roads will literally pave the way toward that effort.   Here in Washington, people talk about border security and  immigration. In Texas, we live it every day. We must get this problem  under control. I am confident that with the support of President Trump  and my colleagues in the House and Senate, we will bring sanity and the  rule of law back to our borders. This bill is a vital step. I urge its  passage.   I thank Lucille Roybal-Allard, my ranking member, and both the  majority and minority staffs for their hard work on this bill.
