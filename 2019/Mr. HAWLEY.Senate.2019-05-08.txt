 Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Committee  on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my privilege to recognize  a family-owned small business that is dedicated to its customers,  employees, and community. In honor of the U.S. Small Business  Administration's National Small Business Week, it is my pleasure to  name Burgers' Smokehouse of California, MO, as the Senate Small  Business of the Day.   Burgers' Smokehouse began in 1927 with E.M. Burger, a man who decided  to use his mother's recipe to start curing hams for himself. Though  this was a time with limited potential for a meat business, Burger sold  six hams in his first year and then doubled to 12 hams in his second  year. From there, E.M. Burger started employing the help of his family  to grow his business to its official launch in 1952 when they opened  their first ``Ham House'' in California, MO. This opening would lead  them to become the first country cured meat company in the United  States to receive Federal inspection just 4 years later in 1956 which  allowed them to ship meat between State borders.   Today, Burgers' Smokehouse is now operated by the third and fourth  generation of the Burger family and has become one of the Nation's  leading provider of cured meats. Burgers' Smokehouse now employs over  200 people and operates two locations, the original ``Ham House'' in  California, and a newly opened second facility in Springfield, MO. The  company distributes over 12 million pounds of products each year and  supplies restaurants such as Bob Evans, Cracker Barrel, and Waffle  House. This success was not only due to the quality of their product,  but also to the utilization of the latest technology. Burgers'  Smokehouse has been recognized in several magazines and newspapers for  the cutting-edge innovations used in their production and food safety  processes.   In addition to the excellence within Burgers' Smokehouse's walls, the  Burger family is intentional about being excellent to those outside of  their walls. Employees participate yearly in the Moniteau County Relay  for Life. Burgers' Smokehouse has raised over $100,000 to help fight  cancer through this effort. In 2006, Burgers' Smokehouse also sent care  packages, which included some of their sandwiches, to U.S. soldiers  overseas. Today, they still offer free shipping to anyone who will  place an order to a military post. Aside from Burgers' Smokehouse's  direct charity, the Burger family also set up a foundation under E.M.  Burger's name, the founder of Burgers' Smokehouse. This foundation  specializes in gifts to the arts and education and frequently gives  grants to the Moniteau County school system.   Burgers' Smokehouse embodies the traits of a true family-owned  business. Armed only with his mother's recipe, E.M. Burger sold just  six hams in his first year. Ninety-two years later, the third and  fourth generations of the Burger family operate his legacy selling over  600,000 hams a year to people all over the country. As a result of the  hard work this family and their employees have put in, Burgers'  Smokehouse has been the recipient of numerous awards and visited by  President Eisenhower, Hank Williams, Jr., and Johnny Carson. It is my  distinct pleasure to honor Burgers' Smokehouse as the Senate Small  Business of the Day. You make Missouri proud, and I look forward to  watching your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
