 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr.  Robert Costrell, professor of education reform and economics and  endowed chair in education accountability at the University of  Arkansas, who is retiring in December.   Dr. Costrell dedicated his career to improving education as a scholar  and public policy adviser. He served in major policy roles to three  Massachusetts Governors. In addition, his leadership has been valuable  at the national level where he served in several roles to improve  education. In 2001, he was appointed by U.S. Secretary of Education Rod  Paige to serve on the Advisory Council on Education Statistics, and in  2008, he was appointed by Secretary Margaret Spellings to serve on the  National Technical Advisory Council. For his contributions to education  finance and public pensions, Dr. Costrell was honored with the Steven  D. Gold Award in 2020.   He demonstrates the same passion for education as a champion for  Israel. Dr. Costrell is a leading voice in Arkansas for advancing  policies supporting our friend and ally. He has helped educate citizens  and leaders at all levels of government about the importance of a  strong U.S.-Israeli relationship. His advocacy is especially important  today as Israel is under attack by terrorists. As Dr. Costrell would  tell us, Israel has a right to defend itself and secure the safety of  its people. The U.S. must continue to support Israel through these  difficult times.   While Dr. Costrell may be retiring from academia, it is not likely he  will slow down. I am confident he will continue to be a vocal supporter  of Israel's right to exist and fight to ensure we deliver on our  promise to our ally.   I applaud Dr. Costrell for his tremendous career helping shape  education policy and setting the stage for success for future  generations. I am also grateful for his significant impact in Arkansas  and in Washington, DC, as a strong advocate for Israel. I appreciate  his friendship and example. I wish him well as he begins a new  chapter.                            ____________________
