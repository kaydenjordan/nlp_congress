 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Like my great colleague from the great State of Texas, I love  America, but I want to know: Why does it seem like some want America to  fail this test? We should all be rooting for America's success in its  fight against COVID-19.   President Trump has overseen the unprecedented Operation Warp Speed,  an effort to develop and disseminate a vaccine in record-breaking time.   We learned this week that one vaccine in particular shows great  promise. Thanks to President Trump, the U.S. will have access to the  vaccine immediately if it proves effective.   Nothing like this has ever been done before, and if successful, this  President's achievement will be a defining moment in American history.   We have already developed lifesaving antiviral treatments that have  caused America's fatality rate to plummet.   Together, we can defeat this virus. We must fight it with science and  facts and leave fear behind.   Madam Speaker, I believe in America, and I ask all of my colleagues  to stand up and support our President during this present crisis.
