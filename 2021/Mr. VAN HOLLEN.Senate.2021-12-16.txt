 Mr. President, I rise to speak on the National  Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2022.   The National Defense Authorization Act provides crucial resources for  our Armed Forces and our national defense, including a 2.7 percent pay  increase for our servicemembers and DOD civilian employees, parental  and bereavement leave for servicemembers, and the creation of basic  needs allowance. I am glad that the Senate was able to come together on  a bipartisan basis to pass this legislation to support our  servicemembers, strengthen our national security, and invest in  critical projects in my home State of Maryland, including over $500  million in authorized military construction projects across the State.  This legislation also includes several important pieces of legislation  that I introduced to strengthen our Foreign Service, ensure that all  students have a fair shot at attending one of our Federal service  academies, and support our Federal firefighters. While there are parts  of this legislation that I have concerns with and important priorities  that were left out, I believe that, on balance, this bill serves our  national interest.   In particular, I am pleased that this NDAA includes the Foreign  Service Families Act of 2021, which I introduced with Senator Sullivan,  with whom I cochair the Foreign Service Caucus. As the son of a Foreign  Service Officer, I know the challenges that Foreign Service families  face in accessing education and employment when they accompany our  diplomats abroad. That is why I introduced this legislation, which  authorizes expanded employment services for the spouses of Foreign  Service officers serving overseas. It also extends in-state tuition at  public colleges and universities for Foreign Service members and their  families after 30 days of residency in a State and allows Foreign  Service families to terminate leases without penalty when ordered to  move for work. This legislation will make a real difference in the  lives of our Foreign Service families and will help reduce attrition  and attract the talented and diverse diplomatic workforce we need to  compete on the global stage. It is modeled after benefits we extend to  military families, who also have to move frequently in service to our  country.   I am also glad that this legislation includes the SERVE Act, which I  introduced with Senator Cardin and Representative Brown. This bill  ensures that high school students applying to attend one of our Federal  service academies do not lose out on opportunities to be nominated  because of a vacancy in Congress. After the tragic loss of my friend  and colleague, Representative Elijah Cummings, my office learned that  nomination slots at our service academies, like the U.S. Naval Academy  in Annapolis, cease to exist if a seat in Congress is vacant at the  time nominations are due. This meant that a student from Congressman  Cummings' district had one-third fewer opportunities to receive a  nomination to a service academy. As a result of this new law, Senators  may make nominations on behalf of a vacant seat, ensuring that students  do not lose an opportunity to serve their country through no fault of  their own.   Further, I am glad Armed Services Committee agreed to include the  Federal Firefighter Flexibility and Fairness Act, which I introduced  with Senators Tester, Collins, and Carper and Representatives Sarbanes  and Wittman. This legislation grants additional  [[Page S9255]]  flexibility to our Federal firefighters that their State and local  counterparts have enjoyed for many years. As a result of this bill,  Federal firefighters will be able to trade shifts across pay periods  without negatively affecting their pay.   This NDAA also establishes a consortium on irregular warfare threats,  a critical step in the transfer of the National Consortium for the  Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism--START--from the  sponsorship of the Department of Homeland Security to the Department of  Defense, which has the resources to maintain this national security  research. I previously worked to secure funding for this transition in  the FY21 defense appropriations bill. The National Consortium for the  Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, better known as START,  is a university-based research and education center based at the  University of Maryland and comprised of an international network of  scholars committed to the scientific study of the causes and human  consequences of terrorism in the United States and around the world.   I am also glad the NDAA incorporates the Enhancing Military Base  Resilience and Conserving Ecosystems through Stormwater Management Act,  which I introduced with Senators Kaine, Cardin, and Warner. This bill  authorizes the Defense Department to carry out stormwater management  projects on military installations. These projects will improve  installation resilience and essential infrastructure that supports  military installations and protect nearby waterways like the Chesapeake  Bay. In August, I worked to secure language in the FY22 Military  Construction-VA Appropriations bill encouraging the Department of  Defense to use Energy Resilience and Conservation Program funds to  support stormwater management projects in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  in order to better protect and conserve the health of the bay.   I also want to thank my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services  Committee for working with me to address the Army's incorrect  application of the law pertaining to the Prisoner of War Medal, which  has negatively affected a Maryland veteran. In 2020, I asked the Army  to award the POW Medal to Marylander Ronald Dolecki for his military  service in Ethiopia in 1965, which he has been denied for over a  decade. Mr. Dolecki clearly qualifies for the Medal under the criteria  established by Congress in the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act,  but the Army continued to incorrectly apply the previous standard to  his case. I am grateful to Chairman Reed and Ranking Member Inhofe for  including language directing the Army to rectify its incorrect  application of the law to ensure that this Marylander who served his  country with honor and distinction and others like him are  appropriately recognized.   Lastly, this bill includes funding and language that is critical to  supporting Maryland's military installations, including more than $350  million for Fort Meade, more than $150 million for Walter Reed National  Military Medical Center, and more than $30 million for Joint Base  Andrews. The bill also includes report language ensuring the Army's  continued support for the demolition of contaminated facilities at  Aberdeen Proving Ground and provisions to continue responding to the  recent crisis in privatized military housing which affected  installations in Maryland and across the country.   While I am pleased with many of the provisions included in this bill  and voted for its passage, I do have significant reservations.   I appreciate that this bill codifies the GAO's recommendations  related to tactical vehicle rollover accidents in response to the  tragic loss of lLT Conor McDowell, a U.S. marine who lost his life in a  training accident at Camp Pendleton. 1LT McDowell showed extraordinary  bravery, saving the life of a fellow marine, and Congress has a  responsibility to ensure that these preventable crashes end. The bill  also includes a directive that the Department of Defense report on the  cost and feasibility of a pilot program that Senators Cardin and  Representatives Brown and Wittman and I proposed in the the 1LT Hugh  Conor McDowell Safety in Armed Forces Equipment Act of 2021. This  simple, straightforward bill directs the Departments of the Army and  the Navy to jointly implement a 5-year pilot program to evaluate the  prospect of using data recorders to monitor, assess, and improve the  readiness and safety of the operation of military tactical vehicles.  This commonsense program will improve the safety of our men and women  in uniform and save lives. I believe we could have proceeded with this  pilot today, but look forward to receiving the mandated report no later  than March 1, 2022, as directed, and I will continue to advocate  vigorously for the implementation of this program.   I am disappointed that the NOAA does not include my amendment to  prohibit the use of funds for the research and development, production  or deployment of the nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile--SLCM- N--and its associated nuclear warhead. The United States already  possesses an array of nonstrategic nuclear capabilities that fulfill  our theater nuclear deterrence missions and reassure our allies of our  extended deterrence commitments. In its 2019 cost estimate of U.S.  nuclear weapons programs, the CBO projected that the SLCM-N would cost  $9 billion through 2028. This projection does not account for  production costs after 2028, nor does it factor in costs associated  with integrating the missile on ships, nuclear weapons training for  personnel, and storage and security for nuclear warheads on naval  bases. Not only is the program a waste of money, it will also  dangerously raise the risk of nuclear miscalculation and escalation.   I also believe that this bill fails to tackle the long-term budget  challenges facing our country. In the midst of a pandemic that has  taken the lives of more than 800,000 of our fellow Americans, we simply  cannot afford to continue this level of investment in defense at the  expense of other critical national priorities. I oppose the decision to  invest an additional $25 billion over the President's budget request  for defense while we continue to underinvest in diplomacy, development,  and a wide range of critical domestic priorities.   Lastly, I am disappointed that the bill did not include my amendment  with Representative Jacobs to close a loophole that allows some U.S.  security assistance to foreign forces without being subject to Leahy  law restrictions that bar U.S. military assistance to units credibly  believed to have engaged in gross violations of human rights. This is a  simple, straightforward matter of the United States living up to our  most basic commitments as a member of the international community. The  accompanying NDAA report language does require the presentation of a  report detailing the processes through which the Defense Department  seeks to ensure that consideration is given to any credible information  relating to violations of human rights by such entities, before support  is given to them. I will be reviewing that report closely to determine  what further action is necessary to safeguard human rights and ensure  that no U.S. security assistance is exempt from these commonsense  restrictions.   While I am opposed to some of the provisions in this bill and  disappointed by the omission of others, I believe that, on balance, the  NDAA will strengthen our national security and advance other important  national priorities. For that reason, I voted in support of final  passage.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an  extraordinary leader, a visionary healthcare advocate, and a tireless  champion for the people of my state and for citizens across the  National Capital Region: Maria Gomez. Ms. Gomez is retiring this month  after 33 years as the president and CEO of Mary's Center, a renowned  federally-qualified health center that she founded in 1988, and which  has transformed the lives of countless individuals and families  throughout our region. Her tireless efforts to improve the health and  well-being of underserved families and individuals in the Washington,  DC, metropolitan area have left an indelible mark on our communities,  and her lifetime of service has inspired a new generation of activists,  advocates, healthcare leaders, and public servants. I would like to  share her story today and have the course of her life forever written  into the Congressional Record.   Ms. Gomez immigrated to the United States from Colombia with her  mother  [[Page S9257]]  at age 13 to escape violence and find new opportunities. Together, they  built a life in Washington, DC, through hard work, courage, and the  determination to succeed. By means of her own grit and skill, along  with the support of a loving mother, Ms. Gomez obtained a bachelor of  science in nursing from Georgetown University and a master of public  health from the University of California at Berkeley. Following  graduation, she returned to the District of Columbia to empower the  very same community that had empowered her when she first arrived in  the United States.   After first working at DC Health, the Red Cross, and the Visiting  Nurses Association, Ms. Gomez founded Mary's Center with a group of  health advocates and the DC Mayor's Office on Latino Affairs. Her goal  was to help immigrant women fleeing war and poverty in Central America.  But what began as the shared vision of one person and a small group of  community and government partners would soon grow into a nationally  renowned health center that has touched the lives of thousands.   Under Ms. Gomez's leadership, Mary's Center went from serving 200  participants in a small basement with a budget of $250,000 to serving  more than 60,000 participants across seven locations in DC and  Maryland, with an annual budget of $76 million in just over 30 years.  The center and the people who work there are committed to providing the  highest quality of care to each and every patient, regardless of their  ability to pay, and the mission of Mary's Center is guided by core  principles of care, education, social justice, and respect. I have had  the privilege of visiting Mary's Center locations in my State of  Maryland while serving in the Senate, and I have witnessed, firsthand,  the extraordinary attention, compassion and professionalism that the  entire Mary's Center family brings to everything they do. It is because  of their work that so many within our communities can receive support  and critical services.   That is Maria Gomez's legacy, and our State and our Nation are deeply  grateful for all she has given to our fellow citizens in need. Her  extraordinary achievements have made Ms. Gomez one of the most  effective and highly regarded leaders in the region and throughout the  country. It was Ms. Gomez's hard work and dedication that led First  Lady Michelle Obama to choose Mary's Center for her first official  visit to a nonprofit organization in February 2009. In 1995, First Lady  Hillary Clinton also visited Mary's Center during National Immunization  Week in recognition of the center's efforts to get children vaccinated  and ready to learn and thrive in school. What is more, President Barack  Obama selected Maria Gomez as one of the 18 recipients of the 2012  Presidential Citizens Medal, the Nation's second-highest civilian  honor, as a testament to her leadership and service.   Ms. Gomez has accrued decades of wisdom over the course of her  distinguished career, and she has always been willing to share that  wisdom and knowledge with those who seek it. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, as  well as former Mayors Vincent Gray and Adrian Fenty, named her to their  mayoral transition teams. She currently serves as cochair of the Human  Services, Social Services, and Health Committee of the DC Mayor's  ReOpen DC Advisory Group for COVID-19, and she is a member of the  Mayor's Commission on Healthcare Systems Transformations, which makes  recommendations on strategies and investments necessary to transform  healthcare in the District of Columbia.   Ms. Gomez also shares her expertise by serving as a board member for  the DC Primary Care Association and the Primary Care Coalition of  Montgomery County. She is a member of the Suburban Hospital Board of  Trustees, is cochair of the Latino Health Steering Committee of  Montgomery County, and serves on the advisory boards for the  Smithsonian American Women History Initiative, the DC Fiscal Policy  Institute, and the AmeriHealth Caritas National FQHC Initiative. In  addition, she is a member of the Washington Housing Conservancy--WHC-- Board.   While Ms. Gomez is the recipient of numerous well-earned awards and  accolades, no medal or trophy that we can give to her can truly speak  to all that she has given us throughout her inspiring life and career.  She has been a beacon of hope for so many families in need over the  past three decades. She leaves behind a legacy of deep compassion for  all whom she has met and known and helped and served. Ms. Gomez's  colleagues regard her as a strong leader, a dedicated mentor, and a  friend to all, and the entire Mary's Center community treasures the  warmth, grace, and respect she has imparted throughout the organization  these past 33 years.   Our Nation's Capital is healthier and stronger because of Maria  Gomez's many years of visionary leadership and dedicated service. I ask  my colleagues to join me in expressing our deepest gratitude to her and  in extending our best wishes to her and to her husband Michael Rexrode  and daughter Amalia--as she begins the next chapter of her life of  service to her community and her country.                            ____________________
