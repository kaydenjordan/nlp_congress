 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Child Protection  Improvements Act. I would like to thank the gentleman from Michigan  (Mr. Bishop) who has been an excellent partner working with me on this  bill, the first version of which was introduced in 2007.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank Chairman Goodlatte and  Ranking Member Conyers for their work on the bill as well.   I volunteered with Big Brothers Big Sisters many years ago. I was  paired with an extraordinary young man named David who is now himself a  Big Brother. I have always said that I have learned as much or more  from David and the program as he ever learned from me.   The experience also helped me understand the huge amount of trust  that we put in volunteers at organizations all around the country. In  the vast majority of cases, that trust is well placed. But,  unfortunately, there are exceptions.   For that reason, in 2003, Congress created the Child Safety Pilot  Program to demonstrate the feasibility of allowing youth-serving  nonprofits to access FBI background checks.                                time  1800    The FBI maintains the database of criminal histories from every State  in the Nation, searchable by fingerprint. An FBI search is really the  gold standard when it comes to background checks, as it cannot be  evaded by using a fake name, and it will find convictions from every  State. I believe that the gold standard is what we should strive for  when it comes to protecting children, seniors, and individuals with  disabilities who are put in a potentially vulnerable situation.   Between 2003 and 2011, youth-serving organizations were able to run  over 100,000 background checks through this pilot program, and about 6  percent of the potential volunteers were revealed to have criminal  records of concern. Applicants were found with convictions for  everything from murder to child abuse, to sexual assault; and  frequently those convictions were from out of State, so only a national  background check would have found them.   H.R. 695 ensures that every child-serving organization in America  will have access to the most comprehensive and effective background  check possible. H.R. 695 will also protect the applicant's privacy and  does not allow for the individual's specific criminal record to be  disclosed without explicit consent by the potential volunteer.   We have demonstrated that background checks for nonprofits working  with children can be conducted quickly, affordably, and accurately. It  is time to create a system that is permanent and that will protect  children and other vulnerable populations while ensuring the privacy of  volunteers.   I urge the passage of this bipartisan bill.
