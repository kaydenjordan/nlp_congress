 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of my amendment and the underlying bill, the  DETERRENT Act.   Foreign influence on our universities and colleges is a serious  threat, and I am concerned foreign adversaries are targeting our  Nation's students.   The DETERRENT Act ensures that we have transparency, accountability,  and clarity in how foreign actors are involved with our universities  and colleges.   My amendment will improve this important bill by revising a provision  in the underlying legislation that creates a public, searchable  database of staff or faculty who have disclosed gifts or contracts from  foreign entities.   While I support transparency and accountability for our university  faculty and staff to ensure foreign entities do not have undue  influence over university research, policies, or instruction practices,  it is important we balance that with the need to protect the privacy of  an individual faculty or staff member at our institutions of higher  education.   This commonsense amendment simply changes the underlying bill's  public database by removing the personally identifiable information of  faculty and staff who are listed in the database as a result of  reporting gifts or contracts with foreign entities.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
