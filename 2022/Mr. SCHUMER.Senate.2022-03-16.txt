 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, moments ago, speaking through a video  feed from Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed  Members of both the House and the Senate as the war in Ukraine enters  its 21st awful day.   It is one of the highest honors of any Congress to welcome remarks by  a foreign head of state, but it is unheard of to hear from a leader  fighting for his life, fighting for his country's future, and fighting  to preserve the very idea of democracy.   I cannot remember the last time a foreign leader united a room full  of Members from both sides so quickly and so intensely. He spoke not  just to American ears but to America's very soul. In one sense, his  speech was reminiscent of the stirring feeling all of us had in the  aftermath of 9/11: equal parts resolve and unity and determination to  save democracy from an hour of darkness.   As we have said from the start of the war, the Senate, the Congress,  and the American people stand unequivocally behind the people of  Ukraine. America will continue to strengthen our NATO allies and  reassure our friends in Europe that we will remain a steady ally. It is  why, last week, Congress approved nearly $14 billion for food, shelter,  money for Javelins and Stingers and anti-aircraft weapons and refugee  help. Every last penny that the United States sends to Ukraine is money  well spent.   This morning, it is reported that President Biden will also announce  another $800 million in military assistance. This means even more anti- tank, anti-aircraft missiles and other weapons that have been the most  effective on the battlefield for the Ukrainians.   Last night, the Senate also unanimously passed legislation supporting  investigations by the International Criminal Court into potential war  crimes by Putin and his regime. I thank Senator Graham and the many,  many others who backed this bill. The Senate also confirmed the  Ambassador-at-Large for Global Criminal Justice, our lead advocate in  making sure this investigation is robust and it is swift.   These steps are all necessary. Over the last 2 weeks, we have seen  Putin attack the largest nuclear plant in Europe, attack the Chernobyl  containment site, attack a children's hospital, and attack designated  humanitarian convoys. Putin, so far, is not winning militarily so now  this evil man is trying to win by massacring civilians; massacring  babies; parents, the elderly; and targeting apartments, just as he did  in Syria, just as he did in Chechnya. If this doesn't equal a war  crime, I don't know what does.   If it wasn't clear before, it should be clear now that President  Putin and his  [[Page S1194]]  band of cronies are not going to stop. But in his monomaniacal hubris,  Putin has severely--severely--underestimated the Ukrainian people.  Every time an innocent Ukrainian is killed, the resolve of the people  grows stronger, and we stand with them. I join my colleagues in one  voice to say this: ``Slava Ukraini,'' glory to Ukraine.   And, Mr. President, just seeing the video that the President showed  us is heartbreaking and strengthens our resolve. Putin, by being such a  villain, by being such a brutal, evil man, is not going to deter the  Ukrainians, for sure, and not the American people from helping Ukraine.  It strengthens our resolve when we see how vicious, how brutal he is.    Mr. President, this vote took a long time. If the others  take that amount of time, we are going to be here until very late  because we are going to get this done. So I hope everyone will--now  that we are on the second vote--hang close.   I ask unanimous consent that the remaining votes tonight be 10-minute  votes.    Let me reiterate.   Members, please stay on or near the floor during the votes so we can  get this done quickly.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, that vote took too long. Will Members  please stay around so we can get these done quickly. We have many more  votes to go.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, March 17; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be  [[Page S1228]]  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Nathan nomination; finally, that if any  nominations are confirmed during Thursday's session, the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    For the information of Senators, there will be two  rollcall votes at 11:45 and one at 1:45.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 9:29 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, March 17, 2022, at 10 a.m.
