 Madam Speaker, it is an honor for me to recognize my friend  and constituent Tommy Whitaker.   On November 14, one day before his 70th birthday, Tommy is retiring  after 45 years as an employee and 16 years as president and CEO of The  Farmers Bank headquartered in Portland, Tennessee. During his tenure,  the bank has grown in assets from $25 million to now $850 million, with  10 branches and 150 employees.   Tommy graduated from the University of Tennessee in 1974 with a  degree in business where he met his wife, Shirley. He later went on to  attend the Graduate School of Banking at Louisiana State University.   Tommy and Shirley have raised two wonderful children, Susan and  Joseph, and are the proud grandparents of their grandson, Grayson.   Tommy is one of Tennessee's most influential bankers, and his strong  character and devotion to service before self has gained him the  respect of everyone in his community and beyond.   It is truly an end of an era for The Farmers Bank. I am so grateful  for Tommy Whitaker's friendship and service, and I wish him a happy  retirement.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, the fight to restore law and order and  secure our southern border continues. Border apprehensions remain at a  2-decade high as the Department of Homeland Security warns officials to  prepare for roughly 400,000 illegal migrants crossing the border just  this month.   President Biden is more committed to ending President Trump's  policies that had successfully slowed the surge of illegal crossings  than he is to securing our border. The cartels and human smugglers have  taken notice of our weakened position and are more than willing to  exploit these changes for their financial benefit. Meanwhile, those who  are understandably seeking opportunity and a better future are being  coached to gain entrance to the U.S. by claiming asylum.   As a result of our open southern border and the refusal by the Biden  administration to detain the majority of those we encounter, more than  2 million illegal immigrants are expected to pass through our southern  border this year. Already, 1.2 million have entered the country  illegally and have been apprehended since President Biden took office,  and millions of these are expected to be brought into the interior of  our country--all at taxpayers' expense.   The desperate situation at the southern border calls for urgent  action. Instead, House Democrats are determined to use the budget  reconciliation process to pass amnesty for millions of illegal  immigrants. This type of thinking, if turned into law, will have  staggering consequences for our Nation for years to come. Widespread  illegal immigration is detrimental not only to Americans and our  families but to our Nation and even the migrants themselves.   As one of the Representatives in Congress for middle Tennessee, I  have the responsibility to safeguard our sacred freedoms. But if we  cannot control our borders, how can we defend our sovereignty as a  nation?   That is why I am fighting to restore law and order at the southern  border.   President Biden and House Democrats can no longer run from this  crisis.
