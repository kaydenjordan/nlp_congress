 Mr. Speaker, in a desperate attempt to maintain their  waning grip on power, the majority is attempting to hijack a bill  related to NASA in order to promote voter fraud and invalidate State  voter ID laws.   But that is not all. The Democrats want to institutionalize ballot  harvesting schemes, mandate the use of unverifiable mail ballots, and  pour public dollars into the campaign coffers of wealthy politicians.   You heard that right, Mr. and Mrs. America. Bidenflation skyrockets  while Democrats are going to raid the Treasury to pay for their  political ads. But that is just the beginning.   A few days ago, New York City adopted a policy allowing noncitizens  to vote, effectively legalizing foreign election interference. You can  bet this will stretch to Minneapolis, Milwaukee, and Madison. In that  respect, perhaps it is fitting that the majority has chosen a NASA bill  to advance their cynical agenda and pave the way for alien voting.   This is one giant leap backward for American election integrity, and  if the majority actually thinks this bill is the solution to what is  ailing America, Houston, we have a problem.
