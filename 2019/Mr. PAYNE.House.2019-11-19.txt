 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize November as  Alzheimer's Awareness Month.   Alzheimer's disease causes brain cells to waste away slowly and die,  causing memory loss and, possibly, death. It is a condition that  affects 5.5 million Americans and growing.   It was believed to be a disease of old age, but diet, exercise, and  lifestyle are becoming larger factors.   It is a personal concern for me because I am a diabetic. I have a  greater chance of contracting it as I age.   But Alzheimer's patients are not the only ones who suffer. The  disease takes a terrible toll on loved ones as sufferers demand  constant care.   Madam Speaker, we need to devote more resources to a disease that  could affect us all.                            ____________________
