 Mr. Speaker, in 1964, then-Attorney General Robert F.  Kennedy summed it up best as to why the Framers put the Capital outside  the borders or control of any State: ``It was indispensably necessary  to the independence and the very existence of the new Federal  Government to have a seat of government which was not subject to the  jurisdiction or control of any State.''   As true as that was when this was said, as true as that was when the  Capital was moved here, it is that true today.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I am glad they remember  history. When the seat of the Federal Government was in New York City  and in Philadelphia, the birthplace of America, they didn't want it in  the control of a State. Therefore, the District of Columbia was  created, under the control of the United States Congress, because that  is who should be determining what happens for the 50 States.   Our colleagues on the other side want to change an amendment to the  Constitution with law.   What about other amendments to the Constitution and how they read  those? Will they try to change those with law?   This is not about taxation without representation. This is about a  Democrat power grab, and let's call it what it is.
