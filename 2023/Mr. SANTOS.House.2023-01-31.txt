 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the brave men and  women of the Nassau County Police Department.   Last week, the Nassau PD arrested eight men in New York's Third  Congressional District who are said to be part of an organized theft  group from South America.   While I am grateful to their ongoing commitment to preventing these  acts of violence, but for suburban New Yorkers in New York's Third  Congressional District, we are seeing a major uptick in crime.   In Nassau County alone, a reported 7,394 crimes have been recorded in  2022. This includes grand larceny, burglaries, and vehicle theft.   Recently, I spoke with the NYPD's commanding officer, Assistant Chief  Kevin Williams of Queens, to discuss the potential protests in response  to the unfortunate events that have taken place in Memphis.   I personally extend my support to Assistant Chief Williams and his  team during this time of uncertainty. While peaceful protests may occur  nationwide, we should also offer our support to the brave men and women  of our local law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, it is my commitment to support good policy that will  provide both the training and resources that our local law enforcement  requires to keep our communities safe.                            ____________________
