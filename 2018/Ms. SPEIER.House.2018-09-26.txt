 Mr. Speaker, I have a brief 1 minute to say that San  Francisco International Airport is in my district. We are being hounded  by noise in the middle of the night at 1, 2, and 3 a.m. in the morning.   I convened a meeting with the FAA. They joined me at that meeting.  They agreed to have a meeting with the airlines, and then the FAA here  in Washington decided to renege.    This is a message to the FAA: You owe your obligation to all the  people of this country, and when a Member of Congress seeks to have you  at a meeting, you show up at a meeting. When you don't show up at a  meeting, heads are going to roll.
