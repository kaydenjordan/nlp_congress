 Mr. Speaker, President Trump claims to have brought  profound change in his first 100 days in office, but thus far, on jobs,  our trade deficit continues to rise.   Rather than fulfill his promise to directly renegotiate NAFTA, the  President signed another ``dodge 'em'' executive order asking for a 6- month delay by reviewing all U.S. trade agreements. That could take  forever. His NAFTA backtrack presents a serious problem for Americans  who continue to lose their jobs to NAFTA's broken promises.   None will be more impacted than Americans working in the automotive  sector. Last year, our country's automotive trade gap with Mexico was  deep in the red again. As a result, our country imported 800,000 more  cars from Mexico than we exported.   This is what it looked like back in 1993. This is what it looks like  today. Is it any wonder that Americans are concerned about jobs?   In agricultural trade among NAFTA partners, 2 million small-scale  Mexican farmers were thrown off their farms and out of work. This  fueled the immigration crisis and subwage workers across our continent  as poverty continued--no different than 1993.   America's workers don't need any more studies or delays. We need jobs  and a renegotiated NAFTA now.                            ____________________
