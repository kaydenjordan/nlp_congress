 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on January 16, more than 2 months ago, the  House passed a supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 268, which  addressed the needs of all communities impacted by recent natural  disasters. The House-passed disaster bill provided assistance to help  people impacted by Hurricanes Florence and Michael, the Hawaii  volcanoes, and the California wildfires. It provided aid to the people  in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Guam, who were  struck last year by typhoons, and the people of American Samoa, who  were devastated by Cyclone Gita. It continued assistance for Puerto  Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to help them continue their recovery  from Hurricanes Irma and Maria. They passed it 2 months ago.   Instead of moving quickly on this package to help those Americans in  need, Senate Republicans, at the President's insistence, held up the  House bill because it included assistance for Americans in Puerto Rico.  Instead of giving aid to the people who need it, the President has  chosen to delay it over petty grudges and political concerns.   The President's refusal to help Americans in Puerto Rico not only  delays the important disaster bill that many of the other States are  relying on to  [[Page S2018]]  speed their recovery efforts, it discriminates against the over 3  million Americans who reside in Puerto Rico, and that is wrong. We have  never--certainly in my years here--had disaster bills in which we say  that Americans in this State can be helped, but we do not like the  Americans in this State, so they cannot be helped.   This is the United States of America. We are supposed to take care of  all of our citizens when there is a crisis, not pick and choose who  gets assistance based on who we are aligned with politically. I have  voted for disaster relief for red States, for blue States, for purple  States because they are part of the United States of America. I feel  that as a country we have to come together to help each other when  there is a disaster.   Certainly Republican Senators and Democratic Senators helped the  State of Vermont when we were hit with a disaster a few years ago.  Well, today it is Puerto Rico, and all of the Americans in Puerto Rico  need our help.   A year and a half ago, it was hit by two back-to-back category 5  hurricanes. It is rare that anybody ever gets hit by two back-to-back  category 5 hurricanes. An estimated 2,975 Americans lost their lives.  Homes were demolished, communities destroyed. It was an extraordinary  disaster, and it requires a commensurate extraordinary response.   I am glad we are finally moving to debate on the House-passed bill  because we need that. We actually ought to just pass the House-passed  bill, but, unfortunately, the Republicans say they will file a  substitute that will take us backward, not forward.   Again, at the President's insistence, it eliminates critical  assistance for the Americans in Puerto Rico provided for in the House  bill, as well as assistance to other U.S. territories. It eliminates  State-revolving funds that would help Puerto Rico rebuild damaged water  systems and ensure they are resilient and can stand up to future  storms. It eliminates a 100-percent cost-share for FEMA that would help  cash-strapped Puerto Rico access Federal aid. It eliminates money to  help Americans ensure that Puerto Rico is able to rebuild their  electrical grid. It eliminates $68 million in Medicaid assistance for  American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands, whose programs  face serious shortages due to the increased need.   Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle claim that this  money is not needed. They point to previous disaster supplemental bills  and argue that we have already addressed the needs of Puerto Rico, and  we should move on. Well, that is untrue. We provided Puerto Rico with  significant assistance, as we should have, given the extraordinary  nature of the storms that ravaged the island and given the extent of  the devastation, but as damage assessments come in and the full picture  of the devastation becomes clear, we must continually reassess and  provide them what is needed to fully recover.   I remember when this first happened, back when the White House was  saying there may be two or three or four or a dozen fatalities in  Puerto Rico. Well, they were off by thousands. There were 2,975 people  who lost their lives, not just a handful.   We don't simply appropriate the same amount of money to each State or  territory that is hit with a disaster no matter the level of damage. We  look at each place, and we provide what is needed for the people to  rebuild their homes, their communities, and their lives.   I will give you one example of why one size does not fit all. With  Katrina, we in Congress passed six supplemental disaster packages--not  one, six--to help rebuild Louisiana and Mississippi because the storm  was unlike anything we had ever seen. They needed the assistance coming  in over time. I supported the help for Louisiana and Mississippi. No  one at the time would have argued to stop after the first tranche of  funding we provided and then leave them to fend for themselves, because  they are Americans. We saw there were more problems, and we added  money.   This is no different.   The President reportedly came to the Capitol and met with Senators  yesterday and made his case as to why we should not continue aid to  Puerto Rico. Let me repeat. The President of the United States-- something I have never seen in my 45 years here with either a  Republican or Democratic President--affirmatively argued that we should  refrain from helping American citizens in need.   Of course, like so many things the President has said, it was not  based in fact or reality. He claimed that Puerto Rico had received over  $90 billion in Federal assistance, but it has not. He knows it has not.  Why does he keep saying this when he has to know that what he is saying  is not true? He claims it is using Federal money to pay off its debt.  It has not. The President knows that is not true. Why does he keep  saying it?   Some here in this body have claimed that Puerto Rico has in the bank  $20 billion in previously appropriated money that they have failed to  spend, and they argue that we should provide no more until it is drawn  down. I do not know if they are getting their talking points from the  White House or what, but that is simply false.   The bulk of the money to which they refer, which we Republicans and  Democrats alike voted to appropriate over 1 year ago, is being held up  by the administration in redtape and bureaucracy. It seems as though it  is being purposely held back because of inaction by this  administration. Billions of dollars that Congress approved over 1 year  ago for disaster recovery efforts remain in the U.S. Treasury in  Washington, DC, not where they belong--assisting the American citizens  of Puerto Rico. There is no excuse for that.   They cannot have it both ways. The administration cannot  simultaneously hold up recovery dollars for Puerto Rico and then point  to Puerto Rico's failure to spend it as an excuse not to provide  additional assistance. In other words, they are holding these billions  away from Puerto Rico, saying: You cannot have it, but why are you not  spending it?   Come on. You cannot do that. You cannot claim they are not spending  the money that is being held back from them, and then say that is why  they do not need additional assistance.   Yesterday, Senator Schumer and I sent a letter to the administration  about these bureaucratic delays and demanded answers.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of a  letter dated March 25, 2019, to Mick Mulvaney, Peter Gaynor, and Ben  Carson.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                     Washington, DC, March 25, 2019.      Hon. Mick Mulvaney,      Director, Office of Management and Budget,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Peter Gaynor,      Acting Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Ben Carson,      Secretary, Department of Housing      and Urban Development, Washington, DC.        Dear Director Mulvaney, Honorable Gaynor, and Honorable       Carson, Last November, we wrote to express our concern about       the significant and unsupported delays related to the       immediate and long-term recovery needs of Puerto Rico in the       aftermath of catastrophic Hurricanes Irma and Maria.       Specifically, we highlighted the lack of effective Federal       interagency coordination under the leadership of the Office       of Management and Budget (OMB), which has and continues to       impede on the Commonwealth's ability to finalize emergency       repairs through FEMA's Public Assistance categories A and B       programs, and subsequently its efforts to move toward       permanent reconstruction. These delays are not unique to       FEMA, as the Department of Housing and Urban Development       (HUD) has also been affected by OMB's micromanagement and       excessive bureaucracy as they attempt to administer and       oversee Puerto Rico's Community Development Block Grant--      Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) funding. The lack of leadership       and coordination, combined with delays in meeting the basic       needs of the island, more than eighteen months after       receiving a presidential disaster declaration, has left far       too many children and elderly citizens in unhealthy and       unsafe conditions, families in severely damaged homes, and       communities without adequate infrastructure to sustain a       decent quality of life.        The response that we received, several months later, was       wholly inadequate and contained no information to respond to       our concerns. Specifically, we raised concerns about OMB's       failure to work expeditiously with HUD to finalize and issue       a Federal Register Notice for nearly $16 billion in CDBG-DR       mitigation funding that Congress appropriated in February       2018, of which $8.3 billion has been allocated to Puerto       Rico. As a result, this critical source of funding remains       unavailable for obligation more than a year after it was       appropriated, and nearly  [[Page S2019]]       a year and half after the historic hurricanes made landfall.       The purpose of the mitigation allocation was to provide not       only Puerto Rico, but more than 15 other cities, states and       territories the resources necessary to rebuild their homes,       businesses, and critical infrastructure to updated       construction standards in order to prevent the same level of       destruction in future disaster events. As you are probably       aware, some reconstruction has started to take place, but       without the availability of the mitigation funding, Puerto       Rico is unable to strategically adopt these improved       standards, or leverage this critical resource toward a       comprehensive island-wide rebuild strategy. Further delays in       the availability of funding is unacceptable. We insist       that you finalize the mitigation notice in the next 30       days.        It has also come to our attention that several issues have       reached a critical point with FEMA that are hindering the       recovery efforts in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands as       well. FEMA needs to work with the territories to develop ways       to expedite approvals and obligations of funding, especially       for priority projects. In addition, FEMA needs to develop       clear policies with regard to the issues laid out below,       share them openly with Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands,       and Congress, and ensure that they are being implemented in a       consistent way.        First, finalizing the consistent implementation of the       ``pre-disaster condition'' language from section 20601 of the       Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 is paramount. The intent of       this provision was to facilitate the rebuilding of       infrastructure, including the electric grid, in a way that is       resilient to future weather events, reduces the need for       future federal disaster assistance, and makes use of       technology and modern standards when rebuilding. Congress       specifically wished to avoid a situation where the islands       would be forced to simply plug new pieces into antiquated       infrastructure, which would only lead to more frequent       failures in the future. It has come to our attention that       there is a lack of consistency and transparency in the way       that FEMA is implementing this language, and that FEMA's       interpretation of this language may be contrary to       congressional intent. For example, recent news reports       indicate that FEMA has reduced its cost estimate for a       Project Worksheet covering rebuilding of a number of schools       because upgrades to meet industry standards were removed from       the scope of work, after previously being discussed by the       stakeholders involved. FEMA must immediately rectify this       situation and issue clear guidance and expectations on its       approach to implementing both the ``pre-disaster condition''       and the ``industry standards'' portion of the Bipartisan       Budget Act. If FEMA needs additional guidance from Congress,       we must be informed of this need immediately.        Second, we are also concerned about changing FEMA guidance       and approaches leading to substantial replication of efforts       and excessive delays in approving and obligating funding for       priority projects in the territories. For example, according       to representatives of the Commonwealth, in March of 2018 FEMA       determined that the level of damage to the Vieques Hospital       justified replacement of the building, instead of repair.       Accordingly, in August of 2018, a scope of work was agreed       upon by the stakeholders involved, and coordination between       FEMA, COR3, and the municipality began on the cost estimate       of the replacement project. However, two months later, FEMA       representatives informed COR3 and the municipality that they       intended to review the validity of the replacement decision       that FEMA had previously made, sending the agreed upon       decision to the Expert Panel for their review. A year after       the initial decision to replace the building was made, the       fate of the Vieques Hospital project remains in question, and       it appears that no real progress has been made in addressing       the long-term health care needs of the people of Vieques, who       continue to rely on a mobile clinic.        Last, when FEMA provides disaster assistance, the receiving       State or Territory is responsible for implementing financial       controls to ensure that funds obligated for a project by FEMA       are drawn down by the grantee for the approved purpose.       Currently, FEMA applies additional fiscal oversight       requirements specifically to Puerto Rico, which require the       Commonwealth to provide detailed documentation to validate       that any costs incurred with disaster assistance funding are       for allowable expenses. FEMA manually validates a percentage       of those actions. Negotiations to end these additional       oversight measures and expedite the processing of recovery       funding have been ongoing; however, it's unclear what       remaining steps Puerto Rico must take to assume full       responsibility of their recovery assistance. Until FEMA       approves the transition of fiscal oversight to Puerto Rico,       these extraordinary measures will stay in place. FEMA must be       clear about the changes Puerto Rico needs to make in order to       properly manage its own recovery expenses and eliminate any       unnecessary bureaucratic steps.        As the territories continue to recover, it is crucial that       FEMA address these issues and move forward with a stronger       sense of urgency and consideration for the unique issues that       they face. A recovery of this scale requires consistency,       transparency, and constant coordination with territory       officials.        Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were hit by back-      to-back Category 5 hurricanes, and the damage to the islands       was catastrophic. An estimated 2,975 people lost their lives,       homes were demolished, and communities destroyed. This       extraordinary disaster requires a commensurate extraordinary       response. We have a responsibility to come to the aid of       fellow U.S. citizens in times of need, and this is certainly       one of those times.        We ask for a detailed response providing an update on the       status of these issues and the projected timeframe for their       final resolution be provided without delay. Please respond by       April 5, 2019.            Sincerely,      Patrick Leahy,        U.S. Senator.      Charles E. Schumer,        U.S. Senator.     Mr. President, yesterday the inspector general of the  Department of Housing and Urban Development announced that it will  review whether the White House has deliberately interfered with the  timely distribution of hurricane funds to Puerto Rico. That is pretty  amazing. I have never seen a case that I remember where the inspector  general of Housing and Urban Development had to look into whether the  White House was deliberately interfering with funds to go to a disaster  area.   I know firsthand what it is like to see a State hit by disaster.  Tropical Storm Irene hit Vermont in 2011, and it devastated our State.  People lost their homes, roads were washed out, bridges destroyed, and  communities forever changed. I saw bridges twisted like a child's toy.  I saw farmhouses that had been on the north side of the river, which  were now on the south side of the river, upside down and destroyed. I  saw farmers' fields wiped out, businesses ruined, schools destroyed,  roads necessary to bring medical supplies into villages gone. I know  firsthand. I know as a lifelong Vermonter that in these moments the  Federal Government is a critical partner in the effort to recover and  rebuild.   It is the same in other States--North Carolina, South Carolina,  Florida, Texas, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands. They are  all counting on us to get this bill across the finish line.   That is why, 3 weeks ago, I put a compromise on the table to create a  path forward. I did it in my capacity as chairman of the Appropriations  Committee. It was a reasonable proposal. It does not restore everything  that had been eliminated from the House bill, but it was a compromise  that focused on the most critical proposals and the immediate needs.  Had Senate Republicans accepted this proposal, we likely would have  seen quick passage of a disaster bill in a bipartisan fashion in both  the Senate and the House. It actually would have eliminated the need  for a conference and would have gotten the assistance to the people who  need it sooner rather than later.   Unfortunately, it appears the President will not accept even this  reasonable offer. It makes me think about when he closed down the  government for over 1 month because the Congress gave him only $1.6  billion for a wall, and then he reopened the government when we gave  him $1.3 billion. I don't know if they actually read the proposals and  bills that we sent.    In this case, I think it is obvious what is happening. The President  is willing to endanger the entire disaster package for all of the  United States because he wants to pick winners and losers. When there  is a disaster, there are no winners and losers. Americans come together  to help everybody. Yet he wants to say who gets assistance in the wake  of disasters based on his own arbitrary standards and political  grudges. That is unacceptable. Where is it going to end? Which State  will the President disfavor next? Remember that just a few months ago,  the President, in a tweet, threatened to cut off aid to California as  they were reeling from some of the worst fires in recent history. He  sent a tweet telling millions of Americans he doesn't want to help. We  are an independent branch of government. We have to have a responsible  party in the room, and it should be Congress.   I think back to when Vermont was hit by disaster and hurricane  flooding. As I was traveling around the State the day after, surveying  the damage, I was receiving emails from a number of Senators,  Republicans and Democrats, saying: Vermont stood with us when we had a  disaster; we will stand with you today.  [[Page S2020]]    That is what I want to do. I want to help, just as I voted to help  Louisiana six times and Mississippi for their damage. It wasn't for a  political benefit for Vermont, but it was because we are Americans and  we all stand together.   To think that we might consider a disaster package that picks and  chooses which Americans are helped when they have all suffered equally  from disasters, and to say: OK, you, American, we favor you, you get  money. You, American, I don't like you. So you are not going to get  money. That is not the American way. That is not the way the Senate  should be.   Let's pass a bill that addresses the needs of all communities  impacted by disaster and do it now. People are waiting. The needs are  pressing.   I will file an amendment today with my recommended compromise. It  provides a reasonable path forward--one that allows us to move quickly  to get assistance to the people who need it now. I hope all Members  will support it.   The Governor of Puerto Rico made a strong statement this morning.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  a statement by Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:             Statement by Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello                              (March 26, 2019)         San Juan, Puerto Rico.--``The comments attributed to Donald       Trump today by senators from his own party are below the       dignity of a sitting President of the United States. They       continue to lack empathy, are irresponsible, regrettable and,       above all, unjustified.        ``I want to be very clear: Not a single federal dollar has       been used to make debt payments. This has been the most       transparent recovery in the history of the United States,       providing unprecedented access and collaboration with federal       agencies. In fact, just yesterday we reached an agreement       with FEMA on the transition of responsibilities for the       reimbursement of recovery funds. An agreement predicated on       the acknowledgment by the federal government that appropriate       fiscal controls are in fact established.        ``I can only assume that Trump is receiving misleading       information from his own staff. I have now made several       requests to meet with the President to discuss Puerto Rico's       recovery and reconstruction, but up to this day we haven't       received a confirmation or a date, even though Trump told me       we would meet after his visit to Vietnam earlier this year.        ``I invite the President to stop listening to ignorant and       completely wrong advice. Instead he should come to Puerto       Rico to hear firsthand from the people on the ground. I       invite him to put all of the resources at his disposal to       help Americans in Puerto Rico, like he did for Texas and       Alabama. No more, no less.        ``Of course, today the world knows the unpleasant truth       that Puerto Rico is a colonial territory of the United States       and are well aware of the democratic deficiencies we endure:       We are not allowed to vote for our President nor have voting       representation in Congress. Even as we have asked       democratically for statehood twice in the past seven years,       the federal government has delayed their responsibility to       act.        People from all over the nation, and the world, have       witnessed the inequalities Americans face on the island. The       federal response and its treatment during these past months       in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria is clear evidence of our       second-class citizenship.        ``Mr. President: Enough with the insults and demeaning       mischaracterizations. We are not your political adversaries;       we are your citizens.        ``We are not asking for anything more than any other U.S.       state has received. We are merely asking for equality.''     The Americans in Puerto Rico do not have representation in  this body. Vermont is probably as far away from Puerto Rico as just  about any State, with the exception of Alaska and Hawaii. They do not  have anybody to speak directly on their behalf on such an important  matter. The Governor has spoken out. I urge every Member to read what  the Governor has to say. I agree with him. Americans in Puerto Rico  should be helped just as Americans in Texas, Americans in Oklahoma,  Americans in California, or Americans in New York, or wherever disaster  has struck. We are the United States of America. Let's start acting  like that on behalf of all Americans, not on behalf of political  biases.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
