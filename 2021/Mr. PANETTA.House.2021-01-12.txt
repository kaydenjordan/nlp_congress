 Mr. Speaker, on January 7 at 4 a.m., I was right outside  those doors where, 14 hours earlier, a rioter was shot as she violently  tried to enter this Chamber.   It was in that early morning and at that location that I had a brief  conversation with Vice President Mike Pence right after we finished  certifying the electoral college.   I was proud that we did our job that morning despite the violence we  experienced earlier that day, but I knew that was not enough because of  the seditious actions by President Trump before that riot and his  inaction during that riot. So I said to the Vice President, ``It's up  to you to keep us safe.''    Tonight, with the President still in office, I am beyond asking; I am  legislating to compel the Vice President to convene the Cabinet, to  conclude that the President is not just unable but, clearly, he is  unwilling and unworthy to discharge his duties.   So, through this legislation, I ask my colleagues to call on the Vice  President to invoke the 25th Amendment, yes, to keep us safe and keep  this Nation secure.
