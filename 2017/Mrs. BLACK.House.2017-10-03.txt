 Madam Speaker, it is difficult to imagine what could be  more important than establishing who is protected under the law and who  is not; who is given a chance of life and who is denied it.   As technology continues to evolve, the more we can celebrate the  ability we have to save a baby at just 20 weeks after conception is  truly remarkable. I remember when I first became a nurse some 40 years  ago. I vowed to devote myself to the welfare of those committed to my  care, whether they were born or unborn. I am still committed to that  today. And 40 years later, the science tells us that after 20 weeks of  pregnancy, unborn babies are able to feel pain inside the womb.   The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act protects those who  cannot protect themselves when handed a death sentence.   Madam Speaker, there are currently seven countries in the world that  allow elective late abortions, countries such as North Korea and China.   Why in the world is the United States on a list of countries  characterized as human rights abusers?   Our Nation can do better than that.   I have seen how special care is given to reduce the pain of these  precious premature babies at 20 weeks in the NICU. Unborn children in  the womb at this stage should be protected, too, and we must pass the  Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to give these unborn children  a chance to see the light of day.
