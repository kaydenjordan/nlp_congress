 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr.  Garamendi and Mr. Graves for their bipartisan work on the Peace Corps  Reauthorization Act.   Last year, the Peace Corps celebrated its 60th anniversary. The Peace  Corps has played an important role in America's foreign assistance  efforts, and I thank the volunteers who have selflessly given their  time to do work abroad.   The Peace Corps faced many challenges during the pandemic, but I am  pleased that volunteers are finally returning to their important tasks  overseas. As they return, volunteer safety must continue to be the  agency's top priority.   Tragically, the number of volunteers reporting sexual assault during  their service has risen. This is devastating, and we must continue to  hold the Peace Corps accountable for maximizing the safety and welfare  of our volunteers.   This bill reinforces and builds on key reforms made by Congress in  2011, including extending the mandate of the Sexual Assault Advisory  Council.  [[Page H7892]]                                     time  1415    It also expedites the reenrollment process for volunteers whose  service was cut short by the pandemic, and it directs the Peace Corps  to establish a zero-tolerance policy on volunteers' drug use.   This bill is an important step toward exercising our oversight  responsibilities and driving reforms that will protect the Peace Corps  volunteers that we all represent.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. In the more  than two decades since the Peace Corps was last authorized, the agency  and its volunteers have done great work around the world on behalf of  the American people, but the agency still has work to do.   By building on key reforms as volunteers go back into the field, this  legislation will ensure that the Peace Corps is prepared to meet the  challenges of tomorrow.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8453, the Upholding the  Dayton Peace Agreement Through Sanctions Act, my bipartisan bill  codifying key sanctions authorities that will help the United States  stave off a serious crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina.   The country is headed into important general elections in just a few  short weeks on October 2, and time is running out to send a strong  deterrent message to bad actors intent on destabilizing the country.   Bosnia's democratic institutions, its territorial integrity, even the  Office of the High Representative, the independent body tasked with  implementing the Dayton Accords, are all at risk.   Peace in Bosnia came at a very steep price. Those who would threaten  the very foundations of the country must be held accountable.   The reckless secessionism and destabilizing actions of  ethnonationalist politicians like Milorad Dodik, the Serb member of  Bosnia's tripartite presidency, are extremely dangerous. The October  elections could be a critical flash point.                                time  1430    It worries me tremendously to see Serb and Croat nationalist parties,  with the support of the ruthless Putin regime, working to roll back the  progress Bosnia has made.   We have a strong and vibrant Bosnian community in my hometown of St.  Louis, Missouri. Many of my constituents fled to the city during and  after the 1992 and 1995 Bosnian war in which more than 100,000--200,000  lost their lives. My constituents want to see their homeland prosper as  a unified, sovereign, and multi-ethnic state.   I cannot imagine the heartache they must feel when Dodik denies the  horrifying genocide committed by Serb troops against Bosniak Muslims at  Srebrenica, or when he threatens to lead the dissolution of Bosnia.   These actions are offensive to those who lost loved ones in the  Bosnian war, and they are profoundly dangerous to Bosnia's future.   It is imperative, Mr. Speaker, that the United States wield our  economic toolkit to deter threats to Bosnian sovereignty and  territorial integrity as the country navigates these challenges.   H.R. 8453 codifies and mandates key sanctions authorities to address  the political crisis and corruption in Bosnia. Ahead of the country's  October general election, this bill sends a critical signal to local  officials engaging in destabilizing and anti-democratic behavior, and  to Russia for its destructive influence, that the United States will  hold them accountable.   At this volatile moment, Bosnians need the United States House of  Representatives to stand in unequivocal support of their peaceful,  democratic future.   I appreciate the chair and ranking member's swift attention to this  urgently needed bill that I have the great honor of putting forward. I  also thank Representative Wild for working with me on this legislation.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 8453, the  Upholding the Dayton Peace Agreement Through Sanctions Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank Representative Wild for working with  me on this important legislation.   And as a guarantor of the Dayton Peace Agreement, the United States  cannot stand by while Bosnia and Herzegovina are threatened by  destabilizing ethnonationalist forces and Russia's destructive  influence.   This legislation sends an unmistakable message to any actor that  threatens the peace, security, and stability, or territorial integrity  of Bosnia. If such destabilizing behavior is not ceased, he or she will  be sanctioned. These sanctions will not be considered, nor deliberated  over, but mandated.   With the country's October election less than a month away, the time  for the U.S. House of Representatives to act is now. I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker I rise in support of this bill. Without question, the  horrific and illegal war Russia is waging against the people of Ukraine  is Putin's war.   But Putin's regime and, by extension, his barbaric behavior in  Ukraine, are shamelessly supported by too many Russian military  officials, lawmakers, oligarchs, and propagandists who have yet to face  U.S. sanctions.   These enablers and supporters of Putin's unprovoked war of aggression  should not be able to set foot in the United States of America. They  should not be able to enjoy their ill-gotten wealth here. They should  not be able to buy expensive homes here, and they should not be able to  send their children to school here.   Failing to act would be a great disservice to the victims of Putin's  depravity, not just in Ukraine, but those in Russia as well who have  suffered from the Kremlin's domestic crackdown.   At the outset of the full-scale invasion, Putin signed a ludicrous  law mandating sentences of up to 15 years for telling the truth about  his war in Ukraine. In Russia, calling it a war and not a special  operation is illegal.                                time  1445    Questioning the wisdom of his unjustifiable war is illegal. Those  still brave enough to speak out these truths, including Vladimir Kara- Murza, now sit behind bars in Russia as political prisoners.   This bill calls on the administration to make a sanctions  determination for nearly 200 Russians linked to the regime's pervasive  corruption and human rights violations. These names were compiled by a  team of investigators organized by now-jailed Russian opposition  politician and anticorruption crusader Aleksei Navalny for not only  their part in Putin's kleptocracy but also for supporting the Kremlin's  war against Ukraine.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill to send a  strong signal to Putin's regime and all his cronies that they will be  held accountable for backing the regime's crimes at home and abroad.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for closing.   Mr. Speaker, in the months leading up to February 24, many of us  called for the Biden administration to impose severe sanctions before-- let me underscore ``before''--Russian troops amassing on Ukraine's  border invaded. These sanctions, we argued, would make crystal clear to  Putin and his cronies that they would be held accountable for launching  this renewed invasion.   Unfortunately, the administration chose not to heed this warning,  sacrificing a final opportunity to deter the war raging today.   While the administration has since worked with allies and partners to  cut off funding to Putin's war machine, it cannot rest in its efforts  to target all those in Russia complicit in the Kremlin's crimes at home  and abroad. Thus, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill to  ensure Putin's enablers face real consequences.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
