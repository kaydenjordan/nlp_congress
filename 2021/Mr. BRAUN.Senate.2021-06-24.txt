 Madam President, in the Senate here, prior to getting  here, I have been a tree farmer since the late eighties and have been  involved in the agricultural part of farming, other than driving the  tractor, for a long time. And farming has got to be one of the most  difficult things God ever created in terms of a complicated business  that involves risk for a return that, in many cases, just isn't there.  Thank goodness, currently, the markets are rewarding that effort and  that great risk.   Environmental credits present an incredible opportunity for American  farmers because that bottom line is so meager to begin with. And when  you have got voluntarily markets out there that are wanting to reward  good stewardship, it should be easy. But significant barriers still  remain.   In today's market, if you are a small farmer, you are not able to  connect with these markets. Only the large farmers, both tree and egg,  can do it. This simplifies it; it democratizes it; and it does  something, finally, that that small guy, the landowner, the American  family farmer, can get some benefit for his or her good stewardship.   The Growing Climate Solutions Act creates a USDA certification  program for third-party technical providers and verifiers. It allows  the USDA to provide legitimacy to the trustworthy actors in the  marketplace. And what is really unusual, in the short time I have been  here in the U.S. Senate--it was a surprise yesterday, when I told some  folks we are actually voting on something on the floor, and it has 55  cosponsors, almost evenly split between Democrats and Republicans.   More than 100 outside organizations back the bill. Farm bureaus,  which are generally very conservative about doing anything where they  are going to endorse, stick their neck out, across the board like it. I  won't mention all the others. It also does it without adding a dime to  our deficit. So it is doing something that has got bipartisan support,  tapping voluntary markets, and just providing that portal that all  farmers are familiar with to use as the way they take advantage of it.   We are demonstrating the right solution. We are making a statement  that we need to be involved in addressing climate, and we are doing it  in a place where, thank goodness, agriculture in this country is only  10 percent of the CO2 emissions. The rest is spread among  electric generation, transportation, industrial emitters.   What that says, when it is 25 percent emissions across the world due  to agriculture, there is a lot to be learned from this as well.   A quick comment on the amendment that we are going to vote on. The  key point is, under both the underlying bill and the Lee amendment, the  USDA will publish a list of entities on a USDA website for farmers to  use.   The Senate Ag Committee worked closely with the Agency, both Under  Secretaries Perdue and Vilsack, to ensure the bill provided the  necessary quality checks so that the folks certified under the program  know what they are doing.   The Lee amendment keeps the website but strikes these requirements.  [[Page S4738]]  This is why groups like the American Farm Bureau write that Senator  Lee's amendment would dilute farmers' influence in the composition of  the bill's advisory panel and also removes critical protections in the  base bill.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the Lee amendment and to support the  underlying bill   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                American Farm Bureau Federation,                                      Washington, DC, June 23, 2021.      Members of the U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator, The American Farm Bureau Federation supports       S. 1251, the bipartisan Growing Climate Solutions Act of       2021, and urges its adoption by the Senate.        The Growing Climate Solutions Act would create a       certification program at USDA to help solve technical entry       barriers for farmers, ranchers and forest landowners who wish       to participate in voluntary carbon credit markets. Lack of       access to reliable information about markets, qualified       technical assistance providers, and credit protocol verifiers       has limited both landowner participation and the adoption of       practices.        S. 1251 seeks to provide more clarity and guidance for       farmers, ranchers and forest landowners who want to provide       the ecosystem services that many consumers and businesses are       desiring. This builds upon American agriculture's strong       foundation of environmental stewardship.        Farm Bureau opposes the Lee amendment and any other       amendments that would undermine the bill. The Lee amendment       would replace the balanced, and widely supported, program       outlined in the current bill with a haphazard alternative       program that would undermine confidence in the private       marketplace. Sen. Lee's amendment goes on to dilute farmer       influence in the composition of the bill's advisory panel,       and also removes critical protections in the base bill to       ensure farmers and ranchers receive their fair share of       proceeds under voluntary environmental credit markets.        The Growing Climate Solutions Act of 2021 is a carefully       crafted bipartisan bill with over half the Senate supporting       as cosponsors. Your vote in opposition to the Lee amendment       and in support of final passage of the overall bill is key to       Farm Bureau.            Sincerely,                                                      Zippy Duvall,                                                         President.                                          ____                                                     June 15, 2021.      Re Support Final Passage of S. 1251.       Members of the U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Members of the U.S. Senate, We write to lend our       support for the Growing Climate Solutions Act without changes       or amendments that would weaken the bill. Our organizations       recognize that there is immense potential for agricultural       and forestry-based natural climate solutions to meaningfully       contribute to the fight against climate change. Farmers,       ranchers, and foresters are on the front lines of severe       weather events that are exacerbated by the changing climate.       The Growing Climate Solutions Act will help producers remain       resilient in the face of these threats and accelerate their       contribution to a solution.        The Growing Climate Solutions Act is a thoughtful and       nuanced piece of legislation that ensures that farmers are at       the forefront in tapping into the potential benefits of a       market-based revenue system that rewards climate-smart       agricultural practices. The bill is also drafted to ensure       that benefits and revenues realized under voluntary market       regimes are designed to be equitably distributed among all       farmers, including small and beginning farmers, historically       underserved farmers, and socially disadvantaged farmers. The       bill makes tangible progress in highlighting these important       stakeholders throughout.        Thank you again for your leadership on this important       legislation. We are proud to lend our support to the Growing       Climate Solutions Act and encourage the Senate to the pass       without changes or amendments that would weaken the bill and       at the earliest possible date.            Sincerely,      Citizens Climate Lobby,      Environmental Defense Fund,      The Evangelical Environmental Network,      National Audubon Society,      National Wildlife Federation,      The Nature Conservancy.                                          ____                                     Corn Refiners Association,                                                     Washington, DC.        The Corn Refiners Association (CRA) strongly supports final       passage of S. 1251, the Growing Climate Solutions Act of       2021. This bipartisan legislation reduces technical entry       barriers for producers and forest owners interested in       participating in voluntary carbon markets and supports our       sector's role in delivering innovative climate solutions.        The Growing Climate Solutions Act reflects CRA's climate       change principles, which guide our industry's advocacy to       ensure a more sustainable future for corn refining,       agriculture, and consumers. By lowering this barrier to       entry, S. 1251 creates an easier way for landowners to be       financially rewarded for the voluntary, sustainable steps       they are taking through selling carbon credits.        Unfortunately, the amendment proposed by Senator Mike Lee       (R-UT) would undercut the central function of this bill by       removing most of the scientific and good governance       requirements to become certified under the bill's central       program by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Without these       critical protections, many farmers and producers will not       have access to reliable information, resulting in unrealistic       cost estimates and loss of trust in the carbon markets. Lee's       amendment would also remove protections for farmers already       certified under the program and would remove the       legislation's focus on equity that is intended to ensure       farmers of color would benefit from the program and inform       its creation.        For these reasons, we strongly urge you to vote No on the       Lee amendment and Yes on final passage of S. 1251, the       Growing Climate Solutions Act. If there are any questions       about our position, or interest in holding a brief discussion       on the legislation or Lee's amendment, please contact me.       Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                    Robin J. Bowen,                           Senior Vice President, External Affairs.                                          ____                                          Citizens for Responsible                                                 Energy Solutions,                                      Washington, DC, June 23, 2021.      Hon. Mike Braun.      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Braun, On behalf of Citizens for Responsible       Energy Solutions (CRES), I am writing to offer CRES' strong       support for S. 1251, the Growing Climate Solutions Act       (GCSA). This bill was reported by the Senate Agriculture       Committee on a unanimous vote and has been cosponsored by 24       Republican Senators. CRES urges the Senate to pass this       bipartisan legislation in its current form.        GCSA will break down barriers for farmers, ranchers, and       landowners to participate in voluntary carbon credit markets.       The bill directs the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to       establish a program to certify third-party verifiers and       technical assistance providers. This program will connect       producers to the experts that will help them earn an       additional stream of revenue by monetizing conservation       practices, which already produce many soil, water, and air       benefits.        This bill establishes a council comprised primarily of       experienced farmers and ranchers to advise USDA on program       implementation and standards, which will ensure that       producers come first in this limited-government approach.       GCSA also contains provisions guaranteeing that the program       will remain voluntary, that third parties will provide       accurate estimates of costs and revenues, and that revenues       will be distributed fairly to farms of all types and sizes.       These provisions are among the reasons the GCSA has the       overwhelming support of agricultural leaders, including       endorsements from the American Farm Bureau, National Corn       Growers Association, and American Soybean Association.        Addressing climate change while strengthening our       international competitiveness will require innovation across       all sectors of our economy--including agriculture. CRES       thanks you and Chairwoman Stabenow and Ranking Member       Boozman, for your judicious, bipartisan work on this       commonsense legislation that puts agriculture first while       providing a real path for decreased carbon emissions. S.       1251, in its current form, should be expeditiously passed by       the U.S. Senate.        Thank you for your leadership on this critical issue.            Sincerely,                                                     Heather Reams,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                Food and Agriculture                                                Climate Alliance,                                                      June 23, 2021.      Re Support Final Passage of S. 1251 and Oppose Lee Amendment.         To the Members of the U.S. Senate: The Food and Agriculture       Climate Alliance (FACA) strongly supports final passage of S.       1251, the Growing Climate Solutions Act of 2021. This       bipartisan legislation reduces technical entry barriers for       producers and forest owners interested in participating in       voluntary carbon markets. FACA consists of nearly 80       organizations representing farmers, ranchers, forest owners,       agribusinesses, manufacturers, the food and innovation       sector, state governments, sportsmen and environmental       advocates. We commend Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman       Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Ranking Member John Boozman (R-      Ark.) and Senator Mike Braun (R-lnd.) for crafting       overwhelmingly bipartisan legislation that supports our       sectors' role in delivering innovative climate solutions.        One of FACA's guiding principles states that federal       climate policy must be built upon voluntary, incentive-based       programs and market-driven opportunities. By fostering the       growth of voluntary markets, S. 1251 does just that.        Unfortunately, the amendment proposed by Senator Mike Lee       (R-Utah) undercuts the  [[Page S4739]]       central function of this bill by eliminating the scientific       and good governance requirements that technical assistance       providers and third-party verifiers would need to meet to       become certified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The       certification program is critical to ensure that farmers are       protected in the emerging marketplace and have access to       reliable information.        For these reasons, we strongly urge you to vote No on the       Lee amendment and Yes on final passage of S. 1251, the       Growing Climate Solutions Act.
