 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I commend Congresswoman Lofgren for her tremendous leadership on this  important legislation, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act.   I join with Mr. LaMalfa, my friend, my Italian America colleague from  California, in his strong remarks for this bill.   It is bipartisan, and it is important for us to pass it.   I proudly join all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this bill, a historic victory for farmworkers and for growers,  which ensures that America can continue to feed the world.   I salute, again, Chair Zoe Lofgren for her months of tough,  relentless leadership without which this bill would not be possible.   I commend the leadership of the United Farm Workers. Arturo Rodriguez  has been working on this bill for almost a generation, 17 years. Arturo  Rodriguez and Teresa Romero have sent a statement of support for the  legislation, which very clearly points out the need and the answer that  this bill is about.   I submit for the Record the United Farm Workers statement of support  for the Farm Workforce Modernization Act.   United Farm Workers Support for the Farm Workforce Modernization Act                            (H.R. 5038--Lofgren)         The United Farm Workers of America supports the bipartisan       Farm Workforce Modernization Act (H.R. 5038). We were proud       to join the bipartisan group of members of Congress and the       major grower associations to develop and support H.R. 5038.       It is cruelly ironic that the people who feed the United       States live in a deep, all-encompassing fear that they       themselves cannot provide food for their families. The human       cost and stress for farm workers and their families as they       live in fear of deportation and harassment due to our broken       immigration system threatens our nation's food supply and is       a source of great shame for our nation. The compromise       legislation authored by Representatives Lofgren, cosponsored       by a bipartisan, diverse group of over 50 members of the       House, and endorsed by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus will       go a long way towards improving the lives of farm workers       today and in the future, and our broken immigration system.        We support H.R. 5038 for a simple reason--it will make the       lives of all farm workers better. H.R. 5038 meets the       following basic principles:        1. Equality of Treatment--the new agricultural visa program       will allow farm workers and their families to have the same       rights and protections as current U.S. farm workers.        2. No Discrimination--the program does not create major       incentives to discriminate against U.S. workers (including       newly legalized workers).        3. Fairness in pay--the pay rates protect U.S. workers and       supports predictable pay increases.        4. Eligibility to earn permanent residence--no one that       works to feed our country should be condemned to permanent       second class status. H.R. 5038 changes our current immoral       system.        You have the ability to pass H.R. 5038. If H.R. 5038       becomes law, agricultural workers will have stability for       themselves, and their families and the agricultural industry.       Please vote YES on H.R. 5038.      Teresa Romero,        President, United Farm Workers.      Arturo S. Rodriguez,        President Emeritus and former Board Chair, United Farm       Workers and UFW Foundation.    So many Members brought their vision, their voices, their  values to this process. I thank all of you for strengthening the bill  we have on the floor today. I thank our friends from the groups for  doing the outside organizing that makes our inside maneuvering  successful. We have all been inspired by the immortal words of our  beloved Dolores Huerta: ``Si, se puede.''   This legislation honors workers' dignity and supports the farm  economy with strong, smart reforms. The bill provides a path for  legalization, as Mr. LaMalfa referenced, for currently undocumented  farmworkers. No one who works to feed our country should be condemned  to permanent second-class status.   The bill secures the agricultural workforce of the future by  updating, expanding, and strengthening the H-2A initiative to ensure  that farms have stable, secure workforces.   Critically, it demands fair, humane treatment for farmworkers,  following the lead of legislation in California by securing fairness in  pay, improving access to quality housing, and ensuring robust safety  and heat illness protections.                                time  1530    Many in this Chamber, particularly, I know firsthand, from  California, have  [[Page H10076]]  helped lead the fight for farmworkers for decades.   This fight is not only about ensuring fair wages and fair treatment,  but about honoring the spark of divinity within each person, which  makes us all worthy of dignity and respect.   This bill honors the 2 million farmworkers who are the backbone of  our economy and country, powering our farm economy, and producing the  food on our tables, even as they persevere through harsh working  conditions and low wages.   As the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops wrote last month  in support of this bill: ``The dignity of work of farmworkers and their  families is a central concern. . . . Farmworkers produce the food that  we eat and contribute to the care of our community.''   This legislation is a critical step forward for workers, for growers,  and for the farm economy, but our work is not done. Led by Chair Zoe  Lofgren and Members from every corner of the country, we will continue  to work to stabilize the farm economy, protect workers and their  families, and maintain America's proud agricultural preeminence in the  world.   As we do so, remember the words of the late Cesar Chavez. He said  this: ``To make a great dream come true, the first requirement is a  great capacity to dream; the second is persistence.''   Madam Speaker, I thank Chair Lofgren for her persistence, and I thank  Mr. Rodriguez for his help.   I am pleased with the bipartisanship of this bill. I thank our  Members for their persistence on this legislation, for which I urge a  strong bipartisan vote.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Buck for his leadership on this as well.
