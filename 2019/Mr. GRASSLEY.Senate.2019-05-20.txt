 Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about two  different subjects. One of them will be just 1 minute, and that deals  with the fact that May is National Foster Care Month. I want to mention  a couple of things about foster care because of my work in that area  for the last 25 years.   I have often heard from young people that they wish someone had  helped their parents so that they could have stayed together as a  family. We can work in Congress to improve the foster care system, but,  ultimately, kids need a family.   That is why I was proud to support the Family First Prevention  Services Act. This bill will help families to stay together by funding  proven services and support for parents. As the implementation process  continues on this new piece of legislation, I will work to ensure that  this legislation succeeds for families across the country, because for  two-and-a-half decades I have been hearing from these young people in  foster care: I would like to have a home, and I would like to have a  mom and dad.                            ____________________     Mr. President, besides May being National Foster Care  Month, it is also Mental Health Awareness Month. This month of May  gives us an opportunity to increase public awareness about the  challenges faced by those struggling with mental illness. It also  encourages us to consider reforms to policies that affect these  individuals as well as their friends and family members.   Almost one in five adults in the United States copes with mental  illness in any given year, and roughly 20 million Americans struggle  with substance abuse disorder, and less than half will get the  treatment that they need.   In the 114th Congress, the previous one, I cosponsored and led the  Judiciary Committee in approving legislation to update and extend the  Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act. Up to half of  our Nation's prison population may suffer from mental illness. Jails  and prisons hold 10 times as many people with mental illness than  hospitals do, according to the National Sheriffs' Association.   In the 115th Congress, I introduced and led the Senate in adopting  reforms to tackle substance abuse, mental health, and other issues that  may drive children and teenagers into the juvenile justice system.  These reforms, which recently were enacted as part of the Juvenile  Justice Reform Act, encourages States to devote Federal grants to  improving treatment of juvenile offenders with mental illness and  substance abuse. The enactment of these two measures is very important,  but even saying that, we still have lots of work to do in the area of  substance abuse and mental illness.   First, lack of mental health resources poses a huge challenge. Now I  am chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. I intend to be committed  to this area and explore new options for increasing access to quality  mental healthcare.   Second, we still have a long way to go to promote parity in mental  health  [[Page S2952]]  and substance abuse treatment. I am committed to building upon existing  efforts and finding new ways to end the stigma attached to mental  health diseases.   Third, experts tell us that it is important to standardize care for  behavioral health and addiction medicines.   Fourth, we may need to equip doctors with more tools to respond to  the opioid epidemic that has gripped the Nation and takes the lives of  130 Americans every day. For example, Federal regulations prevent a  patient's doctor from reviewing that patient's substance abuse records.  This policy is intended, appropriately, to protect patient privacy, and  that is a very important goal, but if it hinders coordination of care,  we may have reasons to be concerned. In some cases, doctors must have  access to a patient's entire medical history in order to adequately  recognize, respond to, and treat the symptoms of addiction.   I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in identifying  bipartisan solutions to these issues. Doing so will help to improve the  lives of many Americans who struggle with mental health and substance  abuse disorders.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
