 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Terry  Dickson for his achievement of being named a recipient of the American  Patriot Award.   During the Vietnam war, Terry served as an infantry squad leader in  the 196th Light Infantry Brigade and received the distinction of the  Combat Infantryman Badge for his incredible service.   After his service, he began a career at the Florida Times-Union where  he became an award-winning newspaper photographer and wrote pieces on a  wide variety of subjects.   Terry has worked at The Brunswick News in my district since 2019,  where he continues to work as reporter, photographer, and pens a weekly  column.   Terry has received many awards at the local, State, Federal, and even  international levels for his work, both in columns and photography.   Among a list of incredible past recipients, Terry is adding his name  onto an honorable group of American patriots.   The American Patriot Award is a given to a veteran who has served  their country with distinction and continued that throughout their  career.   Terry is the epitome of this award, serving tremendously in the  Vietnam war and as a journalist following his service.   I congratulate Terry for receiving this incredible award. He deserves  it.    Paying Tribute to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Accreditation                                   Board     Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to  the Federal Law Enforcement Training Accreditation Board, FLETA, as  they celebrate their 20th anniversary on July 1, 2022.   The FLETA board of directors, located in my district, is comprised of  28 senior officials from varying Federal law enforcement agencies,  academia, and professional organizations.   Since the FLETA Board's inception, more than 75 training  organizations, spanning from 47 agencies and 10 departments across the  executive and judicial branches of the Government, have submitted  training programs for voluntary review and have sought accreditation  through FLETA, in which they have completed 389 of those assessments.   The FLETA Office of Accreditation is one of smallest entities in the  Federal Government, with only seven Government employees. Yet, they  have an extensive impact on Federal training and operations.   FLETA assists law enforcement agencies in virtually every department  of the Federal Government, improving operations through the  implementation of more effective and efficient training tactics.   The mission of FLETA is more important now than ever before. This  agency's efforts are demonstrative of good government in action,  practicing accountability through self-regulation, which exhibits the  transparency that Americans expect of their government.   On behalf of the citizens of Georgia and this distinguished body, I  once again congratulate FLETA on their 20th anniversary and wish them  much continued success in the future.                            Recognizing Don Hogan     Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  my friend, Don Hogan, a State house representative, a county  commissioner, and a fellow Bulldog.   Don received an education from both Georgia Southern University and  the University of Georgia.   He has served as a board member of the Golden Isles Chamber of  Commerce, president of the Saint Simons Chamber of Commerce, area  commissioner for the Boy Scouts of America, and on the advisory council  of the Coastal Area Planning and Development Commission.   I am honored to recognize Don as the 42nd recipient of the Alfred W.  Jones, Sr. award. This award is given each year to honor a person whose  selfless lifetime commitment, contributions, and achievements have  positively impacted our community and its people.   After many years of service, Don has decided not to run for  reelection this November and will be going into retirement after a  lengthy career of service to others.   I know Don is looking forward to spending time on his family farm,  fishing, and telling stories sitting on the porch of his 150-year-old  log cabin.   It was a pleasure and an honor to spend time with Don in the Georgia  State legislature. I thank him for everything he has done for our  State, and he should enjoy his well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we are all witnessing the decline in America's mental  health brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Between family members  and friends, we all are either affected ourselves or we know someone  with a mental health condition. I am a father and a grandfather, and  there is nothing more important to me than the safety and well-being of  my children and grandchildren.   The urgency to address this mental health crisis has become more dire  as we are seeing how fear, anxiety, and particularly isolation have  compounded these issues. We owe it to our constituents to turn despair  into hope and keep our children safe at school and in their community.   The Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act will help  communities provide much-needed lifesaving care to our children.  America's children are our Nation's future. It is time we take action  and protect our loved ones and pass the Restoring Hope for Mental  Health and Well-Being Act.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I encourage my colleagues to do  the same.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of a  beloved woman and an outstanding Georgian, Eleanor Ottoson.   Eleanor and her family were recently blessed to celebrate Eleanor's  105th birthday. Born on a warm day in May of 1917, Eleanor spread her  love across New Jersey and Pennsylvania before finally finding a home  in McIntosh County, Georgia.   Mrs. Ottoson diligently served her community as a registered nurse  and now continues this service as an active member of Morgan's Chapel  United Methodist Church.   A mother and a grandmother, Eleanor's heart holds no shortage of  love. She shares this love by helping around her church, knitting bags,  singing songs, and sharing her life with all those around her.   When asked about how she has lived to her outstanding age of 105,  Eleanor spoke of her lifelong commitment to health. Mrs. Ottoson never  smoked and never drank to excess. Instead, she made a point to  eat well, sleep well, and treat others well.    I smile when I hear about the great joy going on in the lives of my  constituents, and I am so thankful Eleanor's loved ones continue to  have her with them through these years.                            ____________________
