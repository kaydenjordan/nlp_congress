 Mr. President, I came to the floor yesterday to voice my  serious concerns with some of the remarks made by the Secretary of  State nominee, Rex Tillerson, in his hearing.   I was worried that his milquetoast posture toward Russia, especially  his failure to support strong U.S. sanctions--existing or proposed-- bespoke a fundamental misreading of the geopolitical climate and the  true nature of our international security challenges.   I was worried that, as Secretary of State, he only promised to recuse  himself from matters involving Exxon for a  [[Page S298]]  period of 12 months. Exxon's interests overseas aren't going away after  1 year. That is not good enough to resolve what is, potentially, a  massive conflict of interest.   I am worried that Mr. Tillerson, as CEO and chairman of ExxonMobil,  conducted business with all three foreign state sponsors of terrorism  through a foreign subsidiary in a way that allowed Exxon to evade U.S.  sanctions. As the head of Exxon, Mr. Tillerson did business with the  terrorism trifecta: Iran, Syria, and Sudan. This raises serious  questions that the man who is nominated to be the face of the United  States to the world has so much experience doing business with our most  prominent and concerning adversaries.   At the hearing, under questions from the senior Senator from New  Jersey and the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Tillerson denied having  knowledge of these dealings and directed the Senators to seek more  information from ExxonMobil itself. Three times he told the committee  that he ``did not recall'' any of the details. Throughout the  afternoon, it sounded like he was following the dodgeball rules for  confirmation hearings: Dodge, dip, duck, dive, and dodge. In fact, he  basically admitted it to the junior Senator from Virginia.   I just read in the Washington Post that, on three separate occasions,  the SEC, or the Securities and Exchange Commission, wrote letters  directed to Mr. Tillerson himself seeking more information on these  undisclosed dealings during his tenure as CEO and chairman--once on  January 6, 2006, once on May 4, 2006, and again on December 1, 2010.   In general, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt. But it  gives me great concern that Mr. Tillerson says he has zero recollection  of an SEC inquiry into his company's business dealings with foreign  state sponsors of terrorism--real concern. He got three letters from  the SEC on a matter of major, major importance that would concern the  whole corporation--the giant ExxonMobil--and he says he doesn't recall.  This is the kind of matter that should be handled and approved by an  organization's most senior leader.   Mr. Tillerson presents himself as a hands-on manager. It defies  credibility to believe he doesn't recall. This is extraordinarily  troubling because either one of two things is true. Either Mr.  Tillerson was aware of these SEC letters and was familiar with these  dealings but didn't want to answer the questions honestly, or, indeed,  he had no knowledge of consequential financial disclosures made by his  own company. If we consider that, in concert with all the other things  he claimed to have ``no knowledge of''--including the widely reported  extrajudicial killings in the Philippines, whether or not Saudi Arabia  was a human rights violator--imagine, he had no knowledge of whether  Saudi Arabia was a human rights violator; people in a fifth grade world  history class would know that--whether or not his company was engaged  in lobbying against, or perhaps for, energy sanctions--then maybe Mr.  Tillerson does not have the necessary management skills or knowledge  base to be the chief diplomat of the United States of America, running  a Department that is obviously worldwide, farflung, and with thousands  and thousands and thousands of employees.   Simply put, we need answers. What did Mr. Tillerson know and when did  he know it? The American people expect their Secretary of State to be  straightforward and honest with them--not coy, not dissembling. Most  importantly, they expect him or her to have the interests of the  American people and our friends and allies around the world at the  forefront of their mind.   Unfortunately for Mr. Tillerson, and for this country, yesterday's  hearings and today's reports raise more questions than answers. The  American people deserve answers.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
