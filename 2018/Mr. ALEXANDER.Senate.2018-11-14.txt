 Mr. President, I have come to the floor for three  different reasons. Out of courtesy to the Democratic leader, who I see  coming in, I will wait until he is here.    Good.   Mr. President, as the world knows, the country's largest public  utility is the Tennessee Valley Authority and serves 9 million  customers in our seven-state region. It is enormously important to our  State of Tennessee. Its CEO, Bill Johnson, announced today that he is  leaving. I will have more to say about him later, but he and the Board  of Directors have led TVA in an excellent direction, and it is now up  to the Board of Directors to choose his successor. It is a big job. As  I said, it is a $10 billion-a-year company.   John Ryder, of Memphis, was nominated by President Trump 282 days ago  to be one of those Directors. He has been approved by voice vote by the  Environment and Public Works committee. For the last 176 days, he has  been waiting for confirmation. He has the approval of the ranking  Democrat on the committee, the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper. He  has the approval of the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, Senator  Whitehouse. It is time Mr. Ryder, who is consistently named one of the  finest lawyers in Memphis--he has been recognized by Business Tennessee  Magazine as among the 101 Best Lawyers in Tennessee and listed in Best  Lawyers since 1987. In other words, he is a well-qualified,  noncontroversial nominee who is needed by the people of our region to  select a successor to Bill Johnson, the CEO. The other nominees have  been confirmed. The nominee from Alabama was confirmed. The nominee  from Kentucky was confirmed but not the nominee from Tennessee.   I am taking the step today of coming to the floor to ask that he be  confirmed by consent. I can think of no reason why he would not be.            Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar No. 856    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  consideration of executive calendar No. 856, the nomination of John  Ryder to be a member of the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley  Authority; that the Senate vote on the nomination with no intervening  action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table; that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's actions; that no further motions  be made in order; and that any statements relating to the nomination be  printed in the Record.    To my friend from New York, who is he talking about?  He knows my record. I worked with him three times when President Obama  was there, worked with him directly to make it easier for President  Obama to have nominees.   Let me go through that because I think it is important the people  know the efforts we made together. In 2011, working with the Senator  from New York, we got rid of secret holds. We permitted waiver of the  72-hour rule that was used to block nominations and delay. We created  272 expedited privilege nominations. In 2012, we eliminated Senate  confirmations for 163 positions, all to make it easier for President  Obama to make Presidential nominations. In 2013, we created some new  rules which said that Executive nominees could only be debated post- cloture for 8 hours and district judges for 2 hours.   I personally made sure the current chairman of the Democratic Party,  Tom Perez, got cloture so the Senate could vote on him. I voted against  him, but I made certain he could come to a vote.   When President Obama had a vacancy in the Department of Education in  his last year, I went to President Obama and said: Mr. President, I  think it is inappropriate for us not to have a confirmed Senate nominee  in a principal position like U.S. Secretary of Education. If you will  please nominate John King, with whom I disagree, I will make sure he is  confirmed, and we confirmed him. That has been my record in terms of  dealing with nominees of the President of an opposite party.   I ask through the Chair, why pick on Tennessee? Why confirm Kentucky  nominees, why confirm Alabama nominees, why work with me in three  different Congresses to make it easier for President Obama to confirm  nominees, why applaud me for allowing the chairman of the Democratic  Party today to be confirmed as Secretary of Labor and then block a  nominee for the Tennessee Valley Authority, who is eminently well- qualified, who is supported by the Democratic members of the committee  who have jurisdiction and who is needed on the Board to pick a CEO for  the millions of people in the seven-state region? Why pick on  Tennessee, I would say to my friend from New York through the Chair.    Mr. President, I don't know what he is talking about.  I am the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee. I have, during my time, regularly confirmed Democratic  nominees and Republican nominees. I have worked with the Democratic  leader to make it easier for President Obama to confirm nominees and  now he gives me no specific reason why he is objecting to the nominee  from Tennessee.   I ask him further--even though he has left the floor in what I would  consider to be an act of discourtesy while I am speaking to him, and I  mean that. I am very upset about this. I consider that an act of  discourtesy when the Democratic leader leaves the floor while I am  speaking directly to him through the Chair on a matter of importance to  9 million people in our area. I ask him what kind of precedent is he  setting, the Democratic leader.   Let's think about this for a minute. One hundred and nineteen times  the majority leader, Senator McConnell, has had to file cloture to cut  off debate in order to just get a vote on a nominee like Mr. Ryder,  named one of the best lawyers in Tennessee since 1987, approved by  Democratic colleagues, needed by the Tennessee Valley Authority,  certain to be confirmed here almost unanimously. One hundred and  nineteen times the Democratic opposition has required the Republican  leader, Senator McConnell, to use a whole week to confirm a nominee.  That happened 12 times to President Obama. That happened four times to  President George W. Bush. It happened 12 times to President Clinton and  zero times to George H.W. Bush, whose administration I served in. That  is the number of cloture votes on nominees required for previous  Presidents in the same timeframe as President Trump. What kind of  precedent does this set?   Let's talk about that for a moment. This is a body of precedents. For  many years, we always confirmed nominees with 51 votes. That was until  George W. Bush became President of the United States and the Senator  from New York, before he was a Democratic leader, and others, decided  they would use a cloture vote, a requirement for 60 votes, to block  George W. Bush's nominees.   That was the first time that it had happened. Up until that time, the  tradition of this body was that while you could require 60 votes, at  least since about 1920, no one ever did. Even Clarence Thomas--and that  was a very controversial Supreme Court nomination--was confirmed by 52  to 48. No one thought at the time of requiring that his nomination  require 60 votes. They could have but didn't. So that was the tradition  in the Senate--always nominations by 51 votes. The one exception in the  Supreme Court throughout the history of the Senate was Abe Fortas,  under President Johnson, and that was an unusual situation. Never had a  Federal district judge been required to have 60 votes.   In fact, what the Democratic leader--I wish he were here on the floor  to hear this--may have forgotten is that Senator McConnell tried at one  time to require a cloture vote of Judge McConnell in Rhode Island, and  I and a number of other Republicans objected because we had never done  that before. We had never said that you have to have 60 votes to be  confirmed as a Federal district judge. So we rejected that motion by  the Republican leader, and as a result of that, never in the history of  the Senate had we required 60 votes for a Federal district judge to be  confirmed. Never in the history of the Senate had we required 60 votes  for a Cabinet member to be confirmed. But then in the early years of  George W. Bush, in 2003, I had just come to the Senate. The Senator  from New York and others said: Well, we will do that for the first  time. We will block George W. Bush's nominees.   I don't want to debate that back and forth today except to say that  became a precedent. And, sure enough, what goes around comes around. A  few years later, by 2013, things had gotten so that the Democrats  decided to break the rules to change the rules and used the so-called  nuclear option, and when Republicans did the same thing that the  Senator from New York had done, Democrats overruled that and seated  judges on the Court of Appeals.   So as a result of the precedent set by the Senator from New York on  judges with George W. Bush, we had the nuclear option in the Senate, a  using of that. Republicans then did what the Democrats did. That is  what you call precedent.   Well, it happened a second time. That first use of the nuclear option  left it so you could require 60 votes in order to have a Supreme Court  Justice.   When President Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to be a Supreme Court  Justice, the Democrats filibustered Justice Gorsuch, an enormously  well-qualified person. Remember, throughout the history of the country,  we had not blocked a Supreme Court Justice by filibuster with that  single exception of the Abe Fortas instance. Yet they did that. And as  a result of that, the Republicans then said: Well, we will use the  nuclear option and change the rules to 51. So that is what happened  with the precedent.   Now let's look at this precedent. Are we going to block for 282  days--let me get my numbers exactly right; it is 176 days on the  calendar awaiting confirmation--a noncontroversial Board of Directors  member for the Tennessee Valley Authority. That is what we have come  to.   So are we going to say, as the U.S. Senate minority, that we will  effectively block--we will effectively block--those kinds of  nominations and effectively keep an elected President from setting up a  government? Is that what we are going to say?  [[Page S6953]]    It looks like that is what we are saying if you are going to say that  119 times the majority leader of the Senate of whichever party will  have to invoke cloture. That means it takes 3 or 4 days to confirm even  a noncontroversial Presidential nomination, when there are 1,200 such  nominations.   Let's say we have a Democratic President one day and a Republican  U.S. Senate, or a Republican President and a Democratic U.S. Senate.  But let's just for purposes of discussion, since we are talking about  precedent, let's say the Democrats make a big comeback and elect a  Democratic President next time around. It is only 2 years before the  Presidential election.   And let's say the Republicans stay in power and still have a majority  in the Senate and Republicans say: Well, we are a body of precedent. We  will do to the Democratic President exactly what the Senate did to  President Trump.   If Republicans are in the majority, the Democratic President might  not even be able to staff the government because the Republicans could  say: We will not confirm anybody.   Or even if the Republicans were to be in the minority and there were  a Democratic President and the Republican minority did to the next  Democratic President what this minority is doing to this one, then 119  times you would see this happen, at least through the first part of the  administration.   So where does that leave us as a Government of the United States?   Well, here is where it would leave us. It would leave us with a  government of the United States with the Senate having no role in the  appointment of its principal officers. That is what it would leave,  because there is on the books legislation called the Vacancies Act,  which allows any President of the United States to appoint acting  people to all of the positions in the government. They can serve for  210 days at least, and there are a wide variety of people who can be  chosen for those positions. They can be people who are confirmed or  they can be senior people in the government.   We happen to have an example of that today in the United States  Department of Justice--Matthew Whitaker. The Attorney General, Jeff  Sessions, whom I admire and all of us know, resigned at the request of  the President. And instead of nominating or picking a Senate-confirmed  successor as the Acting Attorney General of the United States,  President Trump did, as the Vacancies Act allows him to do, appointed  Matthew Whitaker, Attorney General Sessions' Chief of Staff. I suppose  a President could do that for every position.   I mentioned earlier that toward the end of President Obama's term, he  had no Education Secretary. Arne Duncan had decided to leave, and they  used the Vacancies Act to allow John King, who was not confirmed by the  Senate, in effect, to be the Acting Secretary of Education.   As I said earlier, I had that conversation with President Obama. I  said: Mr. President, I believe that, institutionally, we should have a  Senate-confirmed Secretary of Education. Even if I disagree, as I did,  with John King's education views, I will see to it that if you nominate  him, he is confirmed. President Obama did that. He respected the  importance of having institutionally confirmed principal officers in  the government, and then we confirmed him.   So I don't know where this is leading us. I think this is the same  kind of dangerous precedent that was established when Democrats for the  first time used a 60-vote opportunity to block President George W.  Bush's judges, and what the Democrats then did--what most of them tell  me they wish they hadn't done--was that they used the nuclear option  and required a 51-vote cloture. So now they can't eventually block  anyone, even John Ryder, if we all decide that we want to take a whole  week to confirm him. That is what Senator McConnell has been doing. He  has been putting a priority on district judges and on circuit judges,  and the Democrats have been saying: We are going to slow you down.   But you can't win that way. All that happens is that the Senate  gradually gives up its advise-and-consent authority under the  Constitution to help the President form a government. That is one of  the important parts of what we do in this government.   The late Justice Scalia said: Every tin horn dictator has a bill of  rights. What the United States has that is different is checks and  balances. One of the most important parts of that checks and balances  is for the Senate to advise and consent on about 1,200 different  Presidential nominees.   That is why I worked with Senator Schumer and other Democrats, like  Senator Levin, and Republicans, like Senator McCain and Senator  Barrasso, and we took steps during the Obama administration three  different times to reduce the number of Presidential nominees, to speed  up Presidential nominees, and to put 272 of them at a privileged status  so they could come through more rapidly.   This goes in entirely the opposite direction, and it is a terrible  precedent for this institution. So I am extremely disappointed.   I am disappointed for John Ryder, who is a prominent lawyer, who  thought he might get to be on the TVA Board and was nominated 282 days  ago. I am disappointed for the people of Tennessee and the Tennessee  Valley Authority region. There are millions of people who have had a  very good Chief Executive Officer for the TVA for the last several  years in Bill Johnson and now need a fully functioning Board of  Directors to pick his successor, and yet the Democrats say: Even though  we approve of him, even though we have no reason not to confirm him, we  are just going to slow the train down just because we can.   Well, if they can, someone else can later. That does not serve the  people well. I don't see any partisan political advantage to the  Democrats for doing something like this. I never have thought that. I  always thought that it was the right thing to do to let a President  staff his administration. If you don't like the nominee, you can always  vote no, but at least you can have a vote.   So he is talking about bipartisan packages. This nominee has been  waiting for a long, long time. So I am not through with this. I think  this is something that the people of Tennessee are going to be very  disappointed about, and I would ask my friend from New York again: Why  are you picking on Tennessee? Why would you confirm the Alabama  nominee? Why would you confirm the Kentucky nominee? And why would you  not confirm the Tennessee nominee? Why would you make him swing in the  wind for 176 days when everybody approves of him--even the Democratic  ranking member of the committee and Democratic ranking member of the  subcommittee? Something smells here, and it is a bad precedent for the  Senate. It is not good for our country, and it is completely contrary  to the way that I have enjoyed working with the Senator from New York  in 2011, 2012, 2013 to make it easier, then, for President Obama, but  later for every President of the United States, to have his  Presidential nominees promptly considered by the Senate and voted up or  down.   While I am on the subject of the Tennessee Valley Authority, I want  to mention the fact that Bill Johnson, who has been the Chief Executive  Officer of the Tennessee Valley Authority for the last several years  announced today in a Board meeting of the TVA of Mississippi of his  intention to retire next year. My hope would be that John Ryder, whose  term could have begun earlier this year, would be there to help select  his successor. Bill Johnson and the board have done a good job for the  last few years with TVA. They have reduced its debt. They have kept  electricity prices low. They provided a reliable, ample supply of  electricity for a rapidly growing part of America, making it easier for  us to recruit jobs, and the air is clean.   As I will say more about this in just a minute, the new Foothills  Parkway opened just outside the Great Smoky Mountains this past  weekend, and it was packed with local people. On Sunday I was up there  myself. We can see the mountains because TVA, over the last several  years, has put pollution control equipment on all of its coal plants,  and we could immediately see the difference. Other Federal regulations  have made the air cleaner.   In fact, a lawsuit from North Carolina with TVA to keep dirty air  from Tennessee from blowing into North Carolina has now been made a  Federal regulation, and dirty air from Kentucky or Texas or other  States can't  [[Page S6954]]  blow into Tennessee. The result is that when you come see the Great  Smoky Mountains, you can call them the Great Smoky Mountains and not  the great smoggy mountains, which they were some time ago.   So I would congratulate Bill Johnson on his tenure as CEO. He has got  TVA on the right track, and I would urge the Board of Directors to  think long and hard as they select someone to fill his shoes because as  a former Governor of that State and now as a U.S. Senator from  Tennessee for 16 years, I know the importance of having ample supply of  low-cost clean electricity to heat our homes, run our computers, and  attract our jobs.   Now, I have a Thanksgiving thought, to move away from the  disagreeable, acrimonious dealings of the Senate for a moment.
