 Madam Speaker, I hear my colleagues on the  other side today, one after another, crying about the replenishment of  the PPP. They wanted to keep it as originally designed, where 4 percent  of the borrowers got 45 percent of the money. I think the farms and  dairies and small mom-and-pop shops in my district and across the  country should get loans before big steakhouses.   I am proud of the work my Caucus has done to make the PPP a more  equitable program, plus getting sorely needed funds for hospitals and  testing, which we all know is what is required to reopen our economy.
