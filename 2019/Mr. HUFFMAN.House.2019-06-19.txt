 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this bipartisan amendment would stop the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration from moving forward  with a rulemaking that would change the Federal consistency process  under the Coastal Zone Management Act, known as the CZMA.   The purpose of the CZMA is to give coastal States a strong voice in  Federal agency decisionmaking for activities that affect a State's  coastal uses and resources, including Outer Continental Shelf oil and  gas development.   Federal consistency is the cornerstone of the CZMA. It provides the  platform and process for coordination between States, industry, and  stakeholders; helps anticipate and proactively avoid conflict; and  helps protect the interests of coastal communities. It is a prime  example of successful cooperative federalism, and it is key to long- term management of coasts around the country.   NOAA published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking in March  regarding changes to the Federal consistency regulations to make the  process ``more efficient,'' but there are already clear guidelines and  timelines for Federal consistency review, and it has a proven track  record of efficiency and cooperation. It is clear that there is no need  for NOAA to change the process.   Maintaining the Federal consistency process is especially critical  now, as this administration continues to look for ways to get around  the clear opposition to offshore drilling from coastal States,  communities, and elected officials from both sides of the aisle.   Earlier this week, State Representative Peter McCoy, a Republican  from South Carolina, wrote an op-ed about why the CZMA is so important.  He wrote: ``The consistency review authorities under CZMA have never  been more important than right now . . . this move to potentially alter  CZMA would undermine States' control and take away our ability to  protect our coastlines.''   That is why I have joined in offering an amendment by South Carolina  Representative   Joe Cunningham, as well as our colleagues Florida  Representative Francis Rooney and California Representative Salud  Carbajal.                                time  1830    All of us know firsthand how important CZMA is to protecting our  coastal districts. We have to ensure that States are able to fully  weigh in on Federal activity off their shores. They are the ones most  at risk. Their businesses, communities, and lands and waters will be  left to deal with the economic and environmental costs of offshore oil  and gas development.   Mr. Chair, I urge an ``aye'' vote on this amendment, and I yield the  balance of my time.
