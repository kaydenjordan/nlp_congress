 Madam Speaker, I thank the extraordinary men and women  who serve us in the United States Postal Service.   I rise today to highlight President Trump's shameless attempts to  degrade the United States Postal Service, a revered American  institution. These actions not only undermine our elections, they are  gambling with people's lives.   These past several weeks I have received thousands of emails, calls,  and letters from constituents pleading that these changes be reversed.  Just this week I heard from a constituent with diabetes who feared her  family was at risk of losing their insurance after learning her payment  had arrived 1 month late after it was mailed. Her story is, sadly one  of many being heard across the Nation.   COVID-19 has already brought on significant financial trouble for so  many families. To further hurt working families now facing late fees on  rent or car payments through no fault of their own is unconscionable.   House Democrats have promised to get government working for the  people, and today's bill is another example of that commitment.   Everybody loves the Post Office. It has been with us since the  founding of our country, knitting together communities, and this  attempt to undermine and degrade services is not only undermining  services to our constituents, it is threatening our democracy.                            ____________________
