 Mr. President, fellow Senators, I rise today in honor of  and to speak about the importance of small businesses--in particular,  in relation to National Small Business Week.   Idaho's small businesses are the engine that powers our State's  economy. They provide us with not only goods and services, local jobs,  and growth opportunities, but also immeasurable community value.   With the onset and spread of COVID-19, this year has presented  Idaho's business owners with challenges not seen in our lifetime. Even  under normal circumstances, business ownership takes remarkable courage  and commitment. With the pandemic, the challenges associated with  entrepreneurship have increased dramatically. Throughout 2020, Idaho's  small businesses have shown tremendous determination as they have  strived to serve their customers and keep their doors open to people in  their communities.   During this year's National Small Business Week, I want to take this  opportunity to recognize the resilience and courage of small businesses  throughout the Gem State and encourage Idahoans to continue to support  the local shops, restaurants, and businesses that make our communities  vibrant.   I firmly believe that small business relief is a shared, bipartisan  priority. Here in the Senate, we will continue to work to deliver  relief to Idaho's small businesses so that we can get back on the path  to recapturing the unprecedented prosperity our economy provided before  this crisis began.   Idahoans are set apart by their grit, self-reliance, and their deep  commitment to community. I am constantly reminded of this and proud of  it when I see Idaho's small businesses enduring and supporting one  another through these uncertain times.
