 Mr. Speaker, last month, House Republicans passed  the AHCA, which would repeal the Affordable Care Act, and now  Republican Senators are working on their own version.   So far, we know the plan they are developing will be a disaster for  our economy and for countless Americans who will either pay more for  their healthcare or struggle to afford coverage at all. The Senate plan  would force working families to pay higher premiums, end Medicaid as we  know it, and could make health insurance nearly unaffordable for people  with preexisting conditions and older Americans.   At this point, we don't know more details of the Senate plan because  the Republican leadership is attempting to deny the American people a  voice in their own healthcare system.   We need a healthcare reform that lowers cost, expands coverage, and  strengthens our economy. We need legislation written in the light of  day that can survive public debate. We do not need this.                            ____________________
