 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the groundbreaking  of the country's most important infrastructure project, the Hudson  River Tunnel.   Officials are about to start construction of a new Tonnelle Avenue  Bridge. It will help connect New Jersey to a new Hudson River Tunnel.   The benefits of the Hudson River Tunnel project are numerous. It will  create more than 72,000 jobs, generate more than $87 million per month  for local communities, and utilize American suppliers and manufacturers  through the Buy America requirement. It will increase opportunities for  minority-, women-, and veteran-owned businesses on the project. In  addition, it will create a faster, more effective means of  transportation for 200,000 daily commuters.   I fought to include $66 billion for projects such as this one in the  bipartisan infrastructure law, and I am proud that my work will finally  result in a new Hudson River Tunnel.                            ____________________
