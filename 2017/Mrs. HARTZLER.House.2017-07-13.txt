 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of subtitle A of title VII, add the following       new section:       SEC. 704. PROHIBITION OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MEDICAL                     TREATMENT RELATED TO GENDER TRANSITION.         Funds available to the Department of Defense may not be       used to provide medical treatment (other than mental health       treatment) related to gender transition to a person entitled       to medical care under chapter 55 of title 10, United States       Code.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Missouri.    Mr. Chair, today, North Korea is plotting the next  ballistic missile test, Russia is threatening the NATO alliance, ISIS  is spreading evil, and China continues their expansion in the South  China Sea in defiance of the international community.   Our military has never been in such high demand, yet our readiness to  confront these threats is at a dismal level. We must confront these  challenges by ensuring our defense dollars maximize the military's  readiness and lethality.   That is why I am offering an amendment to advance these goals by  prohibiting taxpayer dollars from funding gender reassignment surgeries  and related hormone therapy treatment for members of the military and  their dependants.   There are many problems with this policy, but funding transition  surgeries with tax dollars is especially problematic because the  surgery is very costly. Surgical recovery time decreases deployability  of our soldiers, and there is lack of medical consensus on the  effectiveness of gender transition treatments.   Funding transition surgeries means diverting money from other defense  priorities. Surgical costs alone can top $1.3 billion over the next 10  years. These resources could fund 13 F-35 aircraft to fight near peer  adversaries like China and Russia; 14 F-18 Super Hornets to fight ISIS;  or 8 KC-46 tankers needed for long-range strike missions to North  Korea.   Our spending priorities must match our threat mitigation priorities.  We must have soldiers who can deploy if called upon.   Military members undergoing transition surgery are nondeployable for  up to 267 days. Similarly, regular hormone treatments renders  individuals nondeployable into the future. It makes no sense to create  soldiers who are unable to fight and win our Nation's wars, and it is  unfair to nontransitioned individuals who must leave their families and  deploy in their place.   For all these reasons, Mr. Chair, I offer this amendment as a  responsible member of the House Armed Services Committee who has  studied the threats and heard from each servicemember about the need  for increased funding and readiness.                                time  1645    Prohibiting funding for transition surgery is the right policy for  our military, our budget, and it is the right policy for the American  taxpayer.   I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 30 seconds.   First of all, this does not preclude service by the transgendered.  This simply says that we are not going to have taxpayers pay for this  surgery.   This is different than somebody going in and having a cold, because  this is a major surgery that requires a medical diagnosis that is going  to render someone nondeployable. Just the recovery from the surgery  alone is 287 days, and then the ongoing treatment precludes them from  certain abilities to serve overseas.   So we need to take a look at all of this and make sure that we are  addressing the threats, and we are spending every dollar that we can to  go after the threats.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Perry), Army National Guard Brigadier.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 15 seconds.   Mr. Chair, I just want to point out that this amendment doesn't  address any of the full healthcare that every soldier is entitled to;  it just says that in this particular instance, we are not going to pay  for the gender reassignment surgeries and related hormone treatment.  And there is a high cost for it, there is a reason for doing it, and  that is why we are addressing that today.   Mr. Chair, how much time do I have left?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 45 seconds remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Hunter).    Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Hunter).    Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Hunter).    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, this is about addressing Korea, Russia,  ISIS. We need every defense dollar to go to meeting those threats, not  anything else, and we need to make sure our troops are ready and can be  deployed.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
