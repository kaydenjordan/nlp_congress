 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I would just say this: Number one, I think you would  do well to turn off the phone and pay attention to this Special Order  while you have the honor of presiding over the floor of the House of  Representatives. The words being spoken are important here.   I would just share a brief anecdote with you, and it is this: I have  spent many nights in combat. And like many of my friends, helmet,  night-vision optics, lots of Velcro camo, backpack. I was a bomb  technician, so I normally carried 30, 40 pounds of explosives. I had my  side arm. I had my carbine. I had a metal detector and a number of  other things. I normally had about 10 magazines across the front of my  vest. And we were heavy. We were carrying a lot of weight on any given  night. And every single night, both myself and my brothers in arms  would decide how many more magazines we were going to put into our  backpacks, into our kits, because we always felt that the dumbest  reason for any of us to die would be for a lack of shooting back.   And I think that is something that would, in turn, be one of the  dumbest reasons for any law-abiding American to bring about their  death, would be because they can't shoot back.
