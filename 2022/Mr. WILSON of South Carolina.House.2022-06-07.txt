 Mr. Speaker, costs for everyday  products and services continue to rise, and American families are  suffering. Gas costs have doubled under Biden, reaching the highest  level ever for the price of gas today.   In the last year we have all experienced price increases for everyday  items, including: eggs up 22 percent, chicken up 16 percent, bacon up  17 percent, milk up 14 percent, roasted coffee up 14 percent, and  breakfast cereal up 12 percent.   It is not uncommon for a can of soup on the shelf to be marked at 65  cents, but at checkout, it registers $1. A Dollar Store had all  merchandise for $1 until Valentine's Day, but now all merchandise is  $1.25.   Due to policies pushed by Biden and Democrats, everyday families are  left to suffer the effects. America should resume the Trump policies of  all-of-the-above energy.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years in the global war on terrorism as it continues  moving from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.                            ____________________
