 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her  remarks.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to  make a sincere suggestion to our Republican colleagues who are working  hard to come up with a replacement for the replacement plan on health  care that didn't fly.   Let's fix the Affordable Care Act and work together in a bipartisan  way. I have always said: the best legislation is always bipartisan.  Drop your plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Stop  undermining this law, and work with Democrats to make the law work  better.   That is what the majority of Americans want us to do. Millions of  people now have health insurance, thanks to the Affordable Care Act.  Insurance companies can no longer refuse to insure people with  preexisting conditions, and essential health benefits like maternity  care and mental health care are now provided.   We know that no law is perfect. We acknowledge that. So let's do our  job and do what the American public want us to do: join together in a  bipartisan way to make the Affordable Care Act work better.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York (for herself and               Mr. Meehan):        H.R. 1949.
