 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer some observations  regarding my first 6 months as a new Member of the 116th Congress.   2019 began with Democrat leadership denying the existence of an  illegal immigration crisis at our southern border during a 35-day  government shutdown. On 17 separate occasions since then, House  Republicans have attempted to pass legislation that would provide $4.5  billion in humanitarian assistance.   While Democratic leadership is considering H.R. 3401 this week to  discuss humanitarian aid at the southern border, their proposal will  not direct funds toward expanding detention centers, nor will it  provide resources to correct the crisis, which is precisely where this  kind of funding is needed.   While this bill is fundamentally flawed, at least, at this point,  there is a bipartisan majority that admits we have a real crisis that  requires action.   Recent figures at the border are staggering. U.S. Customs and Border  Protection announced officers have apprehended or turned back nearly  700,000 migrants in the past 8 months. Further, apprehensions in May  marked the highest monthly total in 13 years near the southern border,  with U.S. authorities detaining or turning away more than 140,000  people.   It is our sworn duty to put the American people over politics,  especially in the people's House. As elected Representatives, it is our  responsibility to deliver on issues that are important to the American  people.   This year's Democratic leadership agenda has focused on policy  proposals that incentivize illegal immigration. Democratic leadership  thought H.R. 1 was important to pass, though refused to support a  motion that would have expressed that allowing illegal immigrants to  vote be prohibited as it devalues and diminishes the voting power of an  American citizen.   How would Democrat leadership expect this to pass in Congress, let  alone get signed by the President?   This is certainly not in the spirit of compromise but is most  certainly a dead-end bill.   Further, Democrat leadership passed H.R. 6, which includes various  blanket amnesty provisions. Amnesty should never be passed by this  House, especially when that bill includes no improvements to border  security.   Not only is putting illegal immigrants ahead of legal immigrants  wrong, but to propose an amnesty bill is an obvious incentive for  illegal immigrants to cross over the U.S. border.    Another example is H.R. 987, a bill originally focused on lower  prescription drug costs which was politicized so it, too, has no chance  of becoming law.  [[Page H5086]]  The provisions of propping up failed aspects of ObamaCare and banning  association health plans is contrary policy to what will drive down  healthcare costs, which is choice, competition, innovation, and State's  jurisdiction.   Making the Federal Government a monopoly over healthcare is exactly  the wrong thing to do if we want to achieve the goal of quality,  affordable healthcare for all. This goal can be accomplished while  assuring a safety net is in place, protecting preexisting conditions,  and keeping Medicare strong.   Additionally, bringing to the floor and passage of the proposed  United States-Mexico-Canada agreement, known as the USMCA, is critical  to our continued economic growth.   I state this as an objective outsider. House Republicans and the  President continue to focus on growing the economy for all Americans, a  strong national defense, including orderly humanitarian border  security, reducing healthcare costs, free- and fair-trade agreements,  revitalizing our stressed communities, regulatory reform, and improving  the quality of life of American families. We need bipartisan policy  which puts Americans first, not America alone, but country first.                            ____________________
