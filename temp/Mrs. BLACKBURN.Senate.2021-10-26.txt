 Madam President, I think I speak for all  Tennesseans when I confess that, during the COVID-19 pandemic  lockdowns, I craved the comfort of familiarity. I laid newer books and  albums aside in favor of well-worn classics so close to my heart that  they, in and of themselves, were cherished memories. We lost so much  during that lonely time, but through it all, at least one thing  remained constant.   Every Saturday night, when I tuned my radio to 650 AM WSM, I heard  the fiddles and steel guitars that have welcomed music lovers into the  Grand Ol' Opry's circle of friends for the past 95 years.   On October 30, 2021, the Grand Ol' Opry will celebrate its historic  5000th Saturday night broadcast. As most country music lovers will tell  you, Saturday at the Opry is more than just an ``experience;'' it is  the foundation of the format's legacy and the endgame for those who  come to Nashville, TN, seeking their place within the ranks of country  music's legends. The Saturday broadcast has been on the airwaves longer  than any other broadcast program of any medium anywhere in the world.  It thrived through its expansion from radio to television and then to  digital streaming platforms. It has survived the Great Depression,  World War II, multiple global conflicts, civil unrest, devastating  natural disasters, and, now, a once-in-a-lifetime global pandemic.   For 7 months during the spring, summer, and fall of 2020, while life  outside the Grand Ol' Opry House ground to a halt, a dedicated skeleton  crew of producers, stagehands, and performers came together to create a  socially distanced broadcast that was just as welcoming and heartfelt  as anything a live audience would expect to see. Today, thankfully, the  fans are back in their seats, and those who don't make the pilgrimage  to Music City tune in from home with a newfound appreciation for the  gift of live music.   It is my privilege to memorialize the Opry's ongoing commitment to  artistry and entertainment and to honor every single person who worked  so hard, against such odds, to bring country music into our homes when  we could not seek it out for ourselves. On behalf of the entire  Tennessee congressional delegation, I thank you for helping us maintain  our bond with the past, our hope for the future, and our belief in the  power of music to comfort and inspire when all else seems lost.                            ____________________
