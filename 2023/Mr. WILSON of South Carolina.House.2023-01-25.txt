 Mr. Speaker, since Biden took office,  there have been nearly 5 million crossings of illegal aliens from over  100 countries, a direct result of his failed policies and those of the  Democrat-led Congress. Biden and Democrats shamefully support what they  expect as low-information voters, ignoring the immediate threat of  terrorists.   According to Customs and Border Protection, last month was the 10th  consecutive month of more than 200,000 illegal crossings. Federal  seizures have also resulted in fentanyl rising over 50 percent from  November to December 2022, murdering young Americans.   The House Republican majority will deliver commonsense solutions to  stop identified terrorists who are threats to American families at  greater risk of mass murder than ever before.   House Republicans are holding the government accountable and will not  stop until the American people are protected with a wall and fences, as  Donald Trump attempted to achieve.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues, moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.                            ____________________
