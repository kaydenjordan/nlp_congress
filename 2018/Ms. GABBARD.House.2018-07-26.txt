 Mr. Speaker, on January 13, earlier this year, there was  a text message that was sent out to over a million phones across the  State of Hawaii that read: ``Ballistic missile threat inbound to  Hawaii. Seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill.''   Now, this turned out to be a false alarm, but this message terrified  residents and visitors all across our State and revealed deep gaps  within an alert system, preparedness measures, and communication  channels at every level of government.   In the months since, my colleagues from Hawaii and I have introduced  several pieces of legislation to address the problems that led to and  contributed to this false alert going out so that we can try to prevent  something like this from happening again, not only in Hawaii but  anywhere in the country.   We have introduced the READI Act to expand delivery of critical  emergency alerts to cellphones, TVs, and radios; recognize, with  technology, the new ways that people are getting information; and see  how we can get alerts through streaming services like Pandora, Spotify,  Netflix, and others.   Ensuring that we take these steps now, ahead of any future disaster,  is critical for every community across this country, and I urge my  colleagues to join us in supporting and passing this timely and  important legislation.                            ____________________
