 Reserving the right to object, colleagues, this is a very  fluid situation, as we all know, and, certainly, Americans who are  watching this from home are confused about the parties. Then, when  laying politics on top of it, where you have a level of animus toward  the Commander in Chief that there is at this point, it becomes very  difficult to sort this out. So as chairman of the Foreign Relations  Committee, I want to try to lay out some fundamentals that we need to  deal with.   As has been pointed out by everyone--and I think everyone agrees--the  situation on the ground in Syria is an incredibly complex situation. It  is difficult to understand and impossible to manage at some point  because of the fact that there are dozens and dozens of tribal entities  that share religious or cultural or tribal affiliations either together  or in opposition. The result of that is the mess that we have had in  Syria for so long.   On top of that, in northern Syria we have a situation where the Kurds  and the Turks are at odds with each other. This has happened just  recently, and as everybody in this body--House and Senate, Republicans,  Democrats--knows, it is a very serious situation, but this is not new.  The animosity and fight between the Turks and the Kurds have been going  on for centuries. This fight between these two groups has been going on  for centuries.   Who are these two groups? First, we have the Turks on one side, on  the north of the border, who are members of NATO and are at the very  least theoretical allies of the United States, although in recent years  that alliance has been strained, and that is an understatement of what  the situation is.   Recently, they negotiated a deal with the Russians to buy S-400  missiles, which is a horrendous problem for a member of NATO. NATO was  formed, of course, to push back against the Russians, and now you have  a member of NATO that is engaging with the Russians in this fashion.  This has caused us real grief.   Those of us who deal with it have dealt with it for months. We have  been pressing the Turks as hard as we can about the mistake they have  made and the consequences it is going to have. They have an order for  F-35s. They make a number of parts for the F-35. We have told them  clearly, in no uncertain terms, for months that they can have the F-35s  or they can have the S-400s, but they cannot have both. They insisted  that they can. That is simply not going to happen. I think they are  starting to believe that.   Fast forward to where we are now. The Turks have amassed 30,000  troops on the border with Syria and are ready to come in and take on  the Kurds, who had moved into the northern part of Syria due to the  failed-state status of Syria.   To say that the President of the United States is responsible for  this is simply a political statement that isn't true. You can dislike  the Commander in Chief, you can dislike the calls that he makes, but  this is a war that has been going on between these two groups for  centuries. It was going to happen.   The fact that Erdogan had amassed 30,000 troops on the border was a  clear indication that it was going to go forward. We had about 28  troops between the two standing armies and admittedly the President of  the United States pulled those 28 troops out of harm's way.   In any event, you can argue about what got us here, what the  triggering factor was, whether it was or wasn't going to happen anyway,  but what you can't argue about is what the situation is today. There  isn't anyone in this body that would disagree that this is a very  serious situation.   Turkey is alone on this, by the way. With the possible exception of  the Qataris, they are alone on this. The world has been watching this,  condemning what Turkey is doing. They have done a cross-border  incursion, and they are facing their age-old enemy, the Kurds, inside  of Syria.   So what do we do about this? Well, the House has passed a matter that  the minority leader has talked about and wanted to pass. Senator Paul  has brought his idea to the floor. But I want to tell you that the  Foreign Relations Committee has been working on this since it blew up.   I want to thank my staff, and I want to thank Senator Menendez'  staff, the ranking member, who pulled an ``all-nighter'' last night,  putting together a piece of legislation, and an ``all-morninger'' to  get to the point where we are.   This piece of legislation is going to be dropped very quickly. Risch- Menendez is a bipartisan piece of legislation that addresses the issues  that all of us are concerned about. It addresses the issues with  Turkey. It addresses the issues with the Kurds. It addresses the issues  that the minority leader addressed regarding the ISIS prisoners who are  being held. It is a good piece of legislation.   It is going to have numerous--and I mean numerous--cosponsors to the  bill from both sides of the aisle. So with that in mind, I am going to  enter an objection to Senator Paul's piece of legislation, not because  I object to it as it stands by itself but because we have a  comprehensive piece of legislation that does address this that is the  result of consultation between both the majority and the minority and  the administration to get us a bill that could actually become law.   From my own standpoint, I am always at a point where I want to reach  an objective and want to get to a result. Senator Paul's and the other  legislation cannot become law. This bipartisan piece of legislation,  Risch-Menendez, which addresses this very, very serious issue can  become law. As a result of that, Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.      Hon. James E. Risch,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION   Republic of Korea--AIM-120C Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile                                  (AMRAAM)         The Republic of Korea (ROK) has requested to buy one       hundred twenty (120) AIM-120C-7/C-8 Advanced Medium Range       Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM). Also included are containers;       weapon support and support equipment; spare and repair parts;       U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical, and       logistics support services; and other related elements of       logistical and program support. The total estimated program       cost is $253 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by meeting       the legitimate security and defense needs of one of the       closest allies in the INDOPACOM Theater. The Republic of       Korea is one of the major political and economic powers in       East Asia and the Western Pacific and a key partner of the       United States in ensuring peace and stability in that region.       It is vital to U.S. national interests to assist the Republic       of Korea in developing and maintaining a strong and ready       self-defense capability.        This proposed sale will improve the ROK capability to meet       current and future threats by increasing its stocks of medium       range missiles for its F-15K, KF-16, and F-35 fleets for its       national defense. The potential sale will further strengthen       the interoperability between the United States and the ROK.       The ROK will have no difficulty absorbing these additional       missiles into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Raytheon of Waltham, MA.       There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection       with this potential sale. Any offset agreement will be       defined in negotiations between the Purchaser and the prime       contractor.        Implementation of the proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to the ROK.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-51       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:  [[Page S5890]]             1. The proposed sale will involve the release of sensitive       technology to the Republic of Korea related to the AIM-120C-      7/C-8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM). The       AIM-120C-7/C-8 AMRAAM is a supersonic, air launched, aerial       intercept, guided missile featuring digital technology and       micro-miniature solid-state electronics. Purchase will       include AMRAAM Guidance Sections. AMRAAM capabilities include       look-down/shoot- down, multiple launches against multiple       targets, resistance to electronic countermeasures, and       interception of high- and low-flying maneuvering targets. The       AIM-120C-8 is a form, fit, function refresh of the AIM-120C-7       and is the next generation to be produced. The capabilities       of the AIM-120C-7 and C-8 are identical. The AMRAAM All Up       Round is classified CONFIDENTIAL, major components and       subsystems range from UNCLASSIFIED to CONFIDENTIAL, and       technical data and other documentation are classified up to       SECRET.        2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        3. A determination has been made that the Republic of Korea       can provide substantially the same degree of protection for       the sensitive technology being released as the U.S.       Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S.       foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in       the Policy Justification.        4. All defense articles and services listed on this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Republic of Korea.                            ____________________
