 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great  organizer and community activist, a leader who fought the Chicago  machine and built multiracial and intergenerational coalitions, my  friend, political mentor, and compadre, Rudy Lozano.   Tomorrow, June 8, marks 40 years since Rudy's life was cut short. A  labor organizer, he fought for workers' rights. As a community  activist, he fought for justice for immigrant families.   Rudy brought together diverse communities to elect Harold Washington  as Chicago's first Black mayor in 1983. Rudy knew political empowerment  was vital to improving community conditions.   My presence in Congress and the growing number of progressive Black,  Latino, and Asian-American elected officials in Chicagoland represent  the enduring impact of his legacy.   Let's continue his legacy by working in coalition to ensure a more  inclusive politics for all.   Que viva Rudy Lozano.                            ____________________
