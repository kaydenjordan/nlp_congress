 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today to honor a great American,  an American whose words lit a flame of hope in the hearts of those  souls who had become weary with the weight of injustice, an American  whose struggles, ideals--and, yes, his dreams--are etched in the  foundation of our Nation.   On April 12, 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was arrested in my  hometown of Birmingham, AL. His crime? Leading a peaceful march to  protest the indignity suffered by the Black community in the Jim Crow  era. He had violated Birmingham public safety commissioner ``Bull''  Connor's ban on public demonstrations, which targeted the growing  resistance of African Americans to the injustices they were suffering.   While in solitary confinement in Birmingham, Dr. King wrote what  became known as the ``Letter from Birmingham Jail''--a stinging  response to a group of White clergy in Alabama who had denounced his  tactics and questioned the wisdom and timing of his arrival in  Birmingham.   They insisted that he was an outside agitator coming to Alabama to  instigate trouble. Dr. King responded famously: ``Injustice anywhere is  a threat to justice everywhere.''   In his letter, he rejected the idea that African Americans should be  more patient for change in the face of the daily indignities inflicted  by segregation and in the face of violence and threats and  intimidation. He wrote: ``There comes a time when the cup of endurance  runs over.''   While I did not experience this struggle as a young child--a young  White child growing up in the nearby Birmingham suburb--I spent much of  my adult life and career as a lawyer and former U.S. attorney examining  the history and absorbing its lessons. I have often returned to Dr.  King's letter to understand the forces at play at the height of the  civil rights struggle. Each time I read his words, I am in awe of his  courage and resolve in the face of such incredible personal risk.   While we have come so far and while we have made great progress in  loosening the binds of racial injustice that have constrained and  suffocated our Nation for so many years, we have not yet fully relieved  the weight of our country's abominable history of slavery, segregation,  and racial discrimination.   That is why I rise today. It is our civic duty and I believe our  moral obligation to remember Dr. King's words and his deeds, to tell  his story, to appreciate that 1963 was not all that long ago, and to  reflect on how many things have changed and how many have not. Our  obligation is to honor Dr. King's  [[Page S2309]]  legacy by joining him in envisioning the mountaintop and working to  make real his famous dream that our Nation will rise up and live out  the true meaning of the creed: ``We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal.'' That is why we rise today.   Dr. King saw an America that had the potential to live up to its  lofty ideals, where every man, woman, and child had an equal  opportunity to succeed and to live a life free from discrimination. He  saw the good in our country when it would have been easier for him to  see the bad. It is that positive spirit and clarity of vision that made  his legacy so enduring.   Today, we will honor that legacy by reading the letter from the  Birmingham jail in its entirety in the Senate Chamber.   I am honored to be joined today by Martin Luther King III, who is in  the Gallery--the oldest son of Dr. King and Coretta Scott King--as well  as my old friend Charles Steele, the president of the Southern  Christian Leadership Conference and a reverend. Together, they are at  the forefront of the modern civil rights movement and personally carry  on the legacy that Dr. King bequeathed us.   I am also very grateful that several of my colleagues on both sides  of the political aisle will stand with me to read portions of the  letter today. I want to thank Senators Lamar Alexander of Tennessee,  Ted Cruz of Texas, Kamala Harris of California, Tim Kaine of Virginia,  and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska for participating in this historic reading  today.   I urge the rest of our colleagues, anyone in the Gallery, and anyone  watching at home on television to consider what we might still learn  today from this powerful message about justice and freedom from  oppression and the indifference of people who stand idly by when their  fellow Americans are persecuted.   To begin the reading of the letter, I would like to yield to my  colleague from Tennessee, my friend Senator Alexander.    Mr. President, Dr. King continues:         Yes, they have gone to jail with us. Some have been       dismissed from their churches, have lost the support of their       bishops and fellow ministers. But they have acted in the       faith that right defeated is stronger than evil triumphant.       Their witness has been the spiritual salt that has preserved       the true meaning of the gospel in these troubled times.        They have carved a tunnel of hope through the dark mountain       of disappointment. I hope the church as a whole will meet the       challenge of this decisive hour. But even if the church does       not come to the aid of justice, I have no despair about the       future. I have no fear about the outcome of our struggle in       Birmingham, even if our motives are at present misunderstood.       We will reach the goal of freedom in Birmingham and all over       the nation, because the goal of America is freedom. Abused       and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up with       America's destiny. Before the pilgrims landed at Plymouth, we       were here. Before the pen of Jefferson etched the majestic       words of the Declaration of Independence across the pages of       history, we were here. For more than two centuries our       forebears labored in this country without wages; they made       cotton king; they built the homes of their masters while       suffering gross injustice and shameful humiliation--and yet       out of a bottomless vitality they continued to thrive and       develop. If the inexpressible cruelties of slavery could not       stop us, the opposition we now face will surely fail. We will       win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and       the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing       demands. Before closing I feel impelled to mention one       other point in your statement that has troubled me       profoundly. You warmly commended the Birmingham police       force for keeping ``order'' and ``preventing violence.'' I       doubt that you would have so warmly commended the police       force if you had seen its dogs sinking their teeth into       unarmed, nonviolent Negroes. I doubt that you would so       quickly commend the policemen if you were to observe their       ugly and inhumane treatment of Negroes here in the city       jail; if you were to watch them push and curse old Negro       women and young Negro girls; if you were to see them slap       and kick old Negro men and young boys; if you were to       observe them, as they did on two occasions, refuse to give       us food because we wanted to sing our grace together. I       cannot join you in your praise of the Birmingham police       department.        It is true that the police have exercised a degree of       discipline in handling the demonstrators. In this sense they       have conducted themselves rather ``nonviolently'' in public.       But for what purpose? To preserve the evil system of       segregation. Over the past few years I have consistently       preached that nonviolence demands that the means we use must       be as pure as the ends we seek. I have tried to make clear       that it is wrong to use immoral means to attain moral ends.       But now I must affirm that it is just as wrong, or perhaps       even more so, to use moral means to preserve immoral ends.       Perhaps Mr. Connor and his policemen have been rather       nonviolent in public, as was Chief Pritchett in Albany,       Georgia, but they have used the moral means of nonviolence to       maintain the immoral end of racial injustice. As T. S. Eliot       has said: ``The last temptation is the greatest treason: To       do the right deed for the wrong reason.''        I wish you had commended the Negro sit inners and       demonstrators of Birmingham for their sublime courage, their       willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline in the       midst of great provocation. One day the South will recognize       its real heroes. They will be the James Merediths, with the       noble sense of purpose that enables them to face jeering and       hostile mobs, and with the agonizing loneliness that       characterizes the life  [[Page S2313]]       of the pioneer. They will be old, oppressed, battered Negro       women, symbolized in a seventy two year old woman in       Montgomery, Alabama, who rose up with a sense of dignity and       with her people decided not to ride the segregated buses, and       who responded with ungrammatical profundity to one who       inquired about her weariness: ``My feets is tired, but my       soul is at rest.'' They will be the young high school and       college students, the young ministers of the gospel and a       host of their elders, courageously and nonviolently sitting       in at lunch counters and willingly going to jail for       conscience' sake. One day the South will know that when these       disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters, they       were in reality standing up for what is best in the American       dream and for the most sacred values in our Judeo Christian       heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great       wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding       fathers in their formulation of the Constitution and the       Declaration of Independence.        Never before have I written so long a letter. I'm afraid it       is much too long to take your precious time. I can assure you       that it would have been much shorter if I had been writing       from a comfortable desk, but what else can one do when he is       alone in a narrow jail cell, other than write long letters,       think long thoughts, and pray long prayers?        If I have said anything in this letter that overstates the       truth and indicates an unreasonable impatience, I beg you to       forgive me. If I have said anything that understates the       truth and indicates my having a patience that allows me to       settle for anything less than brotherhood, I beg God to       forgive me.        I hope this letter finds you strong in the faith. I also       hope that circumstances will soon make it possible for me to       meet each of you, not as an integrationist or a civil-rights       leader but as a fellow clergymen and a Christian brother. Let       us all hope that the dark clouds of racial prejudice will       soon pass away and the deep fog of misunderstanding will be       lifted from our fear drenched communities, and in some not       too distant tomorrow the radiant stars of love and       brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all their       scintillating beauty.        Yours for the cause of Peace and Brotherhood,        MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.    Mr. President, I am struck by a fortuitous phrase in the closing of  this remarkable letter: ``One day the South will recognize its real  heroes.''   The South will recognize its real heroes indeed--heroes like Dr.  King, like Rosa Parks, like my old friend Fred Shuttlesworth; heroes  like Congressman John Lewis, like Fannie Lou Hamer, like Ida B. Wells;  heroes like the countless others who stood alongside them in the fight  for civil rights and like the innocent victims swept up in the brutal  crackdowns during this hopeful movement toward universal human dignity.   We carry on their legacy in our daily lives--in our schools, in our  houses of worship, in our workplaces, and throughout our society. That  includes in the institution of the U.S. Senate. It is also carried on  in the work of Dr. King's family members, like Martin Luther King III.   Dr. King wrote his letter in the midst of this struggle and knew that  much work still lay ahead. Less than 6 months after his arrest, the  Klan in Birmingham planted a bomb outside the ladies' lounge of the  16th Street Baptist Church, and it killed four innocent young African- American girls.   A year later, though, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The year after that, it passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Historic  changes were afoot. Yet, despite this incredible historic progress--or  perhaps because of it--in April 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was  assassinated in Memphis, TN. He was just 39 years old. He gave his life  for this cause. He gave his life in a struggle during which so many  gave their lives.   We have to remember this is not ancient history. We know that we  still have our challenges albeit in a world that has, no doubt,  benefited tremendously from the progress he achieved, but it is still a  work in progress. It will always be a work in progress.   If we truly believe in carrying on his legacy, we must recognize that  we cannot stand idly by when we see injustice and that we cannot stand  idly by when we see a reemergence of hateful rhetoric in our public  discourse. We have seen it before. We have seen it before in Birmingham  and elsewhere. We have seen before the devastating violence that can  follow, and it lives with us today. It lives with us today in tragedies  like those of Charleston, Charlottesville, Pittsburgh, and now New  Zealand.   We need to strive not just for civility but to make sure we live in a  country that does not hold each other in contempt. That bears  repeating. We talk a lot in this Chamber about civility and respect and  dignity, but the fact is, when we leave this Chamber and go out into  the world, people will hold each other in contempt more so than is just  public discourse. That has to change, ladies and gentlemen. It has to  change. Importantly, we--each of us--should continue to do our part to  ensure that the art of the moral universe continues to bend toward  justice.   I thank my colleagues who joined me this evening for this historic  event. It has been an honor and a privilege.   I yield the floor.
