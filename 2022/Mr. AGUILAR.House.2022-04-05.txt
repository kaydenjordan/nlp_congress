 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from New  Jersey for yielding some time.  [[Page H4165]]    I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 1540, the REPORT Act. I first  introduced the bill, as my colleague mentioned, after the 2015 attack  in San Bernardino, a community that I have been proud to represent.  This attack tragically took the lives of 14 people and wounded 22. If  not for the work of our first responders, more innocent lives would  have been lost that day.   The REPORT Act would ensure that lawmakers and law enforcement  agencies are better prepared to detect, prevent, and respond to future  incidents of terrorism.   If enacted, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with  the Attorney General and the FBI, would submit this unclassified report  to Congress whenever an act of domestic terrorism occurs in the United  States.   By requiring the executive branch to share their findings with  Congress, we, as representatives of our local communities, can act on  the recommendations for changes and practices or law to prevent attacks  and to protect all communities.   I appreciate my colleague from Texas talking about other incidents,  and we know that incidents of mass violence continue to happen across  our country, including the moment of silence that we had on the floor  last evening.   If we can work together to prevent one such incident from taking  place, Mr. Speaker, if both parties can unite to save one innocent  life, this legislation will have been a success.   I appreciate the Homeland Security Committee staff for working to get  this done, and my colleague from Texas and my colleague from New Jersey  for leading this effort.   I ask my colleagues for an ``aye'' vote.
