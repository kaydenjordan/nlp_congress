 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing George Ostrom of Flathead County, on his 90th birthday, for  his 60-plus years of contributions to news broadcasting and journalism  in Montana.   A native Montanan, George spent the beginning of his formative years  on a ranch in Sanders County and then in a mining camp near Kila. At  age 17, George left Flathead High School to enlist in the Army and  served his country for the next 3 years while stationed in Frankfurt,  Germany. Following his return to the States, George spent a few years  as a Forest Service smokejumper before an injury led him to seek  employment at a newly founded radio station in Kalispell.   Ever since landing the gig as an announcer for KOFI radio in 1956,  George has been a staple in Montana broadcasting. After rising up the  ranks to eventually become co-owner of the station, George purchased  the Kalispell Weekly News in 1974, which he grew into the most  circulated weekly in Montana. He was also the host of a KCFW-TV  program. George is the author of three books and writes a weekly column  for the Hungry Horse News. He continues on-air in the Flathead with his  own ``George Ostrum News & Comment,'' a key component of the KGEZ 600  AM Good Morning show.   He has served on countless boards including the Red Cross, ALERT, the  Kalispell Chamber of Commerce, Rotary, and, for more than 20 years, the  University of Montana president's advisory council. Now known as the  dean of Montana radio broadcasters, he has been inducted into the  Montana Broadcasters Hall of Fame.   Presently, George resides in Kalispell with his wife, Iris, and has 4  children, 3 grandchildren, and 1 great-grandchild. He still finds time  to go on weekly excursions with the ``Over-the-Hill Gang'' in Glacier  National Park. I congratulate and thank George for his continued  dedication to sharing his voice with his fellow Montanans.                            ____________________
