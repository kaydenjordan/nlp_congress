 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 426 of the  Congressional Budget and Empowerment Control Act of 1974, I make a  point of order against consideration of the rule, House Resolution 891.   Section 426 of the Budget Act specifically states that the Rules  Committee may not waive the point of order prescribed by section 425 of  that same act.   Section 3 of House Resolution 891 states that: ``All points of order  against consideration of the bill are waived.'' Therefore, I make a  point of order pursuant to section 426 of the Congressional Budget Act  that this rule may not be considered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, it was a Republican bill passed in  a Republican Congress, but this act was supposed to stop Congress from  passing bills that forced huge new costs on State and local governments  without giving them the money to pay for those costs.   Well, apparently it didn't work, because the farm bill, which is part  of this rule, would impose massive new mandates on State and local  governments in the Republican majority's quest to kick families off of  SNAP.   For anyone unfamiliar, that is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program, which helps to feed millions of struggling American families  every day. But one provision in the farm bill would force States to  deny SNAP benefits to families with an absent parent unless those  households cooperate with child support enforcement agencies.   According to the CBO, that is the Congressional Budget Office, it is  a nonpartisan group of experts that analyze this stuff. This additional  burden on single-parent families would save  [[Page H3992]]  the Federal Government $4 billion, but my Republican colleagues don't  seem to have thought this through, because it would cost child support  agencies over $7 billion to recoup those child support payments. So  they are spending $7 billion to recoup $4 billion.   CBO, that is the group of nonpartisan experts, says that the cost to  States, who have no say in this matter, would be over $1 billion.   Now, I don't know who wrote this provision, since it sure didn't come  out of the Agriculture Committee or the hearings that we conducted, but  whoever it was, they really need to work on their basic arithmetic  skills.   When you spend $7 billion to recoup $4 billion, that is what I call a  terrible idea, not legislating.   Now, another unfunded mandate would require States to offer  employment and training services to SNAP recipients as part of the  bill's devastating new work requirements. But according to CBO, again,  these are the nonpartisan experts, the bill won't provide States with  enough funds to implement those training programs.   So not only are Republicans heartlessly kicking 1 million Americans  off of SNAP with these additional burdens, but they also are not  providing States with enough money for training programs so that these  people can find jobs and get their benefits back. I mean, you seriously  can't make this stuff up.   CBO, again, the Congressional Budget Office, those nonpartisan  experts, reported yet another intergovernmental mandate that would  prevent communities from restricting the use of dangerous pesticides,  even if they determine the restrictions are necessary to protect  children's health, like stopping harmful insecticides from being  sprayed near schools or hospitals.   This bill also requires that every State allow the sale of all legal  agricultural products from other States, preempting States' food safety  and environmental standards.   Now, you heard me right. The Republicans are preventing local  communities from protecting their children from toxic chemicals and  forcing States to allow products that break laws meant to protect the  health and safety of their own citizens.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I thought the Republicans were supposed to be all  about States' rights. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act was a Republican  bill, as I mentioned.   What about the rules of this institution? It is actually against  House rules, believe it or not, to bring a bill to the floor that  imposes unfunded mandates on State and local governments.   Not a problem, Mr. Speaker. The Republican-controlled Rules  Committee, or as I like to call it, the ``Break the Rules'' Committee,  waived that rule and gave this disastrous farm bill a get-out-of-jail- free card.   But it turns out that waiving the unfunded mandates rule is also  against the rules of the House. That is right. Republicans, once the  party of States' rights, are rigging the rules and ignoring the law so  that they can pass this disastrous bill.   So here is a moment, I think, where liberals and conservatives can  come together, where all my Republican friends who oppose unfunded  mandates can join with many of us on the Democratic side and actually  do something. This is your chance to prove it and to stand up and to be  counted.   Don't let the Rules Committee run roughshod over your values in the  name of passing this lousy bill. Or maybe unfunded mandates on State  and local governments are actually fine with my conservative friends  just so long as they are imposed on a process that takes SNAP benefits  away from millions of people.   As I find myself saying far too often these days, a bad process  produces bad policy. And this farm bill is a bad policy, plain and  simple. It is not thought out. It is a bunch of unfunded mandates. It  is a disaster.   It is bad for the millions of working families, children, older  adults, and other vulnerable Americans who will be kicked off of SNAP  or see their benefits reduced. It is bad for farmers and ranchers, who  are already suffering from low prices, low overhead, and market  uncertainty, not to mention a new trade war, courtesy of Donald Trump.  It is bad for State and local governments, who will have massive  unpaid-for costs despite having no input whatsoever on the drafting of  this bill.   So let's send it back to the drawing table so we can sit down in a  bipartisan way, in the bipartisan tradition of the Agriculture  Committee, and come up with smart, compassionate, forward-thinking  legislation instead of this.   So I ask my colleagues to join with us in a bipartisan way against  considering this rule, which ignores the costs this bill imposes on  State and local governments, in violation of the Unfunded Mandates  Reform Act.   If you believe unfunded mandates are wrong, then you shouldn't  support this rule. I mean, where are my conservative friends? Where is  the Freedom Caucus, who rail about unfunded mandates? Where are you? I  mean, I hope you are going to stand up and have the courage of your  convictions and vote with us on this and send this bill back to  committee, where we ought to do a farm bill in a bipartisan and a  thoughtful way.   This process has been lousy from the beginning, and now we have a  bill that has all kinds of protections, because there are all kinds of  unfunded mandates on our States.   Wait till your governors begin to read the fine print in this farm  bill, wait till your local agencies read the fine print in this farm  bill.   So if you are for unfunded mandates, then vote against what I am  suggesting here today. But if you want to put an end to these unfunded  mandates, then you need to take a stand.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I would encourage my colleague and anybody  else to do something radical: actually read the CBO study.   Basically, what it says here is that the bill would impose  intergovernmental mandates by amending SNAP eligibility requirements,  placing new responsibilities on States as administrators of child  support enforcement, and requiring new State activities in the SNAP  program.   For large entitlement programs like SNAP and child support  enforcement, UMRA defines an increase in the stringency of conditions  on States and localities as an intergovernmental mandate if affected  governments lack authority to offset those costs while continuing to  provide required services. The bill's requirements would increase the  workload of State agencies in areas where they have limited flexibility  to amend their responsibilities and offset additional costs and, thus,  would be intergovernmental mandates.   In other words, on a whole range of issues, this bill requires States  to do so much more, and the Federal Government does not provide the  funding to meet those obligations. So if States want to provide SNAP  benefits to their citizens, which I think every State continues to want  to do, they are going to have to embrace all these unfunded mandates,  add all these additional costs on to what they are already paying.   These are big, fat unfunded mandates. And I want to tell you, when  your Governors read this bill, when you read this bill, you are going  to be amazed about all these additional burdens that are going to be  imposed on States and localities. If this isn't an unfunded mandate, if  this wasn't what that Republican initiative was all about when it was  first implemented, I have no idea what it is.   But I will tell you, even on the work training programs, this bill  would provide maybe about $30 per person for education and training. We  are told that education and training programs, on average, range from  $7,000 to $14,000 to be effective. So this is an unfunded mandate,  plain and simple. If you care about unfunded mandates, you are going to  support us in our initiative here today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.

So the question of consideration was decided in the affirmative.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Woodall) for the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Georgia just said one  rule three bills, which has become kind of a habit around here where we  try to bunch a whole bunch of bills together in one rule so we don't  actually focus on any one issue in a way that is meaningful. It is, I  think, an attempt to try to stifle debate.   We have a bill that would protect our police. We have a bill that  would deal with veterans. And then we have the farm bill. Mr. Speaker,  I want to focus on the farm bill, if I may.   I have served on the Agriculture Committee since 2011. Historically,  it has been one of the most--if not the most--bipartisan committee in  the House of Representatives. That is how farm bills are normally  crafted, through compromise and through a coalition of Members from  urban and rural America coming together to get something done.   That is why I have always had faith in this process--faith that  minority views would be heard. Even when it wasn't easy and even when  the final product wasn't perfect, the end product was traditionally  bipartisan. Until today.   The process for this farm bill was a sham. In no way did it reflect  the Agriculture Committee's long, bipartisan tradition. I am the  ranking member of the Nutrition Subcommittee, and even I wasn't able to  see a word of text until this bill was publicly released. I am not even  sure when Republicans on the subcommittee first saw the language.   Over the last 2\1/2\ years, the Agriculture Committee held 23  hearings on SNAP. Apparently, they were just for show, because not a  single witness--Democrat or Republican--recommended any of the drastic  cuts or draconian policy changes to SNAP included in this Republican  farm bill.   When our distinguished ranking member on the committee, Mr. Peterson,  was finally asked for Democratic feedback on the nutrition title, he  gave a long, thoughtful list of objections and suggested changes. His  input was ignored with the majority changing barely a handful of words  in this whole bill.   The Republican farm bill is filled with controversial provisions, and  no one will tell us how they even got into the bill. Believe me, Mr.  Speaker, I have asked. I can't get an answer. Maybe President Trump's  ethically challenged White House opened its doors even wider to  lobbyists and let them write key parts of this bill. Or perhaps an  arch-conservative think tank was given the chance to airdrop its wish  list into the bill.   But I suspect something more mundane and damaging. I think the  Speaker viewed this bill as his last chance to enact sweeping cuts to  safety net programs before he retires. Even the number of this bill,  H.R. 2, was always reserved by the Speaker for his so-called welfare  reform bill.   So I warn my colleagues on both sides of the aisle: make no mistake.  This legislation is a transformation of our social safety net dressed  up as a farm bill. It beats up, belittles, and demonizes poor people  all across this country. It doesn't even try to put lipstick on this  pig.   Mr. Speaker, last week it was reported that the Republican Conference  brought in communicator Frank Luntz to try to wordsmith how Republicans  can justify supporting this bill. They must be terrified. They know  that just explaining the reality would appall and enrage most  Americans.   Now, Mr. Luntz is the same guy who helped craft Speaker Gingrich's  Contract with America. He earned PolitiFact's lie of the year in 2010  for one of his debunked claims on healthcare reform and even tried once  in an interview to turn the term Orwellian into something positive. Mr.  Speaker, he has his work cut out for him here because I don't even  think Mr. Luntz can wordsmith something so cruel into something  positive.   Now, here is how mean this bill really is. SNAP is our Nation's  premier anti-hunger program, our first line of defense against hunger.  People, including the most vulnerable among us--kids, the disabled, and  the elderly--turn to it when there is no other option. For them, there  is no plan B when they are struggling to figure out where their next  meal is coming from. With this bill, Republicans are cutting SNAP by  over $20 billion. Millions of people would see their benefits slashed,  and many would be cut off from assistance entirely.                                time  1330    Why are the Republicans doing this?   To pay for hoisting their latest unproven and way underfunded State- based workforce bureaucracy experiment on the entire Nation. That is  why. I say ``unproven'' because I don't see any evidence or studies  suggesting that any of this will even work. In fact, I have a study  here that points out the flaws in this proposal.   It expands work requirements for poor parents while making  millionaires and billionaires eligible for subsidies even if they don't  live or work on a farm.   You can't make this stuff up. There is no evidence that this approach  is effective. We have no idea whether States have the manpower or  infrastructure to take this on. We have no idea how much it will cost  States to put a recipient through a job training program. This bill  would give States just $30 to train each person, when we know it costs  thousands of dollars per person to fund robust job training programs.   Mr. Speaker, it would be laughable if this weren't so serious.   Currently, States are testing the effectiveness of job training  programs as a way to help SNAP recipients move out of poverty. But we  aren't expecting to get the results of these pilot programs until 2021.   Shouldn't we wait to see the results of State pilot programs?  Shouldn't we wait until we know what might work and what doesn't? Why  should we force our Governors and States to gamble on a sweeping,  untested bureaucracy that appears doomed to failure?   Clearly, the Republicans aren't going to let a lack of facts stop  them from creating this massive, new government bureaucracy that will  affect millions of vulnerable Americans. This is from a party that  claims to want a government so small, they could drown it in a bathtub.  Apparently, they want a government just small enough to leave millions  of poor and working Americans with nowhere to turn.   This isn't about helping people; this is about putting up roadblocks  that make nutrition assistance difficult, if not impossible, to get.   This legislation also severs the link between SNAP and the Low Income  Heating Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP. This connection is what  has allowed disabled and working families to receive credit for out-of- pocket heating and cooling expenses without unnecessary trips to the  SNAP office. But the changes in this bill would force recipients to  make those unnecessary trips, and they would lead to more hassles and  avoidable errors and people falling through the cracks.  [[Page H3996]]    I think the Republican leaders in the House are the only people on  this planet who believe that creating unnecessary hassles count as some  kind of laudable reform.   The Republican farm bill would also eliminate broad-based categorical  eligibility. This has been a critical option that States have used to  help working families with kids and seniors during tough times. More  than 40 States today use this option, including 12 States with  Republican Governors. Eliminating it would cause 400,000 eligible  households--close to 1 million people--to lose their food benefits. The  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that 265,000 students  will lose access to free school lunches if this bill were to become  law.   You know, when I was growing up, it was school bullies that went  after kids' lunch money; it wasn't the United States Congress. This is  shameful.   But let's also be clear here that eliminating broad-based categorical  eligibility would throw close to 1 million people off of SNAP who work.  Basically, it would deny SNAP benefits to people who earn under $16,000  a year.   Mr. Speaker, what the hell is wrong with this place?   These people can't get through the year on that. That is not enough  to feed one's self or one's family.   The Republican Congress, who rushed to raise taxes on 86 million  middle class families to pay for a tax cut for large corporations and  the richest 1 percent, is now trying to stop kids from getting school  lunches and taking assistance away from families struggling with  hunger.   This entire Congress has been one long, slow march toward making life  harder for the poor, the hungry, and working Americans. I am tired of a  Congress that prioritizes the rich, that looks out only for the  wealthy.   The legislation we take up here today should reflect our values. But  this bill doesn't reflect my values, Mr. Speaker. This is a farm bill  that doesn't even make significant improvements to our agricultural  programs to help farmers who are caught in the middle of the  President's trade war.   It is an attack on those living in poverty. It trades in stereotypes  to justify shredding our social safety net, and it is hell-bent on  making hunger worse in this country. This Republican farm bill is  disgusting, and the process that got us here is disgusting.   By the way, just so Members are clear, the average SNAP benefit is  $1.40 per person per meal. I say to my colleagues, you try living on  that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Under this bill, somebody who is working and earns like $15,800 a  year up to like $23,000 a year, who works right now, and who currently  receives SNAP would lose it under this. This is how you are rewarding  their work. I just find that appalling.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Schneider).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Polis), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia  for his comments. I think, again, if the gentleman reads this bill, he  and his farmers should be concerned about this bill because it does not  increase support for our farm safety net and support prices. So we have  a lot of farmers who are deeply concerned about that part of the bill  as well.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to urge that we defeat the previous question.  If we do, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up  Representative Lamb's legislation, H.R. 5805, which provides the fix  needed to implement the VA MISSION Act to ensure that it is not  hindered by budget caps.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, to discuss that proposal, I yield 4  minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Lamb).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz), the ranking member of the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, we aren't done, so if the gentleman would  like to yield me some time, that would be great.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, I would encourage my colleague to read the bill. Broad- based categorical eligibility gives States the flexibility to offer  people who are struggling--more people, the SNAP benefit. There are  many States, including mine, that basically offer SNAP to people who  are at 200 percent of the poverty level. That is about $24,000. This  bill changes the criteria.   So you could be working and making anywhere from $24,000 to like  $15,900, and, right now, you are working and that is what you make and  you are eligible for SNAP. This bill says you no longer can get that  benefit. These are people who work, and this bill takes this nutrition  benefit away from them.   I don't know how anybody could think that that is a good thing to do.  I don't know how that reward works. What that does is punish people.  That punishes individuals who are doing everything they possibly can to  try to make ends meet.   And a lot of people, by the way, who qualify for SNAP who aren't  working, qualify maybe for a month or two because they are out of work  for only a month or two. This idea that SNAP creates this culture  dependency is just a myth. The majority of people on SNAP work--who are  able-bodied work. I want to make that point clear.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Delaware (Ms.  Blunt Rochester).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Delaware.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, who are very strongly  opposed to this farm bill.                                             Consortium for Citizens                                               With Disabilities,                                        Washington, DC, May 7, 2018.      Re H.R. 2, Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (Farm Bill).       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi, The undersigned       members of the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities       (CCD) urge you to continue the longstanding bipartisan       commitment to protect and strengthen the Supplemental       Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by rejecting proposals to       restrict eligibility, reduce benefits, cap or reduce funding,       or make harmful structural changes to SNAP in the Farm Bill.        CCD is the largest coalition of national organizations       working together to advocate for federal public policy that       ensures the self-determination, independence, empowerment,       integration and inclusion of children and adults with       disabilities in all aspects of society.        In the United States, all too often food insecurity and       disability go together. Families that include people with       disabilities are two to three times more likely to experience       food insecurity than families that have no members with       disabilities. Similarly, people experiencing food insecurity       have increased likelihood of chronic illness and disability.        SNAP is vitally important for people with disabilities and       their families. By increasing access to adequate, nutritious       food SNAP plays a key role in reducing hunger and helping       people with disabilities to maximize their health and       participate in their communities.        Using an inclusive definition of ``disability,'' in 2015 an       estimated 11 million people with disabilities of all ages       received SNAP, representing roughly one in four SNAP       participants.        Roughly 4.4 million households with non-elderly adults with       disabilities received SNAP in 2016.        Non-elderly adults with disabilities who receive SNAP have       very low incomes, averaging only about $12,000 per year in       2016.        SNAP benefits are extremely modest, averaging $187 per       month for non-elderly people with disabilities in 2016--or       just $6 per day.        Existing SNAP time limits are harsh, unfair, and harm many       people with disabilities and their families by cutting off       essential food assistance. Federal law currently limits SNAP       eligibility for adults between the ages of 18 to 49 without       dependents to just three months out of every three years--      unless they can engage in work or job training activities at       least half time, or qualify for an exemption. These       provisions cut off food assistance at a time when people need       it most and do not result in increased employment and       earnings. At least 500,000 low-income individuals nationwide       lost SNAP in 2016 due to this time limit.        Many people with disabilities are already hurt by SNAP time       limits, despite existing exemptions for people who receive       governmental or private benefits on the basis of a disability       or are able to document that they are ``physically or       mentally unfit for employment.''        For example, in a study of SNAP participants subject to       time limits referred to participate in work activities in       Franklin County, Ohio, one-third reported a ``physical or       mental limitation''.        Cutting off food assistance from SNAP would only make it       harder for people to work and increase their economic self-      sufficiency. We strongly oppose any action that would cut off       or reduce SNAP benefits, narrow eligibility, or force more       people to navigate harsh and unnecessary program rules,       including people with disabilities and their families.        In particular, we are concerned that the Farm Bill advanced       by the House Committee on Agriculture on April 18, 2018       includes a number of provisions that would harm people with       disabilities and their families. Small increases in the       proposed bill are insufficient to make up for significant       benefit reductions.        New work requirements with highly punitive rules would cut       off SNAP benefits for many people--including in families with       children, adults, and seniors with disabilities. It may seem       simple to assert that ``people with disabilities will be       exempt,'' but converting such a statement into an effective       policy process is complicated, expensive, and fundamentally       flawed. Many people with disabilities receive SNAP, but do       not meet SNAP's statutory definitions of ``disability'' or       have not been so identified. Under SNAP, states have no       obligation to help people prove they are exempt, even if they       have difficulty obtaining the necessary records or       verification from a doctor. In addition, states are under no       obligation to ensure that people with disabilities have       access to the full array of services they might need to       work--such as accessible transportation, supported       employment, and personal care aide services. People with       disabilities often want to work, but need additional supports       and services to obtain and keep jobs, in addition to facing       discrimination and misconceptions about their ability to       work.        Underfunded work programs would be woefully inadequate to       meet training needs. Proposed new investments in SNAP       employment and training programs--funded in large part by       benefit cuts--amount to only about $30 per person per month.       This amount would be grossly insufficient to provide adequate       employment services for people subject to proposed new work       requirements, including jobseekers with disabilities.        New reporting requirements would create major hurdles to       benefits. Proposed new reporting requirements related to       eligibility, employment and training, and time limits would       be extremely difficult for many people with disabilities to       navigate and comply with. For example, ending a decades-old       simplification measure and instead requiring people to share       utility bills with the SNAP office--or else, see their       benefits reduced--is harsh, unnecessary, and burdensome both       for SNAP participants and states.        If Congress wishes to explore meaningful opportunities for       SNAP participants to increase self-sufficiency through       employment, we recommend awaiting the results of the       Employment & Training pilot projects authorized under the       2014 Farm Bill. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)       awarded pilot grants in 2015, all 10 state programs are       operational, and evaluation activities will operate through       2021. Already, a number of pilot states have cited multiple       barriers faced by participants, including ``health issues.''       It will be important for USDA and the evaluators to carefully       explore the experiences and outcomes of people with       disabilities and their families in these pilot programs.       Congress should await the final pilot evaluations before       considering any changes in these areas.        We call on you to reject proposals that would weaken SNAP's       effectiveness as our nation's foremost anti-hunger program by       limiting access, reducing benefits, or creating       administrative hurdles. We urge all Members to vote no on the       Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 as approved by the       Agriculture Committee on April 18, and instead to work on a       bipartisan basis to strengthen and protect SNAP as part of       the Farm Bill.

Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from  No Kid Hungry, Share Our Strength, an initiative strongly opposed to  this bill.                     [From No Kid Hungry, May 15, 2018]                     Congress Must Vote No on Farm Bill         Washington, DC.--This week the House of Representatives       will vote on the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (H.R.       2), also known as the Farm Bill. The following is a statement       from Share Our Strength's Senior Vice President Lisa Davis       about the harmful impact the bill would have on struggling       families in America. Share Our Strength officially opposes       the bill.        ``This week, the House of Representatives will vote on the       Farm Bill. On balance, this bill will ultimately increase       poverty and hunger in the United States and Share Our       Strength cannot support it.        Thirteen million children today are growing up in families       that worry about hunger. Even more live in families on the       brink, just one lost job, one medical emergency, one broken       water heater away from hunger. Consider:        A study by the Federal Reserve shows that nearly half of       all Americans couldn't come up with $400 for an emergency       expense.        Another study from the National Center for Children in       Poverty shows that nearly half of all children in the United       States live ``dangerously close'' to the poverty line. 6 in       10 Americans will spend at least one year of their lives in       poverty.        And in another survey recently conducted on behalf of No       Kid Hungry, two-thirds of low-income parents said they would       not be able to afford enough food for their families if they       were hit with a single, unplanned expense of $1,500.        These are families trying to do their best to survive.       These are the families we all know. It's the single working       mom in California, worried about whether to pay the       electricity bill or pay for groceries this month. It's the       grandmother trying to raise her grandkids in Appalachia. And       it's the military veteran trying to find enough work hours to       support his son in Central Pennsylvania.        And while this legislation includes some needed       improvements to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program       (SNAP), such as increasing asset limits and indexing them to       inflation, these changes are significantly outweighed by       harmful ones, such as eliminating Broad Based Categorical       Eligibility (BBCE) and increasing administrative burdens on       states and imposing penalties on adults who are unable to       comply with the expanded work requirements in a given month.        We believe a good job is the best pathway out of poverty,       but there is little reason to think the policies in this Farm       Bill will increase employment. It imposes harsh penalties on       beneficiaries who drop below the required number of hours in       a month, locking them out of SNAP for a full year the first       time and 3 years if it happens again. imagine a single mom       barely getting 20 hours of work a week whose child gets strep       throat or the flu. Or the rural dad whose car breaks down. Or       the 55-year-old house cleaner whose back goes out.        This is all counterintuitive. Adding hurdles and punitive       restrictions won't help people find jobs or get back on their       feet. But it will increase hunger and hardship for many       families.        In addition, the Congressional Budget Office also reports       that this legislation will lead to more than 265,000 kids       losing free school meals during the school year, a double       whammy for poor, working families. Research demonstrates the       deep connections between hunger and health, particularly for       children. When kids don't get the fuel they need to nourish       their developing minds and bodies, they are more likely to       get sick and do poorly in school, and they are much less       likely to access a future free from poverty.        We urge members of the House of Representatives to take a       stand for children and families and oppose this       legislation.''                             ABOUT NO KID HUNGRY         No child should go hungry in America, but 1 in 5 kids will       face hunger this year. Using proven, practical solutions, No       Kid Hungry is ending childhood hunger today by ensuring that       kids start the day with a nutritious breakfast, are able to       get the nutrition they need during the summertime, and       families learn the skills they need to shop and cook on a       budget. When we all work together, we can make sure kids get       the healthy food they need. No Kid Hungry is a campaign of       national anti-hunger organization Share Our Strength.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from a  coalition of over 60 child advocacy organizations opposed to the bill.                                                        May 9, 2018.        Dear Representative: As child advocates in the areas of       hunger and nutrition, poverty, health, welfare, housing, and       education, we are writing to express our opposition to the       Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (H.R. 2), which will       harm the millions of children who rely on federal nutrition       programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance       Program (SNAP) for access to consistent, healthy food. In the       interests of our nation's babies, children and youth we       strongly urge you to vote NO on H.R. 2.        SNAP is a proven anti-hunger and anti-poverty program for       children, which also lowers the odds of household and child       food insecurity, and of children's anemia, poor health,       hospitalization for failure to thrive, and developmental       delays. Research has also found that receiving SNAP in early       childhood improved high school graduation rates, adult       earnings, and adult health. Today, nearly 20 million children       participate in SNAP, representing 44 percent of the program's       recipients and receiving nearly half of every SNAP dollar. In       addition, school breakfast and lunch programs provide many of       these same children a nutritious morning and lunchtime meal       each day. Because children experience both poverty and food       insecurity at higher rates than the general population,       federal nutrition programs such as SNAP and school meals are       critical supports that help them develop, learn, and succeed.       To that end, we are very concerned about the impact H.R. 2       would have on our nation's children. In fact, several       provisions in the Nutrition Title of H.R. 2 directly threaten       access to vital nutrition programs for the countless children       and youth that we represent:        Drastic Program Eligibility Changes: H.R. 2 Makes several       harmful changes to state options that simplify SNAP       eligibility requirements to improve access to SNAP for poor       and low-income families with children. These changes would:        Expose Low-Income Children to a SNAP ``Benefit Cliff'':       H.R. 2 eliminates Broad Based Categorical Eligibility (BBCE),       which gives states additional flexibility and efficiency in       granting SNAP eligibility. This change will reinstate a       benefit cliff in a majority of states, jeopardizing food       assistance for 400,000 households who are scraping by on       earnings just above 130 percent of the Federal poverty line.        Undermine the Ability of Poor and Low-Income Families with       Children to Build Savings: Similarly, the virtual elimination       by      H.R. 2 of Categorical Eligibility will mean many states will       have to introduce a counterproductive and costly process of       asset testing for SNAP eligibility. As a result, H.R. 2 would       cause many families to lose eligibility solely because of red       tape, and force other families choose between meeting their       basic need for food and building up the savings and resources       that would help them achieve economic mobility.        Threaten Poor and Low-Income Children's Access to School       Meals: Under current law, children who receive SNAP are       directly certified for free school meal programs. These meals       help combat childhood hunger, while playing an important role       in improving academic achievement and test scores and       reducing absenteeism, tardiness, and discipline referrals. By       forcing families off of SNAP due to changes in categorical       eligibility, H.R. 2 would break this vital link between SNAP       receipt and school meals for low-income and poor children. As       a result, some 265,000 children stand to lose access to free       school meals.  [[Page H4003]]         Undermine SNAP benefits for Poor and Low-Income Children       Whose Families Rely on the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance       Program (LIHEAP): LIHEAP is a program that helps low-income       households afford their monthly utility bills. Under current       law, some states allow households to use LIHEAP benefits       greater than $20/month as proof of significant energy       expenses, creating a streamlined method for families to       access a modest increase in their SNAP benefit. However, H.R.       2 removes this option for households that do not have an       elderly member, effectively requiring poor and low-income       families with children to provide substantial documentation       of energy bills on a frequent basis for caseworkers to       determine their utility allowance, which could discourage       them from seeking the larger benefit or decrease its size.        Harsh Work Requirements: Under current law, existing SNAP       work requirements aimed at childless adults already have       unintended and harmful consequences for children (for       instance, those who rely on pooled resources from extended       family and Non-Custodial Parents) and youth (such as those       aging out of foster care.) Yet in spite of limited supporting       evidence, H.R. 2 intensifies and expands work requirements,       reduces state flexibilities for exemptions, and requires       states to implement costly training and employment programs       that will take funds from food benefits to support a       bureaucracy that will not provide quality services to people.       The consequences of these changes could be devastating for       countless children and youth, including:        The 13.4 million school-aged children on SNAP: H.R. 2 takes       the unprecedented step of expanding work requirements to       adults with school-aged children. This provision risks the       wellbeing of children whose parents or guardians are: 1)       acting as a caretaker for a loved one such as a child with a       disability; 2) have physical or mental health disabilities       that don't qualify as a disability under the legal       definition; 3) face substantial barriers to work, including       substance abuse issues or domestic violence; 4) working but       struggling to meet the 20 hour per week threshold or the       burdensome documentation requirements; and 5) have difficulty       obtaining childcare or transportation. For these parents or       guardians, losing SNAP translates to a benefit cut for their       whole household, meaning there will be less food on the table       for their children. Some parents and guardians may also       erroneously believe that their inability to meet these new       work requirements makes their children ineligible for SNAP as       well, and as a result opt out of applying for or renewing       benefits for the entire family.        In addition, children in very vulnerable families may be       impacted by the new requirements, such as:        Children in the Care of Grandparents: Today, more than 2.5       million children are being raised by their grandparents or       other relatives, in part because families are dealing with       parental alcohol and substance abuse issues, which are       growing rapidly due to the opioid epidemic. And already,       these families face barriers to accessing the full array of       benefits and services they need. H.R. 2 would further       threaten the ability of grandparents and other older       relatives to care for children because it expands work       requirements for adults up to age 60 who are caring for       children over six years of age.        Children in Families with a History of Family Violence:       H.R. 2 requires parents fleeing family violence with their       children to meet the new work requirements unless they       receive a state exemption. In addition, H.R. 2 requires       parents to cooperate with state Child Support Enforcement       (CSE) efforts in order receive SNAP benefits--a drastic       change from current law, under which 45 states, DC, and the       Virgin Islands have declined to link the two. Yet H.R. 2       effectively eliminates existing state flexibility around CSE       cooperation, meaning parents who would like to apply for SNAP       but are afraid of CSE requirements which would link them to       their abusers are forced to choose between safety and feeding       their children.        Children in Military and Veteran Families: Many veteran and       military families need help feeding themselves and their       children. Today, households that include a veteran with a       disability are nearly twice as likely to lack access to       adequate food as households that do not include someone with       a disability, and sadly, food insecurity rates are nearly       double among post-9/11 veterans. Furthermore, currently-      serving military families often experience food insecurity       because of financial emergencies, low pay, and crisis levels       of chronic unemployment or underemployment of military       spouses in a society where most families need dual incomes to       live. By subjecting these parents, including those suffering       from PTSD, to the new work requirements, H.R. 2 penalizes       families in need who have already sacrificed so much for our       nation.        Youth aging out of foster care and unaccompanied, homeless       youth: Youth aging out of foster care often face various       challenges, including homelessness, difficulty affording       education, and finding employment. Unaccompanied homeless       youth and young adults (who lack safe stable housing and who       are not in the care of a parent or guardian) experience       similar difficulties, especially when they reach age 18.       Existing SNAP work requirements already create a substantial       barrier for these young people from accessing food       assistance, because they technically meet the definition of a       childless adult. Under the harsh requirements in H.R. 2,       these vulnerable young adults will face even larger obstacles       to food assistance.        The Farm Bill represents an important opportunity for       policy solutions that will strengthen and improve nutrition       programs for our nation's children. Instead, H.R. 2 is slated       to reduce spending on SNAP benefits by more than $20 billion       over 10 years and will disproportionately hurt children       through its harmful provisions. We urge you to protect our       nation's children and vote NO on H.R. 2.        Thank you for your time and attention.

Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  National Education Association strongly opposed to this bill.                                 National Education Association,                                       Washington, DC, May 15, 2018.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the three million members       of the National Education Association and the 50 million       students they serve, we strongly urge you to VOTE NO on the       Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (H.R. 2) and oppose any       amendments that further weaken the Supplemental Nutrition       Assistance Program. This bill makes unnecessary changes to       eligibility requirements that could reduce the number of       students certified for free school meals. The bill also       imposes additional work requirements for adults that will       make it harder for some people to get or keep critical       nutrition benefits. Votes associated with this issue may be       included in NEA's Report Card for the 115th Congress.        The Farm Bill, as this reauthorization is commonly known,       provides funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance       Program (SNAP), which is our nation's largest anti-hunger       program. By providing monthly benefits to eligible low-income       people to purchase food, SNAP plays a critical role in       reducing hunger, malnutrition, and poverty, and improving       family security, child and adult health, and employment. SNAP       reaches key vulnerable populations--78 percent of SNAP       households include a child, an elderly person, or a person       with disabilities; 84 percent of all SNAP benefits go to such       households. SNAP lifted 3.6 million Americans out of poverty       in 2016, according to the Census Bureau's Supplemental       Poverty Measure. By providing much needed economic support,       SNAP allows families to have sufficient nutrition during       times of unemployment, fluctuating incomes, and low-wage       work.        Children living in households that receive SNAP benefits       are eligible to receive free school meals. The healthy meals       that low-income children receive at school fight hunger,       improve academic performance, and help reduce absenteeism,       tardiness, and discipline referrals. According to the Food       Research and Action Center, linking children in SNAP       households to school meals is so important that Congress       required all school districts participating in the National       School Lunch Program to directly certify their students for       free school meals.        H.R. 2 undermines the important link between SNAP and free       school meals in the 28 states that have chosen a broad based       categorical eligibility option under current  [[Page H4004]]       rules that expands SNAP eligibility to assist working       families that still struggle to make ends meet. According to       the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), this could       impact as many as 265,000 students nationwide. While students       could apply for school meals via a burdensome paper process,       there is no guarantee that they will still be eligible for       the program or recertified in a timely manner. This would       cost their families even more when they have just lost SNAP       benefits. Further, this puts an enormous administrative       burden on schools to revert to a costly paper-based system,        Direct Certification for SNAP also provides the foundation       for the Community Eligibility Provision, a hugely successful       option that allows over 20,000 high-poverty schools to offer       free breakfast and lunch to their students. The provision       eliminates the need for schools to collect and process school       meal applications, which allows schools to focus on providing       healthy and appealing meals instead of processing paperwork.       Schools are eligible to implement community eligibility if at       least 40 percent of their students are certified to receive       free school meals without submitting an application.        Reducing the number of students who are directly certified       by changing the rules for broad-based categorical eligibility       means that fewer schools will be eligible to implement       community eligibility, and many schools that are eligible       will find that it is no longer financially viable, because       fewer of their meals would be reimbursed at the free rate.       This would increase unnecessary paperwork for schools and       inhibit student success.        The proposed changes in H.R. 2 to broad-based categorical       eligibility will result in working families losing much       needed food benefits. It also means that their children could       lose free school meals, amplifying the negative impact of the       cut. It will mean more children go hungry at home as well as       at school.        The bill further imposes aggressive new work requirements,       which are unnecessary, unworkable and likely to do more harm       than good. It would require SNAP participants ages 18 through       59 who are not disabled or raising a child under 6 to prove--      every month--that they're working at least 20 hours a week,       participating at least 20 hours a week in a work program, or       a combination of the two. These new requirements would force       states to develop large new bureaucracies that would need to       track millions of SNAP recipients, but likely would do little       to boost employment, particularly given that the new funding       provided in the bill for job training and work slots would       amount to just $30 per month for those recipients who need a       work slot to retain SNAP benefits, according to the CBPP.       Further, the requirements would leave low-income people with       barriers to employment--such as limited job skills or family       members with illness--with neither earnings nor food       assistance.        We also have particular concern about amendments filed for       Rules Committee consideration that would undermine the       nutrition guidelines for school meals programs. These       guidelines are currently being implemented in schools, and       have already led to increased fruit and vegetable consumption       by students. Good nutrition is particularly important for       students from low-income families, who may eat as many as       half of their calories every day at school. Additionally,       USDA has only recently published an interim rule for school       meals that provides additional flexibility on the guidelines       for schools. These amendments would only add uncertainty to       this process and threaten the nutritional quality of the       meals offered to students.        We urge you to oppose any amendments that could threaten       mandatory safety net programs beyond SNAP, such as Medicaid,       Medicare, Social Security, and Temporary Assistance for Needy       Families.        The bill further includes $65 million in loans and grants       administered by the Department of Agriculture to support       Association Health Plans (AHP) offered through organizations       that will eliminate coverage of essential health benefits       (categories of care). These plans may appear to be a less       expensive option than current small group market plans that       include comprehensive coverage and consumer protections.       However, in light of recently proposed rules, AHPs will soon       not be required to cover services such as prescription drugs,       mental health and maternity care leading to insufficient and       inadequate care for children and adults.        We strongly urge you to Vote No on the Farm Bill, any       amendments aimed at weakening the healthy guidelines for       school meals, and any amendments that make it even more       difficult for SNAP participants to receive critical nutrition       benefits.            Sincerely,                                                      Marc Egan,                                   Director of Government Relations,                                    National Education Association.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Engel).    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to serve on the Agriculture Committee.  I am the ranking member in the Nutrition Subcommittee, and I sat  through 23 hearings. I heard Republican witnesses and Democratic  witnesses, and all of them said the same thing: the SNAP program is  important; don't mess around with it.   I didn't hear anybody--anybody hint at embracing what is in this farm  bill under the nutrition title, a title, by the way, which I, as the  ranking member of the Nutrition Subcommittee, didn't even see until it  was made public.   My friend from Georgia talks about bipartisanship. I mean, give me a  break. I mean, you can say it all you want, but the bottom line is that  it doesn't exist in the Agriculture Committee. The process was  offensive, and even more offensive is what the end product is going to  do to vulnerable people in this country.   You know, this is not a debate about able-bodied adults who aren't  working. You know, that is a very complicated population. I actually  asked for a hearing on that population, and I was denied that right.  You ought to know who this population is. It is a complicated  population.   Many of these able-bodied adults without dependents who are not  working or who are not in the job training programs are our veterans  returning from Iraq and Afghanistan having difficulty reintegrating in  the community; they are young people graduating out of foster care;  they are people with undiagnosed mental illnesses. If we did a hearing,  you would know who this population is. This is more than a press  release.   I am sick and tired of people being stereotyped all the time. And by  the way, you punish people who are working. You know, by eliminating  broad-based categorical eligibility, there are people right now who are  working, who make, you know, between $50,800 a year and maybe $24,000 a  year, they work, and they get this benefit to put food on the table.                                time  1415    And yet you are making changes that will deny them that benefit. They  are working. You say you want to reward work. Well, what are you  thinking when you take this nutrition benefit away from these people,  who are doing everything right. When you take this SNAP benefit away  from adults, you are taking it away from their children as well. And  you heard over and over and over again that when people lose their SNAP  benefit, their kids lose access to a free breakfast and lunch at  school. This is awful.   Send this bill back to committee. Vote ``no'' on this rule.    Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Georgia just  mischaracterized the very partisan process that occurred in the  Agriculture Committee in which Democrats were totally shut out.   I want to know: What are the remedies that we have at this point in  the debate to be able to correct the record so we can correct the  misrepresentations?    Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentleman that nobody  walked away from the table; only after we were totally shut out of the  process.   As I mentioned in my opening statement--if the gentleman were paying  attention--the ranking member, Mr. Peterson, actually tried to offer  suggestions and was totally shut out.   I am the ranking member of the Nutrition Subcommittee. You mentioned  the ranking members usually get informed as to what is going on. I  didn't see it until it was made public.   This was the most offensive process I have ever witnessed.   And, by the way, the product in this ag bill--which I don't think the  gentleman has read, based on some of the things he has said--but this  final product does not represent any of the hearings we had.   So this process in the Agriculture Committee, which has been,  historically, probably the most bipartisan committee in the Congress,  was basically thrown into chaos as a result of the behavior of the  majority.   I just say to the gentleman: You can try to spin this all you want,  but the bottom line is that this has never happened before. And Collin  Peterson--I just want to say--is probably the most bipartisan Member of  this House. If you can't strike a bipartisan deal with Collin Peterson,  you can't strike a bipartisan deal with anybody.   But that is not what this was about. This was about advancing an  agenda, quite frankly, that is going to hurt millions of vulnerable  people in this country, and I find it offensive.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
