 Mr. President, this amendment No. 1471 is our amendment,  and it would modernize the formula by which this money is distributed.   This formula is 34 years old. It privileges a handful of States over  the vast majority--I think the number is 15 over the other 35. And it  is not just me saying it; the EPA issued a report that stated that the  current formula does not meet the wastewater needs of all of the States  and recommended that it be updated regularly. Notably, from the EPA's  report, it says that the EPA does not know how the current allotment  formula was developed. It says:         The weighting and factors that were used to establish the       formula for the original allotment are not known.    My home State of Florida is one of many that are disadvantaged under  the current formula, and the result has been obvious over the years.   I think most of my colleagues would agree that distributing funds-- let alone $14.4 billion--to States without rhyme or reason is not  beneficial and isn't fair.   It is not just States, by the way. This amendment, if passed, would  secure more equitable allotments to Native American Tribes and  territories.   Unfortunately, I made--in our drafting of this amendment, there was a  small technical error in which, instead of stating that it should be  0.025 in the distribution for Native American Tribes, it says .0025.   So I ask unanimous consent to further modify amendment No. 1471 with  the changes that are at the desk so that the right number is on there.    Mr. President, in my remaining time--    I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. President, I just want to state that we are not  changing the formula. There is an extra zero, and it is literally a  typo, the kind of typo people make every single day in the Senate.  Instead of saying ``.025,'' it says ``.0025.'' Everyone knows what it  was intended to do. That is the way we talked about it. That has been  objected to. The Senate is now a place where you cannot amend a typo by  unanimous consent. That is unbelievable. It is unreal. I, frankly, find  it unacceptable.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
