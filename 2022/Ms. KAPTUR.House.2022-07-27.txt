 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Kildee for yielding time.   Madam Speaker, a miracle is happening here. Michigan Wolverines and  Ohio Buckeyes, on a bipartisan basis, are agreeing. Wow. Everybody  should vote for this act, for America's sake.   I am so proud to help celebrate the passage day of the Susan Muffley  Act that will restore retirement benefits for thousands of Delphi  retirees. Hard work should be rewarded.   The men and women who built up Delphi were made a promise in return  for their years of hard work, and they were promised a stable and  secure retirement during their golden years.   Over the years, the American worker has time and again seen promises  broken, and they have seen the financial security they earned and is  rightfully theirs thrown away. Now, the Susan Muffley Act makes good on  Delphi's original promise.   Workers in Defiance, Ohio, and Sandusky, Ohio, and throughout  Michigan and the Midwest will see, by restoring their benefits, the  retirees who worked hard and built America will have the future they  paid for and earned.   We know that the Susan Muffley Act is a giant step forward in  justice, justice for Americans who worked hard and were cast aside  until now.   I thank Congressman Kildee for his absolutely tireless and relentless  efforts to bring this to the floor. To get anything out of the Ways and  Means Committee is a miracle anyway.   For Ohio, this means 5,000 families--believe me, many who can't  afford their medicine, many who worry about tomorrow--will be  celebrating. There will be a sense of being made whole again because of  what they gave to this country, what they gave to their employers, and  that bargain should be kept.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Congressman Kildee. The Wolverine State  has sent a highly capable American to Congress. I thank Congressman  Turner of the great Buckeye State of Ohio, from the Dayton region, for  this great partnership to help thousands and thousands of America's  retirees.
