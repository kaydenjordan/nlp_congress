 Mr. Speaker, most of Minnesota is in extreme drought,  and many of our farmers are facing a tremendous hardship.   There are reports that herd culling is already being done around the  region due to the lack of quality feed, and farmers will soon be forced  to make impossible decisions regarding their crops and livestock.   The situation is serious and demands our attention. I have asked the  administration to allow emergency haying and grazing on CRP lands now,  but that request was met with silence.   If the drought continues to worsen, and if the administration does  not act, the impacts on our economy will be far-reaching.   In the meantime, I stand ready to assist my constituents in  navigating these challenges and working toward quick recovery.                            ____________________
