 Madam Speaker, I rise today in proud support of the  Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, a bill that will  help protect children from abuse and neglect.   Across our country, more than 670,000 children were reported to be  victims of child abuse or neglect. In 2016, almost 1,500 children in  the United States died as a result of abuse or neglect.   It is past time for us to act to prevent child abuse and neglect.  That is why, earlier this month, I introduced the Speak Up to Protect  Every Abused Kid Act. I am proud that portions of the Speak Up Act are  included in the Stronger CAPTA Act.   The Speak Up Act would take commonsense steps to increase reporting  of child abuse or neglect by requiring States to implement a consistent  standard for reporting suspected child abuse or neglect.   The Speak Up Act would require individuals with professional  responsibilities over children to report suspected child abuse and  neglect directly to State authorities. We have heard too many stories  of children being abused or neglected and not getting the help they  need because adults do not report it to the proper authorities.   I was proud to support the Stronger CAPTA Act in the Education and  Labor Committee, and I am proud to vote for it on the floor today. I  urge my colleagues to vote in support of this important bill.
