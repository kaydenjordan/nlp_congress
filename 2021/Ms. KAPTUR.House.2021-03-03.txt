 Madam Speaker, I rise with great concern regarding the  recently announced contract between the United States Post Office and  Oshkosh Defense for the construction of 165,000 postal vehicles over  the next decade, all new.   There is no doubt our postal fleet is aging. The Grumman LLV, in  service since 1994, is gas powered and lacks basic safety equipment  like airbags or air conditioning.   Unfortunately, this contract lacks any commitment to make these  vehicles new age, either electric, hybrid, or advanced biofuels.   While new vehicles are said to be capable of incorporating an  electric drivetrain, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who has been a  disaster for the Postal Service, recently indicated only 10 percent of  the new fleet will be electric. Ten percent? That makes no sense and  flies in the face of the Biden administration's recent order to  electrify the Federal fleet.   DeJoy's failed tenure calls into question the awarding of this  contract.   As such, the administration and the Postal Service must delay the  contract until a review is conducted to determine that there was not  inappropriate political influence in the process and that the proposed  contract is consistent with Biden's Executive Order on tackling the  climate crisis.   This contract is a multi-billion-dollar opportunity to reimagine the  Federal fleet and develop this critical domestic supply chain. We can't  fumble this opportunity.                            ____________________
