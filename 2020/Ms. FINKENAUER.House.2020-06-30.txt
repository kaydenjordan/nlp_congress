 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio for yielding.   It is an honor to serve on the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee and bring the needs of rural America to the committee and be  able to work on those needs in a bipartisan way. I am proud to say  multiple of my standalone bills that are included in the larger package  are bipartisan bills that I was able to work across the aisle on with  my Republican colleagues.   So, I am very confused about their rhetoric around this bill being so  partisan, when it has been an honor to get to work across the aisle and  find common ground on so many issues.   One that I am particularly proud about today is one that is included  in this en bloc that increases funding for the Rebuild Rural grant  program by $150 million and extends the program for 2 more years,  giving certainty to our rural areas, which have long been forgotten  here in Washington, D.C.   On top of that, what we will see in the larger package is the  Investing in America's Bridges Act. It will also include rural road and  bridge funding that has often, again, long been forgotten, including  the Investing in Community Infrastructure Act as well.   There is so much work that we have done here that I know is going to  show up in a very big way in my district.   I would also like to say I find it really ironic the talk that we are  hearing here today, when my Republican colleagues had 2 years in the  House with the Senate and with the Presidency to put together any plan  they would like that would invest in areas like the place that I grew  up, and they kicked it down the road.   I am happy today to be here fighting for my district, fighting for my  State, and passing one of the best investments in rural infrastructure  that our country has ever seen. I will be here doing my job, and I know  it is going to be up to the Senate and the President if they decide to  do theirs.                                time  1630
