 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, more than 100,000 people and families will  join together in the March for Life in Washington that is going to take  place tomorrow. They will brave the cold--there is supposed to be sleet  and bad weather--for one simple reason, to give voice to the voiceless,  the unborn, our most vulnerable among us but are still deserving of the  right to life.   Jeremiah 1:5 says:         Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,        Before you were born I sanctified you.    To everyone who comes to the March for Life, know that we hear you,  and we are standing with you, just as we have in the past.   This is not a new topic, not for me to speak on either. Twenty-five  years ago, I came down to tell a story. At that time, I was in the  House. This has been going on for a long period of time. I came down  here to tell the story of Hannah Rosa Rodriguez. This is a quote from  1992:   Mr. Chairman, there is a big misconception regarding abortion and the  issue of women and their right to protect their bodies. It is not that  right that I object to but the right that is given them to kill an  unborn fetus--an unborn child.   I want to share with you a story that my colleague Chris Smith told  me some time ago on this floor. That was 1992.   Ana Rosa Rodriguez is an abortion survivor. This is another group of  people we haven't talked about very much on the floor. At birth, she  was a healthy 3-pound baby girl, except for her injury; she was missing  an arm. Ana survived a botched abortion.   Her mother attempted to get an abortion in her 32nd week of pregnancy  when she was perfectly healthy--8 weeks past what New York State law  legally allows. In the unsuccessful abortion attempt, the baby's right  arm was ripped off. However, they failed to kill Ana Rosa. She lived.  Pro-life supporters agree that nightmare situations like the Rodriguez  case are probably not common, but abortion-related deaths and serious  injuries occur more frequently than most people are aware.   It is amazing that we can pay so much attention to issues such as  human rights abroad and can allow the violent destruction of over 26  million children here at home. We are fortunate that Ana was not one of  those children. She survived.   That was 1992, but today we still don't have Federal protections for  the babies who survive the brutal abortion process. I am working with  Senator Sasse, who is leading the effort this year to reintroduce the  Born Alive Abortion Survivor Act, which would ensure that a baby who  survives an abortion will receive the same treatment as any child  naturally born premature at the same age, without prescribing any  particular form of treatment. That is just morally right, and I don't  see how anyone could vote against something like that. We will find  out.   Just a few years later, in 1997, I was on the floor of this body, the  U.S. Senate, with my good friend former Senator Rick Santorum, to try  to pass the partial birth abortion ban and end the horrific practice of  late-term abortions. I remember how active Senator Rick Santorum was at  that time, a real leader in the pro-life cause. I spoke then, 1997, on  the floor:   I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for yielding time. I think he  made one of the best presentations I have heard on the floor of this  body. I want to say that, when he deals with the facts, he is dealing  with the facts but, you know, we are also dealing today with  perceptions.   I tried to make a list of those things I have heard over and over.  There is a lot of redundancy on this floor, but there are some things  that have not been stated. I would like to share a couple of those with  you.  [[Page S262]]    I am going to do something that is a little unusual because I am  going to read some Scriptures to you. It is not totally unprecedented  in this body. In fact, I have done it many, many times. The  distinguished Senator from West Virginia does it quite often.   I was talking about Bob Byrd. We remember Bob Byrd. He is deceased  now, but this was 1997, and he read Scriptures every day on the floor  of this Senate.   So I would like to read a couple of Scriptures, just for those who  care. Anyone who does not, just don't listen.   First of all, I have used this a number of times. Jeremiah 1:35 says:  ``Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before you were born I  sanctified you.'' The 139th Psalm, no matter which interpretation you  use, makes it very clear when life begins. Life begins at conception.   Then I was, not too long ago, at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.  I had been to the museum in Jerusalem, and I found the same thing was  printed on the last brick as you are going through. This is Deuteronomy  30:19. It said: ``I call heaven and earth as witnesses today against  you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing;  therefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may live.''   Last, I am also concerned that something that is as dramatic and as  significant as this issue is going to go unnoticed; that maybe there  are Senators out there who are not really into this issue, and they  might want to vote the party line or they might want to say, well,  maybe there aren't as many of these procedures out there, so they just  really are not knowledgeable on the subject. So I will read Proverbs  24:11-12:         Rescue those who are unjustly sentenced to death; don't       stand back and let them die. Don't try to disclaim       responsibility by saying you didn't know about it. For God,       who knows all hearts, knows yours, and He knows you knew.    That is pretty specific.   Mr. President, I was listening to the Senator from Massachusetts who  said it does not do any good if we pass this because the President is  going to veto it anyway.   That was actually in 1997. The President, if you remember, at that  time, I advised the chairman, was Bill Clinton.   But I suggest to you that the President may not veto it, and if he  does veto it, maybe some people will come over who were not here a year  ago on this side of the aisle.   See, this was 1997. It was pretty close back then. It could have gone  either way.   One individual at the time was Ron Fitzsimmons, who just last year  insisted that the number of partial birth abortions were a relative  handful now admits: ``I lied through my teeth.'' He was lying. So if  the President is predicating his decision to veto this ban on the basis  of what was told to him by Ron Fitzsimmons, there is every reason to  believe he could turn around on the issue. I suggest also that we are  talking now not just about a procedure but a culture.   I have a very good friend by the name of Charles Colson. We all  remember Chuck Colson. He is the guy who started the Campus Crusade for  Christ. He gave these remarks upon winning the prestigious Templeton  Prize for a contribution to religion. Listen very carefully. He puts it  all together, not isolating one procedure or one issue. He said:         Courts [like to] strike down even perfunctory prayers, and       we are surprised that schools, bristling with barbed wire,       look more like prisons than prisons do. Universities reject       the very idea of truth, and we are shocked when their best       and their brightest loot and betray.        Celebrities mock the traditional family, even revile it as       a form of slavery, and we are appalled at the tragedy of       broken homes and millions of unwed mothers. The media       celebrate sex without responsibility, and we are horrified by       plagues. Our lawmakers justify the taking of innocent lives       in sterile clinics, and we are terrorized by the disregard       for life in blood-soaked streets.    I think that puts into context what we are now approaching--that it  is not just a normal type of abortion.   I have a great deal of respect for one of the most intellectual  Members of this body. Keep in mind that this is 1997. His name is  Patrick Moynihan--a very good man. He is from New York. Not many people  know that he actually lived in his early years as my neighbor in Tulsa,  OK. Again, at that time, nobody knew it until I mentioned it.   He was a self-proclaimed pro-choice Senator. He said: ``And now we  have testimony that it is not just too close to infanticide; it is  infanticide, and one would be too many.''   That is Patrick Moynihan. He is thought of and respected as one of  the great liberal scholars of this body.   This is where we get the numbers game. I heard it said on the floor  many times that we are talking about maybe 1 percent or that maybe  talking about those who are in the ninth month may be an infinitesimal  number, but in fact, one is too many. It was said on the floor that we  may be only talking about 200 lives being taken during the normal  delivery process. That is when a baby is given a natural birth and,  yet, they take the life by using this barbaric procedure. We have all  kinds of documentation that it is being done in the ninth month and  during the normal birth process. They say only 200--only 200 lives are  taken.   I agree with Patrick Moynihan. I am totally in a different philosophy  than he is, but one is too many.   I am from Oklahoma, and some of you remember that we lost 168 lives  in the Murrah Federal Office Building bombing. This was the largest  domestic terrorist attack in American history. Did anybody say that is  only 168 lives that were lost in Oklahoma City? No, the entire Nation  came with compassion and mourned with us.   One life--I agree with Senator Moynihan--is too many.   One other issue that has not been discussed in this debate this  year--keep in mind that is 1997--is that of pain. Rather than go into  it--I do not think anyone refutes the fact that a small baby, if that  baby is certainly past the second trimester, feels pain every bit as  much as anybody who is in here, as any Member of the U.S. Senate would  feel pain.   There was a study conducted in London, and I have the results here,  but I think everyone understands that this is something that is very  real--that these babies do feel pain.   My junior Senator gave an excellent speech on the floor, and he  talked about all of these issues in a different way, but he is doing it  currently, and we are talking about now quite a number of years ago.   I have a picture of a good friend of mine with me. His name is Jase-- James Edward Rapert.   Back when people our age were having babies--I am talking about  myself now. Kay and I have been married 59 years. We have 20 kids and  grandkids. We know a little bit about this. Back at that time when they  were having babies, they wouldn't even let you in the hospital, let  alone the delivery room.   When my daughter Molly called up and said, ``Daddy, the time is here;  could you come over,'' I went over to the hospital, and she said: Would  you like to come into the delivery room?   I said: Yes, I would.   I saw for the first time what many of you in this room have seen and  many of the women have experienced firsthand. I was there when this  little guy was born. It is hard to describe to some of the men here who  have not been through that experience of seeing this wonderful life  begin, and I can remember when, in that room where the delivery took  place, it occurred to me that when baby Jase, my grandson, was born,  that is the moment when they could have used this procedure inflicting  all of the pain you have heard described so many times: going into the  cranium with the scissors, opening the scissors, sucking the brains  out, and the skull collapses.   That is pain, and there are individuals who want to keep a procedure  like this legal. If you did that to a dog, they would picket in front  of your office. Somehow, we have developed a culture that puts a  greater value on the lives of critters than human life. I watched baby  Jase being born. I suggest to those of you who are concerned about  choice that this is really the choice. It is either that choice or this  choice, and these choices we are facing today.   This is something on which I agree with the Senator from  Pennsylvania. I was talking at that time about Rick Santorum.   We should not be having to talk about it. To think that 100 years  from  [[Page S263]]  now they may look back and talk about that barbaric society that killed  their own young, and here we are just trying to save a few lives from a  very painful death. Nonetheless, that is the issue we are faced with  today.   I gave that speech in 1997 and again in 1998 and year after year  until we won the battle and finally ended the practice of partial-birth  abortion in 2003--a ban that was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2007.  There is still much more that needs to be done to end abortion on  demand culture.   President Trump gets this. He was the first sitting President to  speak at March for Life, and his administration has made real progress  to advance the pro-life agenda. He has reinstated the Mexico City  policy. We remember what that was. It was the one that bans taxpayer  money from funding abortions abroad and directed the Justice Department  to formally investigate Planned Parenthood.   President Trump also directed the Department of Health and Human  Services to expand religious and conscience exemptions to protect  individuals' religious liberty.   I am working in Congress to end the practice of abortion on demand  that strips opportunity away from unborn babies and deprives them of  the right to life.   This week I have joined my colleagues in introducing five commonsense  bills--this is taking place right now, as we speak--in addition to the  Born Alive Abortion Survivors Act, by Senator Sasse, which I mentioned  earlier in this presentation. The No Taxpayer Funding of Abortion Act,  working with Senator Wicker, would establish a governmentwide statutory  prohibition on taxpayer subsidies for abortion and abortion coverage-- simple enough. I am pleased that Majority Leader McConnell has set up a  procedural vote for this bill today.   There is the Life at Conception Act, which Senator Paul has, which  would recognize that life begins at conception.   The Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act, led by Senator  Blackburn--one of our brand-new freshman Senators--would prohibit title  X family planning funds. Those are taxpayer funds now being used to  subsidize abortions.   You might be wondering how that is different from the one just talked  about. Here is how. Every year, Planned Parenthood receives nearly $60  million from the American taxpayer through title X family planning  program. The program is intended to assist low-income women with family  planning services. Unfortunately, this money is being used to subsidize  massive organizations that engage in abortion activities, such as  Planned Parenthood, and we need to stop that.   The Protect Funding for Women's Health Care Act, led by Senator  Ernst, would prohibit all Federal funding of Planned Parenthood.   I also cosponsored the Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act,  led by Senator Rubio, which would prohibit individuals from taking  minors across State lines where they have lax laws just to have an  abortion, stopping their States from having the jurisdiction.   Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I am cosponsoring Senator  Graham's Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would prohibit  abortions from being performed on unborn babies after 20 weeks, when we  know they can feel pain. Only five countries allow abortions after 20  weeks, including the United States and North Korea, and that is  unacceptable.   I wish to acknowledge a very important day. Religious Freedom Day is  today. It is clear that our Founding Fathers recognized and enshrined  the importance of religious liberty--one of our most precious and  foundational religious freedoms, which allowed them to live their lives  according to the teachings of the Bible.   I have long been a strong advocate of the basic human right to freely  worship, and I am glad we can take a moment today to recognize that.   Anyway, all from speeches from 1992 and 1997--it is as true today as  it was then. We are ready to start saving lives instead of taking the  most vulnerable little lives, and we are ready now.   With that, I yield the floor.
