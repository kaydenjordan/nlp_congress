 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas, and I wish  him well and a very Merry Christmas with his family, and save travels  home.   I too share his affinity for wanting to work across the aisle. I have  done so on numerous occasions. I am fairly well known for speaking my  mind on the House floor. But I am happy to work across the aisle, and  also an equal opportunity basher of both sides when I disagree.   But I wish we would have vigorous debate here on the floor of the  House. A lot of things that the gentleman from Texas talked about, I  agree wholeheartedly. The immigrants he discussed wanting to come to  the United States; I would like them to have safe passage under our  rules and under our laws.   Right now we have a broken system that is endangering lives; lives of  immigrants and endangering lives of Americans.   We talked about the ideals and the values of this country, and I  share those ideals and values.   I would ask and inquire of my colleagues in the body broadly, how can  we maintain those ideals if we are bankrupt?   How can we maintain those ideals if we are writing checks we can't  cash?   I can give speech after speech after speech about this topic, but  unless we change our ways on both sides of the aisle, this country will  not survive.   I don't know what it is going to take to get the people who are  entrusted to run this country--and that starts in this Chamber, the  power of the purse, entrusted to the people's House, we are abusing it.  We are conducting our duties irresponsibly, both sides of the aisle.   Today, the United States Senate, the Senate, supposedly, the ``upper  chamber,'' the House of Lords in the United States, if you will, sent  us--or is in the process of sending us, after voting for it, a 4,155- page bill, unveiled yesterday morning at 1:30 a.m., that will cost $1.7  trillion.   This bill will increase spending $118 billion. This bill has $45  billion for the country of Ukraine; 21 percent over President Biden's  request, by the way.   $40 billion for disaster relief. $15 billion for 7,234 earmarks, with  the senior Senator of Alabama, Richard Shelby, walking out of the  Senate with a legacy of $670 million. I believe the senior  [[Page H10044]]  Senator said that monuments are for pigeons and dogs in response to my  criticism.   Well, there is a lot of stuff in your name in Alabama, and you just  got some more, Senator Shelby. Is that what this is about?   Because who is paying for that? He is not paying for it. Our kids and  grandkids are paying for it.   You know what else we are paying for? We are paying for $500,000 to  the Long Island Gay and Lesbian Youth Incorporated; $113,000 to the  LGBT Center of Greater Reading, Pennsylvania; $1.5 million for The  Loft: LGBTQ+ Community Center new home project in New York, which I got  excoriated as somehow being hateful for tweeting that out earlier by  one of my colleagues.   Now, hold on a second. So I am hateful for raising whether or not we  should have $1.5 million set aside for The Loft: LGBTQ+ Community  Center in New York that is then divvied up by both age and sexual  identity or preference. Okay. I am the bad guy for thinking that maybe  taxpayers are thinking, Why are we doing that?   $750,000 for New York-based In Our Own Voices, Inc., which aims to  strengthen the voices of LGBT people of color and increase their  capacity for combating oppression and marginalization.   $250,000 to support Wisconsin's first in the Nation gay rights law  book and archive.   How about the climate agenda? $1.3 million for workforce development  activities at a climate change education center in the Los Angeles  Community College District.   $3 million for clean energy workforce development at the New York  State Energy Research and Development Authority; $200,000 for the Rhode  Island AFL-CIO's climate jobs workforce training initiative.   $875,000 for green energy on demand at Clarkson University; $400,000  for the placement of at-risk young adults into the green jobs industry.   $2 million for community driven air quality environmental justice  assessment at the University of Illinois.   $2 million for a climate change impact on water initiative at Texas  State University. I represent Texas State University and that is  garbage. Why are we doing this?   $10 million for the State of Hawaii's zero emission bus program; $1.6  million for the Center for Wind Energy at UT Dallas. Texas is pretty  well represented with all these earmarks.   Inequality and equity, the omni funds pointless equity initiatives  and subsidies even more radical ideologies, such as $1.5 million for  equity and ecosystem help through water column development; $2.25  million for the shoreline equity and adaptation hub.   $750,000 for the acquisition of a building in Brooklyn, New York, to  create the Brooklyn Center for Social Justice, Entrepreneurship, and  the Arts.   $300,000 for the city of Sacramento's Neighborhood Equity Initiative.   $477,000 for the Equity Institute's ``teacher professional  development.''                                time  1715    How about racial wokeness? A few examples:   $443,000 for the Racial Justice Improvement Project, Montgomery  County DA's office.   $1 million for the Penumbra Theatre in St. Paul, Minnesota, to  develop and implement a curriculum for racial healing and equity  training.   $800,000 for Economic Development For Black Communities in Colorado.   $750,000 for a minority-owned small business emergency assistance  program in Seattle.   I could go on and on and on. For all the things that are put in here  divvying us up by race, divvying us by gender ideology--all of those  earmarks just flooding out with money we don't have.   That is not even the worst of it. That is not even the actual  irresponsibility of this body. That is just pork spending that this  body is used to doing to the tune of $15 billion, $16 billion.   The real problem is that we are funding a whole alphabet soup of  Federal agencies that are demonstrably not doing their jobs--more  importantly, are demonstrably targeting the American people.   The Department of Homeland Security is getting $3.2 billion more with  no policy changes required, in fact, unbelievably, with restrictions on  how that money can be used. It may not be used for security. It may  only be used for processing more people.   That is what our Democratic colleagues and, unfortunately, a sizable  bloc of Republicans believe is a good use of your taxpayer money.   Hey, guys, the Department of Homeland Security is doing such a crack  job of securing the homeland, they are doing such a great job at the  border, let's give them some more money to not secure the border, and  let's restrict it from being able to be used to do any of the security  that the line Border Patrol agents actually want to do their job.   There you go. That is what you got. And what happened in the Senate  today? What happened in the Senate today? I will tell you what happened  in the Senate today.   Blunt, Boozman, Capito, Collins, Cornyn, Cotton, Graham, Inhofe,  McConnell, Moran, Murkowski, Portman, Romney, Rounds, Shelby, Thune,  Wicker, and Young: 18 Republicans who campaigned on fiscal  responsibility, who campaigned on securing the border, who campaigned  on balancing the budget, who campaigned against the swamp, who run  commercials saying they are going to change this place did the  swampiest thing you can possibly do, and that is to vote for a 4,100- page bill they got just yesterday, not knowing remotely what all is in  the bill because it was cooked up behind closed doors with no  appropriations meetings, jamming it over a new House Republican  majority, doing it intentionally to prevent us from being able to  debate and vote on how we are going to fund Ukraine, how we are going  to fund our own national defense, how we are going to fund nondefense  discretionary spending, and ensure that we use that money to secure the  border of the United States.   That is what your Republican Senators, those 18, did to you, America.  Remember it. Remember it when Republicans are going around thumping  their chests, talking about changing this town when they are neck-deep  drowning in the swamp, when they are emblematic of everything wrong  with the swamp. Remember it. Remember it.   I don't like saying it. I have friends on both sides of the aisle,  and some of these 18 are my friends. But do you know what? John Adams  and Thomas Jefferson had a pretty testy relationship because they  fought over the way this country should be run and be set up.   We are hired to fight for the people we represent, so I will be  damned if I am going to give a rat's rear end whether I offend some of  the people in this godforsaken town because I dare question, regardless  of which party they are in, regardless of who they say they are friends  with or who they campaign with, I will be darned if I am going to be  cowed into not calling out what you see unfold before you with your  very eyes.   Leader Mitch McConnell called the bill ``a strong outcome for  Republicans.''   The arguments that I have heard from some of the Members include this  argument. Having lost a vote for a continuing resolution until the new  Republican majority takes over in January, we had two bad choices: cast  a protest vote against funding our military, veterans, Border Patrol,  and other essential government functions, or vote for a flawed bill.   That is what happens in this town. This was a setup, ladies and  gentlemen. It was purposeful. Well orchestrated by Mitch McConnell. I  do not question that. He is good at playing these games in this town,  as is virtually everybody associated with the appropriations process  and leadership of the House and the Senate.   They have all the excuses in the world: There is a troop pay raise.  There is a helicopter that we need to buy. There are missiles we need  to buy. There are boats and planes we need to buy. Because of that, we  must cast a vote for a flawed bill rather than ``a protest vote.''   A protest vote? What is a protest vote? My vote, which I will cast  whenever we get this monstrosity finally sent over here, whenever the  Committee on Rules goes through their sham process--and it is a sham  process, ladies and gentlemen.  [[Page H10045]]    They will entertain some amendments, and they will give some  perfunctory, ``Let's review it.'' They will kick it down here to the  floor. There will be no debate, no amendments offered. It will be  jammed through because every one of the people in this Chamber, both  sides of the aisle--maybe not everyone, the vast majority--they want to  get on their jets and get home for Christmas.   You should have seen the wailing and gnashing of teeth last night  when Mike Lee was offering an amendment over in the Senate to try to  address the expiration of title 42 and what is going to occur if the  Supreme Court lifts its stay. What is going to happen in Texas, what is  going to happen to the United States, what is going to happen to  migrants, the empowerment of cartels, the fentanyl pouring into our  country, Mike Lee dared to try to do something about that.    You should have seen the wailing and gnashing of teeth: Well, what  are you going to do? We don't want to be here until Christmas.   Why don't you tell that to George Washington and the boys crossing  the Delaware in 1776 or the boys in Bastogne in 1944?   What were they doing on Christmas? Were they trying to fly out of the  Nation's Capital in their jets back to their homes around their warm  fireplaces so they could be with their families after they absolutely  just royally screwed the country and their kids and grandkids? Because  that is what they just did. That is what this body, this House Chamber,  the people's House, is going to do tomorrow morning.   Mr. Speaker, $600 million more for the Federal Bureau of  Investigation while doing nothing to stop it from colluding with Big  Tech, targeting parents, or harassing pro-lifers, all of which the FBI  is doing as we speak.   It is better than that, ladies and gentlemen across the country. They  are getting a brand-new headquarters. Do you want to know what almost  derailed this lovely $1.7 trillion piece of legislation? A fight over  where to put the fancy new FBI headquarters.   These are the important things we do here in this city. Let's figure  out who can get their pork back home in the form of a massive Federal  agency that is involved on a daily basis in targeting the American  people in the name of law enforcement. That sounds like a winning prize  for the people of either Maryland or Virginia. Let's grow this greater  metropolitan area even more.   What could do more for the people of the United States than to have a  fancy new FBI headquarters filled with all sorts of people who are  conspiring to target the American people and actually label a father as  a domestic terrorist for daring to go to a school board meeting?   By the way, the superintendent of that school system has been  indicted. These are all the things that just get swept aside, pushed to  the corner. Nobody wants to talk about it.   Where are my colleagues, by the way? I get an hour of debate time  down here. Where is everybody? Are they sipping on some eggnog with  some whiskey and having some steak dinners or something?   What is more important than sitting down here on the floor and  highlighting the fraud being perpetrated on the American people right  before our eyes, a complete and utter disastrous fraud, endorsed by 18  Republican Senators--I hope none of my Republican colleagues in this  Chamber, but we will see--a bill that will fundamentally limit our  ability to secure the border.   It is actually in the dang bill. They don't even pretend anymore,  ladies and gentlemen. They don't even try to hide it. They actually put  the text in the bill that says this money cannot be used to secure the  border of the United States. It can only be used to process people.  That is in the text of this bill.   Let me be clear to those 18 United States Senators: That alone should  have been enough to have you vote ``no'' on this bill. Yet, you voted  for it.   It should have been enough that we are giving another $600 million to  the FBI and building a new headquarters.   It should have been enough that there is more money for ATF and all  sorts of provisions to go after law-abiding gun owners. It should have  been enough that there was $2.5 billion more for NIH, which funded  gain-of-function research in Wuhan and pays Anthony Fauci's salary in  perpetuity, and hires CRT propaganda speakers.   I say again to those 18 Republican Senators: You own this. You own  every one of those earmarks that I listed and said in this speech,  every one of those earmarks that I put out in a tweet thread earlier.  You own it. You own it with the kind of reasoning that says: Well, you  vote for a flawed bill instead of casting a ``protest vote.''   It is not a protest vote to come to the Chamber where you were hired  by your constituents to fight for them and vote against the funding of  the very tyranny you campaigned against; to vote against the very  irresponsible spending that is driving up our national debt, increasing  inflation, weakening the dollar, undermining the American family; to  vote against that; to vote against the funding of the Federal  bureaucrats like, for example, the $760,000 more going to the CDC,  whose Director lied about vaccine efficacy while the CDC colluded with  Big Tech to suppress free speech about vaccines.   How about the World Health Organization, giving them more money?   The State Department, $3.6 billion: They fund drag shows in Ecuador  and an LGBT group in Kazakhstan that advocates for transwomen sex  workers with migration experience.   I don't care what you believe about these things. Why in the hell are  the American people borrowing money to fund them? Someone explain that  to me. Someone explain to me how it is in the interest of the United  States, when we are sitting here $31.4 trillion in debt, to borrow more  money to build more Federal buildings, to hire more Federal  bureaucrats, to fund these kinds of earmark programs throughout the  world, things that nobody in America actually wants to see happen. Poll  it. Go ahead.   Elon, if you are listening, throw this out on Twitter for a poll. I  promise you what the result will be.                                time  1730    The American people are beside themselves at an incompetent Chamber  in this body and the other side of this building in the Senate who seem  to wake up every single day and decide, how can we screw the American  people over more today than we did yesterday?   Well, today is a banner day in the annals of this supposedly august  institution known as the United States Congress:   $560 million for an EPA destroying reliable energy;   $574 million for a Department of Interior that has leased fewer  Federal acres for oil and gas development than any administration since  World War II.   Before I turn it over to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry),  my friend, I assume tomorrow, after voting for this monster of a bill  as a body--not individually--I assume that we will all be heading out  for Christmas. This bill will pass. This bill will become law.   My question for this body, heading into the 118th Congress, is what  are we going to do to change the way we do business? This is no way to  operate. You cannot drop 4,000 page, $1.7 trillion bills onto the floor  of the Senate, jam it through, send it over here so bad that we are  having to wait to get it by midnight, work through the Rules Committee  to vote on it in the morning so everybody can get out to beat a winter  storm.   We had all year. All year we had to try to fund this Federal  Government responsibly, and we failed. We fail every year. No  corporation would put up with this garbage. Every one of us would be  fired. And we should be.   And I will just say right now, if my colleagues will join with me to  all resign, I will resign. I would love to clean this place out. I  would love to get rid of every last person in here, including my  friends, because if you took, in the words of William Buckley, the  first 435 names in the phone book, can they do any worse than the  schleps in this body? I don't for the life of me understand how it can  be possible to do worse than we do.   And the Senate itself, hell, the Senate makes us look like William  the Conqueror. They don't even bother to do Appropriations Committee  work. They just scoff and sit at their tables and go, well, we will  just do the work for them. Yeah, thanks, Mitch.    I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania for the purposes  of a colloquy.    Yes, 1:30 in the morning.    There is a joke in there somewhere.    Hey, wait a minute. Does the gentleman have any ideas about  why Alabama might be receiving so many of these earmarks?    My friend from Pennsylvania makes a great deal of sense, and  I can't help but observe the utter hypocrisy, with all due respect, of  so many of our colleagues on this side of the aisle in both the so- called upper Chamber and the so-called people's House.   How about the junior Senator from Utah, Mitt Romney, when he said in  2021, quote, Democrats want to spend boatloads of money at the wrong  time and in the wrong ways instead of addressing inflation and dealing  with the emerging threat of China. They are dead set on raising taxes  and government giveaways. This isn't how we solve the problems facing  Americans, end quote.   Well, the junior Senator from Utah just supported this monstrosity-- opposed, I believe, the senior Senator from Utah in the election this  year, the senior Senator from Utah being the one who was trying to stop  this monstrosity today.   How about the exiting senior Senator from Alabama? In July of 2022,  just this year: ``Inflation hit 9.1 percent today, another record high.  This is devastating news for millions of hardworking Americans. The  Biden administration remains remiss in getting inflation under control.  Passing another massive tax-and-spend bill would be a mistake we cannot  afford.''   Well, here is the problem with Republicans, with all due respect to  Republicans, they love to use the phrase tax  [[Page H10047]]  and spend, but my Republican colleagues, who oppose tax increases,  which I generally do as well, sure have no problem with spend and  spend.   Spend for defense, spend for nondefense discretionary, and then go  with their tail tucked between their legs back home and go: I am sorry,  I couldn't really do anything about it. Our hands were tied because we  must have the spending for defense, and we must have the spending for  Ukraine because somebody gave a fancy speech in this Chamber last  night.    I will yield.    That is a great question that my friend raises. The omnibus  spending bill that is coming over to us from the Senate, to the best of  my understanding, raises defense spending somewhere in the neighborhood  of 8 to 10 percent, right?     It is more than what the President asked for, I believe.    Correct. But in addition to the increase in spending for our  national defense, there is also an additional $45 billion, which is  almost the entire budget of our Department of Homeland Security, by the  way, $45 billion additional to go to Ukraine on top of the almost $60  billion already approved, authorized this last year, bringing it to  somewhere around $100 billion, again for Ukraine, well eclipsing,  almost doubling our own Department of Homeland Security budget, well  eclipsing the entire defense budget of Russia. American taxpayers are  paying for that.   We talked about, I think, the 8 to 10 percent increase in defense  spending. I would have to look at my notes. A sizable pop of money.   Is the gentleman in agreement, because the gentleman served in the  United States military for 30 years, and I thank him for it, just like  I thank every other veteran and every other Active-Duty member of our  United States military for standing up to defend this country, but I  don't think the gentleman did that in order to rack up more debt and to  destroy our financial security. I don't think the gentleman did that in  order to throw 10 percent more money to the Department of Defense, a  Department of Defense which is continually more of a social engineering  experiment wrapped in a uniform than it is a military designed to kill  people and blow things up. Would the gentleman agree?                                time  1745     I would just ask the gentleman from Pennsylvania: Do you  recall when the gentleman and myself came to the floor of the House  right after the invasion of Ukraine by Putin, and we spoke right here  at this table, and we spoke about the horrors being inflicted and the  evil being perpetrated by Vladimir Putin, the extent to which we were  in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and wanting to stand up and  defend their country against the thuggish behavior and the willful  destruction of lives and the carnage that had been carried out by  Vladimir Putin and the Russian Army?   Does the gentleman remember our being here on the floor talking about  that in the early stages, wanting to stand up and support the people of  Ukraine before this Chamber embarked on a 9-month spending spree  without any pay-fors and without any significant accountability or  knowledge of how the dollars were flowing and without any care and  concern about what we are doing for our sovereignty and security on the  home front; does the gentleman remember that?    I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    And does the gentleman believe that it is possible for  people who have concerns about these things--about the spending, about  the ridiculous decisionmaking in this Chamber--to want to stand up and  be able to say that they stand with the people of Ukraine in solidarity  but don't believe that writing a blank check is in their interest, our  interest, or anybody's interest?    I want to lay that foundation about our shared desire to  stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine; whatever that means in  terms of resources, that should be debated.   And by the way, side note: Have we ever had a full, robust debate  with amendments and being able to offer any kind of discussion here  about Ukraine on the floor of the house?    On any matter whatsoever.   So what I would inquire of the gentleman is does he agree with this:  If you go back and look about what is going on, everything you are  seeing unfold before your eyes, America, is a setup? It is a complete  setup.   You go back to September, and a block of about 42 of us wrote a  letter to the leaders of these august bodies saying, Hey, how about not  doing a continuing resolution into the middle of December right before  Christmas? How about you not do that because we know exactly what that  results in.   We sent that letter.   What happened in September?   A continuing resolution right until the middle of December.   Now, you get to the continuing resolution in the middle of December,  and there is all sorts of chatter about: Will there be a continuing  resolution into early 2023 with a new House majority?   Never in the last 70 years have we had a change, a transfer in the  majority of the House Chamber and had the Senate do what it did today,  which is jam through a massive spending bill with the existing House,  soon to be minority, and jam it through.  [[Page H10048]]    Now, fast-forward to right now, and what do you have? We have this  bill sent to us that spends $1.7 trillion: a 10 percent increase in  defense spending; $42 billion increase in nondefense spending, which is  6 percent; Ukraine funding of $45 billion; disaster relief funding of  $40 billion; and $15 billion of earmarks that I went through and  described a little bit ago.   Who spoke in the Chamber in the United States House of  Representatives last night, other than the President of Ukraine?   Now, does the gentleman believe, as I do, that that is not an  accident?   The entire setup from the House Republicans and the Senate  Republicans working with the Democrat leadership in both Chambers was  to set that up so that you have the President of Ukraine speaking here  saying we have got to pass this massive spending bill because you had  the whole theatrical event set up from the beginning, set up to expire  right before Christmas to then jam through 7,200 earmarks, a massive  amount of spending, a continued explosion of the bureaucratic state, a  restriction on the ability to secure the border, all because you knew  you had a handful of Republicans on the hook who couldn't help  themselves because we are talking about defense and we are talking  about Ukraine.   Does the gentleman think that maybe that stuff is not a coincidence?    I am suggesting that it was in no way, shape, or form a  coincidence. I am suggesting that it was purposeful theater designed  very specifically to create the winds in the sails of the appropriation  process which is badly broken, and we get a 4,100-page bill dropped on  us that we then must vote for. Right? Have to vote for it.    I would add that my 13-year-old son was telling me yesterday  morning while I was getting ready to catch the plane to come to  Washington, as we were stacking firewood for my wife and daughter and  son to use during this cold snap coming into Texas, and he and I were  talking and he said, ``Well, Dad''--basically begging me--``you are  going to be home for Christmas, right?''   You know, that is my 13-year-old son, and I don't get to see him a  lot when I am up here. And he is saying, ``Dad, you are going to be  here for Christmas, right?''   And my daughter was saying the same thing, but my son was asking the  question. And I said, ``Look, son, I hope so. Of course, I want to be  here for Christmas, but under no circumstances am I going to walk away  from my duty to fight to give you the country that I inherited, that my  dad inherited from his dad, and so forth and so forth.''   Yet, most of my colleagues in this Chamber were so itching to be able  to get on their plane or get in their car and go home that last night  there was group that were apoplectic that we might be stuck here, that  we might be stuck here until Sunday, which is Christmas day, I had  multiple people come to me and say, ``Well, what is Senator Lee going  to do?   What is going to happen?''   Well, heaven forbid, we do our job. Heaven forbid, we do something  responsibly. I would ask the gentleman, with a $118 billion increase in  spending on our annual year-over-year spending, not including Ukraine  spending, not including the disaster relief spending, the emergency  spending, on top of the almost $5 trillion we spent in response to  COVID, do you think there is a correlation to government action and  government spending to inflation?   Would the gentleman agree that it is government that causes inflation  based on our actions, our spending, our policy choices?    I assume the gentleman would agree that when we are talking  about this spending--let's pause for a second.   Let's just set aside the fact that we are giving a $76 billion  increase to a Defense Department, which has not been held accountable  for its departure from Afghanistan, leaving billions behind, walking  away from Bagram, undermining our interests, no accountability, no  review of the woke policies, orders not to use terms like ``mom'' and  ``dad'' at the Air Force academy or a whole story yesterday about the  Marines maybe walking away from the use of ``sir'' and ``ma'am,'' it is  just a fundamental undermining of the culture of the Department of  Defense--purposeful by the way.                                time  1800    Every recruit and every member of the Armed Forces Active Duty whom I  [[Page H10049]]  have talked to says that it is gutting the ability to recruit, and it  is gutting the ability to have strong morale.   Let's put aside that. Let's put aside $45 billion for Ukraine without  accountability and a knowledge of how it is being spent and what it is  being used for in our national security interests. Let's set aside $40  billion for disaster relief. I don't even know where it is going.   Let's set aside the $16 billion in earmarks my friend just talked  about and that he and I outlined. Let's set aside the $3 billion for  DHS with no policy changes and, in fact, language inserted in the bill  that prevents us from actually securing the border while processing  more people; the $600 million for the Federal Bureau of Investigation,  the new headquarters for the FBI; the $215 million for ATF; $2.5  billion for NIH which is basically at war with freedom and forcing  needles into the arms of the American people and undermining the  freedom of the American people in terms of their health choices and  paying Anthony Fauci's salary; a CDC of $760 million; the World Health  Organization; the State Department at $3.6 billion; an Education  Department which is administering Biden's $400 billion student loan  bailout, all of that stuff, let's ignore all of that.   Let's ignore all of those horrible policies and all the things that  he is doing to undermine our freedom and creating the alphabet soup and  expanding the alphabet soup of bureaucracy that is tyrannizing the  American people.   Let's put all that aside. We are just talking about inflation, and we  are spending more money and dumping more money. While we are raising  interest rates to cool it, we are going to spend more money causing  more inflation, undermining the dollar even more.   In July of 2022, we had Mitch McConnell just saying that, oh, a few  years back Republican policies created the best economy for American  workers in a generation, low inflation, robust growth, record  unemployment. Democrats' recklessness--Democrats' recklessness he  said--has produced soaring inflation, slowing growth and growing risk  of a full-on recession.   How about Shelley Moore Capito from West Virginia in August of 2022  in an op-ed, thumping the lectern about the Inflation Reduction Act:  ``Americans understand pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into the  economy and raising taxes will certainly not reduce inflation.''   How about Todd Young from Indiana: ``About the border, this is a  national security crisis. We must strengthen our border security.''   How about Mitt Romney from Utah who told Mayorkas that he needed to  secure the border and urged him to keep title 42 in place. And then he  just worked against the whole effort today by the junior Senator from  Utah.   Things are upside down, and we are spending money we don't have  causing inflation. Republicans go out and campaign against it, and then  they do it.   And my Democratic colleagues have never once had an honest  conversation on the floor of this House about what we are going to do  about inflation, what we are going to do about spending money we don't  have and racking up debt.   When I came to Congress as a staffer on the Senate Judiciary  Committee, our national debt in 2003 was about $6 trillion, I think. We  are at $31.4 trillion and climbing.   The question here is: Are we going to do anything about it?   The resounding answer from this body,--including my colleagues on  this side of the aisle--is: No, we are not.   So I think my question for the gentleman is: Does he share my belief  that it is time to end the status quo and that it is time for a radical  departure from the way we are doing things?   It is time to change the way we are doing business in the House of  Representatives. It is time for a change to do the way we are doing  business in the United States Senate, and it is our job to keep our  heads up high as not conservatives and not Republicans or Democrats but  as Americans who want to actually do the hard work necessary to be  responsible stewards of this country and of our great birthright.   Does the gentleman agree with me that as we head into the 118th  Congress and as Republicans are in the majority that we must  fundamentally change this institution from top to bottom, from the  leadership down?   This place must change, and we will not accept anything but change.  That is why we were sent here. As we exit here for Christmas, as my  friend goes home to his daughter and I go home to my son and my  daughter, I am not going to look them in the eye and say that I didn't  do everything I know how to do so we can change this place so that we  can save America for them.   Mr. PERRY: I agree with the gentleman with this caveat: It is not  just time; it is long past time.   I would suggest to the good gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy) that he  has worked diligently in his time here within the system, within the  status quo, to make these changes.   Others do not want to make too many ripples because you have to work  with these folks, and this is the system that is set up, and if you  make everybody mad at you, how are you going to be effective?   The status quo is not working, ladies and gentlemen. We have tried.  We have tried to work within the system that is here. The system that  is here produces this.   Do you know how I know?   Because since I have been here, this isn't the first time I have come  to the mic. I can come here probably every few months and go through  the same thing. It is not the first time right around Christmas we have  got a short-term continuing resolution right before Christmas so we can  pass an omnibus and just keep on spending the money that we don't have  and more programs that don't make any sense.   We have got $3 million for the University of Maine system to research  wild blackberry production for changing markets and climates.    Well, my goodness, as a man who had to pick blueberries--that was my  first job was picking fruit, and blueberries were one of them--I don't  know why it is the job of the whole country to pay for the University  of Maine to figure out about blueberry production.   Ladies and gentlemen, this system is broken. The status quo doesn't  work for Americans. The lady that has to buy these blueberries and  can't afford them doesn't care about this system here. She doesn't care  about the status quo and making colleagues uncomfortable in this  Chamber or the other one. What she cares about is feeding her children  and feeding her family. And right now she can't afford to do it because  of the status quo.   This cannot continue. Something has to change. Einstein said that  doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different  outcome is the definition of insanity.   Ladies and gentlemen, citizens of America, we are doing the same  things under the same conditions with the same people, and somehow, we  think something is going to change.   Well, it is not going to change unless we change it.   We are highlighting this tonight. The gentleman from Texas and I are  here highlighting this tonight to tell you how egregious it is, how  long it has been going on, and to elicit your support--your support-- calling your Representatives and your Senators and saying: This will  not stand. We are sick and tired of this: $2.52 million for an electric  battery and an electric charging station program at some community  college; $6.85 million for real estate strategies to obtain equity  property acquisition and redevelopment in Delaware.   Why is that your job to pay for that?   We don't have the money to pay for that.   You would like it in your community I bet. But you are going to pay  for it in someone else's.    Merry Christmas to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and  merry Christmas to the staff here. God bless you all and thank you for  all the work you do for this country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
