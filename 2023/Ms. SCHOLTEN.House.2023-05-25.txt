 Madam Speaker, once again I am standing here today  while House Republican leadership has failed to do the bare minimum.   Where are they?   The Republican side of this Chamber is vacant while House Democrats  have remained at the ready to do their jobs and pay America's bills.  [[Page H2622]]    It is fiscally responsible to pay our bills. Doing so would protect  my friends, neighbors, and constituents in west Michigan from  disastrous consequences.   Defaulting would kill nearly 8,000 jobs in my district alone,  jeopardize Social Security payments for nearly 90,000 families, and  mean financial chaos on an unprecedented scale, hurting working  families across the country.   House Republicans' solution?   Cut nearly 30,000 law enforcement jobs. The party that says that they  back the blue wants to take their jobs away.   This is a false choice. There is a bill sitting right here that needs  just five more Republicans. We invite them to sign it.   We can and must act now. It is Congress' job to get this done.                            ____________________
