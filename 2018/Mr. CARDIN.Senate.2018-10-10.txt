 Mr. President, today I wish to discuss American's access  to healthcare and the patient protections that are currently being  threatened by the Trump administration, specifically expanding the  availability of junk health insurance, also known as short-term limited  duration plans.   Short-term limited duration insurance is a type of health insurance  that was designed to fill temporary gaps in coverage, such as when an  individual is transitioning from one plan or coverage to another plan  or coverage.   The Obama administration limited these plans to 3 months to ensure  they would be used only as a backstop for those who truly need  temporary, limited duration coverage.   A major flaw of this insurance is that it is exempt from certain  consumer protections provided through the Affordable Care Act.   Because of the Affordable Care Act, health insurance companies are  required to offer essential health benefits such as emergency services,  maternity care, mental health and substance use disorder services, and  preventative services. Additionally, insurance companies are no longer  allowed to place annual or lifetime dollar limits on coverage and  cannot refuse to cover someone or charge someone more just because they  have a preexisting condition.   Among the most common preexisting conditions are high blood pressure,  behavioral health disorders, high cholesterol, asthma/chronic lung  disease, heart conditions, diabetes, and cancer.   In 2017, HHS released a report stating that as many as 133 million  non-elderly Americans have a preexisting condition. The Maryland Health  Benefit Exchange estimates that there are approximately 2.5 million  non-elderly Marylanders with a preexisting condition, 320,000 of which  are children.   Expanding access to short-term limited duration plans is another in a  long line of GOP healthcare sabotage efforts since President Trump took  office. Short-term plans are allowed to have annual or lifetime dollar  limits on coverage, and do not have to provide coverage of essential  health benefits or provide coverage to those with preexisting  conditions. These plans will lead to increased health insurance  premiums for people buying insurance on the ACA marketplace. Healthy  individuals may be deceived to leave the marketplace and buy these junk  plans instead.   Short-term plans will impose an ``age tax'' on seniors because they  are allowed to charge seniors more for coverage. Currently, the ACA  limits how much more plans are allowed to charge seniors.   Short-term plans are junk insurance, plain and simple. People believe  they have coverage, but when they get sick and need medical care, they  suddenly realize the plan that they paid for won't allow them to  receive the care they require.   These actions by the Trump administration to expand access to short- term plans is wrong. Not only do these actions directly threatens the  133 million Americans with preexisting conditions, but also any  American who wishes to have strong, affordable, and comprehensive  coverage.                                   S. 3021     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I regret to inform our colleagues of the  death of Joe Tydings, who died on Monday, succumbing to cancer at the  age of 90. Senator Tydings was one of the most outspoken progressive  Democrats in this body.   He was born to privilege. His father was a Democratic Senator from  the State of Maryland--a conservative Democratic Senator. His  grandfather was one of our first Ambassadors to the Soviet Union. His  paternal grandfather married Marjorie Merriweather Post, who built Mar- a-Lago, which most of us know is in Palm Beach. He came from a family  of great privilege. Yet he was known in Maryland as a person of the  people, representing the people of our State.   His first elected office was president of the Young Democrats of  Maryland. From there, he became a member of the Maryland House of  Delegates, where he fought the establishment, took on the network in  Annapolis, and investigated the savings and loan situation in our  State. He really shined a lot of light on what was happening in abuses  in that industry.   He was chosen by then-Senator Kennedy to head up his campaign for  President. Joe Tydings handled his campaign in Maryland for President  and helped in other primaries around the Nation, leading to President  Kennedy's election as President of the United States.   President Kennedy asked him to serve as the U.S. attorney for  Maryland, and Senator Tydings served as the U.S. attorney. He was known  for his independence at the U.S. Attorney's Office. He pursued white  collar crime and political corruption. He indicted and convicted a  former Member of the House of Representatives, as well as the speaker  of the Maryland House of Delegates. He recruited young talent to his  office in the U.S. Attorney's Office, including Ben Civiletti, who went  on to become the Attorney General of the United States, and Stephen  Sachs, who continued to become the attorney general for the State of  Maryland.   In 1964 he ran and was elected to the U.S. Senate. He worked on  progressive causes, including the Voting Rights Act, which he helped to  get enacted under President Johnson, and also gun safety legislation.   After leaving the Senate after one term, he continued to be extremely  active in our community. He was best known, I believe, for his work at  the University of Maryland. He served three terms on the board of  regents of the University of Maryland system, giving back to the school  where he graduated from both undergraduate and law school, and he was  known as one of the most aggressive people in the reform of our  University of Maryland System and also in the independence of the  university hospital.   On a personal note, let me tell you that he helped with my election  to the U.S. Senate 12 years ago and gave me a great deal of support and  friendship and was an adviser and role model for me. I remember his  being here when I took the oath of office as a Senator, walking me down  the aisle. I had a great deal of pride that he was with me.   He is going to be missed by all of us--just an incredible person, a  person who put his principles over practical politics. It may have cost  him an election, but he did what he thought was right. I can tell you  that we are all proud of his service to the people of Maryland and our  Nation.   Mr. President, we will miss this man, who was determined to help bend  the arc of the moral universe toward justice as fast as possible.   Joe Tydings was born as Joseph Davies Cheesborough in Asheville, NC,  on May 4, 1928, to Eleanor Davies of Watertown, WI, and Tom  Cheesborough of Asheville. Tydings' sister, Eleanor Cheesborough, was  born in 1932. In 1935, his parents divorced, and his mother married  Millard Tydings, who was then serving his second of four terms as one  of Maryland's U.S. Senators. Several years later, Millard Tydings  formally adopted Joe and his sister, Eleanor.   Joe Tydings' illustrious family included his namesake grandfather,  Joseph Davies, an early adviser to Woodrow Wilson, who later was  appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as America's second  Ambassador to the Soviet Union. While Joe was still a boy, his maternal  grandfather married one of the richest women in America, Marjorie  Merriweather Post, who owned homes in New York City and Long Island,  the Hillwood Estate here in Washington, DC, the Topridge Great Camp in  the Adirondacks, and built Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. Joe sailed home  from Europe aboard the Sea Cloud, Post's luxurious 322-foot, four- masted barque, the largest privately owned sea-going yacht in the world  at the time.   Joe Tydings attended public schools in Aberdeen, MD, before entering  the McDonough School in Baltimore County as a military cadet in 1938.  After he graduated, he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1946 and served in  one of the Army's last horse platoons as part of the postwar occupation  of Germany. When he returned to the United States in 1948, he entered  the University of Maryland, where he played lacrosse and football and  was student body president and then earned his law degree at the  University of Maryland Law School in 1953.   Joe Tydings was surrounded by tremendous wealth and prestige and  political power while he was growing up. The obituary that appeared in  the Baltimore Sun notes that, despite the fact that Joe was born into a  life of privilege, he was a frugal person and quotes his daughter, Mary  Tydings, as saying, ``He was a man of the people despite how he grew  up.'' His adoptive father was also a Democrat but opposed some of the  New Deal legislation because he was a fiscal conservative. Joe, on the  other hand, was a progressive from the get-go and attributed his  Wisconsin-born mother as the influence, but it is clear that his  father, who was known for taking principled, if often controversial,  stands on many issues, also shaped Joe's approach to politics and to  life.  [[Page S6753]]    As I said earlier, Joe Tydings started his political career by  serving as president of the Maryland Young Democrats. While he was  president, he confronted a hotel owner in Ocean City who refused to let  Black members of the organization stay at the hotel for an event being  held there. In 1954, Joe was elected to represent Harford County in the  Maryland House of Delegates. Once there, it was clear that he was  willing to fight established powers. He started with the State's  savings and loan, S&L, associations following a banking scandal. In  ``My Life in Progressive Politics: Against the Grain,'' an  autobiography cowritten by former Baltimore Sun reporter John W. Frece  published earlier this year, Joe reflected, ``I was appalled no one was  doing anything about it.'' The reason, he argued, was that many too  many Maryland politicians were profiting from the schemes that led to  the scandal.   While Joe Tydings had a famous last name in Maryland political  circles, it was his early and enthusiastic association with Senator  John F. Kennedy that pushed Joe onto the national stage. In 1960, Joe  directed Kennedy's Presidential campaign in Maryland and then helped  out in other primaries, at the party convention in Los Angeles, and  throughout the fall election. After Kennedy won, Tydings was offered a  post in the new administration, and he asked to be appointed U.S.  attorney for Maryland. The Maryland Democratic Party establishment was  wary of the young reformer; nearly every Democratic Congressman in the  State opposed his appointment. President Kennedy questioned his  brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy about the opposition,  saying ``how can I appoint him with all these people opposed to him.''  Robert Kennedy replied, ``That's exactly why you are going to appoint  him.''   As U.S. attorney, Joe Tydings assembled a staff of neophyte trial  attorneys that included a future Attorney General of the United States,  Benjamin R. Civiletti, and a future Attorney General of Maryland,  Stephen H. Sachs, and many other lawyers who would become judges and  successful attorneys with prominent law firms. He worked hard to  establish the nonpartisan reputation of the U.S. attorney's office in  Maryland and build a modern Federal prosecution force that has  effectively targeted political corruption in Maryland up to the present  day. Joe successfully prosecuted Representative Thomas Johnson, a  fellow Democrat, for receiving illegal gratuities. He successfully  prosecuted Maryland House Speaker A. Gordon Boone, another Democrat,  for mail fraud connected with the S&L scandal.   In 1963, President Kennedy visited Oakington, the Tydings' 550-acre  estate along the Chesapeake Bay in Harford County, to urge Joe to run  for the Senate, which he agreed to do. On the November day that Tydings  held his farewell luncheon with colleagues to prepare for his Senate  run, he learned that President Kennedy had been assassinated in Dallas.  Joe ran as a reformer and had to win a primary against the State's  beloved comptroller, Louis L. Goldstein. Joe, whose campaign slogan was  ``Working for Maryland, Not the Machine,'' energized reformers within  the State party, attracted an army of volunteers, and won. It was Louis  Goldstein's only loss during six decades in public office. Joe then  went on to defeat the incumbent Republican Senator, James Glenn Beall,  Sr., in the general election.   As a Senator, Joe Tydings backed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and  the Fair Housing Act of 1968. He supported controversial decisions of  the Warren Court, including the one-man, one-vote requirement for  apportionment of State legislatures; the prohibition of prayer in  public schools; and the guarantee of the rights of defendants to remain  silent and to be represented by counsel. He was an early advocate for  family planning and worried all his life about the detrimental health  and environmental effects of worldwide overpopulation. He reached  across the aisle to get things done, working with Republican colleagues  such as then-Representative George H.W. Bush. He regularly decried the  lack of bipartisanship in the Congress today.   Like many of his congressional peers, Joe Tydings came to office  supporting American involvement in Vietnam, but as the war escalated,  deaths mounted, and protests spread throughout the country, Tydings  finally broke with President Lyndon B. Johnson and came out against the  war.   Although Joe was ranked 100th in seniority when he arrived in the  Senate, he authored legislation to make long overdue improvements to  the Federal court system, many of which are still in place today. He  helped to create the system of Federal magistrates to lighten the  workload of Federal judges; improved jury selection so that Federal  juries more fairly represent the make-up of their communities; and  worked to keep unfit, unqualified, or mentally or physically  incapacitated judges off the bench. Joe became an ``enemy'' of  President Richard M. Nixon by helping to defeat two of the President's  Supreme Court nominees, Clement F. Haynsworth, Jr., and G. Harrold  Carswell.   Joe Tydings was an avid outdoorsman and hunter, but supported  sensible gun safety laws, including the Firearms Registration and  Licensing Act, which earned him the enmity of the gun lobby and the  National Rifle Association.   By the time he stood for reelection in 1970, Joe later admitted, he  had probably supported one liberal position too many. The country had  changed, and Joe's progressive outlook had been supplanted by the  backlash to new civil rights laws, fear over race riots in American  cities, and a deep division over Vietnam. Vice President Spiro Agnew,  who had been Governor of Maryland, called Joe a ``radical.'' Joe  narrowly lost his reelection bid to John Glenn Beall, Jr., the son of  the man he had defeated in 1964, 51 percent to 48 percent.   I mentioned that Joe was an avid outdoorsman. He was also a great  horseman. One of the many causes to which he dedicated his energies  after he returned to private life was the protection of Tennessee  Walking Horses from the inhumane practice of ``soring.'' He sought  vigorous implementation of the Horse Protection Act of 1970, which he  had authored while still in the Senate, and was honored by the U.S.  Humane Society for his efforts.    After Joe left the Senate, he kept his hand in Maryland politics,  supporting various reform candidates and pushing for legislation to  protect his beloved Chesapeake Bay. He went on to serve as a member and  later as chairman of the board of regents of his alma mater, the  University of Maryland. He was appointed to three separate terms on the  regents by three different Governors in three different decades. In  1977, Joe called for the board of regents of the University of Maryland  to divest its endowment from companies doing business with the  apartheid regime in South Africa. In September 2008, then-Maryland  Governor Martin O'Malley appointed Joe to the board of the University  of Maryland Medical System.   Joe Tydings was indefatigable. He built a national and international  career in law, offering his legal services pro bono in cases  challenging the death penalty. As the Baltimore Sun obituary noted,  ``At an age when his peers were considering retirement, Sen. Tydings  worked as an attorney with the Washington law firm Blank Rome LLP. `He  didn't need to be here for the last 20 years of his life,' said Jim  Kelly, chairman of Blank Rome's Washington office. But Sen. Tydings  chose to continue to work toward causes he deemed important. `It sounds  a little trite, but he really was committed to basic notions of justice  and fairness,' Kelly said. `He was not afraid to wear that on his  sleeve, and he was not afraid to stand up and be counted.' ''   When I was sworn in as U.S. Senator for the first time in the 110th  Congress, I was honored to have Joe Tydings join Senators Paul Sarbanes  and Barbara Mikulski and escort me to the well to take the oath of  office. One of his political slogans was ``Joe Tydings doesn't duck the  tough ones.'' So true. Joe's life of service serves as an example to so  many people, including me, particularly in these difficult times.  Former Vice President Joe Biden wrote in the forward to ``My Life in  Progressive Politics: Against the Grain,'' ``In reading this memoir,  you can't miss the salient parallels to challenges facing our nation  today. The issues on which Joe staked his Senate career a half-century  ago are the same ones that still require  [[Page S6754]]  our advocacy and attention. Protecting voting rights. Safeguarding our  environment. Pushing back against the forces of inequality that are  hollowing out the middle class. Standing up for common-sense gun safety  laws.''   In the Gospel of Luke, there is the saying, ``Every one to whom much  is given, of him will much be required; and of him to whom men commit  much they will demand the more,'' Luke 12:48. Joe Tydings was given  much; he gave back more.   I know my Senate colleagues will want to join me in sending our  condolences to Joe Tydings' family: his sister, Eleanor Tydings Russell  of Monkton, MD; his four children from his first marriage, Mary Tydings  Smith of Easton, MD, Millard Tydings of Skillman, NJ, Emlen Tydings  Gaudino of Palm Beach, Australia, and Eleanor Tydings Gollob of McLean,  VA; and Alexandra Tydings Luzzatto of Washington, DC, the daughter of  his second marriage. He is also survived by nine grandchildren:  Benjamin Tydings Smith, Jill Campbell Gollob, Sam Tydings Gollob,  Margaret Campbell Tydings, Jay Davies Gollob, William Davies Tydings,  Ruby Anne Luzzatto, Emerson Almeida Luzzatto, and Maeve Chaim Luzzatto.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
