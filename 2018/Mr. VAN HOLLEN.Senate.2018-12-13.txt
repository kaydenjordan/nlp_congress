 Mr. President, the United States must fundamentally  reshape our relationship with Saudi Arabia. Whether it is the  catastrophic war in Yemen or the brutal murder of a U.S. resident,  Saudi leaders believe they can behave recklessly and criminally without  any consequences. We simply cannot continue business as usual with the  Kingdom, specifically with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.   President Trump has enabled Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman's most  egregious behavior. After our intelligence community assessed that the  Crown Prince was implicated in the murder of U.S. resident Jamal  Khashoggi, Trump responded, ``it could very well be that the Crown  Prince had knowledge of this tragic event--maybe he did and maybe he  didn't!'' Once again, the President has chosen to trust the word of a  brutal autocrat above that of his own intelligence community. Once  again, Trump has cast aside our Nation's values.   Even more tragically, the devastating and brutal war in Yemen rages  on, pitting the reckless Crown Prince against the Houthis. The Crown  Prince's actions have driven the Houthis even farther into the hands of  their Iranian backers and, inadvertently, strengthened Tehran's  position. The result is the world's worst humanitarian catastrophe.  Tens of thousands of civilians have been killed. More than 8 million  Yemenis are on the brink of starvation. The worst cholera outbreak in  modern history has afflicted over 1 million people, including over  600,000 children. Millions more are displaced from their homes. As the  years wear on, and with no end in sight, the cycle of desperation,  destruction, and death continues unabated.   Though the administration recently suspended aerial refueling for the  Saudi-led coalition, it claims that munitions sales and targeting  assistance provide leverage in the conflict; yet President Trump seems  unable and indeed unwilling to use this leverage to place meaningful  restraints on the Saudi attacks in Yemen.   So we must ask ourselves these questions: Why is the United States  complicit in this endless war? Why is the President providing cover for  the Saudi Crown Prince, at all costs? Finally, what must we do to reset  this relationship?   I believe there are two clear, near-term actions we must take to  answer these questions and reshape our relationship with Saudi Arabia.  [[Page S7579]]    We took our first step today. In an historic moment, the U.S. Senate  voted to suspend military support for the Saudi-led operations in  Yemen. The administration should heed this clear signal and end all  military support, including supplies of U.S. spare parts and technical  support. We must refocus our efforts to help broker an end to the  conflict.   Second, the United States must send a clear message to Saudi Arabia  or any other autocratic regime: We do not tolerate the slaughter of  political dissidents. We must hold accountable all those responsible  for murder of Jamal Khashoggi. That means we must impose sanctions on  the Crown Prince himself.   The Senate's vote today sends a clear message to Saudi Arabia and  President Trump: We will hold you accountable, we will not trade away  our Nation's values, and we will not abdicate our responsibility in  decisions of peace and war. S.J. Res. 54 reins in the President's  largely unencumbered war-making powers and ends unconditional U.S.  military support for the Saudi campaign in Yemen without an  authorization from Congress. For these reasons, I was proud to vote in  support of this resolution.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  tremendous service of Stephen ``Ski'' Sucharski, who joined our staff  as a Brookings Fellow this year. Ski's expertise in defense, veterans,  and homeland security issues was invaluable, helping to ensure we met  the needs of constituents throughout our great State of Maryland. Ski  came to our office with a wealth of policy knowledge from his civilian  work at the Department of Defense and his many years serving our  country in the U.S. Army. Ski's years of service enhanced our office in  many ways, perhaps most notably in veterans affairs. I am particularly  grateful to Ski for his dedication to improving services for veterans  in our State and across our Nation. Ski's generosity, willingness to  pitch in wherever needed, and sense of humor made him a great colleague  and terrific staffer in my office. We owe him a debt of gratitude, and  we will miss him greatly. My whole staff and I wish him well as he  embarks on his next journey in service to our country.                            ____________________
