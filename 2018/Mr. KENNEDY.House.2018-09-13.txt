 Mr. Speaker, Brett Kavanaugh does not belong on our  highest court in the land.   Mr. McConnell can withhold all the documents he wants. Mr.  Kavanaugh's words betray that silence. His emails show that he will  dismantle Roe v. Wade. His rulings show that protections for  preexisting conditions are no longer safe. His words show that marriage  equality and LGBTQ rights would no longer be etched in stone. His  silence shows that a President will be handed a shield against  accountability.   To those harmed by his rulings, he offers not even a handshake. When  pressed, he offers just a lawyerly dodge and a shield of  confidentiality.   But the American people marched for a woman's right to choose. They  took to our streets to end gun violence. They fought for marriage  equality.   If you believe that healthcare is a right for all and not a privilege  just for a few, then we need you to raise your voices today.   Mr. Kavanaugh should not be on our court.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bill before us, S. 3021;  and specifically, Mr. Speaker, the Fair Ratepayer Accountability,  Transparency, and Efficiency Standards Act written into title III,  culminating more than 4 years of work on this issue.   In 2014, due to an unintended loophole in the Federal Power Act, my  constituents were locked out of challenging a nearly $2 billion rate  increase, because at the time the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  was deadlocked 2 to 2 on whether to approve or deny the change.   With this bill before us today, we can close that loophole and ensure  that no ratepayer suffers the same consequence that continues to  threaten the bank accounts and pocketbooks of my constituents. It is  especially important today given that the commission currently has only  four sitting commissioners.   While this is not the bill that I first introduced more than 3 years  ago and it is not the one that the House unanimously passed each of the  last two Congresses, it is a compromise with our Senate colleagues and  is an important step in the right direction.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bill before us, H.R. S.  2031.   Specifically I rise in support of the Fair Ratepayer Accountability,  Transparency, and Efficiency Standards Act, written into Title III,  culminating more than four years of work on this issue.   As my colleagues have heard time and time again, my constituents in  New England pay among the highest retail electric rates across the  country. And in 2014, due to an unintended loophole in the Federal  Power Act, my constituents were locked out of challenging a nearly $2  billion rate increase because at the time, the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission was deadlocked two-to-two on whether to approve  or deny the change.   As written, the Federal Power Act allows for rate changes to take  effect by operation of law if FERC fails to act within the statutory  60-day time period. Due to a deadlock in 2014, no action was taken. And  as we have since learned, the Federal Power Act only allows for appeals  of official FERC Actions, not rates that take effect by operation of  law, including deadlocks like the one that left my constituents  voiceless.   With this bill before us today, we can ensure no ratepayer suffers  the same consequence. It is especially important now given the current  status of the Commission with only 4 sitting commissioners.   This bill represents a compromise with my Senate colleagues. The bill  states that any rates that take effect by operation of law, due to a  deadlock or a Commission that lacks sufficient members for a quorum,  are appealable both at FERC and in the courts. It is intended to ensure  that FERC and the courts consider the merits of a rate change and  whether such a change is just and reasonable as required by the Federal  Power Act. It would not allow FERC or the courts to simply dismiss a  challenge because FERC failed to issue an order.   Additionally, I would like to highlight two concerns with this  language and make clear congressional intent in the process. First,  this bill would not apply to rates that the Commission either chooses,  or inadvertently allows, to take effect upon expiration of the  statutory clock. It has been my understanding and my experience that  FERC can and will continue to address all rate filings with the due  diligence and scrutiny each deserves, and I hope FERC will continue to  do so even on the most contentious of cases. I expect FERC will abide  by the requirements of this legislation and not take advantage of any  loophole to avoid a contentious filing.   Second, while unusual, this bill would require each of the sitting  commissioners to explain in writing their view on the rate change. To  my knowledge, there is no other similar requirement in any part of the  Federal Power Act or Natural Gas Act. However, it is my belief that if  and when the time comes to address a deadlock, commissioners will use  the opportunity to explain their views for purposes of transparency and  good government.   While this is not the bill I first introduced more than three years  ago, the one that passed the House unanimously in each of the last two  Congresses, it is a good compromise and a significant step in the right  direction.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
