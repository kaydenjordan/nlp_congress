 Mr. Speaker, President Lincoln used the term ``four score  and 7 years ago'' at Gettysburg. If President Lincoln reappeared today,  he might say: One score and zero years ago, a new Houston hospital,  Houston Methodist, was brought forth in Sugar Land, Texas, a new  hospital, conceived in medicine, and dedicated to the proposition that  all Texans have the best care.   Seven thousand patients in 1998 became 225,000 in 2017. Over the 20- year score, Houston's Methodist Sugar Land Hospital scored numerous  awards, like the best metro area hospital from Fortune magazine.   There is a very simple reason for this amazing success, I CARE  values: I, integrity; C, compassion; A, accountability; R, respect; E,  excellence.   As CEO Chris Siebenaler said in a recent interview in the Fort Bend  Focus: ``Houston Methodist Sugar Land is committed to cultivate a safe,  spiritual, and healing environment for every single patient.''   Congratulations on 20 amazing years, 20 more to come                            ____________________
