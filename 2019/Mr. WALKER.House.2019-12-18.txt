 Madam Speaker, when emotions supersede the facts, the  conclusion is cataclysmic. Today, we are wrapping up not a 3-month  process but, rather, a 3-year process with Democrats' disdain so much  that it has led to the abuse of this very House.   These are the same Democrats who promised America they saw evidence  of Russian collusion. Do the American people trust them? Hell, no, they  don't.   A growing number of American people have condemned this impeachment  process, and that is with House Democrats setting the rules and then  even bending and breaking the rules to fit their narrative. The  majority of Americans see this circus for what it is. I wonder how many  more will join them.
