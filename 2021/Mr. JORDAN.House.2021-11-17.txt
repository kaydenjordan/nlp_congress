 Madam Speaker, as we speak, the FBI is treating parents  as terrorists. The Department of Justice is getting ready to pay people  $450,000 who illegally entered our country. And Democrats in Congress  later this week plan to spend $2 trillion more, which we all know will  only exacerbate the already 30-year-high inflation.   What are they doing today? Censuring a Member for a cartoon. You have  got to be kidding me. You have got to be kidding me.   What scares me most about all of this is the attack that we have seen  on the First Amendment over the last year from the left, from the  Democratic Party. They are attacking moms for standing up and speaking  at a school board meeting. There are still places in this country where  a full congregation cannot meet on a Sunday morning, stopping Americans  from exercising their First Amendment freedom of religion rights.   The Speaker of the House stopped Americans from petitioning their  Member of Congress to redress their grievances and wouldn't even let  them in their own Capitol.   Now, here we go again, censuring speech. The most fundamental liberty  we have is our right to speak, our right to talk, our right to  communicate, and they are going after that today because they don't  like freedom. You can see it. They don't like it.   This is wrong. We know it is wrong, what they are doing to our  colleague, Mr. Gosar. I hope they will have second thoughts and that we  will vote this down.
