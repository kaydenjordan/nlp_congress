 Madam Speaker, several days ago the Department of  Labor released statistics on job creation and inflation in the United  States. This data should be deeply alarming to every American.   This country, over the last year, has dumped trillions of dollars of  excess Federal spending into our economy. At the time economists warned  us that doing so was dangerously inflationary. Unfortunately, those  fears have come to fruition.   The statistics for the month of December show inflation at nearly 7  percent on an annualized basis. That is the highest rate of inflation  in nearly 40 years. When inflation is caused through government action,  as this round of inflation clearly is, it represents an unseen tax that  is paid by every American because it raises the prices of everything  that we buy.   Equally alarming is the fact that real wage growth has not kept up  with inflation. In fact, the Department of Labor says that for all of  last year real wage growth was negative nearly 2\1/2\ percent. If we  don't correct this trend, it is going to result in an entire generation  of Americans being driven toward poverty because their wages are not  keeping up with the prices that they pay for the goods that they need  to survive.   Madam Speaker, we need to get our fiscal house in order and correct  this runaway Federal spending before our children suffer the  consequences.
