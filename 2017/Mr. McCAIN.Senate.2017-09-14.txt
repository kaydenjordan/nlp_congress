 Mr. President, I want to thank my friend from New York. I  thank him for the cooperation we have gotten in the consideration of  this important legislation.   I would just ask the Democratic leader, is it reasonable to assume  that we could finish this up today or set a time for it on Monday?    Good. I hope we can do that.   I again thank the leader from New York, who has been very cooperative  to me and to the Senator from Rhode Island as we have moved forward  with this legislation. I thank him.                     Training Accident at Camp Pendleton    Mr. President, I wish to begin by offering my thoughts and prayers to  the marines who were injured yesterday when their amphibious assault  vehicle caught fire during a training exercise at Camp Pendleton in  California. With 15 marines hospitalized and 5 in critical condition, I  join all of my colleagues in hoping for a full and speedy recovery for  each of these brave young servicemembers.   Last night, unfortunately, the majority leader was required to file  cloture on the National Defense Authorization Act for 2018. We have  gotten a lot done in the short time this legislation has been on the  floor. I know I speak for many of my colleagues when I say that it is  my hope that we will be able to do more.   I thank my friend from Rhode Island. I thank Members who have been  very helpful and cooperative in this effort, as we have considered a  27-to-0 vote through the committee. It passed unanimously. We have  engaged in spirited, thoughtful debate, and we have ultimately adopted  277 amendments from both Republicans and Democrats.   I sound like a broken record, but this is the way the Senate should  conduct business. The authorizing committee reports out legislation  that has been examined with hearings and debate and amendments, and it  appears on the floor, and we have additional debates and amendments,  and people can vote yes or no, but they are informed.   It is a violation of our oath of office when we are told that one- fifth of the gross national product--i.e. healthcare--is going to be  decided by a ``skinny repeal'' that none of us had seen until an hour  or two before. That is not the way the Senate should do business.   We are not perfect. We are going to have to invoke cloture on this  bill. We are not going to have some debate and votes on some very  important--at least four--issues. But while we have been on this bill,  we have adopted 277 amendments. We had hours and hours of hearings. We  had a week of putting this bill  [[Page S5713]]  together on a bipartisan basis, and it was reported out by over one- quarter of the Senate, to zero. That is the way we should be doing  business.   I will freely admit that national security probably is at a higher  level of importance--and should be--than the average legislation, but  shouldn't we learn from this that if we sit down together, we argue, we  fight, we debate, and then we reach consensus, we come to the floor of  the Senate and to the American people with something that we are proud  of and that we can defend?   As I mentioned, there are still some issues that we are negotiating  on, back and forth--and we are negotiating--and hopefully we can get  those done before cloture is invoked. I hope the majority leader and  the Democratic leader will agree to a time certain for final passage.   Let me just say that I support beginning to move toward final  passage, which will provide our Armed Forces the resources they need.   By the way, again, I want to emphasize that on the Armed Services  Committee, we have had dozens of hearings on topics such as the global  threat environment, the effects of defense budget cuts, and military  readiness and modernization. Those hearings informed the work of the  committee as we moved toward the legislation.   I know that all of us from time to time like to take credit for  accomplishments that maybe we are not as responsible for as we would  advertise, but I want to say that I am not just proud of John McCain  and Jack Reed, I am proud of the 27 members of the Armed Services  Committee who--and the debate was spirited. It is not the Bobbsey  Twins. We fight in a spirited fashion. We defend what we believe in.  But once the committee is decided, then we move on.   So my colleagues have embraced the spirit of that process, and we  have submitted more than 500 amendments for consideration this week.  The Senator from Rhode Island and I negotiated a number of very good  amendments that have the support of both Republicans and Democrats. We  still have some hard issues that are remaining, and I will be talking  more about them. We are still negotiating to see if we can find  agreement on those, and I am guardedly optimistic we can get most of  that agreement done. We will know more later on this morning or early  this afternoon.    Let me also point out to my colleagues what we are talking about. We  have seen Navy ships, Army, and Marine Corps helicopters, Air Force  planes crashing during routine training and operations, and these  incidents have cost the lives of dozens of our men and women in  uniform. There are many reasons for these tragedies, but the one this  body cannot avoid responsibility for is that we are failing to provide  our military with the resources they need to perform the missions we  are asking of them. We are asking them to do too much with too little.  The result is an overworked, strained force with aging equipment--and  not enough of it.   We can point fingers and assign blame all we want, but at the end of  the day, the constitutional responsibility to raise moneys and maintain  Navies lies with us, with the Congress. That, of course, brings up  sequestration, which I will address later on.   I just want to point out, again, the men and women who wear the  uniform of our country are the best of our country, and they do  everything we ask of them with great courage. It is time for this body  to show a similar measure of courage and end the threat sequestration  poses to their mission and their lives.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the Senator from Rhode Island, my dear  friend, Jack Reed, is too kind. It takes two to tango. The partnership  we have developed over the years has made it possible for us to get to  the place we have in the past and we are today. He has not only my  gratitude but that of the men and women who are serving because of his  advocacy and his leadership.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota. She  has been an advocate on this issue for a number of years. Obviously, as  she stated with some articulation, we are talking about the fundamental  of democracy, and the threat to it has probably never been greater.   She also understands there is an issue of germaneness and committees  of responsibility and all that, but I want to tell the Senator from  Minnesota that I appreciate her advocacy. This issue is not going away.  I look forward to continuing to work with her because this is really-- it may be in some ways one of the greatest threats to democracy we have  faced, and I know she has been an advocate on this issue for a number  of years. I thank her.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, let me state the bottom line up front.  This year's NDAA, once again, focuses medical research dollars on the  needs of servicemembers and military veterans, and it increases  transparency on how these taxpayer funds are being spent.   The amendment of the Senator from Illinois would take hundreds of  millions of dollars away from defense needs to spend it on research  activities totally unrelated to the mission of the military and shield  these activities from critical oversight by the Department and the  Congress.   Let me state this up front: If these medical research dollars were  invested in the proper branch of government, I would be one of its  strongest supporters. What we are seeing here--what we see so often--is  the Willie Sutton syndrome. They asked Willie Sutton: Why do you rob  banks? He said: That is where the money is.   Why do you think medical research for autism, spinal cord injury,  prosthetics, or many others have nothing to do with defense? Let's take  it out. Let's appropriate the right amount of money to the right branch  of government. So while we are watching the defense dollars--thanks to  sequestration--going down over the last 20 years, Congress has provided  more than $11.7 billion in medical research.   According to--what is aptly named over in Defense--the  Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, 12 out of 28  current research programs do not mention the military, combat, or  servicemembers and their official mission or vision statements.   So let me repeat this for the benefit of my colleagues. Spending on  medical research at the Department of Defense, nearly 15 percent of  which has nothing to do with the military, has grown 4,000 percent  since 1992--4,000 percent. So in the meantime, the Budget Control Act  is constraining the DOD budget. It has done great harm to our military.  Every single service chief and combatant commander over the last 5  years has testified to the Armed Services Committee that the budget  caps imposed by BCA have hurt our military readiness and have made it  more difficult to respond to the Nation's growing threats. Yet, during  this time of severe defense budget restrictions, funding for the  Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs has nearly doubled.  Is that our priority?   I suggest to the Senator from Illinois: Why don't you go to the right  place in the appropriations bill and allocate research funds there? Why  don't you do that? You are not going there because it is the Willie  Sutton syndrome.   What you are doing is you are taking away from the men and women  serving  [[Page S5720]]  in the military what they need to defend this Nation.    No, I will not yield.   The fact is that we have now had a rash of fatal accidents in the  military--10 from the USS McCain and 17 more. We now have many more  accidents due to the lack of readiness, training, and maintenance than  we do in combat. So what do we do? Do we stop cutting the military? No,  we add $11.7 billion for medical research.   I am for medical research. I know of no one who opposes medical  research, but do we take it out of defense? This is the directed  spending on medical research at the Department of Defense.   You may see that in 1992 it was a small amount of money for breast  cancer research. Like other government programs, it has grown and grown  and grown. If you will take a look at the pink side here, you will see  that what also has grown is those programs that have no relevance to  the military. I want to say it one more time. No, I will say it again  and again and again. If the Senator from Illinois wants this money  spent for medical research, then, take it out of the right place. Don't  be Willie Sutton. Take it from where it belongs, instead of taking  it from the men and women in the military who are undermanned,  undertrained, underequipped, and in harm's way.    So you have a choice here, my dear friends. Yes, who could be against  medical research? Nobody who I know. But who could be in favor of  taking money from the men and women and their training, equipment, and  readiness, when every single service chief has testified before the  Armed Services Committee that we are putting the lives of men and women  serving in the military at greater risk? So we are going to see these  billions of dollars taken out of defending the Nation and the arms, the  training, and the equipment that the men and women in the military  need.   Now, if the Senator from Illinois wants to fund those that are  militarily relevant, I would be glad to go along with that, but see  what has grown and grown and grown from 1992, when it was $25 million.  Now it is billions of dollars. Let's see. Funding has increased by  4,000 percent from $25 million in 1992 to over $1 billion last year.   Spending on medical research--nearly 50 percent of which has nothing  to do with the military--has grown 4,000 percent since 1992. So let's  not say that we are shorting the men and women in the military when  that spending has increased by 4,000 percent.   Again, I would like every one of my colleagues to listen to the  leaders of our military and to the men and women who are serving. They  don't have enough training. They don't have enough equipment. They are  not ready, and it is being reflected in these kinds of accidents where  we are killing more members of the military in training than we are in  combat, and every one of the service chiefs will tell you that it is  because of lack of funding for training and readiness and maintenance.  This has to stop.   The NDAA this year prohibits the Secretary of Defense and the service  Secretaries from funding or conducting a medical research and  development project unless they certify that the project would protect,  enhance, or restore the health and safety of members of the Armed  Forces. Is that an outrageous requirement that we should spend tax  dollars that are for defense that would actually be used for defense?  Wouldn't that be outrageous?   So it requires that medical research projects are open to competition  and comply with other DOD, or Department of Defense, cost accounting  standards. So we are not only asking them to be responsible but to  comply with other Department of Defense cost accounting standards. So  why that should be unacceptable, I don't know.   So the Senator from Illinois has submitted an amendment that would  strike these requirements--it would strike these requirements--to  adhere to the Department of Defense cost accounting standards. Why? Why  would you not want to go along with cost accounting standards?   So it is certainly not an accident that the largest spike in  congressionally directed medical research funding coincides with the  tenure of the Senator from Illinois as chairman and ranking member of  the Appropriations Committee Defense Subcommittee, in which, I say, he  has done an outstanding job. Hundreds of millions of dollars in the  defense budget will be used for medical research unrelated to defense,  and it was not requested by the administration.   If this amendment passes, hundreds of millions of dollars will be  taken away from military servicemembers and their families. If this  amendment passes, hundreds of millions of dollars will not be used to  provide a full 2.1-percent pay raise for our troops. It will not be  used to build up the size of our Army and Marine Corps. It will not be  used to buy equipment so that our airmen don't have to steal spare  parts of airplanes in the boneyard to keep the oldest, smallest, and  least ready Air Force in our history in the air.   So I say to my friend and colleague from Illinois, it is not that he  is wrong to support medical research. We all support medical research.  It is that he has proposed the wrong amendment to support medical  research. Instead of proposing to take away hundreds of millions of  dollars from our military servicemembers, he should be proposing a way  to begin the long overdue process of shifting nonmilitary medical  research spending out of the Department of Defense and into the  appropriate civilian departments and agencies of our government.   I want to emphasize again that this debate is not about the value of  this medical research or whether Congress should support it. I, of all  people, know the miracle of modern medicine and am grateful for all who  support it, and I am sure every Senator understands the value of  medical research to Americans suffering from these diseases and to the  family and friends who care for them and to all those who know the pain  and grief of losing a loved one. But I will repeat again that this  research does not belong in the Department of Defense. It belongs in  civilian departments and agencies of our government.   So I say to my colleagues that the National Defense Authorization Act  focuses the Department's research efforts on medical research that will  lead to lifesaving advancements in battlefield medicine and new  therapies for recovery and rehabilitation of servicemembers wounded on  the battlefield. This amendment would harm our national security. The  amendment of the Senator from Illinois would harm our national security  by reducing the funding available for militarily relevant medical  research that helps protect servicemen and servicewomen on the  battlefield and for military capabilities they desperately need to  perform their missions. It would continue to put decision-making about  medical research in the hands of lobbyists and politicians, instead of  medical experts where it belongs.   I would like to repeat for at least the fifth time that I strongly  support funding for medical research. I do not support funding for  medical research that has nothing to do with the Department of Defense.  The dollars are too scarce. You can see the way that it has gone up and  up and up. So what we are trying to do is to preserve medical research  where it applies to the Department of Defense and not use it for every  other program, which should be funded by other agencies of government.  I am very aware of the power and influence of the lobbyists who lobby  for this kind of money, knowing full well that this is the easiest  place to get the money.   I just hope that some of us would understand that 10 sailors just  died onboard the USS John S. McCain. They died because that ship was  not ready, not trained, not equipped, and not capable of doing its job  because they didn't have enough funding. Let's get our priorities  straight.   I yield the floor.    I object.   Go ahead.    Madam President, I thank the majority leader for all the  support and assistance we have been given on this issue. Of course, I  regret that we finally had to turn to cloture. The fact is that we have  incorporated over 100 amendments offered by Senators of both parties,  and it means the NDAA becomes stronger as a result of including these  amendments. Second, the process took a step in the right direction, as  Senators were able to have their voices and opinions heard and  reflected in this legislation.   I wish we had never had to come to voting for cloture, but I wish to  say that we have made enormous progress. We have had debate. We have  had amendments. We have had votes. All of these are the ``regular  order'' that some of us have been arguing for that the U.S. Senate--in  accordance with the Constitution of the United States.   I am very appreciative of the cooperation of Members on both sides,  including Senator Reed. I believe we can be proud of our product. It  came down to about four amendments on which we could never get  agreement to move forward--that compared to the over 100 amendments we  were able to adopt.   I still wish we had been able to go completely through this process  without having to resort to cloture, but I do want to thank Members on  both sides--as we approach cloture--for their cooperation, for their  involvement, for their engagement, and for their dedication to the men  and women who are serving us in the military.   We look forward to the next hours. We will have debate and hopefully  some amendments proposed, vote cloture, and have it completed sometime  early next week. The work that needs to be done will be done,  accomplished before then.   I thank all my colleagues for their participation. I thank them for  their engagement and involvement. I am proud of this product, which  comes after hundreds of hours of hearings, of negotiation, of  discussion, and of debate, because it proves that the first priority of  Members on both sides of the aisle is the men and women in the military  and their ability to defend the Nation.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, there be 10 minutes of debate, equally  divided in the usual form, and that following the use or yielding back  of that time, the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the  substitute amendment No. 1003, as modified.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin. I  thank her for her agreement that we should move forward with this  important legislation, and I am very proud of the way this legislation  has proceeded before the Senate most of the way. But now I am not very  proud because we are now not allowing Senators to have a vote.   I do not agree with the amendment from the Senator from Wisconsin,  but I strongly believe she should have the right to have her amendment  considered, debated, and voted on.   I am very proud of the fact that we have approved and agreed to 103  amendments. We still have three or four amendments that have caused us  to be where we are today. It will be a conference item, the amendment  of the Senator from Wisconsin, and although I do not agree with it, I  will certainly make sure that it is part of the conference.   But I want to remind my colleagues again that one of the reasons we  had 107 votes for and 0 against is that we went through a process of  days, weeks, and months of hearings, study, debate, discussion, and  bringing it to the floor. That is the way the Senate should work.   I thank the Senator from Wisconsin, and I want to tell her and the  Senator from New York, Mrs. Gillibrand, that I will continue to do  everything I can to make sure they are given the rights that they  earned by being elected in the States they represent.    Mr. President, I have no further use of the time.
