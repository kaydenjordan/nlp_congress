 Mr. Speaker, in 2010, Tea Party Republicans were swept into  office on a passionate plea to eliminate the deficit, to reduce the  national debt, and to not pass on a great fiscal burden to our  children.   Upon election, they boldly formed the Freedom Caucus, the fiscal  watchdogs of the House. At the time, the national debt, in 2010, was  $13 trillion, and many were deeply concerned about our Nation's fiscal  situation, and they made a promise to do everything in their power to  rein in wasteful spending and to get government's fiscal House in  order.   Now here we are in 2017, after nearly 7 years of a Republican- controlled Congress, and the debt is over $20 trillion. That is 7 years  of a Republican-controlled Congress and $7 trillion in additional debt.   Now we have a tax giveaway of an additional $2.5 trillion to pass on  to our children. I ask all the so-called fiscal conservatives in this  Chamber, all the so-called Freedom Caucus members, where is your big  talk about the debt now? Is your desire to claim a victory worth  betraying your deepest principles forever?                            ____________________
