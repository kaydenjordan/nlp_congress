 Madam Speaker, I thank my very good friend, the  distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts, Chairman McGovern, for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Today's rule covers three items. The first item is a bill to ban  imports of Russian oil into the United States and to impose additional  sanctions following Russia's unprovoked and unjust invasion of Ukraine.   Madam Speaker, although I will be supporting this bill, I cannot help  but feel that this is a half measure and a missed opportunity to  exhibit unified support on immediate steps to confront Putin's evil  regime.   Yesterday, Senators Wyden and Crapo introduced a much stronger bill,  one that was negotiated over the weekend by Republicans and Democrats  in both the House and the Senate. But rather than taking yes for an  answer, the majority instead put forward a weaker bill, one that is  watered down and leaves loopholes wide enough to drive a tanker  through.   Banning Russian oil imports in the wake of Vladimir Putin's invasion  of Ukraine should be an obvious no-brainer, just like it ought to be a  no-brainer for the President to reverse his misguided policies and  unleash development of America's own energy sources. But instead of  doing so, the Biden administration continues to discourage domestic oil  and gas production and is asking every other oil producer in the world  to make up the difference.   Instead of encouraging our own domestic sources of energy, which  could meet our needs, critically supply our allies, and strengthen  American energy independence, President Biden instead is taking steps  like unilaterally canceling the Keystone XL pipeline, imposing a ban on  new oil and gas exploration and leasing on Federal lands, and telling  hardworking Americans who are struggling to buy expensive gasoline to  instead go buy more expensive electric vehicles.   Failing to develop America's energy resources is a missed  opportunity, Madam Speaker, just like this bill. We had a better  option. I wish we had taken it.   Our second item today is an omnibus appropriations package covering  the remainder of the year 2022, and the third is a short-term  continuing resolution to ensure continuity of government funding while  Congress processes a larger bill.   Madam Speaker, it has been a very, very long road to get to this  point. But  [[Page H1383]]  today, the House will act on a bipartisan, bicameral appropriations  package. As vice ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, I am  encouraged that we are finally nearing completion of this fundamental  function of Congress to provide full-year funding for the government.   We are here today in a time of great crisis. Two weeks ago, Russian  President Vladimir Putin launched an unprovoked and unjust war against  Ukraine, its democratic neighbor to the west. Inflation has skyrocketed  to a 40-year high, and due to the administration's reckless action, gas  prices have continued to soar month after month after month.                                time  0930    Yet despite these crises, the Members of this body have worked  together and have found common ground on today's legislation.   As I have said many times, one of the most consequential duties of a  Member of Congress is to fund the government and keep it open and  operating. At a time of crisis, this is more important than ever.   Last year, the Appropriations Committee passed all 12 appropriations  bills out of committee and succeeded in passing nine of those bills  across the floor before the August recess. Unfortunately, these bills  were partisan and did not receive support from any Republican Members,  with good reason.   Today, we are 5 months into fiscal year 2022, and despite the long  process, the path forward has always been clear. It was clear last  July, just as it is clear today.   In order to reach a final bipartisan, bicameral deal on  appropriations for FY 2022, four conditions needed to be met. I am  greatly pleased that this bill meets all four.   The first is to ensure that the longstanding, bipartisan pro-life  provisions historically included in the appropriations bills are  restored. These include the Hyde amendment, which prevents Federal  dollars from being used to pay for abortions, except in limited cases  of rape, incest, and the life of the mother, and the Weldon amendment,  which protects American doctors, nurses, and other healthcare  professionals from participating in and providing abortions if they  have a moral objection.   The inclusion of these and other broadly popular provisions was and  is an absolute necessity for this bill to have any chance of becoming  law. I am personally deeply grateful that they are included in this  package.   Second, partisan policy riders that were included in the bills that  passed the House last summer needed to come out. These are provisions  that both sides did not agree to and do not enjoy bipartisan consensus.  At the end of the day, we needed to reach an agreement on these items  to move forward. Fortunately, each of these provisions has been  removed.   Third, the level of defense spending absolutely needed to come up.  Unfortunately, last year, President Biden proposed a budget that  underfunded national defense, repeating the mistake of the Obama-Biden  administration of chronically underfunding our national defense. But  earlier this year, the House Armed Services Committee and the Senate  Armed Services Committee, both controlled by Democrats, worked together  in a bipartisan manner to authorize an increase in defense spending of  $25 billion over the fiscal year.   In today's bill, appropriators actually went beyond that, ensuring a  robust increase in defense spending. This increase is necessary to  ensure that our Armed Forces will have the funds needed to maintain our  readiness and to procure the weapons and assets the warfighters of  tomorrow will need to continue to succeed on the battlefield.   This includes increases for defense assets based in my own home State  of Oklahoma. If the present crisis in Ukraine shows us nothing else, it  should show us the need to continue to adequately fund our national  defense.   Finally, the fourth condition that needed to be met was that the  proposed levels of nondefense spending had to come down. In the initial  set of bills that passed the House, my friends in the majority sought  to include a 17 percent increase in nondefense spending. While that no  doubt included many worthy items, Republicans generally felt that 17  percent was excessive, particularly given the substantial needs on the  defense side of the ledger.   But the bill before us today increases nondefense spending by just  6.7 percent, which will allow for increased investments in key areas  while also ensuring that we will continue to be responsible stewards of  taxpayer dollars.   Of course, this 6.7 percent ensures that there will be significant  and important investments in nondefense areas across the government. I  am particularly pleased that the National Institutes of Health will  receive a robust $2.25 billion increase, which will help advance  medical science, help address future pandemics, and continue our  progress toward defeating the scourge of cancer.   We are also funding ARPA-H, one of the President's highest  priorities, at $1 billion in its first year of operation. I am also  encouraged that this bill provides significant increases for TRIO and  GEAR UP, two programs that are close to my heart, that help first- generation students go to college. These are just a few of the programs  that I could point to that are worthy of increased funding and  investment, and this bill has done that.   The legislation before us today represents a negotiated compromise  between the House and the Senate and obviously between Democrats and  Republicans. Given that, it is a compromise. That means neither side  got everything that they wanted. As I have often said, in a compromise,  you have to give up more than you would like to get less than you want.  Indeed, this is not the bill I would have written had I written it  alone. But at the end of the day, it represents a good balance for  Congress and for the Nation.   Before I finish, I want to congratulate my friends and colleagues on  the Appropriations Committee, particularly Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro and  Ranking Member Kay Granger, without whom we would not have gotten to  where we are today.   I also want to extend my huge thank you, as the chairman did, to the  Appropriations Committee staff and to the Rules staff on both sides of  the aisle. These staffers are truly unsung heroes who spent many long  and sleepless nights over the preceding weeks, including this past  weekend. We would not be here today without them.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  just quickly respond to my friend's comment about the energy industry.   I am from an energy district. I am from an energy State. My  constituents and their forebearers have produced more energy than they  have consumed for over a hundred years, and they have shared it all  over the world, but particularly across this country.   Thank God for them because, quite frankly, what Americans would be  paying at the pump now would be astronomical were it not for them.  Since 2005, American oil production has doubled, and that is due to  their ingenuity. Frankly, we pay almost the lowest energy prices in the  world.   I am sorry, but to put all of these energy price increases off on  Vladimir Putin--he is certainly responsible for those this week, but  the reality is, for the entire Biden Presidency, energy prices have  been going up. That is because the President, on his very first day,  effectively declared war on the fossil fuel industry. He canceled the  Keystone Pipeline. He changed the leasing and drilling rules on Federal  lands. The hostility has simply been overwhelming.   Now, where does that put us? The United States is going to Iran to  ask them to increase energy production, the largest sponsor of state  tyranny.  [[Page H1385]]    We are sending representatives to Venezuela. Why don't we just call  people in Houston and Oklahoma City and Cheyenne? We have got lots of  places that know how to produce energy and have been doing it cheaply,  efficiently, fairly, and cleanly for decades.   The reality is, let's not attack them. They are our salvation in a  time of trial, and they are our national security moving forward. I  feel very strongly about that.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess), my good friend and distinguished member of the Rules  Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee.                                time  0945     Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an  additional 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  will refrain from correcting my friend again and just send him  something to read.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule to bring up H.R. 6858, the American Energy Independence from  Russia Act for immediate consideration.   Two weeks ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin shocked the world by  launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In doing so, Mr. Putin  revealed his true self, and that is a bully, a thug, a tyrant bent on  subverting his democratic neighbor to the west. In challenging not only  Ukraine, but also the rest of the civilized world, Mr. Putin's powerful  weapon is not his army, potent though that may be, but the dependence  of much of the rest of the world on Russian oil and gas. Already he has  begun to put the squeeze on democratic states seeking to challenge his  invasion of Ukraine by threatening to cut off their supplies of energy.    The American Energy Independence from Russia Act would address the  challenge and would reposition the United States to be energy self- sufficient. It would immediately approve the Keystone XL pipeline,  would restart oil and gas leasing on Federal lands and waters, and  would expand liquid natural gas exports at the moment Europe needs the  most. In doing so, it would ensure that America remains energy  independent and can act to address Russian aggression without risking  economic damage.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record along with extraneous material immediately  prior to the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Crenshaw), my good friend and a distinguished member of the  Energy and Commerce Committee, to further explain our amendment.    Madam Speaker, to further discuss the need for America to  be energy independent, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber), a member of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee and my good friend.    I yield the gentleman from Minnesota an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Just to remind my friend, it was the last administration that  actually began lethal aid to Ukraine. The Obama administration did not.  The record there is pretty clear as to who has helped the Ukrainians.   Madam Speaker, to further discuss the need to get America out from  under the thumb of Russia, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Pfluger), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and my  good friend.    Madam Speaker, for further explanation of our energy  independence bill, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Oklahoma  (Mrs. Bice), my very good friend and fellow Oklahoman.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, the  distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts, Chairman McGovern, for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, our second rule of the day now covers four items. As  we discussed earlier, the first item is a bill to ban imports of  Russian oil into the United States and to impose additional sanctions  following Russia's unprovoked and unjust invasion of Ukraine.   Although I will be supporting this bill, it is a missed opportunity  to exhibit unified support for the immediate steps to confront Vladimir  Putin's evil empire. A much stronger bill has been introduced in the  Senate that was negotiated over the weekend by Republicans and  Democrats in the House and Senate. Why the majority would forgo taking  yes for an answer and instead introduce a much weaker, watered-down  bill is beyond me.   Our second bill is an omnibus appropriations bill covering the  remainder of fiscal year 2022. Our third bill is a short-term  continuing resolution to ensure the continuity of government funding  while Congress finishes the larger bill. And our fourth bill is a $15  billion standalone COVID supplemental.   The omnibus appropriations bill was a long time in coming. Indeed, we  are over 5 months into fiscal year 2022, and it is more than a little  frustrating that it has taken us this long to get here. But we are here  now, and the bill before us represents a realistic compromise between  the House and the Senate and between Democrats and Republicans.   The omnibus bill is far, far better than the partisan bills the House  passed last summer. This bill preserves the historic legacy of  bipartisan pro-life riders like the Hyde amendment and the Weldon  amendment, both of which absolutely had to be in this package in order  to become law. It omits new partisan policy riders on which there is no  consensus. It increases defense spending by more than $25 billion over  last year, which is clearly necessary in the wake of Vladimir Putin's  unprovoked aggression against Ukraine. And it provides for an  appropriate, measured increase in nondefense spending, which will allow  for continued investments in programs like the National Institutes of  Health, ARPA-H, TRIO, and GEAR UP. The limited increase in nondefense  spending allows us to make responsible investments in key programs  while being good stewards of taxpayer dollars.   While it spends more than I would have preferred, it is still a very  reasonable compromise.   Before I conclude, Madam Speaker, I want to, once again, congratulate  Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro and Ranking Member Kay Granger of the  Appropriations Committee on today's bill and thank them for their hard  work.   On the new addition, the $15 billion COVID supplemental, I think  there are serious concerns with this additional unpaid-for increase.  According to the CBO, there is currently more than $340 billion in  unobligated funds available for repurposing and appropriation. Indeed,  instead of providing new resources like this bill does, we should  rescind or repurpose existing COVID resources for these purposes, as  the bill we considered earlier today would have done.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have more remarks.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 6858, the American Energy  Independence from Russia Act, for immediate consideration.   Over the past few weeks, we have seen the clear consequences of  President Biden's war on the oil and gas industry. Emboldened by  Russia's role as the key source of energy for much of Europe, Vladimir  Putin launched an unprovoked invasion of his neighbor, Ukraine. Gas  prices are soaring, with the pressures of unchecked inflation and  Putin's threats to cut off oil and gas exports pushing them ever  higher.  [[Page H1392]]  Indeed, Mr. Putin has begun to deploy his most potent weapon, which is  to threaten to cut off Europe's energy supply right in the dead of  winter.   Madam Speaker, this was all avoidable. The United States has the  capacity to be energy independent if only we choose to be. We can stand  on our own two feet, confident in the knowledge that we can meet all of  our domestic energy needs right here at home, and we can provide  assistance to our allies to ensure their protection against Russian  threats.   Unfortunately, President Biden's actions since taking office have  made this impossible. On day one of his Presidency, he terminated the  Keystone XL pipeline, and he subsequently froze oil and gas leasing on  Federal lands. In lieu of the U.S. producing oil and gas that we need,  he is instead asking every other oil producing country but the United  States to step up. Many of these are hardly friends of our country or,  frankly, humanity. It is simply astonishing.   The American Energy Independence from Russia Act would address this  challenge and ensure American energy self-sufficiency. It would  immediately approve the Keystone XL pipeline; it would restart oil and  gas leasing on Federal lands and waters; and it would expand liquid  natural gas exports at the moment Europe needs them most. It would free  the United States and our allies to act in opposition to Vladimir  Putin's brutal and barbarous assault on his neighbor without fear.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' on the previous question and  a ``no'' on the rule, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I advise my friend I am prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, before I go to my formal remarks, my friend and I will  have a discussion about energy.   I am a big believer in renewables. My own State gets 42 percent of  its electricity from wind power, and we are number two in the country.  I would put our record up against anybody.   We really do believe in ``all of the above.'' But we are very proud  of having produced energy for over 100 years for this country in  abundance, far beyond our needs, and exported at reasonable prices.   I would also remind my friend, whatever the prices are--and I wish  they were lower--they are cheaper here than just about anyplace else in  the world, and we can thank, literally, the thousands of people I am  privileged to represent.   Many of us represent over 10 million of the men and women who  actually produce the energy this country needs and, frankly, the rest  of the world needs right now. I don't think they ought to be demeaned.  I don't think their motives ought to be questioned. They are an  extraordinary group of people, and they are patriotic and step forward  whenever we need them. When times are bad, nobody seems to care what  happens to them. When times get tougher, everybody wants them to step  forward, invest more, and do more, and they do. They will continue to  do that in this time of crisis. So, I don't think we need to be divided  on this.   There is no question we need more oil and gas now; Europe needs more  oil and gas now; and we have been taught a serious lesson about the  dangers of becoming reliant on people like Mr. Putin when they have the  ability to impact world prices.   Madam Speaker, in closing, although I oppose the rule, I am greatly  encouraged by the underlying appropriations measure. While it is not  perfect--no bill ever is--and could always be better, it does represent  a good compromise between Democrats and Republicans that will ensure  full-year funding for fiscal year 2022.   The bill before us continues Congress' policy of increasing our  investments in defense spending, which is of critical importance at  this time of global crisis. It provides for needed investments in  health, including increasing funding for combating future pandemics and  research into diseases like cancer. It funds education, infrastructure,  energy production, roads, and care for our Nation's veterans.                                time  1815    It includes also--and I want to thank my friend for doing this--his  proposal for a much-needed White House conference on hunger, and it is  an area we work together on. I am proud to acknowledge his leadership  in that.   It is, in sum, a bill Congress can collectively be proud of, and it  is a bill that does the right thing for the American people.   On the Russia oil ban, I am disappointed. The Democrats walked away  from a strong bipartisan, bicameral deal that could have united us as a  Congress and led to swift passage in the Senate. As it currently  stands, it is unclear what fate awaits this legislation in the Senate.  I am hopeful that my friends on the other side will reflect on this  missed opportunity and work with Republicans to not only stand up  against Russian aggression abroad but also for homegrown American  energy resources that are critical to achieving our goals and checking  Vladimir Putin.   On the new $15 billion unpaid-for COVID supplemental, the data is  clear that there are already adequate resources available. These could  be fully utilized before additional funds are provided.   Madam Speaker, while I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the  previous question and ``no'' on the rule, I encourage all Members to  support the bipartisan and bicameral omnibus appropriations bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
