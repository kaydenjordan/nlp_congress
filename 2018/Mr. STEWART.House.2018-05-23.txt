 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colonel James  Brown, a friend of mine, who has faithfully served the Tooele Army  Depot and the United States Army. It is my honor to recognize the years  of service Colonel Brown has given to our Nation prior to the upcoming  change of command. Colonel Brown has been instrumental in expanding  Tooele Army Depot's mission of readiness, as well as ensuring a safe  and secure worksite for its employees.   I offer my sincere thanks to all those who served at the Tooele Army  Depot, as well as those who have had the privilege to serve with  Colonel Brown. I understand the sacrifices of our military men and  women on behalf of our Nation. I am humbled by the work these men and  women do every day to protect our freedom and our Nation's freedom as  well. And we have to remember their families because their families-- their spouses and children--also sacrifice.   Defending honor, duty, and country is the greatest service one can  achieve in the United States military. Colonel Brown's courage and  dedication is enduring, and his work will continue to support  generations to come.                            ____________________
