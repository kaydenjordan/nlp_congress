 Madam Speaker, I rise today to share with you some of  the important projects we have nominated as part of the community  project funding process, 10 projects that will bring more than $8.4  million in critical funding to my district and which have now been  included in the House Appropriations Committee's fiscal year 2022  funding bill.   It is my honor to represent the residents of PA-05 in Congress, and I  am thrilled to have secured funding for these projects that were  submitted by nonprofit and government agencies in our region and that  met the rigorous funding criteria laid out by Congress.   The projects our office nominated for inclusion address some of the  most pressing needs in our region: economic development, climate  resilience, treatment for opioid use disorder, and expanding mental  health resources.   Each of these projects will also help deliver on House Democrats' and  President Biden's promise to build back better, to set the table for  success for the American people, now and in the future.   Today, I would like to shine the spotlight on two projects I am  particularly proud of.   The Delaware County Mobile Crisis teams project will provide an  alternative response for emergency calls involving people suffering  from mental illness. For too long, our mental health system has been  woefully underfunded. As a result, all too frequently, people living  with mental illness or cognitive disabilities have ended up in our  criminal justice system, often with fatal consequences. We can do  better.   Around the country, communities have begun to address this dearth of  mental health resources and overreliance on the criminal justice system  by developing programs to provide alternatives to and diversion from  arrest, abuse, and incarceration.   At the Federal level, I am proud to have introduced the Mental Health  Justice Act, which would make it easier for State and local governments  to develop these programs and send trained mental health professionals  instead of police when someone calls 911 because an individual is  experiencing a mental health crisis.   At the local level, I am proud to support Delaware County's  application to fund just such a project in this year's appropriations  bill, a project to address the mental and behavioral health challenges  of residents who might otherwise find themselves in the criminal  justice system.                                time  1045    The county proposal will create mobile crisis teams stationed with  the county's Emergency Services Department. These teams will be  dispatched in conjunction with law enforcement in response to requests  for help for persons known or suspected to be suffering from mental  illness with the goal of diverting them from the criminal justice  system into treatment with access to prioritized admission and to  properly address their underlying needs.   This program is a collaboration among Delaware County's human  services, health adviser, district attorney, and public defender. I  commend these county leaders for looking forward, and I look forward to  seeing the positive impact mobile crisis teams can have on our  community.   Another project that I was proud to secure funding for in the fiscal  year `22 appropriations bill is for the restoration and reopening of  the historic Lansdowne Theater.   The 1927 Lansdowne Theater is an Art Deco gem that will be  rehabilitated into a regional concert hall and spur investment in the  surrounding community. The $1.5 million in Federal funding we have  secured in the appropriations bill will be the final dollars for this  $15 million project so that it can immediately start the restoration  needed to bring this community treasure back to life.   We anticipate the project will create 51 jobs to operate the theater  and 100 permanent jobs in businesses nearby, in addition to over 100  jobs for the trades during construction. Once completed, the theater  will breathe new economic life into the community and attract more arts  and culture to PA-5.   It will create opportunities for enhanced educational programs for  area students through internships and access to different genres of  music.   This transformational investment is integral to a broader plan to  create an anchor in the community to restore, enhance, and spur  economic activity in this part of the Baltimore Pike commercial  district.   The community project funding program is a win for the American  people. It gives our communities the opportunity to make their case  directly to Congress for funding to make bold, progressive investments  that are exactly what our community and communities across the country  need to recover and rebuild.   This is what keeping a promise looks like. I look forward to  continuing to fight for the people with these new investments.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule under  consideration today.   Well before coming to Congress, I provided legal services for Iraqis  and Afghans who had put their lives at risk as drivers, translators,  and contractors to help our military abroad. They needed help to obtain  the Special Immigrant Visas they were promised in return.   From that experience, I know firsthand that the process is rigorous  and time-consuming. Even before the pandemic, it could take years for  these critical allies to receive the special visas they were promised.  During that time, they and their families faced continual threats of  injury and death. Many died, had to go into hiding, or had their  relatives killed because they had assisted U.S. forces.   As the U.S. leaves Afghanistan after almost two decades of unending  war, we need to streamline the SIV process so that we can make good on  America's promise to our Afghan allies who risked their lives to  protect our troops.   The ALLIES Act would ensure that the U.S. keeps its promise to  protect those allies who worked with U.S. troops in Afghanistan. We  must pass this bill quickly so that no one is left behind.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to state my support for the other two bills  in today's rule.   My region knows just how pervasive and dangerous the PFAS chemicals  are. Pennsylvania has multiple PFAS-contaminated sites, and my district  is downstream from a couple of them.   Uncontaminated drinking water should not be a debatable topic. For  the health and safety our families, friends, and neighborhoods, we need  to properly regulate and remediate PFAS chemicals, and this bill would  do just that.   Finally, we need to pass the Consumer Protection and Recovery Act to  restore the ability of the FTC to protect consumers by forcing bad  actors to return funds to consumers who have been defrauded, in the  wake of a Supreme Court decision that took away that power from the  FTC.   It is estimated that Pennsylvania seniors lose about $1.2 billion a  year to scammers. Forcing reimbursements has been a key tool in the FTC  toolbox for almost 40 years, and it is probably the most important tool  for the individual consumer. This bill will make clear Congress' intent  to restore that power to the FTC.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this rule and its underlying  legislation, and I call on all my colleagues to do the same.
