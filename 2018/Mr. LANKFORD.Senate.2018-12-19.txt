 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask the Chair lay before the Senate  the House message to accompany S. 943.   The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message  from the House of Representatives:         Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 943) entitled       ``An Act to direct the Secretary of the Interior to conduct       an accurate comprehensive student count for the purposes of       calculating formula allocations for programs under the       Johnson-O'Malley Act, and for other purposes.'', do pass with       an amendment.                               Motion to Concur     I move to concur in the House amendment.    I know of no further debate.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, the Federal Government awards more than  $600 billion in grant awards--$600 billion. We actually do more in  grant awards than we do in contracting. Our current system is riddled  with outdated reporting mechanisms that burden grant recipients and  inhibit oversight from Agencies in Congress.   The bill, H.R. 4887, which is called the GREAT Act--Grant Reporting  Efficiency and Agreements Transparency Act--tries to put some sense  into this process. This is a process that has worked with all of the  grant requesting Agencies. Whether they be universities, whether they  be entities for research, they have all gone through this for the past  couple of years, actually. They have given a tremendous amount of input  because they struggle in actually requesting the grants and in getting  through all of the chaos of those grants.   The OMB and other entities are not getting the data information to  the American people, so there is no transparency in that process. For  the past couple of years, we have worked very hard to establish a good  process of getting transparency and also of helping the grant- requesting entities get a more efficient process.   The GREAT Act would require, within 1 year, OMB and the leading grant  Agency to establish a governmentwide data standard for information  related to Federal awards. Within 2 years, guidance must be issued for  grant-making Agencies on how to apply those standards and implement  them into the existing reporting practices. Within 3 years, Agencies  must ensure that all grants and cooperative agreements use the new data  standard for future information requests. This is exceptionally  important to get through the process so that we are not squandering  $600 billion in grants.   Let me tell you what this process has gone through.   In February, H.R. 4887 passed unanimously out of the House Oversight  and Government Reform Committee. Then it went to the House Calendar,  and it passed unanimously on September 26. Every Democrat and every  Republican in the House voted for this. Subsequently, Senator Enzi and  I passed our amended Senate companion to H.R. 4887. It passed  unanimously out of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Committee in September.   The bill being considered today is reflective of bipartisan support  from both the House and the Senate. This bill, H.R. 4887, cleared the  Republican hotline weeks ago. Every single Republican has already  cleared this. They want the transparency in the grant process and want  a better grant process for all of the grant requesters. It is not yet  clear on the Democratic side.   My simple request doesn't just come from me. This request comes from  the Grant Professionals Association, the National Grants Management  Association, the Association of Government Accountants, the American  Library Association, the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources  Coalition. Leading universities around the country have just asked to  improve this grant-making process. Every single Democrat in the House  has affirmed this, and every Republican in the House and every  Republican in the Senate has already cleared it. We are just asking for  this bill to move forward and to be passed.   I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs be discharged from further consideration of H.R.  4887 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration. I further  ask that the Johnson substitute amendment at the desk be considered and  agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time  and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I am a little confused when every grant- making and requesting organizations--all of the universities around the  country--are requesting this. Every single Democrat in the House has  already affirmed this. There does not seem to be a great fear of Mick  Mulvaney at the OMB since, by the time this will be implemented, it  will be 2022. So it is a little bit confusing to me why getting more  transparency in grants and helping grant requesting organizations would  be controversial.   I yield the floor.
