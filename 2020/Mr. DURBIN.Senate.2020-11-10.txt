 I announce that the Senator from Washington (Ms.  Cantwell), the Senator from California  [[Page S6630]]  (Ms. Harris), the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Heinrich), the Senator  from Washington (Mrs. Murray), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz),  the Senator from Arizona (Ms. Sinema), and the Senator from Montana  (Mr. Tester) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, more, perhaps, than any event in our  lifetimes, the COVID-19 pandemic has focused our minds on the life-and- death value of scientific research and discovery.   As the entire world waits anxiously for safe, effective, affordable  vaccines and medical treatments that can protect us against this deadly  virus, the recent announcements of the 2020 Nobel Prizes in science  gives us reasons for hope.   While the new Nobel science laureates are not themselves involved in  COVID-19 research, collectively, they have found answers to some of the  most fundamental questions in science, they have made medical  discoveries that have already saved millions of lives worldwide and may  one day soon enable us to cure cancer and other deadly diseases.   There is another reason to be hopeful about the 2020 Nobel science  laureates. For only the second time in history, women scientists  received two of the three Nobel science prizes, for physics and for  chemistry. And for the first time ever, two women won a Nobel science  award for research they pioneered on their own, without the help of  male colleagues. Their achievements underscore why we need to continue  clearing hurdles for women and girls as they navigate careers in  science, technology, engineering, and math. We can't afford to ignore  the scientific potential of half of our society. We need all hands on  deck.   Let me tell you about these new Nobel science laureates.   The 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry goes to Jennifer Doudna and  Emmanuelle Charpentier for their work on CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary  advancement in biomedical science that enables scientists to edit and  change DNA with high precision.   Jennifer Doudna is an American biochemist at the University of  California, Berkeley, and Emmanuelle Charpentier is a French  microchemist and director of the Max Planck Institute for Infection  Biology in Berlin. They are the sixth and seventh women in history to  receive the chemistry prize and the first all-women team to receive a  Nobel in any science.   In less than a decade since the pair wrote a paper demonstrating the  power of CRISPR-Cas9, the technique has  [[Page S6640]]  transformed how basic science is done. Scientists are using CRISPR to  ask fundamental questions about life, such as which genes are essential  to a cell's survival. Doctors are testing it as a cure for genetic  conditions such as sickle cell disease and hereditary blindness, and  plant scientists are using it to create new crops.   People in my home State of Illinois are especially proud of Andrea  Ghez, a 2020 Nobel physics laureate who grew up in Chicago and was  encouraged to pursue a career in science by a gifted teacher at the  University of Chicago Laboratory School.   Dr. Ghez, director of the UCLA Galactic Center Group, received the  Nobel for her pioneering research on the supermassive black hole at the  center of our galaxy. She describes her research as ``extreme  astrophysics.'' Her discoveries have enabled scientists to explore  black holes and their fundamental role in the evolution of the  universe.   Dr. Ghez and her team conduct their research at the W.M. Keck  Observatory in Hawaii. She is only the fourth woman to receive the  physics prize. She shares half of the prize with Reinhard Genzel of UC  Berkeley and the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in  Berlin. The other half of the prize was awarded to Roger Penrose of the  University of Oxford.   Dr. Ghez has earned numerous honors for her research, including  election to the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy  of Arts and Sciences. In 2019, she was awarded an honorary degree by  Oxford University.   When she was a girl, she wanted to be the first woman to walk on the  moon. She attributes her love of science partly to a woman who taught  her nearly 40 years ago at the University of Chicago Laboratory School.  Judith Keane was the only woman in the Lab School's physical sciences  department. Dr. Ghez has said how important it was for her to see a  woman in that role.   For much of history, women's involvement in science has been  discouraged and their achievements have been ignored. Nevertheless,  they have persisted. A few examples:   In 1903, Marie Curie became the first woman to win the Nobel Prize  for Physics, for her discovery of radioactivity. She won the Nobel  Prize in Chemistry 8 years later for her work in isolating pure radium.  She remains the only woman in history to ever win the Nobel twice and  the only human to ever win a Nobel Prize in two different sciences.   Rachel Carson was a marine biologist and environmentalist whose  groundbreaking book, ``Silent Spring,'' helped launch the modern  environmental movement.   Rosalind Franklin, a British chemist and molecular biologist, was one  of the key figures behind unlocking the structure of human DNA,  although her contributions went largely unrecognized.   Barbara McClintock was an American geneticist and the only woman ever  to have been awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine by herself. In 1993  she won the the Nobel Prize for her discovery of the ``jumping gene''  or the ability of genes to change position on the chromosome.   Ruth Rogan Benerito was a chemist and pioneer in bioproducts who  spent most of her career at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. She is  credited with saving the cotton industry in post-WWII America through  her discovery of a process to produce wrinkle-free, stain-free, and  flame-resistant cotton fabrics.   Navy Rear Admiral Grace Hopper first developed computer languages and  a compiler to translate them into machine code. She developed computer  languages written in English, rather than mathematical notation,  including COBOL, which is still in use today.   Katherine Johnson was an African-American mathematician and NASA  space scientist who made enormous contributions to America's space  programs by her incorporation of computing tools. She calculated key  trajectories for America's first manned space flight and for the 1969  Apollo 11 flight to the moon.   Mae Jemison is a physician, chemist, biologist, and a former NASA  astronaut. As a girl growing up on the South Side of Chicago, she was  inspired to become an astronaut after watching Star Trek's Lt. Uhuru,  the only Black woman aboard the Starship Enterprise. In 1992, she  became the first Black woman to travel into space.   Despite the achievements of these and other women, the tradition in  science of excluding women and other underrepresented groups at  prestigious scientific meetings and conferences is so pervasive that  some scientists sometimes refer wryly to such panels as ``manels.''   Dr. Francis Collins is director of the National Institutes of Health  and a brilliant scientist. In June 2019, he announced that he would no  longer speak at any science conference where women and other minority  scientists were not included. He challenged other leaders in bioscience  to do the same. Fortunately, some are. More should. As I said, we need  all hands on deck.   I will close with this. About a week after the 2020 Nobel Prizes  announcements, the winner of the 2020 3M Young Scientist Challenge was  announced. That is the Nation's top science prize for middle schoolers.  It carries a $25,000 award.   The winner this year is a 14-year-old Indian-American girl from  Frisco, TX, Anika Chebrolu. Two years ago, she began studying the  Spanish Influenza of 1918 that killed at least 50 million people  worldwide. Last year, she came with a bad case of the seasonal flu  herself and threw herself into finding a cure. She discovered a  molecule that may lead to the development of a new antiviral drug to  treat COVID. The molecule binds to the spiky protein of the novel  coronavirus and inhibits the spread of the virus into human cells.   Supporting the achievements of girls and women in STEM fields can  help solve some of the greatest afflictions of our time and solve some  of the deepest mysteries of our universe. It is a profoundly wise  investment. Congratulations to the new women Nobel science laureates of  2020. May there be many more who follow in their footsteps.
