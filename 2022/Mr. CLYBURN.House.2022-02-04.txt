 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I  appreciate him letting me stand in today for the majority leader. I  have talked to the majority leader this week, and I understand he is  doing very well, and I hope that he will rejoin you at this desk next  week.   Madam Speaker, before I go to the schedule, I also thank the  gentleman for joining me yesterday for an historic occasion, the  dedication of H-150 on the first floor of this building, which happens  to be part of his office. That building has been designated the Joseph  H. Rainey Room.   As you know, Rainey was elected to the United States Congress from  South Carolina this past December 12, 150 years ago. None of us really  realized it at the time but H-150, now a part of the Republican whip's  office, was an Indian Affairs room back when Rainey was here. And  Rainey was on that committee, so it is fitting and proper for that room  to carry his name. I thank the gentleman for being so kind yesterday  and being part of that.                                time  1130     Madam Speaker, as the gentleman occupies one of the  offices that he served in, I am proud to now be representing many of  the communities that he represented here in this body. Thank you so  much.   Now, for the schedule for next week. On Monday, the House will meet  at 12 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with  votes postponed until 6:30 p.m. On Tuesday, the House will meet at 10  a.m. for morning hour and 12 p.m. for legislative business. On  Wednesday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.   The House will consider H.R. 4445, the Ending Forced Arbitration of  Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act, introduced by Representative  Cheri Bustos, which would end forced arbitration in cases relating to  sexual assault and harassment, providing survivors with legal recourse  to seek justice in court against their assailants.   The House will also consider H.R. 3485, the Global Respect Act,  introduced by Representative   David Cicilline, which furthers our  Nation's commitment to LGBTQ rights around the world by sanctioning  foreign individuals found to be complicit in violating the human rights  of LGBTQ people.   Additionally, the House will consider Representative Carolyn  Maloney's bill, H.R. 3076, the Postal Service Reform Act. This  bipartisan bill would strengthen the financial position of the United  States Postal Service and ensure it continues to successfully carry out  its mandate to the deliver mail to every household and business in the  country.   Lastly, the House stands ready to act on the Build Back Better Act,  as well as the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act, should the Senate  amend them. Of course, we will act on appropriations, hopefully on an  omnibus bill, but we will not allow the government to shut down.   Additional items may be possible in our view.    Madam Speaker, yes, we have heard all of those  discussions. We are hopeful that something will come forward next week  in the form of an omnibus, but if not, we will respond appropriately  when we get to that point.    Madam Speaker, I am not aware of a date, but I would  hope that if we do not get an omnibus there will be a short term CR  because as the gentleman knows that getting the omnibus is very, very  important to our constituents back home so that people can plan their  lives sufficiently. We both are very concerned about the effectiveness  of our representation of our constituents.    Madam Speaker, I know that the Speaker is in  consultation with the attending physician on what the protocol for this  year might be. In the weeks ahead as we approach the date, the  attending physician will make recommendations based on the current  state of the pandemic.   I think, as all of us are very pleased with what we are hearing about  the pandemic, it is moving in a very favorable direction, and I am sure  the attending physician will take all of that into account when he  establishes the protocol for the State of the Union address.    Madam Speaker, I, like the gentleman, witnessed those  games over the weekend. I don't know why you want to remind me of the  last time you and I shared a stadium with Joe Burrow, but I do want you  to know that I was pulling for him over the weekend. That is tough for  this Clemson guy to do.   I enjoyed those games. I am sure that all the people who attended  them enjoyed those games. Now, what I am sure the attending physician  will be taking into account is he will probably get the reports from  the aftermath of those games and will be guided by that.   I am sure that if the day or two following the games everybody was  well, he will take that into account. He will look and see how people  faired the next day and the day after that to establish the protocol,  and I am perfectly willing to wait to hear from him.    Madam Speaker, you are absolutely correct, I agree with  you. The number that was announced previously was based upon the  situation as it stood at that moment. I suspect that if things change  dramatically in the next week or two or three that number may go down,  everything else may get back close to normal.   I come from a pretty red State and the reviews are pretty mixed as it  relates to even school children. Some schools are doing well, other  schools aren't. It is not just what State you may be from, but a lot  depends on what community that you live in.   We have a community here that we all enjoy living and working in. I  am sure that the attending physician will take into account things that  exist in and around this community in making his decision as to how we  should conduct ourselves during the State of the Union.    No, I don't have any idea and have not been informed as  to what date that decision will be made. I am sure it will be made and  we will be given enough time for us to conduct ourselves accordingly.    Madam Speaker, I have nothing else.
