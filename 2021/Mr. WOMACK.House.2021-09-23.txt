 Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon in steadfast support  of this supplemental and of Israel.   In the same week President Biden pledged to stand with our allies,  his Democrat counterparts removed critical defense resources for our  longstanding ally and friend. We shouldn't be surprised, given the  openly anti-Semitic sentiments and comparisons of Israel and America to  terrorist organizations expressed by some on the other side.   The State of Israel has the right to exist free of terror. This point  should not be controversial. The bill is simple. As evidenced by the  colloquy just a minute ago, it replenishes the defensive Iron Dome  system. I will say it again. It replenishes a defensive system.   The Iron Dome has no offensive capability, and yet there are still  members on the Democrat side of the aisle who oppose it. It was that  opposition, Mr.  [[Page H5109]]  Speaker, that delayed proceedings in this very Chamber on Tuesday,  forcing leadership to pull Iron Dome from the continuing resolution, so  they could have the votes to pass.   Interestingly, we didn't see the same visceral reaction to leaving  more than a billion dollars' worth of artillery in the hands of  terrorists in Afghanistan, as we are seeing with this defensive system.   They are openly opposing a capability that protects women and  children from terrorist rocket attacks.   In the words of our own Speaker, it is about the children.   Earlier this year, Hamas and other terrorist organizations launched  more than 4,000 rockets at Israeli civilians. We are talking about  children and families simply trying to live their lives.   I hope this bill passes without opposition. That, Mr. Speaker, should  be the standard. I urge each and every one of my colleagues to support  this bill.
