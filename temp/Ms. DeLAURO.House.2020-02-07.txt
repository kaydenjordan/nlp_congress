 Madam Chair, I rise to speak in support of the  supplemental bill for Puerto Rico.   The island has been rocked by earthquakes and tremors. Thousands of  Americans are left without water or power, facing catastrophic property  damage.   In my district, I met with affected families and community members.  We discussed the ongoing disaster and the response and recovery needs.   I have staff, people who have family in Puerto Rico who are sleeping  outdoors for fear of going back into a home that is badly damaged.   There should be no question about providing the resources necessary  to recover. This supplemental package provides $4.67 billion for  educational needs, transportation infrastructure repairs, and disaster  relief activities, including $100 million for education.   For K-12 programs, it helps schools restart operations, support  reenrollment, and pay for the costs of providing education to students  who have been displaced by natural disasters, and yes, it addresses the  mental health needs of children as they have experienced a traumatic  event. Higher education, the funding helps defray the unexpected costs  associated with enrolling displaced students and with rebuilding  damaged facilities.    This supplemental also extends the child tax credit to all children  in Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories. Under the current system,  Puerto Rican families are only eligible for the child tax credit for  the third or subsequent child. What we need to do is to expand and  improve the child tax credit, make it fully refundable, but this is a  necessary step in the meantime so that U.S. citizens in the territories  are treated exactly like those in the States.   Let me just also assure my colleagues on a final note, that we are  working with the administration to determine the costs of our ongoing  response to the 2019 novel coronavirus. We have urged the  administration to work with the Congress on a bipartisan basis to enact  an emergency supplemental for that public health emergency. We stand  ready to move forward quickly to protect public health and safety.   On this supplemental for Puerto Rico, let me urge my colleagues to  vote ``yes,'' vote ``yes'' for Americans who are in dire straits on  that island, and it is unconscionable that we would have second  thoughts about the kind of support that they need during this crisis.  Urge the Senate, urge the President to add their support swiftly. Our  fellow Americans and Puerto Rico cannot afford for us to delay any  longer.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment. It is  $1 million that provides funds for a study on the impacts of natural  disasters on the well-being and educational paths of affected students  and children in Puerto Rico.   The children in Puerto Rico have been struggling from the trauma of  multiple natural disasters. It has been resulting in unbelievable  disruptions to their lives at home and at school.   After Hurricane Maria, Congresswoman Grace Meng from New York and I  went to Puerto Rico. We visited the schools, and the teachers told us  that the children were not coming to school. Why? We asked the  question: Why?   They were scared that if they went to school and they returned home,  they would not find their families, their home, or anything else that  gave them their strength and the hope with their families, so they  weren't going. They also couldn't go because the power was out, and the  heat was too much for them to be there.   What is it that you can't understand? What is it that this  administration doesn't understand about what is happening to children,  American children, in Puerto Rico?                                time  1030    We included $3 million in the 2019 Labor-HHS appropriations bill to  provide behavorial health services and counseling to children in Puerto  Rico. These services are being provided through the National Child  Traumatic Stress Network, which is a national network of grantees that  provide services for children and adolescents exposed to traumatic  events.   Schools are the center of our communities. They offer students stable  schedules, warm meals, and support from teachers and school  professionals. They are the center of learning. We need to act with  urgency to support the school recovery and restore this stability for  the children in Puerto Rico,  [[Page H954]]  but we must take a careful look at the long-term impacts of these  disasters on student well-being and educational access and success.   Madam Chair, this amendment provides those resources. I support it,  and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Madam Chair, may I inquire how  much time is remaining.    Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time  in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I look forward to the day when my  colleague, Miss Gonzalez-Colon from Puerto Rico, can vote in this House  of Representatives.   I also want to add one thing.   A colleague from South Carolina said earlier that folks in Puerto  Rico do not pay taxes. They pay payroll taxes. We  [[Page H955]]  all understand payroll taxes; and, quite frankly, that is the basis on  which the child tax credit is determined. So they are paying taxes.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment. I am honored to  colead it with my colleague Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, with  Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez, and Congressmen Serrano and Soto. It  increases funding for Puerto Rico's Nutrition Assistance Program to  $210 million.   The $40 million in the underlying bill provides a strong foundation  on which to build; and, in light of a new analysis from leading  nutrition experts which has shown how great the need is, the amendment  increases the resources to what the experts are now calling for.   Thousands have been left without food, water, or power. We cannot  turn our backs on the people of Puerto Rico. We need to meet basic  needs so that they can rebuild. It is not only a responsibility, but it  is a moral responsibility.   And why is this necessary? Because Puerto Rico receives a block grant  for nutrition assistance. It is known as the Nutrition Assistance  Program, or NAP. Because the value of the block grant is fixed, their  nutrition assistance is unable to meet the heightened needs of children  and families in times of disaster. It is fundamentally different from  how food stamps work for the millions of other Americans elsewhere in  our country.   But we know where this administration falls on the food stamp  program. They are willing to deny 3 million people access to food  stamps, take 2 million kids off of the School Lunch Program.   Folks here are in need, but the people in Puerto Rico, the children  in Puerto Rico are in need. An island ravished by earthquakes and  tremors--Wednesday saw a 5.0 magnitude earthquake.   In her request to the Congress, Puerto Rico's Governor warned:  ``Puerto Ricans are currently suffering economic and job loss,  displacement and interruption of essential services, and thousands of  refugees currently located in camps are children and the elderly.''   We offer a bipartisan amendment today to build on the underlying  bill. I commend the committee chair, Congresswoman Lowey, and the  subcommittee chair, Congressman Bishop, for their hard work on this  fast-moving matter.   To my colleagues: Have a sense of what food means to people. We live  in a land of plenty. We should not be about the business of denying  food and nutrition help to others, and especially American children and  American families from Puerto Rico, the nutrition assistance, the food  that they need in order to survive.   Madam Chair, no one should go to bed hungry in this country or in  those countries where we have American citizens, and that is Puerto  Rico.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues, please--please--deal with what our  moral responsibility is in this body. We have the power to make this  happen. Let's make it happen today.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
