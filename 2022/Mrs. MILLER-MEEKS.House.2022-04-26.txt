 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  accomplishments of an engineer from my district.   Yarelis Hernandez of Clinton was recently recognized by the National  Association of Manufacturers with the Women in Manufacturing STEP Ahead  Awards. This award is awarded to women who have demonstrated  exceptional leadership in the manufacturing field.   Diversity is a passion of Yarelis' as she serves on LyondellBasell's  Diversity, Equity, and Leadership Council striving to implement  diversity in the workforce.   In the community, Yarelis also sits on the local economic board  leading development between schools and corporations to create jobs for  Iowa students. Yarelis volunteers in the local Introduce a Girl to  Engineering program, which is a mentorship for girls interested in STEM  careers.   Yarelis' dedication to promoting diversity and STEM for young girls  is why she is worthy of receiving such a prestigious award. I am so  proud to represent distinguished women like Yarelis and cannot wait to  see her continued impact in the district.                            ____________________
