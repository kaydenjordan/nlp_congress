 Mr. Speaker, recent aggressive moves by California water  and environmental regulators now threaten very long-held water rights,  pre-1914, the gold standard in my home State. Why? The mismanagement of  water during a short rainfall year has led to hundreds of thousands of  acres of farmland being cut off from water due to Federal and State  regulators that prioritize fish over people's needs.   A California State agency is now ready to cut off water to crops in  just 6 days, midsummer, mid-crop year. Imagine, over halfway through  the year, and they just cut it off. This is in favor of failed  environmental policy that allows the water to flow out to the sea and  doing so ostensibly to help a fish population that it really is not  helping.   Our infrastructure that we are contemplating needs to include water  storage projects. For the American consumer, don't count on these fruit  and vegetable products coming from somewhere else in the world, except  at a much higher price. They will not get to your table with the same  high quality you expect.   We need water storage. We need to be included in any infrastructure  bill. Otherwise, we all suffer as Americans. This is everybody's  problem.                            ____________________
