 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, in January of 2017, when President Trump issued his  first Muslim ban executive order, I immediately rushed to LAX to help  those individuals who were being held at LAX. These were individuals  who had been cleared by our State Department to enter the United  States. Let me repeat: These were individuals who had been cleared by  our State Department to enter the United States, and then they were  blocked by the President's random order.   I immediately introduced my first bill, the DIRe Act, to provide due  process guaranteed by our Constitution for Dreamers, immigrants, and  refugees, due process that has been systematically denied by a  President.   Our Nation is built by immigrants who dare to dream better,  immigrants who came to this country with nothing but their dreams of a  better life.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this bill.
