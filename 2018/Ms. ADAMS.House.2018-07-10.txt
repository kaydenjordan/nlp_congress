 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 1700, the SCORE for  Small Business Act of 2018.   There are nearly 30 million small businesses in the United States,  representing more than 99 percent of all businesses. These small firms  employ nearly 50 percent of all private sector employees in the United  States.   These trailblazers play a critical role in the American economy. They  take great risks by launching new ventures, developing new products,  and establishing new industries; and, ultimately, these brave efforts  help spur growth in our economy.   The Small Business Administration, SBA, is a vital part of their  support system. The SBA administers a portfolio of Entrepreneurial  Development programs, which includes the Service Corps of Retired  Executives, better known as SCORE.   Through this program, the SBA has undertaken efforts to connect new  entrepreneurs and small-business owners with more experienced  businessmen  [[Page H6030]]  and -women. This expansive network consists of entrepreneurs, business  leaders, and executives who volunteer as mentors to small firms both  in-person and online.   SCORE has grown to become one of the Federal Government's largest  volunteer business adviser and mentoring programs. In 2017, 59 percent  of SCORE's clients were women, 39 percent minorities, and 11 percent  veterans.   My legislation reauthorizes this essential program so that it will  continue to have the ability to meet the needs of entrepreneurs. With  technology enhancements and streamlined service processes, SCORE  mentoring will now be accessible to business owners, no matter their  location.   I urge Members to support this legislation, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I do have the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Evans), who will speak on this issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I do want to thank Chairman Chabot for his support.   There is no question that we need to support our small businesses  across the country, no matter their location, industry, or expertise  level. My bill, H.R. 1700, provides that critical support by  reauthorizing a major component of SBA's entrepreneurial programs and  clarifying the utilization of the volunteer base.   This bill is supported by the SCORE Association and is reflective of  the growth of this program that actively engages business owners, as  well as retired executives, to mentor the next generation of job  makers.   I want to again thank Chairman Chabot for working in a bipartisan  manner to help our Nation's small businesses and for his support to  reauthorize SCORE.   I would urge all of the Members to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise to support H.R. 2655, the Small Business Innovation Protection  Act of 2017.   Innovation is an indispensable driver of economic growth and it  ensures America's competitive edge in the global marketplace, but many  small innovators who should have IP rights are disadvantaged by a  complex system which allows their property to be pirated. Much of the  time, all they needed was access to the resources, the expertise, and  the knowledge to obtain, monitor, and enforce their rights.   H.R. 2655 corrects this by creating a partnership between the two  agencies best suited to help these innovators: the Small Business  Administration and the United States Patent and Trademark Office.   By leveraging existing IP education and training programs and  utilizing the immense network of Small Business Development Centers,  innovators will have all the necessary resources to better protect  their interests both domestically and internationally.                                time  1930    I applaud Representative Evans for recognizing the problem and  working to advance the interests of our Nation's small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, intellectual property protections offer small innovative  firms and entrepreneurs much needed  [[Page H6032]]  protection at home and in other countries.   In fact, small business firms with IP rights earned 32 percent more  in revenue on average per employee when compared to their counterparts  without IP rights.   Without those protections, our economy may not be what it is today.   H.R. 2655 offers necessary education and training to sustain  America's competitive edge and drive continued economic growth.   As such, I once again urge my colleagues to support this measure, and  I yield back the balance of my time.
