 Madam Speaker, a few days ago, I stood immersed in a sea  of women, of men, and of children of all colors, creeds, and  backgrounds; citizens who fiercely believe that the diversity of their  opinions anchor, that they do not undermine, the values that we share,  and that their personal activism and unique advocacy could be traced  back to one collective, guiding principle--equality.   As hundreds of thousands of people swarmed this Capital, Boston  Common, town greens from Wilton, New Hampshire, to Newport, Oregon,  they sent a clear message to their government that when you treat any  of us as less, you threaten all of us.   And that is what this bill does. It tells women across this country  that their health can be compromised; that constitutionally guaranteed  means something different to them than it does to men.   If this was a simple attempt to limit a woman's legal right to  abortion or reproductive health care, that would be bad enough. But it  is more than that.   Combined with yesterday's reinstatement of the global gag rule, this  bill crystallizes the fact that our new GOP-led government sees women's  health care as expendable, both within and far beyond our borders.   Make no mistake, if my colleagues continue down this path, I know  that there will be a few million men, women, and children willing to  keep marching.
