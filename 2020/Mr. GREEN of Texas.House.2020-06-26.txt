 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  51--the Washington, D.C. Admission Act--introduced by my colleague,  Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton. This bill would not only establish the  District of Columbia (``D.C.'') as the 51st state of the United States,  but it would also grant long overdue voting representation at the  federal level to the residents of D.C.   I remain committed to the principles this country boasts: democracy  and representation. Since 1801, the residents of D.C. have been denied  federal representation. They pay their taxes and have fought and died  in every American war, yet those armed service members and their  families are deprived of the freedoms they have fought to protect.  Statehood is the only remedy that provides full representation in  Congress for the residents of Washington, D.C.    Madam Speaker, it is an honor to serve in the  Congress of the United States of America under Chairwoman Waters'  leadership.   Madam Speaker, Ms. Waters and I both know that the CRA was not born  to create luxury homes in opportunity zones. The CRA was not birthed to  provide opportunities in what are being called banking deserts that may  not be LMI communities.   The CRA was born to correct the harm that the government had done in  the 1930s.   At that time, the government, by and through the FHA, decided that it  would craft maps, and these maps had red lines on them. These red lines  became communities that were undesirable, but more appropriately, they  were deemed unsafe, and as a result, lending institutions would not  lend in these redlined areas.   The CRA was born to end the discrimination, the redlining, but this  bill takes a step back to the 1930s.   This bill will not undo the harm that was done; it will increase the  harm. I cannot support it.   The CRA was created to help LMI, low-to-moderate income, communities  have banking privileges that they were denied under the law.   This bill doesn't help us with the LMIs. It is going to give those  big guys an opportunity to acquire these funds. I stand against it.   Madam Speaker, I support the chair of the committee and I stand for  justice for the LMI communities.    Madam Speaker, I submit the following letters to  be included in the debate on H.J. Res. 90. The following letters  express support for H.J. Res. 90.                                                 National Community                                          Reinvestment Coalition,                                                      June 23, 2020.      House of Representatives,      U.S. Capitol,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the undersigned       organizations, we are writing to urge you to cosponsor and       support H.J. Res.  [[Page H2579]]       90, a disapproval resolution that would overturn a poorly       constructed rule change on the Community Reinvestment Act       (CRA) hastily finalized in May, days before Comptroller       Otting's resignation from the agency, and published this       month.        At the outset, it is critical to note that the Trump       Administration is split on the CRA final rule. With a lack of       interagency coordination among the nation's bank regulators,       different banks will be held to different reinvestment       standards depending on their regulator--an outcome that both       banks and advocates have cautioned against. Federal Reserve       Chairman Jerome Powell testified just last week that he       expects the agency to move forward with CRA updates intended       to garner ``broad support among the community of intended       beneficiaries'' something he considers to be ``one non-      negotiable condition for it.'' The OCC's final rule achieved       no such support or consensus. The vast majority of public       comments--about 90 percent--opposed the CRA evaluation       measure and presumptive ratings framework that remains at the       heart of the final rule, but the OCC adopted it anyway.        The OCC's final rule makes a series of changes to the CRA       regulatory framework that reduce incentives for banks to lend       to low-and-moderate income (LMI) families and invest and       serve LMI communities: home buyers and homeowners, small       businesses, community development projects that primarily       benefit and serve LMI people. It also expands the number of       banks that will have no review of how they open and close       bank branches and provide key bank services in LMI and       underserved neighborhoods.        These harmful changes could not come at a worse time. The       ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and widespread social unrest that       is gripping the nation has hit LMI and communities of color       the hardest and brought gapping disparities to the forefront.       The changes to the CRA being pushed through by the OCC would       do little to address the pressing national priorities of       reducing the racial wealth gap, of better serving those       traditionally underserved by the nation's financial system or       stimulating an economic recovery from COVID-19 that is       equitable. While the OCC claims its aim is to increase CRA       activity, the lack of interagency agreement among this       Administration's regulators should serve as a dire warning       about that claim. We do not yet know the full impact of       COVID-19 on local mortgage markets, small business       resiliency, or how LMI households, neighborhoods, local jobs,       and key sectors will recover. Weakening CRA at this moment is       a blueprint for a crisis after the crisis.        For all these reasons and more, we urge you to cosponsor       H.J. Res. 90 and support it when it is considered on the       House floor.

Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi: I am writing on behalf of the National       Housing Conference (NHC) to express our strong support for       H.J. Res. 90, the Congressional Review Act resolution of       disapproval of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) final       rule.        The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has       issued its final CRA rule just six weeks after the end of the       comment period on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) and       amid the worst health and economic crisis of our lifetimes.       Implementation of this rule poses a material  [[Page H2580]]       threat to our recovery from the COVID-19 recession and       undercuts the purpose and intent of CRA, harming underserved       communities throughout the nation.        As NHC stated in its formal comment letter on the CRA NPR       on April 8, we have no idea how severely the pandemic will       impact our economy, the financial system and communities       throughout the nation. Committing resources to regulatory       initiatives that do not directly support our national       response to the COVID-19 pandemic is a dangerous distraction:       On April 27, NHC joined 14 other major national       organizations, including the National Association of REALTORS       and the National League of Cities, to urge regulators to       refrain from committing resources to regulatory initiatives       that do not directly support our national response to the       COVID-19 pandemic.        Notably, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)       and the Federal Reserve Board refused to join the OCC on this       ill-timed decision. As FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams noted       in her March 19, 2020 letter to the Financial Accounting       Standards Board, financial institutions ``will face unique       difficulties over the coming weeks and months to adequately       staff customer-facing functions; ensure that deposit, loan,       and IT systems operate normally; help borrowers that are       experiencing unanticipated cash flow difficulties; and       address the earnings and capital implications of near zero       percent interest rates and a potential surge in borrowers who       are unable to meet contractual payment terms.'' We could not       agree more.        CRA modernization is a once-in-a-generation opportunity.       There is much to improve, as the law and most recent       regulations were written before the proliferation of       interstate banking, internet banking and the revitalization       of America's cities; the latter being the opposite trend of       one of the two major reasons for CRA's adoption--urban       disinvestment--as well as the stubborn persistence of       redlining and its legacy impact. Instead, the OCC has pursued       an entirely new system that will gut CRA's effectiveness for       years and undercut broader efforts to address the very issues       that Congress attempted to solve in 1977, and still struggles       with today.        The OCC's rule has received nearly universal condemnation.       Using its ratio-driven approach, banks will be powerfully       incented to make only the largest investments in communities       that need it the least, and may also fuel the displacement of       those people who need it the most. This rule eliminates the       fundamental value of CRA, which at its best, levels the       playing field between large, highly profitable investments,       and the harder and smaller but still profitable deals that       often have disproportionately positive impact on communities;       and are by their nature, harder to get an allocation of       capital from a bank that we want to be governed by a culture       that focuses on a risk-weighted return.        CRA modernization is long overdue and needs to be done so       banks and communities get the clarity and flexibility they       need to ensure it has the maximum positive impact. But no       modernization effort is worth gutting the central purpose of       CRA--constructive reinvestment in the communities that need       it most. Consequently, the National Housing Conference       strongly supports H.J. Res. 90 and hope that once this       unprecedented national crisis is behind us, we can all work       together to fully realize the purpose and intent of CRA.            Sincerely,                                                  David M. Dworkin,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                                             Hope,                                                      June 23, 2020.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House,      House of Representatives.                           Support for H.J. Res. 90         HOPE (Hope Enterprise Corporation/Hope Credit Union/Hope       Policy Institute) supposes H.J Res. 90, providing for       congressional disapproval of the Office of the Comptroller of       the Currency's (OCC) final rule overhauling the Community       Reinvestment Act.        HOPE is a Black-led, women-owned community development       financial institution, credit union, and policy institute in       Jackson, Mississippi. HOPE was established 25 years ago to       ensure that all people regardless of where they live, their       gender, race or place of birth have the opportunity to       support their families and realize the American Dream. HOPE       has generated over $2.5 billion in financing that has       benefitted more than 1.5 million people throughout Alabama,       Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee.        The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) has been a critical       tool for HOPE to leverage the resources it needs to serve       low-income communities, rural communities, and communities of       color in the Deep South. Unfortunately, the OCC's final rule       moves the CRA--and economic opportunity for our communities--      further out of reach in three ways:        Incenting larger, easier activities, potentially reducing       the smaller, more intensive investments that Deep South       communities so often need,        Deprioritizing meaningful CRA activities in the country's       most distressed communities, and        Diverting investments to activities far from the CRA's       original intent of redressing redlining.        As just one example, the OCC's failure to prioritize bank       branches in low-income and rural areas will be acutely felt       in the Deep South, where already much of the region is       already in a banking desert and includes areas with the       highest percentage of persons who are unbanked in the United       States. Mississippi and Louisiana, with over 15% of unbanked       residents, have the highest percentage among all states. The       rate of unbanked Black households is even higher, at 28% both       states. As made plain during COVID-19, these disparities in       access to banking relationships lay the foundation for       broader disparities in access to capital for small businesses       and individuals.        Ultimately, the OCC's final rule widens the wealth gap and       further inhibits economic opportunity in already hard-pressed       areas of the country, particularly here in the Deep South.                                   ____           National Alliance of Community Economic Development             Associations,                                                     June 23, 2020.      Representative Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, House Financial Services Committee, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters: Thank you for leading and actively       supporting H.J. Res. 90, a disapproval resolution to overturn       the Community Reinvestment Act rule change finalized by the       Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in May 2020.       The National Alliance of Community Economic Development       Associations (NACEDA) and our members find the OCC's final       rule deeply problematic for low and moderate-income       communities for the reasons outlined in our public comment       letter dated April, 8, 2020.        The final rule addresses very few of the concerns we       expressed in our April letter. The final rule is deeply       problematic and fundamentally flawed.        To paraphrase FDIC Board Member Martin Gruenberg's       statement on December 12, 2019, in opposition to the proposed       rule, the proposed rule severely undermines what has been a       core strength of CRA for 40 years--the encouragement of bank       engagement and dialogue with stakeholders in local       communities, including community-based organizations,       community development corporations, and others, to understand       and better serve historically underserved areas. For this       reason and more, we support your committee's Congressional       Review Act resolution to overturn the rule change.            Sincerely,      Frank Woodruff,        Executive Director, National Alliance of Community Economic       Development Associations.     Madam Speaker, and still I rise.   I am here for a special purpose, and I shall not deviate from the  cause that has brought me to this podium tonight, but I do assure you  there are things that have been said that at an appropriate time, I  will respond to.   Tonight, I rise to call to the attention of this House H. Res. 1014,  Encouraging the celebration of the month of June as LGBTQ Pride Month.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the many original cosponsors of this  resolution. There are 60. I would like to thank the Human Rights  Campaign for the work that it has done to help us construct this  resolution. I would like to thank the Center for Transgender Equality,  the Equality Caucus, and Dignity Houston.   I rise tonight because 51 years ago, the Stonewall riots in New York  heralded in the beginning of the end of a shameful period in our  history, because 51 years ago, Madam Speaker, in June 1969, police  raided The Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village, New York,  causing a civil uprising and clashes between the police and thousands  of protesters.   Those historic events catalyzed a generation of activists who birthed  a civil rights movement for LGBTQ equality.   I rise tonight because I am an ally of the LGBTQ-plus community.   I rise tonight because I didn't get here by myself. There were people  of all stripes who made it possible for me to stand here in the House  of Representatives.   I rise tonight because 51 years ago being gay, lesbian, bisexual, or  transgender was illegal in most States in this country. Another way of  putting it is this: It was illegal to be who you were in this country.   Fifty-one years ago, no Federal or State laws existed to secure the  rights of lesbian and gay people to live openly in a relationship with  their partner.   Fifty-one years ago, no law precluded even the most overt  discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.   Fifty-one years ago, our legal system afforded LGBTQ-plus persons no  protections under the law to live free from discrimination in  employment, in housing, in finance, in education, or in healthcare.   I rise tonight because 51 years ago, there were few openly gay  politicians or public figures in this country.   I am honored to say that the Honorable Barney Frank, whom I served  with in Congress, has been and continues to be a part of this  resolution. Each resolution that I have sponsored has honored the  Honorable Barney Frank, a Member of Congress from 1981 to 2013, and  recognized him as an honorary cosponsor of this resolution.   I rise because 51 years ago, being openly gay was a finable offense,  a crime, in many Federal agencies and a per se bar to obtaining a  Federal security clearance.   But today, thanks to the resolution and thanks to the revolution that  began this month 51 years ago at Stonewall, I am proud to say that  several openly gay persons serve proudly on my congressional staff. I  am proud to have them, and I am proud of the work they do.   Today, I am even more proud that as of last Monday, when the Supreme  Court decided Bostock v. Clayton County, each member of my staff and  all LGBTQ persons in the United States of America now enjoy the same  legal protections against employment discrimination as all other  persons without regard to sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity.   In that historic 6-3 decision, the Bostock court resoundingly  affirmed that the prohibitions of Title VII bar all discrimination in  employment on the basis of sex, including sexual orientation or gender  identity.   Today, we recall the painful, bloody, and often deadly toll of the 51  formative years between Stonewall and Bostock.   Today, we remember each LGBTQ-plus victim of discrimination,  violence, and prejudice in the intervening years--51 years, I might  add--who were shut out, subjugated, or even killed.   Today, we mourn each one of the Black transgender women who have been  murdered in this year alone.   And today, with consideration of this Pride resolution, we continue  the tradition that I began as an original sponsor of Congress' Pride  Month resolution.   I am proud of how far we have come as a Nation in our struggle for  full LGBTQ-plus equality. And in this season of Pride, it is fitting to  celebrate that remarkable hard-won progress.                                time  1830    But today, I also recognize that, although we have come a long way in  51 years, we still have far to go. Today, we must ensure that full  inclusion for LGBTQ-plus persons does not take another 51 years or even  51 weeks. It is now time that we must complete the march toward full  legal equality for all persons, without regard to sexual orientation or  gender identity.   Today, I call upon the Senate to take up and pass the Equality Act,  H.R. 5, without further delay. I am proud to be the original sponsor of  this resolution. I am grateful to all who have become original  cosponsors. It is not too late for persons to cosponsor the resolution,  and I would beg that persons would do so.   So now, having finished my comments on the Pride Month resolution, I  would like to step over to the next microphone.                Valuing Order and Law Instead of Law and Order     Madam Speaker, I rise because now I must say it  was most difficult to sit in this House and hear some of the comments  made by my colleagues tonight. They seem to value statues above human  life.   All the vandalism and crimes that have been committed, I don't  support that, and I don't think that the protesters who were out there  peacefully protesting supported it either.   I don't think you ought to paint all protesters with one brush, just  as I don't paint all peace officers with one brush. I never conclude  that all officers are bad, but those who are bad ought to be punished.   I find it quite fascinating that my colleagues who came here and  spoke so eloquently tonight, I haven't heard them on the floor in prior  times talking about all of the atrocities being committed against  people of color at the hands of the constabulary. I just question why  is it that they don't come to the floor and stand up for people of  color.   I stand up for all people. It doesn't matter your color, your sex,  your sexual orientation. I have been on this floor consistently doing  this, but I don't see that from the other side.   I see them here for what I call order and law, not law and order, and  here is how that works: You have a President who goes before members of  the police community, and he says to them: When you arrest a person,  you don't have to be so nice.   Now, he is talking about a person who is in the care, custody, and  control of the police, and that person does not have to be treated so  nice.   He sent a message. That message was, you maintain order, do whatever  you have got to do, and I will provide the law to support you. That is  order and law.   I support law and order. I have an uncle who was a deputy sheriff. He  influenced my life. I am probably in Congress today because of words  that he spoke to me, so I support policing. I understand the necessity  to have persons who are going to assure us that we can be protected.   But what I don't support is a belief that peaceful protesters are all  somehow a part of a mob. You can peacefully protest and go to jail. I  know; I have been there. I was there with the Honorable   John Lewis.  We were peacefully protesting, but we went to jail.   Peaceful protesters go to jail. Peaceful protesters get in the way.  Peaceful protesters disrupt. That is what protest  [[Page H2592]]  is about. If people don't get uncomfortable, then your protest has  accomplished very little.   Dr. King was in jail when he wrote the letter from the Birmingham  jail. He was peacefully protesting, but he went to jail. It happens.  That is a part of the protest movement.   When I went out to protest, knowing that I would likely go to jail, I  had somebody to post my bail.   Peaceful protest does not mean that you are not disruptive. It means  that you have a message that has to be heard. As Dr. King put it,  protests can be the language of the unheard, peaceful protest  especially.   So I am here to say to my colleagues, I regret that you cannot see  the hurt that is being felt by people of color.   I don't understand why my tax dollars have to support a statue along  some thoroughfare of Robert E Lee. You can have it. Take it to a  museum. Tuck it away for whatever purposes you like. But you don't have  to impose it upon me.   We don't allow--or, more appropriately, Germany does not have statues  of Hitler in the public squares. And I refuse to stand by and allow  statues of people who wanted to keep my ancestors in chains, in  slavery, which is a nice way of saying rape, murder, kidnapping,  stripping babies from their parents, and sending the parents one way  and the children another. It is too nice a word for what happened to my  ancestors.   So, I am not going to celebrate them. I have never celebrated them,  and it is time to remove them.    I am not going to go out and pull one over and push it off into some  corner. But I don't see my colleagues helping with the means by which  they can be removed, and you take them and put them wherever you would  like to have them. I have no problem with your ownership of them, but  don't expect me to celebrate them and have my tax dollars take care of  them.   There was one in my congressional district, a Confederate soldier  named Dowling. It has been removed, and I am proud to know that was  removed.   So I rise now, as I close, to say just simply this: I love my  country. I love my country. I love it because of many of the good  things that have happened to me. But I also love it in spite of many of  the things that were not appropriate that have occurred. And I will  continue to love my country.   But I refuse to accept symbols of racism and hate. I will never honor  them, and I would badly have my colleagues take them to some other  place out of the public square.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
