 Madam President, I want to thank my colleague, the  Senator from Utah, Mr. Lee, for working with me on the act that we just  passed.                            ____________________     Madam President, if this week has shown us anything, it  is that courts matter. In three important decisions over 2 days, the  Supreme Court majority endorsed Donald Trump's bigotry and handed him  the power to exclude any group of people for any reason, as long as he  couches it as a national security matter.   Justice Alito led a narrow majority in a concerted effort to destroy  unions--in this case, public sector unions--and Justice Thomas told  States that they cannot tell women what reproductive services are  available to them.   We have also seen a Federal trial court judge in San Diego, who  combined his understanding of the law with his capacity for human  kindness, order that children who were separated from their parents at  the southern border be reunited with them in short order.   We have seen the Third Circuit Court of Appeals rule in favor of  transgender public school students being able to use the bathrooms that  match their gender identity.   The work that judges do affects the real lives of people living and  working in this country--people who are trying to care for their  families, to serve their country, to earn a living; people who count on  us here in Congress to make sure that they are safe and that their  rights are protected. In the Judiciary Committee on which I sit, that  responsibility is normally never greater than when we consider a  nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.   These are not normal times. When we have a President who avows that  the Supreme Court should always be Republican, ignoring the independent  role of the Court, the Senate's advice and consent process is even more  crucial.   Take a look at the President's tweet. He believes the Supreme Court  is an extension of his political party. Last March, he reiterated: ``We  need more Republicans in 2018,'' he said, ``and must ALWAYS''--he likes  to capitalize--``ALWAYS hold the Supreme Court!'' Any nominee from this  President comes to us with this taint attached.   The President is not the only one to politicize the courts. Neil  Gorsuch would never have made it to the Supreme Court if not for the  majority leader, whose proudest achievement, according to him, is Neil  Gorsuch's confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court.   There is no question that the majority leader wants to ensure a  conservative majority on the Supreme Court to upend the fundamental  rights of millions of Americans. It started in 2016 when he refused to  even meet with the President's Supreme Court nominee and would not  grant him a hearing. The majority leader held this seat hostage  precisely because he wanted someone who would serve as a rubberstamp  for his radical conservative agenda.   Here is what Mitch McConnell said when he did this. He said that the  American people should have a voice in the selection of their next  Court Justice. Under the McConnell rule, this vacancy created by  Justice Kennedy's resignation and retirement should be treated no  differently.   If the people's voice should have been heard in 2016, it is no less  important now, because these are clearly not normal times. On Tuesday-- the same day the Supreme Court ruled that the President could  discriminate against people coming to our country on the basis of  religion--the majority leader tweeted this picture of himself with Neil  Gorsuch.   The message is clear. The twisted process got the Republicans just  what they wanted, and they want to do it again. They want to keep doing  it, and we should not let them.   Democrats should do everything we can to ensure that the Supreme  Court stays independent and protects fundamental rights and values. The  American people certainly deserve no less.   I yield the floor.
