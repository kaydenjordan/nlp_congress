 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1494 the  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Homeland Security  Partnerships Act. This legislation would require the Department of  Homeland Security to develop a strategy to strengthen the partnerships  between the Department and HBCU's. In turn, this would expose the  talented students attending these institutions to more robust  recruitment and hiring by the Department along with better cooperation  by these institutions in DHS research and testing programs.   HBCU's and other Minority Serving Institutions have provided a  quality education to millions of Americans seeking to gain knowledge  and to better their career prospects. Many of the students who are  attending these institutions come from diverse backgrounds and are the  first in their families to pursue a postsecondary education. It is my  strong belief that our federal workforce should be as diverse as  possible so that the work our government does can impact all Americans.  With the passage of this legislation today, the Department of Homeland  Security will take a step towards a more diverse workforce. Mr.  Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand with the Members of the  Congressional Black Caucus tonight to celebrate the ratification of the  15th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which granted African  American men the right to vote.   The 15th Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits the  Federal Government and each State from denying a citizen the right to  vote based upon the citizen's race, color, or previous condition of  servitude.   We are still fighting for that right; although, we are celebrating  the 150th anniversary of that right.   In Texas and throughout our country, we are still fighting for the  right to vote and the right to have our voices heard without ridiculous  impediments and barriers that you have heard about tonight. The  memories of the poll tax and jelly bean jars to be counted are still  with us.   I am old enough to remember that, when I became 21, at that time, to  vote, I had to pay a poll tax. So it was important to be able to just  vote. But I say to young people today that we still have to fight  equally as hard for our right to vote.   I have lived through the periods in American history when the  fundamental right to vote has been continuously challenged for people  of color, where discrimination was the law of the land and separate but  equal was the norm. These rights guaranteeing the 13th, 14th, and 15th  Amendments to the Constitution are sacred and continue to be protected  so we may live in freedom. But the fight for freedom is daily.   The 15th Amendment is part of the Reconstruction Amendments. The 13th  Amendment abolished slavery. The 14th Amendment granted citizenship to  all persons born or naturalized in the United States and guaranteed all  citizens equal protection under the laws. And the 15th Amendment  protected the right to vote.                                time  2000    The 13th and 14th Amendments were intended to establish equal rights  for former slaves, and here we are, celebrating the 150th anniversary  and still being treated as if slavery is the law of the land.   Reconstruction, a period in American history that lasted more than a  decade, from 1863 to 1877, was devastating for African Americans and  denied us the basic freedoms promised by the Constitution. This led to  mass segregation in the South.   Clearly, our young people of color today did not live through much of  this, and many of us didn't. Yet, we continue to live it every day.   Madam Speaker, you have heard remarks on the budget, and you have  heard remarks that specifically single out people who are least able to  look out for themselves because of segregation and racism. They are  also the ones who are first to be punished.   We will not be silenced, however. We will use our right to stand for  all the people who have been guaranteed the right to be full Americans  until we become full Americans.
