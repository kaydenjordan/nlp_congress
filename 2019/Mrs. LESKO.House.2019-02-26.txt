 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank Mr. Raskin for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, all of us, Republicans and Democrats, want to reduce gun  violence. I think there is just a difference of opinion on how we get  there.   Unfortunately, H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112, although well-intentioned, will  not reduce gun violence as Mr. Raskin said, and instead it will turn  everyday, law-abiding individuals into criminals and could actually do  more harm than good.   I grew up in a family that didn't have guns. After my dad returned  from World War II, he stopped hunting. So, because I wasn't around  them, I have to admit I had an irrational fear of guns for awhile. It  wasn't until I became an adult that I got educated.   I remember I first went to a debate where the person who was talking  for gun rights said: Do you know who follows the laws? Law-abiding  people follow the laws. Who doesn't follow the laws? Criminals do not  follow the laws.   So although well-intentioned, often laws are unenforceable, and  criminals just do not follow them.   H.R. 8, again, I believe is well-intentioned. But it will not solve  the problem. H.R. 8 would not have prevented any of the mass shootings  in the last 20 years, not one of them.  [[Page H2121]]    I studied them because I am on the Judiciary Committee along with Mr.  Raskin, and we heard this bill in that committee. In most cases, guns  were obtained legally. Recent attackers have passed background checks  to acquire their firearms, including the attackers at the Thousand  Oaks, California, shooting; the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania shooting; the attacker in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas  High School, Parkland, Florida, shooting; the shooting at the Pulse  nightclub in Orlando, Florida; and the Las Vegas, Nevada, shooting.  None of these attacks would have been prevented if H.R. 8 or H.R. 1112  were law.   Then, the attackers in the Columbine High School Colorado shooting  used straw purchasers for their weapons, an act that is already illegal  and has been illegal since at least the 1960s.   Adam Lanza, the attacker in the Sandy Hook Elementary School,  Newtown, Connecticut, shooting used his mother's firearms which were  legally purchased by his mother. So as you can see--and I have each one  of them listed how the attackers got their guns--H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112  would not have prevented any of these shootings.   Not only would none of the mass shootings be prevented by H.R. 8 and  H.R. 1112, but the Department of Justice under President Obama said  that in order for universal background checks to actually work and be  enforceable, a Federal gun registry is needed. Yet this legislation in  H.R. 8 specifically prohibits a registry; thus, again, it is  unenforceable.   The fact is criminals don't get their guns legally and will not go  through a background check to get their guns even if this bill were  signed into law.                                time  1345    A recent Department of Justice report of prison inmates that used  guns in their crimes showed that 56 percent obtained their guns  illegally and another 25 percent received them from family members-- which, by the way, family members are still allowed to get the guns  under this law.   It is obvious, then, that they did not get their guns from a gun show  or private sales, as Mr. Raskin is concerned about.   H.R. 8 will also turn everyday, law-abiding citizens into criminals  if it becomes law.   Let's look at the amendments that were rejected by the Democrats in  the Rules Committee and in the Committee on the Judiciary that offered  to protect law-abiding citizens from becoming criminals.   First, there was an amendment--I thought commonsense--that someone  thinking of committing suicide would be exempted from temporarily  turning over their gun to a friend, and it is not allowed under this  bill. They would become a criminal.   So, somebody who wants to commit suicide could not transfer their gun  to someone else.   If a law-abiding citizen wanted to let someone temporarily use their  gun on their own property, they would become a criminal under this  bill.   If a farmer or rancher wanted to temporarily lend a gun to a ranch  hand for the purposes of ranch activities, the farmer would become a  criminal under this law.   If a domestic violence victim was in fear for her life and wanted to  temporarily borrow a gun from a friend to protect herself, she would  become a criminal under this law.   Let's also look at some commonsense amendments rejected by the  Democrats that would have prevented undue burdens and duplication on  law-abiding citizens who have already passed a background check but now  have to go through another background check under this law.   People who have security clearances. This is the application to get a  government security clearance, page upon page, background check,  extensive background check. Yet, someone who has this and has gone  through this still has to get another background check.   People who have a concealed carry weapon issued by a State, they have  to go through another background check.   People who have already gotten a gun permit from States which require  them; they have to go through another background check.   People who have global entry, who have gone through a background  check, they have got to do it again under this bill.   Even law enforcement officers. Law enforcement officers have to go  through another background check under this bill.   This is placing undue burden on law-abiding citizens.   Now I want to share testimony from a young woman from the Judiciary  Committee. This woman was a victim of rape on her college campus. And  the reason I am bringing it up is because well-meaning gun control laws  actually prevented her from carrying a gun to school because the State  she traveled through did not allow her to carry a gun in order to  defend herself.   This is a clear example of how law-abiding citizens--not criminals,  law-abiding citizens--who follow the law and how this young woman and  others like her were actually harmed by well-intentioned gun control  laws.   As a survivor of domestic violence, I know all too well how hard it  can be to protect oneself or find a lifeline out. My abuser often  controlled all my finances. I wouldn't have been able to pay for a  background check or a gun.   Sometimes getting a gun from a friend could actually be your only  option; yet, unfortunately, under this bill, I tried to offer an  amendment, but it was rejected.   Now let's turn to H.R. 1112, which changes the length of time that a  background check has to be completed from the current 3 days to 10  business days and then another 10 business days for an appeal. So it  could be 20-plus days.   The reason I am bringing this up is I want to tell you a story--a  real story--about Carol Bowne. She was a New Jersey woman who was  stabbed to death while waiting to be approved for her firearm  application.   She already had an order of protection through the courts, but that  wasn't enough. She needed more than just that piece of paper.   H.R. 1112 will make the realities of Carol's story happen across the  country, putting millions of women and law-abiding citizens in danger.  Women who seek avenues of protection will be forced to wait almost a  month--20 days to a month--like Carol. How many women will potentially  suffer like Carol?   H.R. 8 also has other problems.   Unfortunately, the debate in the Judiciary Committee was cut short.  Many commonsense amendments were not even heard. Only 10 amendments out  of 100 were heard before the chairman cut off debate.   Because of the rush to get this bill through, there is another  problem. There is vague language that is not defined and, thus, is open  to interpretation.   I know, in some of the amendments, the majority party has tried to  give an alternative to my good, commonsense domestic violence  amendments, but it doesn't do any good. And this is the reason; it is  because the language is so vague.   It says: Under H.R. 8, a person is allowed to temporarily transfer a  firearm if it is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily  harm.   The question is: There is no definition of this, so how long is a  temporary transfer? Who determines that? Does the victim determine it?   Who determines if there is imminent death? Does it qualify if a  victim of domestic violence thinks they will be killed? Or does the  person transferring the gun have to be in the same room and there be  some kind of shootout and they throw a gun to them?   What do ``imminent danger'' and ``imminent death'' mean?   With something as important as the Second Amendment, I think we owe  it to the American people to do our work and take as long as we have to  in order to have a fair and open debate on major pieces of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, with that, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Hudson), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to address a couple of things that were  said previously.   I had sponsored an amendment, as a survivor of domestic violence, to  allow victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse who have orders of  protection to be able to get transferred a gun if they might be in fear  for their life.   As I have said, often victims of domestic violence don't have the  financial means or they are so restricted by their perpetrator that it  is difficult for them to go out and purchase a gun, let alone get a  background check, and so they might have a friend whom they can borrow  it from.   Now, in response, I think, Mr. Raskin, if I am not mistaken, said  that the Democrats did help domestic violence victims. I just don't  think that their amendment cuts it, and I am going to read the  amendment if this is the one that the gentleman is talking about.   It says: A temporary transfer that is necessary to prevent imminent  death or great bodily harm, if the possession by the transferee lasts  only as long as immediately necessary to prevent the  [[Page H2124]]  imminent death or great bodily harm--and then here is the amendment-- including the harm of domestic violence, dating partner violence,  sexual assault, stalking, and domestic abuse.   I would say just because you add the words ``domestic violence,''  ``victims of domestic abuse'' doesn't mean this is going to help; and  the reason is simply because of what I said before, that these terms in  here are really unclear. I really would like somebody to explain, and  they are not defined anywhere, who determines prevent imminent death or  great bodily harm?   So, let's say I am a victim of domestic violence and I think my  perpetrator is going to kill me. Does imminent death and, in this word,  say, last only as long as immediately necessary to prevent the imminent  death? So does that mean the person who--my friend who can lend me a  gun has to be right there in the same room and see that there is  imminent death coming?   I mean, there is no definition here. So it is unclear to me that this  would help at all.   Also, what is the definition of ``temporary transfer''? How long is  that? How long is temporary transfer? Does that mean, you know, just  enough time you can throw somebody a gun while they are imminently in  death? I mean, do you have to be right there? What does this mean?  There is no definition.   So, if we are going to proceed with this, I think that we should at  least define what these terms mean. Therefore, I really wish that my  amendment that said that victims of domestic violence or sexual abuse  that have an order of protection through the court--through the court-- would be allowed to at least borrow a gun to defend themselves from,  maybe, a friend.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would like to refute some of the things, or talk about some of the  things said by my friends on the other side.   One of the things that I do want to talk about is that Mr. Raskin  said that my amendment is such a narrow exception for domestic violence  victims. I had a broader one in Judiciary Committee, if the gentleman  remembers, and Chairman Nadler told me that it was too broad, that it  was too vague, so that is why I made it very specific.   If the gentleman would like, I will make it broad again.                                time  1415    Also in the Rules Committee, there was another amendment as well, and  we are both on Rules, too, of course.   There was a broader one from Mr. Scalise, who is a victim of gun  violence. He had an amendment that was ruled out of order. That  basically said any victim of domestic violence, which was broad, but  then he had another subsection that said victim of domestic violence or  sexual abuse that has an order of protection. So we covered both, yet  it was ruled out of order. So we really tried.   Now, the other thing that you brought up, that it is very clear what  imminent danger means, and that would cover somebody, and surely a  domestic violence victim would not become a criminal under this law.  Well, I don't think it is very sure.   So I ask Mr. Raskin, my colleague, if he would be open to removing  the word ``imminent'' and just say ``danger,'' instead of ``imminent  danger,'' because to me, ``imminent danger'' means you have to be right  in the same room, you know, and throw somebody a gun or something. I  mean, to me, the word ``imminent'' needs to be removed from the  language.   The other thing I would like to talk about is the number of times now  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said: Oh, so many  people support this universal background check.   Well, I disagree. I disagree, because there is proof right in Maine.  They had a ballot measure, and it was rejected by the majority of the  people.   I suppose it depends on how you ask the question, but I just don't  think that when you get into the details of how it takes away our  fundamental Second Amendment rights and actually burdens law-abiding  citizens and actually may harm people, some of these laws--like was the  case with the young woman who testified in Judiciary who said that  good-intentioned gun laws actually prevented her from defending  herself, and she was raped.   So I would say I have some disagreements with some of your  statements.   I also want to point out that there are many things that we can do on  a bipartisan basis, and this obviously is not bipartisan. I am a co- chairwoman of the Women's Caucus in Congress, and I have talked to my  counterpart, a very nice woman and Congresswoman. We really do want to  work on bipartisan solutions to gun violence. I would say one of those  is let's really concentrate on mental health issues.   Now, we have done some things in the past. We did the Fix NICS Act,  which we passed last year on a bipartisan basis, which really is an  attempt to fix the national background system so that local  jurisdictions actually report when there are problems, which I think is  very valuable.   We also did legislation in a bipartisan manner that would protect our  schools more.   Here is another thing we could do in a bipartisan manner. As you have  noted, 3.5 million people have been stopped by NICS since 1994 from  getting guns, and 112,000 were stopped just last year. But you know  what? Only 12 of those 112,000 were actually prosecuted. Why? I mean,  we have laws on the books now, and we are not even enforcing them. So I  think that is another thing we can do on a bipartisan basis.   Again, this bill, I believe, does more harm than good. I do think my  colleagues are well intentioned. I do believe that all of us, whether  we are Republican or Democrat, want to reduce gun violence.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to make my amendment in order, which would allow  domestic violence and sexual assault victims with orders of protection  to be exempt from the gun transfer prohibitions. This amendment  is crucial to saving lives.    As a survivor of domestic violence, I know what it is like to be in  fear for our lives.   This commonsense amendment is clearcut. If you are a victim with an  order of protection, you can borrow a firearm or transfer a firearm to  you. It is important, because victims don't often have the means to  purchase or go pay for a background check.   The Democrats have presented a letter from the National Task Force to  End Sexual and Domestic Violence as a reason for not needing my  amendment. However, with all due respect, the National Task Force does  not speak for every victim, and they certainly do not speak for me. In  fact, they never even contacted me, and I have been an outspoken person  saying I am a survivor of domestic violence since I ran for Congress. I  am also the person who sponsored the amendment to extend the Violence  Against Women Act, yet they have never talked to me or reached out to  my office.   The majority offered a political amendment on domestic violence,  which I have already talked about, which really does not do any good,  because the definitions of imminent danger are not defined, and it will  not be carried out and will not be effective.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, we all want to solve gun  violence in the United States, but H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112 will not solve  the problem.                                time  1430    As co-chairwoman of the bipartisan Women's Caucus, I am committed to  working across the aisle on solutions we can all agree on. However,  this is not one of them. We can talk about mental health. We can talk  about strengthening the NICS background check system even more. We can  talk about enforcing the laws that are already on the books.   H.R. 8 will turn law-abiding citizens into criminals by making  everyday gun transfers a crime and putting those who seek to protect  themselves in jail for wanting to do so.   H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112 will place an undue burden on citizens who  already have a background check. For instance: security clearance,  global entry, State-issued permits, et cetera.   These pieces of legislation put law-abiding citizens in danger by  disarming them and emboldening criminals. The bad guys never follow the  law. In fact, I believe that this legislation violates the Second  Amendment of the Constitution because it does not prohibit undue fees  for background checks and, thus, some people cannot afford them  [[Page H2127]]  and, thus, not be able to get a gun to defend themselves.   Mr. Speaker, I urge ``no'' on the previous question, ``no'' on the  underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Graves) for yielding.   Today, I have heard a lot of amazing things. My colleague on the  other side of the aisle, Mr. Johnson from Georgia, said, I believe,  caravans trying to cross the border are a figment of our imagination. I  don't know about you, but I think all we need to do is turn on the  news. I have seen thousands of people traipsing thousands of miles to  get into our country. In fact, there has been some violence. So I just  don't understand that statement at all.   And Speaker Pelosi and Chuck Schumer recently said the crisis at the  border is manufactured. I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that I live  in the State of Arizona, a border State, and I have visited the border,  and I have met with the border agents and border officials at the  border.   They have told me, firsthand, there is a crisis at the border. They  have told me, firsthand, when I asked do we need a border fence, they  said, yes, it is part of the solution.   You know, I am here today to ask for reason. The Republican  legislature, the majority last year, tried to pass legislation that  would not only secure the border but, as a compromise, would have given  legal status to the DACA recipients. Not one Democrat voted for it.   Can we please get together and solve this problem?   It is unfortunate that the President had to resort to this because  Congress, the Democrats, would not vote for border security. And so I  support the President in his declaration for emergency. I support him  in protecting our Nation--his number one duty--and I oppose this  resolution.
