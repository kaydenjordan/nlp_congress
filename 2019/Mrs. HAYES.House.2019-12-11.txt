 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Elijah E. Cummings  Lower Drug Costs Now Act, a bill that would take power wielded and  weaponized by massive drug companies and put it back in the hands of  the American people.   It is beyond unacceptable that families in my district and around the  country are price gouged at the pharmacy counter and forced to make the  impossible decision to either pay for their medication or put food on  their table.   H.R. 3 will save my constituents in Connecticut's Fifth suffering  from diseases like diabetes, asthma, and arthritis, hundreds--even  thousands--of dollars per year.                                time  2100    But perhaps the thing I am most proud of in H.R. 3 is that it  includes a bill that I sponsored, the Supporting Trauma-Informed  Education Practices Act. This bill will put drug companies who share  responsibility for the opioid crisis on the hook for part of the  solution.   My bill would direct $100 million of the savings from drug pricing  negotiations to grants that would improve trauma support services and  mental healthcare for children and schools.   As a Member of Congress who has spent a career in the classroom, I  have seen the painful reality of too many schools having too few  counselors and psychologists to tackle the complex needs of students  suffering from abuse, neglect, and trauma.   We need to commit to investing and implementing ongoing supports and  wraparound services for every student who is affected, for every  student who has faced loss or has been separated from their parents as  a result of the opioid crisis.   Drug companies are prioritizing profits over human lives in their  cruel business calculus. Communities like Waterbury, Litchfield, and  New Britain in my district desperately need help to fight this opioid  crisis, which mirrors the crisis that consumers are currently facing  with rising drug costs.   I am proud that this bill also includes legislation I cosponsored  that would lower drug costs for some of the most vulnerable members of  the population.    The bill would also save older adults with limited  incomes money and improve access to their needed medications.   Mr. Chairman, my constituents cannot wait for change. Patients in  rural communities cannot wait for change. The 22,000 Connecticut  residents diagnosed with cancer each year cannot wait for change. The  student in Meriden who has suffered as a victim of the opioid crisis  cannot wait for change.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to recognize that our  constituents need us. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R.  3.  [[Page H10116]]
