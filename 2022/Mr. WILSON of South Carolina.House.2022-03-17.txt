 Madam Speaker, during a Monday address  to the Ukrainian people, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a direct  appeal to soldiers of Russia, asking: ``. . . why should you die?''   Zelensky said: ``We hear what you really think about this senseless  war . . .'' Then telling those who surrender: ``. . . we will treat you  the way people are supposed to be treated'' and ``. . . not how you are  being treated in your army.''   Today, Putin declared war on the Russian people. His call for self- cleansing is a repeat of the murderous Stalinists purges leading to  Soviet Socialist nonpersons who disappeared.   Today, I will be offering legislation for expedited refugee status to  America for defecting members of the Duma, diplomatic personnel, and  Russian Government officials.   This reinforces the bipartisan legislation for Russian military  defectors for expedited refugee status to America. The defectors who  turn over equipment to Ukraine will receive up to $100,000.   I also have a bill in Congress for a bust of President Zelenskyy to  be placed in the U.S. Capitol.   God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine. Long live President Volodymyr  Zelenskyy.                            ____________________
