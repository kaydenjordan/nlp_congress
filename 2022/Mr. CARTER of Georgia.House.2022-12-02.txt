 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Savannah restaurant owner Mary Githens for her placement in Georgia  Trend's annual 40 Under 40 list.   Mary immigrated to the United States when she was 17, and one of the  first objects of her homesickness was the lack of authentic food from  her native Peru.   She took to Georgia Southern University's Armstrong campus and  enrolled in entrepreneurial courses, dead set on fixing Savannah's  apparent lack of Peruvian cuisine herself.   Just a year after she graduated, she put those entrepreneurial skills  to use and opened the first Latin Chicks location in the Oglethorpe  Mall food court in 2009. The restaurant was a huge success and quickly  expanded to a second location.   Today, Mary is the owner and operator of three restaurant  enterprises: Mint to Be Mojitos, which offers Latin-inspired cocktails;  The Apparition, a bar and speakeasy; and, of course, Latin Chicks, the  venture that started it all.   Mary's story exemplifies perfectly what the American Dream is about.  No matter who you are and where you come from, you can achieve great  things with a bold vision and the ambition to achieve it.   I want to commend Mary for her hard-earned success and Georgia Trend  for recognizing her accomplishments.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my  support for H.R. 8876, the Jackie Walorski Maternal and Child Home  Visiting Reauthorization Act of 2022.   This bill is a critical piece of legislation that will help mothers  and children at every stage of life. The maternal, infant, and early  childhood home visiting program reaches new parents and their children  from before birth through kindergarten with in-home support.   In meeting with families in the program, I have seen firsthand how  effective this program is at improving maternal and child health,  family safety and stability, child development, and readiness for  school.   In my home State of Georgia, we have the highest rate of maternal  mortality in the United States. I have worked on this issue since I was  a member of the Georgia State legislature, and it still baffles me why  Georgia has the highest rate.    By passing this bill, not only are we addressing maternal and newborn  health, but we are also furthering the legacy of Representative  Walorski, who dedicated her life to helping others. I can think of no  better tribute to our dear friend, who departed us far too soon.   For these reasons, I look forward to supporting this bill, and I  encourage my colleagues to do the same.
