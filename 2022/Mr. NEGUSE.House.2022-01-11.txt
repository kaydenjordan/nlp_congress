 Madam Speaker, just over a week ago, on December 30, a  devastating disaster hit the Boulder community. Fueled by hurricane- force winds, exacerbated by months of drought and dry conditions, the  Marshall fire spread through the suburban neighborhoods of Louisville  and Superior with a speed and magnitude that we have never witnessed  before.   Over 1,000 homes and businesses destroyed. Over 30,000 individuals  evacuated. Countless families and community members dealing now with  unprecedented loss left only with the clothes on their backs and the  items carried in their departure. One known fatality and still one  member of our community missing. Our hearts ache for every single  person touched by this disaster.  [[Page H32]]  For every first responder and firefighter that worked to keep our  community safe, we owe you a debt of gratitude.   Madam Speaker, finally, I close by saying that I have lived in this  community for many, many years. And we know that even in this  unprecedented and terrible tragedy, that we are strong, that our  community is resilient, and that our community will get through this  together.                            ____________________
