 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, Amendment No. 30 expresses the sense of  Congress that the royalty rate for onshore Federal oil and gas leases  be 12\1/2\ percent. This amendment establishes that it is the sense of  Congress that the royalty rate of onshore Federal oil and gas  [[Page H1663]]  leases be 12\1/2\ percent, the pre-Inflation Reduction Act level. The  so-called Inflation Reduction Act was filled with horrific policy and  has only made things worse.   The Inflation Reduction Act is geared to severely harm American  energy independence by, among other things, increasing royalty rates  and fees while restricting access to energy resources.   Our country needs to produce more energy, not less, but Democrats  designed their extreme climate agenda to restrict oil and natural gas  production.   One measure of the so-called Inflation Reduction Act enabled the  Biden administration to raise the oil and gas royalty rate for certain  offshore leases from the current 12\1/2\ percent to 16.67.   This measure will only result in less oil and gas production, harming  consumers and our national security.   The Biden administration doesn't even pretend otherwise. Interior  Secretary Deb Haaland said, It resets how and what we consider to be  the highest and best use of American resources.   This is about the use of the land, and the Biden administration  clearly wants to block all of our lands from the use for oil and gas  production.   My amendment simply returns onshore royalty rates to what it was 2  years ago, before this radical Democrat intervention.   This amendment would affirm the intent of the underlying bill, which  would reset the royalty rate for onshore leases to 12\1/2\ percent.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0915     Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Mr. Chair, it should be noted that the largest oil profit  was realized by Saudi Arabia.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment provides that any entity  subject to the jurisdiction of the Government of the People's Republic  of China or any entity that is owned by the Government of the People's  Republic of China may not acquire any interest with respect to the land  leased for oil or gas under the Mineral Leasing Act, the Outer  Continental Shelf Lands Act, and may not acquire claims subject to the  General Mining Law of 1872.   We need to secure our land and not make it available for foreign  governments, especially the CCP, the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP  is one of the greatest threats to American democracy and our homeland.   Since at least 2007, the Department of Defense has consistently  recognized China's dominance in the mining of key minerals as a leading  national security threat.   The Biden administration is recklessly pursuing a green agenda that  makes the United States economy more dependent on critical mined  minerals used to make things like batteries.   We cannot continue to allow the genocidal CCP to control that supply  chain. We certainly must ensure that the CCP cannot expand its market  power by controlling mines even in our own country.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of my commonsense amendment for the  sake of our people and our national security, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Westerman and my colleague  across the aisle for their support.   It should be noted that it is the CCP that launched a reconnaissance  balloon across our country. It is the CCP that is flooding our country  with fentanyl and killing our kids and poisoning our country.   I urge adoption of this amendment. Let's send a message to China that  we have had enough.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
