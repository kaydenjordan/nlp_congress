 Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Budget  Committee, I want to take this opportunity to make several points in  opposition to the Republican side-by-side amendment and in support of  the amendment that I have offered.   Like many Republican proposals, if you read the Republican amendment,  it sounds good on the surface, but if you probe half an inch into it,  you recognize what an incredible disaster it will be for working  families of this country--nice words, but devastating impacts. So I  want to talk about that.   No. 2, I want to talk about what it will mean if, in fact, the  Republicans  [[Page S188]]  are successful in doing what they want to do, which is repealing the  Affordable Care Act--something which I, and I think virtually every  Democrat, will do our best to oppose--and what it will mean to the  American people if the Affordable Care Act is repealed without any  alternative to replace it.   What that, in fact, will mean is throwing 30 million people off of  their health insurance. Thirty million people will lose their health  insurance. I have not seen any Republican studies as to how many of  those people will die, but certainly many thousands of them will die  because if you are sick and you don't have any money and you don't have  any health insurance, you cannot get to a doctor or you cannot get to a  hospital. In fact, there have been some studies suggesting that  thousands of people will die, and certainly many others will become  much sicker than they should be. That is what happens when you simply  throw 30 million people off of health insurance and you have no  alternative plan.   Nobody in the Senate thinks the Affordable Care Act is perfect, least  of all me. I think it needs significant changes. Let's work together to  change it. But you cannot just repeal it without any alternative.   Not only will a repeal throw 30 million people off of health  insurance, it will devastate millions and millions of low- and  moderate-income families by making major cuts to Medicaid, and that  includes many middle-class families who use Medicaid to support  payments for their parents who are in nursing homes.   If you repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement, you are  going to significantly increase the cost of prescription drugs for  senior citizens, many of whom have a hard time right now paying for  their medicine. And while you have thrown millions off of health  insurance, while you make devastating cuts to Medicaid, while the  repeal of the Affordable Care Act will raise the cost of prescription  drugs for seniors, a repeal would do something else, which is not  terribly surprising coming from Republicans. It would provide $346  billion in tax breaks to the top 2 percent. Millions lose their health  care, the costs of prescription drugs go up, middle-class families will  not be able to afford nursing home care for their parents, but,  importantly, from the Republican perspective, $346 billion in tax  breaks will go to the top 2 percent.   Now, this is a set of priorities which I, frankly, believe the  American people do not support.   Also this afternoon I want to touch on another issue that is actually  even more important than the previous two, and that is, to my mind, in  a Democratic society, a candidate for President--in this case Mr.  Trump--cannot simply say one thing over and over again, cannot go out  to the American people and make campaign promises, but the day after  the election, forget about what those promises were about.   Now, here is the purpose of the Republican amendment. This is what is  in front of all of us right now.         Purpose: To strengthen Social Security and Medicare without       raiding it to pay for new Government programs, like       ObamaCare, that have failed Americans by increasing premiums       and reducing affordable health care options, to reform       Medicaid without prioritizing able-bodied adults over the       disabled, and to return regulation of insurance to State       governments.    That is the exact quote of the purpose of the Republican amendment  that we will be voting on in a few moments. It sounds pretty good. But  let us translate it into English, and let us be very clear about what  these words actually mean and why this amendment should be opposed by  every Member of the U.S. Senate.   The Republicans say in their purpose that they want to ``strengthen  Social Security and Medicare.'' Well, count me in. That is exactly what  I want to do. But how do they propose to go about doing that? They are  going to strengthen Social Security and Medicare by making devastating  cuts to Social Security and Medicare. That is a strange way to  strengthen a program.   As we speak right now, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and  Means Subcommittee on Social Security--the committee that has  jurisdiction over Social Security--has introduced legislation which  will make devastating cuts to Social Security. That is a very unusual  way to strengthen that program.   My Republican friends will tell us that the only way we can  ``strengthen Social Security'' is, in fact, to cut Social Security.  Now, talk about fake news; talk about Orwellian language. We are  strengthening Social Security by cutting Social Security. To all those  seniors and disabled veterans who are out there and who are trying to  get by on $13,000, $14,000, $15,000 a year in Social Security benefits,  my Republican colleagues are going to ``strengthen'' Social Security  and they are going to do it by cutting your benefits. That is a very  strange way to strengthen Social Security.   It seems to me that if we are serious about really strengthening  Social Security, what that means in plain English--not Orwellian  language--is, No. 1, if you want to strengthen it, we have to extend  the life of Social Security. Social Security now can pay out every  benefit owed to every eligible American for 17 years. That is OK. It  means we are not in a crisis, but it is not good enough. I want to see  Social Security be solvent for another 50 or 60 years. That is  strengthening Social Security.   When we talk about strengthening Social Security, that means  increasing benefits, not cutting benefits. The truth is that seniors in  this country cannot make it on $13,000 or $14,000 a year in Social  Security benefits; we need to increase and expand their benefits.   Thirdly, if we are serious about strengthening Social Security, we  need to end the absurdity of seniors who this year got a COLA of three- tenths of 1 percent, and in recent years have gotten COLAs of zero  percent because the formula that determines COLAs for people on Social  Security is totally inadequate and an incorrect formula, not really  measuring the cost-of-living expenditures of senior citizens.   That is what we have to do to strengthen Social Security.   How do we do that? I have legislation that will do just that. But do  my colleagues know what? Despite all of the talk of my Republican  colleagues wanting to strengthen Social Security, we have zero  Republican cosponsors on that idea.   The way we do it--a concept supported by many of the major senior  organizations in this country--would eliminate the earnings cap on all  taxable income above $250,000. Right now, if you make $1 million a  year, $10 million a year, you contribute the same amount into the  Social Security trust fund as somebody who makes about $118,000. That  is wrong. That is unfair. Lifting that cap, starting at $250,000 and  above, would impact only the top 1.5 percent. If we do that, we can  extend the life of Social Security for well over 50 years and we could  expand benefits for people living on less than $16,000 a year by more  than $1,300 a year. That is how we strengthen Social Security. But I  have not heard one Republican in this body speak in support of that  proposal.   Now, Republicans say they want to strengthen Medicare without raiding  it to pay for new government programs like ObamaCare. That is what they  state in their purpose. So let me be absolutely clear. That is a  totally false statement. It is not true. The so-called raid was an  effort to save some $700 billion over a 10-year period by making  Medicare more efficient and more cost effective.   My Republican friends talk every day about the need to bring  increased efficiencies into government programs. They are right. We  need to do that. And that is precisely what the Obama administration  did. My Republican friends will not get up here and tell us that there  was one nickel of Medicare benefits cut as a result of the creation of  the Affordable Care Act. There was not one nickel of benefits cut. They  know it. I know it. They will not say otherwise.   So the $700 billion was in savings, doing the right thing--not  cutting a nickel of benefits from Medicare. I hope my Republican  colleagues will not continue to try to spread this mistruth.   The Republican amendment that we are going to be voting on talks  about reforming Medicaid without prioritizing able-bodied adults over  the disabled. It sounds good. What are they talking about in real  English? What they want to do is ``reform'' Medicaid without  prioritizing able-bodied adults over the disabled. What does that  [[Page S189]]  mean? It means not only do they not want to see Medicaid expanded, as  over 30 States have done, what they want to do, and what this language  is really about, is to throw millions of people off of Medicaid. We are  the only major country on Earth that does not guarantee health care to  all people. Some 28 million Americans today have no health insurance.  They want to throw millions more off health insurance.    So if you are an ``able-bodied'' adult making the Federal minimum  wage of $7.25 an hour--which, by the way, they don't want to raise.  Vermont has raised its minimum wage to $10 an hour. I don't know what  it is in Wyoming--$7.25. But if you are in a State where minimum wage  is still $7.25 and you are able-bodied, do the arithmetic. If you have  a couple of kids, health insurance will cost you $10,000, $15,000 a  year. How do you afford that when you are making $8, $9, $10 an hour?  You don't afford it. That is able-bodied.   The last I heard, it is not criminal activity to be working and  making $8, $9, $10 an hour. Unfortunately, that is what millions of  people do. They cannot afford health insurance. What many of us have  tried to do is expand Medicaid so that they will get health insurance,  but what the Republican proposal and their language is about is the  denying health insurance for the so-called able-bodied. Let's get rid  of the word ``able-bodied.'' Let's talk about working people at  starvation wages who cannot afford health insurance. That is what that  language means in English.   The Republican's proposal we will be voting on also talks about  ``returning regulation of insurance to State governments.'' OK. It  sounds good. What does that mean in the real world? That means you  could be denied coverage for a preexisting condition.   I just met a woman last night dying of breast cancer. That is her  reality, but she was able to get health insurance, despite having a  very severe situation, because we abolished the insurance companies'  ability to say no to her and to millions of other people who have  preexisting conditions.   When you want to return regulation of insurance to State governments,  that is precisely what they can do--the law is gone. The insurance  companies can say: You have cancer; we are not going to cover you  because you are going to cost us too much money, and we can't make any  money from you. Insurance companies could refuse to cover needed things  like maternity care, prescription drugs, or high-cost diseases like HIV  and many others. That is what they mean when they talk about returning  regulation of insurance to State governments, doing away with all of  the patient protection we have passed here in Washington that is widely  supported by the American people. Go out to Wyoming, go to Vermont, go  to Oregon, go to any State and ask the people if we should repeal  preexisting conditions so insurance companies can discriminate against  people with illness, and they will tell you overwhelmingly no.   So the Republican proposal, which sounds nice, is in fact a  devastating amendment that would very negatively impact many millions  of people. I hope every Member of the Senate will reject that  Republican amendment and in fact vote for an amendment I will be  offering which addresses two very important issues:   No. 1, at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, at a time  when a tiny sliver of our population--the people on top--are getting  phenomenally wealthy, phenomenally richer, we have an explosion of  billionaires in recent years while the middle class continues to  shrink. At a time when we are the only major country on Earth not to  guarantee health care as a right to all of our people, it would be  absolutely unacceptable to take away health insurance from 30 million  Americans, unacceptable to privatize Medicare, unacceptable to slash  Medicaid, unacceptable to increase the costs of prescription drugs for  seniors, unacceptable to defund Planned Parenthood--a high-quality  health care organization providing health care to over 2 million  Americans, many of whom are low income women. So a vote for the Sanders  amendment rejects all of those very bad ideas.   If we throw 30 million people off health insurance and if we do not  have a plan to replace it, I would hope my Republican colleagues would  have the decency to tell us how many of those 30 million people will  die. If we are going to be considering this legislation and throwing 30  million people off who can no longer get to a doctor, can no longer get  to the hospital because they don't have the money, how many of them  will die? Tell us. Tell us so we can hold that in consideration as we  look at this proposal.   For years, it is no secret Republican leaders like Paul Ryan and  Congressman Tom Price have wanted to end Medicare as we know it. That  is what they have told us. It is not what I am saying. It is not a  great secret.   What does that mean? What does it mean if we end Medicare as we know  it and if we turn it into a voucher program, handing a 65-year-old  senior who has been diagnosed with cancer an $8,000 check and telling  them to go out to a private insurance company and buy insurance on  their own. That is what privatizing Medicare is about. It is a voucher  program. Here is a check. You go out to the private insurance  companies. You do your best.   If you are an 80-year-old suffering with cancer and you have a check  for whatever it may be--$8,000, $9,000 a year--and you go to an  insurance company and you say: What do I get for my $8,000 check, they  will laugh at you. They will laugh at you because they understand the  cost of your care--your hospital care, your prescription drugs--will go  well beyond 8,000 in the first week, let alone year. You will get  nothing. That is what the Republican idea is in terms of privatizing  Medicare.   Let me get to the last point I want to make, and that gets well  beyond the Affordable Care Act and well beyond Medicaid, Medicare, and  Social Security. It gets to the essence of what our political system is  supposed to be about, and that is, if we run for office--and every  person in the Senate has run for office. If you run for President, you  cannot say over and over again that you are going to do this, and the  day after the election decide you are not going to do it. That is why  so many people in this country are disgusted with the political  process. They see people saying: Hey, vote for me. I am going to do A,  B, and C, and the day after the election you do the very opposite, D,  E, and F.   When he ran for President, Donald Trump ran a very unconventional  campaign. That is for sure. He said: I am not a typical Republican.  That is what he said. He said: If I am elected President, I, Donald  Trump, am not going to cut Social Security, I am not going to cut  Medicare, and I am not going to cut Medicaid. He didn't say that once.  He wasn't caught in an ambush interview. That was the heart and soul of  his campaign. That is what he said to the elderly and to working-class  Americans, and many voted for him precisely because he said he would  not cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.   On May 7, 2015, Mr. Trump tweeted: ``I was the first and only  potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social  Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.''   April 18, 2015, Trump said:         Every Republican wants to do a big number on Social       Security. They want to do it on Medicare, they want to do it       on Medicaid, and we can't do it. And it's not fair to the       people that have been paying in for years. Now, all of a       sudden they want to cut it.    August 10, 2015, Trump said:         I will save Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security without       cuts.    Without cuts.         We have to do it. People have been paying in for years and       now many of these candidates want to cut it.    March 29, 2016, Trump said:         You know, Paul [Ryan]--    Paul Ryan is, as we all know, the Speaker of the House--       wants to knock out Social Security, knock it way down. . . .       . He wants to knock Medicare way down.    Two things. You will lose the election if you are going to do that. I  am not going to cut it, and I am not going to raise ages, and I am not  going to do all the things that they want to do. Welcome to ``they.''  That is what the Republicans are trying to do.   Back to the quote:         But they want to really cut it, and they want to cut it       very substantially--the Republicans--and I am not going to do       that.    That is where we are today. Republicans have a proposal which will  make  [[Page S190]]  devastating cuts to Social Security over in the House, and here by  repealing the Affordable Care Act, they are going to cut Medicare and  Medicaid.   In December of 2011, Trump wrote:         Now, I know there are some Republicans who would be just       fine with allowing Social Security and Medicare to wither and       die on the vine. The way they see it, Social Security and       Medicaid are wasteful entitlement programs. But people who       think this way need to rethink their position. It's not       unreasonable for people who paid in to a system for decades       to expect to get their money's worth. That's not an       entitlement. That's honoring a deal. We as a society must       also make an ironclad commitment to providing a safety net       for those who can't make one for themselves.    On May 21, 2015, Trump tweeted:         I am going to save Social Security without any cuts. I know       where to get the money from. Nobody else does.    On and on and on. These are just some of the quotes. This is not like  a statement in the middle of the night. This is what he campaigned on.   What this amendment is about and says to my Democratic colleagues and  says to my Republican colleagues is, do we hold and support the process  in which a candidate runs for office and over and over and over again  tells working families and the elderly he will not cut Social Security,  Medicare, or Medicaid--do we hold him to his word or do we just say:  Hey, that is just campaign rhetoric. He lied. That is OK. That is  politics in America. It doesn't matter what he said. This is the  reality. We are going to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.   So this amendment tells us that if we go forward with what the  Republicans want to do, it will be devastating to the American people,  but perhaps, more importantly, what this amendment says is that in a  democratic society, we must have faith with the American people. You  cannot run a campaign, make promises, and the day after forget about  everything you said.   I would hope very much that my Republican colleagues will join all of  us on this side in supporting what democracy is supposed to be about.  We have differences of opinions. Mr. Enzi and I disagree on a lot of  things, but I have never suggested that Mr. Enzi--when he campaigns, I  believe he says what he believes. People vote for him or they vote  against him. It is called democracy. Now you have a situation where a  candidate for President goes to the working class and says: I will not  cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Let us tell Mr. Trump: Let  us keep faith with the American people. We heard what you said, and we  are going to hold you to your word. Let us support the Sanders  amendment.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, when my friend Senator Flake talks about  reforming Social Security, what he is talking about is cutting Social  Security. He is suggesting that is the only way we can save Social  Security. Of course, that is nonsense. I would urge my good friend from  Arizona to get on board legislation that I will be offering. Do you  know what it does? It extends the life of Social Security for 55  [[Page S191]]  years and expands benefits, and it does that by lifting the cap so that  billionaires contribute more into the Social Security trust fund.   To suggest that nobody on this side wants to do anything is  inaccurate. We do want to do something. We want to raise benefits and  extend the life of Social Security. And, yes, some campaign donors-- billionaires--may have to pay more in taxes.   I urge my colleagues to reject the Flake amendment and support the  Sanders amendment.   Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment,  No. 52, is not germane to the underlying resolution and therefore  violates section 305(b)2 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.    Mr. President, this amendment does two basic things. No.  1, it says that the Senate should not go on record in throwing 30  million people off of health insurance, raising the cost of  prescriptions drugs for seniors, and privatizing Medicare.   But it also does something else maybe even more important. It says  that we should support President-Elect Trump when he campaigned  throughout this country saying that I, Donald Trump, will not cut  Social Security, will not cut Medicare, will not cut Medicaid. Let's  tell the American people that we think that when a candidate for  President says something over and over and over, when he promises the  working people and the elderly that he will not cut Social Security,  Medicare, and Medicaid, we stand with him and we are going to support  him and make sure that there are no cuts to Social Security, Medicare,  and Medicaid.   Thank you.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive all applicable  sections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask  for the yeas and nays.
