 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the extremists in this  Chamber to stop playing political chess with the lives of working  people and families.   In 2021, 85 percent of Americans over the age of 50 opposed cuts to  Social Security and Medicare to reduce the national debt.   Clearly, the economic scheme proposed by the GOP is in direct  opposition to the people's will: slashing Social Security and Medicare  for the working class while giving tax breaks to the wealthy.   The GOP scheme also proposes a ridiculous 30 percent--yes, 30  percent--national sales tax, a huge setback for working families,  increasing the cost of everyday essentials and raising gas prices.   As if that wasn't enough, this scheme is holding the reputation of  our Nation hostage to extremist demands for cuts to Social Security and  Medicare.   Democrats stand with the people. Dismantling Medicare and Social  Security will never be up for debate.                            ____________________
