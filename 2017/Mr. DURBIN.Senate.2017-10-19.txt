I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr.  Menendez) is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, Wade Nelson was a friend who began his  professional life as a journalist and served at many levels in public  service.   He was regarded as an honest professional in all of his life's work,  a father and husband truly dedicated to his family, and a joy to count  as a friend.   His colleague and friend, Bob Secter, wrote a remembrance, which I  include with this statement. It was given to those of us in attendance  at Wade's memorial service at the Unity Temple in Oak Park, IL, on  October 7, 2017. The speakers at the service included his wife, Ellen  Warren, a respected journalist in her own right, and his sons, Ted and  Emmett. They each shared touching stories of Wade as a husband and  father. Rick Kogan emceed the celebration with his own signature style  and Wade's friends Bern Colleran, Terry Kelleher, Hanke Gratteau, and  musician Jon Webber each added great memories to the service.   As Bob Secter wrote:         Back in the rambunctious days of Chicago newspapers, Wade       Nelson worked for the legendary columnist Mike Royko who sent       his ``legman'' to check out a tip that Cook County judges       were issued cushier toilet paper than that stocked in public       restrooms.        The easy part for Nelson was grabbing samples from public       toilets in the Loop courthouse, now known as the Daley       Center. Obtaining tissue from a judge's inner sanctum was       trickier.        So, Nelson made up a pretense to interview Chief Judge John       Boyle, then excused himself mid-talk to use the toilet       attached to the judge's chambers. He emerged to confront the       startled judge with the incriminating evidence, and a great       column was born.        Charmin-gate was hardly the highlight of Nelson's days as a       reporter. Yet it demonstrated the resourcefulness, spunk, and       droll whimsy that propelled him on a rich career path       involving being press secretary for the late U.S. Senator       Alan Dixon of Illinois, communications director for the       federal military base closure commission, political       consultant, and chief speech writer for former Chicago Mayor       Richard M. Daley.        That resume hardly defines the sum of Nelson, however.       Friends remember him as someone with boundless curiosity and       a walking encyclopedia of knowledge about interests as varied       as Midwestern architecture, jazz, the Cubs, anything Chicago       related, the minutia of the small Southern Michigan town of       Sturgis where his ancestors were early settlers in the 1800s,       and the secret to the perfect martini.        Edward Wade Nelson Jr. grew up in west suburban River       Forest, attended Fenwick High School in Oak Park and the       University of Missouri where he graduated with a degree in       journalism.        As a young adult and beyond, his greatest devotion was       reserved for performers at Chicago's varied night club,       cabaret and piano bar scene where men and women who played       and sang there came to embrace Nelson as an honored guest and       friend. He became an audience fixture at venues, most now       long gone, like The Acorn on Oak, Toulouse, The London House,       the Green Mill, and Yvette. Nelson even came to name his       family pets after 20th Century jazz legends.        As Nelson climbed the rungs of journalism jobs, from City       News to the suburban Wilmette Life and then the Chicago Daily       News, his career tracked closely with another young reporter,       Ellen Warren, who later became a White House correspondent       for the old Knight-Ridder news service and then a columnist       for the Chicago Tribune. They eventually married and had two       sons.        Nelson moved back to River Forest, but he rejoined Dixon in       the mid-1990s when the former senator chaired a politically       sensitive federal commission charged with recommending the       closure of surplus military bases across the country.        In subsequent years, Nelson served as a spokesman for then-      Cook County Circuit Court Clerk Aurelia Pucinski, now an       appellate court judge, and the Illinois State Board of       Education and became a program officer and grant manager at       the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, a Michigan-based non-profit       specializing in education grants. Wedged in between these       jobs was a multiyear stint as the chief speechwriter for       Richard Daley, a difficult task making Chicago's notoriously       ineloquent mayor sound eloquent.    Wade is survived by his wife and sons, Ted--and his wife, Sarah--and  Emmett of Chicago; a sister, Karen Nelson of Chicago; and a brother,  Ted--and his wife, Terry--of Spicewood, TX.                            ____________________     Mr. President, earlier this month, Elaine Nekritz retired  after more than 14 years of service representing the 57th District in  the Illinois House of Representatives. Along with being a good friend  and dedicated public servant, Elaine was a real leader for her  constituents in Northbrook, Arlington Heights, Wheeling, Buffalo Grove,  and across her district.   Elaine's legacy in Illinois will always be visible as people travel  on high-speed rail from Chicago to St. Louis and throughout the State.  As the chair of the Illinois House Railroad Industry Committee, Elaine  was a leader in advocating for high-speed rail before it was popular.   During her service in the State House, Elaine championed women's  [[Page S6636]]  rights, the environment, and criminal justice reform as well. Because  of Elaine's efforts, kids who have had run-ins with the law have a  better shot at staying out of adult courts and avoiding getting caught  in an endless criminal cycle.   Elaine was always willing to listen to colleagues and friends on both  sides of the aisle, even when partnership was challenging. She helped  craft bold legislation to rescue Illinois from its dire economic  circumstances. As house assistant majority leader, she was a leader in  working to reform pensions in our State. Fiscal responsibility was  always her core value.   The people of the 57th District were lucky to have such a strong  advocate. Her energy, creativity, and thoughtfulness will be missed.   I thank her for her service to Illinois and her friendship. I wish  her the best of luck in her next adventures and salute her husband,  Barry, for his strong partnership with his talented spouse.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
