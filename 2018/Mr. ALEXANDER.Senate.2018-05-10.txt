 Mr. President, I ask that my remarks to the  International Franchise Association be printed in the Record.   The material follows:                    International Franchise Association          What I have discovered is that those who       like a center-right administration, which I do, have a hard       time accepting success. I could probably do the       accomplishments and achievements over the last 15 or 16       months in a 60 second version, which would be a better       economy, lower taxes, fewer regulations, more conservative       judges, repeal of the part of Dodd Frank that hamstrung small       financial institutions in mortgage lending, Alaskan energy, a       new NLRB, the local control of schools--that actually       happened before President Trump came in because of a       Republican majority in the Senate--and the repeal of the       individual mandate. That's a pretty good list. In fact, if       you only did economy, taxes, regulations and judges, at the       end of four years, most administrations would be pretty happy       with the  [[Page S2615]]       different direction. So if you cut through all the tweets and       the chaos and confusion and the noise and the cable       television in Washington, D.C. and look at the direction of       the country, I think it's significantly different.        I'll give a couple of examples of that: rolling back       regulations--only once before this administration and this       Republican majority in Congress, we've used a provision in       the law that allows us to overturn a regulation with 51       votes. We've done it 15 times in the last 15 months,       including the blacklisting rule, including the OSHA record       keeping rule. Most of you know about all these things in       detail so I won't go into detail, but those are important.       They're unusual and they're a completely different direction.        We passed the first major tax reform for 31 years. In       Tennessee, I hear a lot about that, not just from individuals       whose taxes are lower but I hear it from corporations who are       now paying 21 percent on their income tax. But I'm hearing       especially about being able to deduct capital investments in       the first year, and I think we can see the results in the       economy.        We have been able to confirm experienced and qualified       nominees in a whole range of areas and I would suggest that       in no area has the shift in policy been more marked than in       the Labor area. For example, there's a new labor secretary,       Acosta. A new deputy labor secretary, Pizzella. There's a new       NLRB chairman Ring, NLRB member Kaplan, NLRB member Emanuel,       NLRB general counsel. Those are big changes in the policy       direction of this country. Then we've been examining, or       these new appointees have been examining policies that are       harmful that you work on a regular basis. Let's start with       joint employer guidance. At least Secretary Acosta was able       to pull back that guidance as it bled over from the NLRB to       the department.        The problem with the joint-employer decision for me is that       we live in a time when it's harder to find a good middle       class job close to home. People are always flying here,       flying there in what I would call the Internet economy. The       hundreds of thousands of franchisees we have in America are       an opportunity for mom or mom and dad or a family to work 12       hours a day, work several days a week, build their own       business in their own home, contribute to their own community       and be a part of the American middle class. And the joint       employer decision during the last administration was a direct       assault on that route for the middle class. And I'm glad to       see this administration heading in a different direction on       that as well as the Micro Union decision, as well as       beginning to review the Ambush Election Rule.        These are all major, major decisions. Where are we likely       to go on joint employer? Well, the House has done its job,       but in the Senate to get legislative results, you need 60       votes, and that's going to be hard to do--impossible to do--      without Democratic support. We don't have any Democratic       support in the Senate right now. Your association has been       working hard to try and develop that. I hear Democrats       privately talking about it, but when it comes to co-sponsor a       bill or vote for a bill, they don't want to do that. So I       think I would suggest to keep pushing, but a more likely       solution is when the NLRB revisits the rule, because that's       after all how it was changed in the first place, and by a new       administration with new appointees from a center-right       administration and a center-right Senate that keeps things       headed in that direction.        Last thing I want to mention to you has to do with what I       believe is a prominent Labor Department proposed rule       involving health insurance called association health plans. I       worked for the last seven months to try to at least       temporarily fix the individual market. President Trump asked       me to do it. He did a very good job of working with us. In       the end, we had a proposal which he called Senator McConnell       and Speaker Ryan and asked him to put it in the omnibus       spending bill a month ago. They agreed to do it but the       Democrats blocked it because Democrats didn't want to vote       for the so called Hyde compromise language that they'd been       voting for on elective abortion since 1976 and that they       voted for in a hundred other provisions in the same bill. The       shame of that is that we have millions of Americans who don't       get any government subsidy. A contractor, for example, may be       earning $60,000 and paying 15 or $20,000 for their insurance.        We had a proposal and Oliver Wyman--the experts in health       consulting--said over these next three years would reduce       those premiums up to 40 percent. If you're paying $20,000 for       your health insurance and you get an $8,000 reduction, those       are real bucks. So we have to turn to the administration to       get changes in the Affordable Care Act. One of the most       promising potential administrative changes is Secretary       Acosta's proposed rule, and I hope you've followed it. It       basically would allow uninsured people who are self-employed       and more small business people to enjoy some of the same       health insurance benefits that people who work for large       companies do. Most Americans get a subsidy of some sort from       the government for their health insurance. More than half of       Americans get their insurance on the job, they get in effect       about a $5,000 subsidy because of the way the tax code       interacts with the employer deductions and the income that       goes to the employee on large group insurance. So, if you're       a small business person, you get the same kind of insurance       that somebody who works for IBM might have.        It would be cheaper. I just mentioned the amount of the       deduction, and it wouldn't have the same protections that the       large group plans have where you couldn't be charged because       of a pre-existing condition, you couldn't be denied insurance       or be denied coverage. You'd have to have coverage offered       for your kids up to the age 26. You couldn't have lifetime       limits and you would have of course, the lower costs. That       could affect 9,000,000 Americans like the contractor I       described who are getting hammered by Obamacare because they       get no subsidies when they buy their insurance, and could       affect the 11,000,000 other people who are self-employed or       work for small businesses that don't provide health       insurance. So that rule is not yet final. It's been published       by the Department of Labor for everybody to consider.        I expect it to soon become final. And I expect that when it       is, it's likely to be the single greatest development in the       near term for individuals who are either uninsured or who       worked for small businesses and who can't afford the       insurance that is offered. So thanks for all that you do.       We'll keep our eye on joint employer. At the very least, our       committee can continue to focus on it. My hope is that the       NLRB revisits the issue soon.        And I hope you remember when you think about this       administration and you look through the chaos and the tweets       and all that goes on here, that if you stripped that all       away, there's a picture of a country heading in a       significantly different direction with a better economy,       lower taxes, fewer regulations, more conservative judges, a       repeal of a significant part of Dodd Frank, an energy bill in       Alaska that we've been trying for 40 years to do, a different       NLRB, more local control of schools and a repeal the       individual mandate.        In a big democratic, messy government, that's a significant       shift of direction. I hope we can add joint employer to it       before very long.                            ____________________
