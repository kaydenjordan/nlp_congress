 Mr. President, today I recognize the hard work of  my Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee law clerk Mike  Munoz. Mike hails from Avon, CT, and will soon graduate from Georgetown  University Law Center. As a law clerk on the Commerce Committee, Mike  assisted the Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data  Security Subcommittee. He is a dedicated worker who has been committed  to getting the most out of his clerkship. I extend my sincere thanks  and appreciation to Mike for all of the fine work he did for the  committee and wish him continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________
