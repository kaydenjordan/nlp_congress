 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 7624, the Spectrum Innovation Act, led by Chairman Doyle and  Republican leader Latta.   The Spectrum Innovation Act preserves United States leadership in  wireless technology and ensures Americans stay connected. Through this  legislation, Congress is taking steps to protect national security,  improve our public safety communications, and continue to push the  administration to manage our Nation's airways more effectively.   The Energy and Commerce Committee is leading on finding bipartisan  solutions to ensure America leads a new era of innovation and  entrepreneurship. Today's legislation is a result of that bipartisan  work.   The Spectrum Innovation Act extends the Federal Communications  Commission's authority to conduct spectrum auctions by 18 months.  Without congressional action, the FCC's authority to issue spectrum  licenses expires on September 30.                                time  1600    With the upcoming 2.5 gigahertz auction, Congress must act now to  make sure that spectrum can be used to provide faster mobile  connectivity across  [[Page H7112]]  the United States. For the American people, it will mean faster  internet, better connectivity, and stronger cell service.   In order to fully utilize our communications network, we must make  sure that they are secure. In 2020, Congress passed the Secure and  Trusted Communications Network Act to ensure communications networks in  the United States were secure. This provided funds to carriers that  contained dangerous equipment in their networks like Huawei and ZTE, so  that these carriers could maintain service while replacing that  communications equipment with secure components.   Earlier this year, the FCC determined that they needed more money to  secure our networks. This legislation addresses that shortfall.   If we fail to act, dangerous equipment from CCP-connected companies  could remain in our communications networks indefinitely. This is a  serious national security threat that must be addressed as quickly as  possible.   The Spectrum Innovation Act also includes legislation sponsored by my  colleague from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) to establish an incumbent  informing capability at the National Telecommunications and Information  Administration. His legislation, the SMART Spectrum Act, will provide  NTIA another tool to better manage Federal spectrum use and help us win  the future by making more spectrum available for commercial use as the  demand and uses for wireless technology grows.   Finally, the Spectrum Innovation Act would facilitate a nationwide  transition to next generation 911. This legislation will help bring 911  fully into the 21st century by considerably improving the public's  ability to contact and share information with first responders during  emergencies.   It will also enable our first responders to respond to emergencies  more safely by providing them with additional information-gathering  tools to help strengthen their response when they arrive at the scene.   I thank Mr. Hudson and Ms. Eshoo for their years of hard work to put  together comprehensive legislation to upgrade our Nation's aging 911  infrastructure.   This bill advances innovation, improves public safety, and  strengthens America's economic leadership all while remaining budget  neutral and costing the American taxpayers nothing by using the  proceeds from future spectrum auctions to fund these important  priorities.   I thank Chairman Pallone, Chairman Doyle, and Ranking Member Latta  for working with me and for all of us to come together on a bipartisan  agreement.   This legislation is currently the only proposal moving through  Congress to address these challenges, and there are imminent  consequences to our national and economic security if Congress fails to  act.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to see the House lead and take up the  Spectrum Innovation Act with bipartisan support, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes.''    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 4551, the RANSOMWARE Act.   Every sector of our economy can be targeted by bad actors seeking to  exploit vulnerabilities in software and networks. Last year, we saw a  significant increase in ransomware attacks from groups operating out of  and affiliated with foreign countries like China and Russia.   This legislation builds on my SAFE WEB Extension Act, which was  enacted last Congress, and amends it to include ransomware in its  international reporting and cooperation. This will help protect  Americans from ransomware and other cyberattacks from foreign actors.   Just a few months ago, the U.S. learned that hackers for the Chinese  Communist Party had breached major telecommunications companies and  network service providers to steal credentials and harvest data. What  the CCP will do with this information, no one knows. If their intent is  ransom or to use it to extort Americans, this bill will help us better  understand and combat these attacks.   We will achieve this by requiring the FTC to report on cross-border  complaints involving ransomware, or other cybersecurity-related  incidents, committed by foreign adversaries. This will help safeguard  critical industries from countries like China, Russia, North Korea,  Iran, and others that may wish to harm us.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Consumer Protection and Commerce (Mr. Bilirakis) for his work on H.R.  4551, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.
