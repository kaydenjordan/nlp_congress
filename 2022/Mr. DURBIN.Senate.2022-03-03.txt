 Mr. President, on Tuesday evening, President Biden  delivered his first State of the Union Message to Congress and to the  American people. His remarks were timely, strong, and statesmanlike.   He touched on many topics. I think his message really boiled down to  two profound questions: How do we protect democracy in other nations,  particularly in Ukraine, which is now entering the second week of a  horrific and unprovoked invasion by Russian forces; and then he asked,  how can we protect and preserve democracy here in America?   Dictators like Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping want the world to  believe that democracy is nothing more than chaos and gridlock. The  people of Ukraine are showing the world just how wrong these despots  are.   I speak to you today from the comfort and safety of the Senate  Chamber in the United States of America, in Washington, DC, on a  beautiful springlike day. But I have to reflect for a moment on what  life must be like at this very moment in Kyiv, in Ukraine, and what it  must be like in Lviv; two cities in Ukraine that I visited where bombs  are raining down on innocent people--children, women, and men who are  losing their lives because Vladimir Putin believes that he can restore  the Soviet Union to its borders.   We have all seen the video of the Ukrainian grandmother, armed with  nothing more than sunflower seeds and courage, confronting Russian  soldiers.   We have seen ordinary Ukrainian men and women and teenagers taking up  arms, making Molotov cocktails, building barricades, taking down  highway and road signs to confuse the invading Russians--even laying  down their lives to stop Russian tanks and convoys.   In the back of my mind, I am sure I am thinking what many Americans  are thinking: Could I do the same thing? Could I bring together the  courage at this moment to stand up and fight if my home is at stake, if  my family is at stake, if my country is at stake?   The Ukrainians are answering that message every minute of every day.  Their courage and unity in the face of this Russian barbarity is  inspiring the world.   For months, President Biden, Secretary of State Tony Blinken, and  others in the Biden administration have worked behind the scenes to  revitalize the NATO alliance. That critical alliance emerged after the  last great land war in Europe in 1945 from the allies who came out of  it and said: Never again. We will stand together to stop any invader  against the NATO coalition, the NATO alliance.   The Biden administration has worked behind the scenes to remind this  alliance that there comes a moment when you have to bring to this  alliance the courage and direction to stand for the kind of democracy  which we are all committed to.   Two years ago, we had a President who took Putin's word over the  assessment of America's own intelligence Agencies and said he  threatened to pull the United States participation out of NATO. Today,  we have a President who actually shared U.S. intelligence with our  allies to show Putin for the liar that he was from the very start.   NATO is more unified today--thank you, Vladimir Putin, for that--than  it has ever been since the Cold War or the end of World War II. In  fact, nations that are not formally part of NATO--Sweden and Finland,  for example--have stepped up, in concert with the NATO alliance, to  stand our ground and protest what is happening in Ukraine and to  protect Europe--even Switzerland. Switzerland, which is famously  neutral in all major conflicts, has come out of its neutrality and made  it clear that they, too, stand against the Putin invasion.   In his State of the Union Address, President Biden urged Congress to  approve billions of dollars in emergency military and humanitarian  assistance for Ukraine. Sign me up. I will vote for that in a second,  and I hope it comes soon. We need to agree on an aid package without  delay and get it to the President as quickly as possible, not just for  the humanitarian purpose but for the purpose of showing American unity  with the resistance in Ukraine.   Ukrainian ordinary citizens are dying today because of Vladimir Putin  and the bombs and missiles he is launching. As in every war, innocent  Ukrainians will soon be facing greater suffering, greater hunger--even  starvation. In the year 2022, is it imaginable that this is happening  in Europe? We must rally the world to support those still in the  Ukraine, assist our allies in neighboring nations who are housing and  feeding neighboring Ukrainians who have fled their homeland. They  estimate 800,000 to a million Ukrainians have left the country to find  safety nearby.   Once again, let me thank the people of Poland. They have been opening  their doors to the people of Ukraine for many years, and now, they are  being called on in an extraordinary way to harbor these refugees and to  take care of them at this moment of need. They are fleeing Putin's war,  and their numbers are growing dramatically. Some have suggested that a  humanitarian airlift is a possibility. I don't want to rule that out.  Let's explore that and see whether that is the best way to provide  relief to those still in Ukraine facing Putin's attack.   President Biden also promised to form a high-level task force to  enforce U.S. sanctions against Putin, sanctions against Russia's  political elites, and sanctions against the corrupt oligarchs. That  always brings a cheer here in America because people think that those  who have been engaged in a kleptocracy in the name of personal greed  should be held accountable. The thought that they are shopping in New  York City or buying luxury condos and apartments in London or are  harboring their yachts in any country is disgusting.    They need to pay a price. We shouldn't just freeze their assets; we  ought to seize their assets and hold them to rebuild Ukraine amid the  devastation that the Russians are causing. Putin wants to be a czar. He  and his cronies have become a pariah.   We will support Ukraine, but we also have work to do to strengthen  our own democracy. We also have to remember that the bordering nations,  the Baltic States of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, are especially  vulnerable to Russian aggression. They, as members of the NATO  alliance, know that they have friends at their back, but we have got to  reinforce that to the people of those small countries who worry about  their very survival.   Let's take a look at home. As the President said, we have finally  moved  [[Page S970]]  to a safer direction with the pandemic. What a relief it was to go to  the State of the Union Address and not wear a mask. Following doctors'  orders, I might add, we listened to the medical experts who told us it  is safe now not to be wearing a mask unless you are in a particular  category of people. So most of us enjoyed one of the first public  gatherings of a political nature where we were without masks and  relieved to be so. We need to get back to our normal routines. We need  to get our kids back in school--all of them--as quickly as possible.   We added 6 million new jobs last year, an alltime record. Things are  good and positive, but inflation still is haunting this Nation. Wages  are up; inflation is up. But it is not just our Nation. Inflation is a  global problem. COVID-19 constricted the economy of the world. We are  now emerging from it with new jobs, new businesses, new appetites, and  new consumption. It is all good. But the cost of it is inflation.   I trust that we can bring this under control soon. Inflation is real.  It is eating away at families' wages and savings and their faith in the  future. When people work hard and can't get ahead, that is not just an  economic problem; that can be a threat to our democratic spirit because  it can open the door for anti-democratic demagogues.   In his State of the Union Address, President Biden laid out a plan to  help American families afford big-ticket items that are essential;  restore the enhanced child tax credit; help parents raise their kids  and themselves out of poverty; help families with quality affordable  daycare, childcare; expand family and medical leave so workers don't  have to choose between caring for an ailing member of their family or a  terminally ill parent and keeping their jobs; make healthcare more  affordable and accessible; expand veterans' health benefits to cover  more cancers and other service-related health conditions; and make  prescription drugs more affordable by letting Medicare negotiate the  price for medication.   Just one simple thing seems to be so popular across this country, cap  the monthly cost of insulin at $35--$35. There are some 34 million  people who are suffering from diabetes in this country, and of course  their families are pulling for them every day. Think of all of the  lives that could be improved if insulin were affordable. If a fourth or  half of those who are diabetic have to now ration their insulin and  risk their health, that is just wrong in a great nation. We should have  insulin at affordable prices, and $35 a month is that. It is an outrage  that the price of insulin has been raised countless times to more than  $300 a vial.   As we support the Ukrainian people and their immense courage, I hope  we will also find the courage to protect America's future.                           Tribute to Tom Balanoff    Mr. President, when it comes to the American labor movement, I  selfishly say all roads lead to Chicago. At the turn of the 20th  century, workers from all walks of life and from every corner of the  globe joined together in support of a simple but profound belief: An  injury to one is an injury to all.   Few leaders have embodied that philosophy of solidarity and mutuality  more than Tom Balanoff, president of the Service Employees  International Union--SEIU--Local 1 in Chicago and the union's State  council. If you are a worker in Illinois or a worker anywhere in  America, there is a good chance you know Tom. He has devoted his life  not only to building a strong labor movement but a more inclusive one.   Now, he is retiring from his post as president of Local 1. Though his  leadership will be missed, he leaves behind a formidable legacy.   He helped build a global labor movement, led by essential workers. I  am talking about janitors, security officers, airport staff, and  nursing home and home healthcare workers who are reclaiming their power  in the workplace.    As president of Local 1, Tom Balanoff transformed the chapter into  one of the most influential forces in the American labor movement, and  every step of the way, he held true to the chapter's progressive roots.  Formed in Chicago in 1921, Local 1 was the first racially integrated  union in America, bringing together immigrant janitors from across the  globe who were fighting for better working conditions.   From that moment on, SEIU has been synonymous with merging the fight  for workers' rights with the fight for social equality, and Tom has  carried that legacy to new heights. He has been a steadfast champion of  racial equality, gender equality, and protecting the rights of  immigrant workers, and he has assembled the most diverse leadership  team in SEIU's history.   Importantly, Tom's commitment to leading a socially conscious labor  movement is steeped in a proud family tradition. It began when Tom's  grandfather, James Balanoff, immigrated to America from Bulgaria and  found work in a live chicken shop on Commercial Avenue in Chicago.  Since then, each generation of the ``Battling Balanoffs'' has been  grounded in a commitment to defending the rights of working people in  and outside of the workplace.   The Balanoff family notes with pride that both Tom's father and  grandfather attended the 1937 Memorial Day Massacre, where police  opened fire on unarmed protesters at the gate of the Republic Steel  Company in South Chicago, killing 10 men and injuring scores of others.  If the police had hoped to fracture union solidarity, the massacre had  the exact opposite effect on the Balanoff family and many others.   The Balanoff family has stood by workers. Tom's father, James Jr.,  organized steelworkers at a time when manufacturing was the dominant  industry in America, and he eventually rose to be president of the  largest steelworkers union in America, Local 1010, in East Chicago, IN.  Tom has been helping lead the charge for justice for all since he was  in middle school--middle school--when he and his siblings were the only  White kids in class to protest racial segregation in American schools.   By the time Tom was ready to follow in his family's tradition of  union activism, America's economy was going through a dramatic shift.  Factories were shuttering and good-paying union jobs disappearing,  shipped overseas. As more and more Americans left the factories and  found new opportunities in airports, hospitals, nursing homes, offices,  and coffee shops, Tom discovered his life's mission: defending the  rights of the service workers who make our economy tick. To complement  the commitment to economic and labor justice that runs in the Balanoff  family's veins, Tom earned a master's degree in labor and industrial  relations from the University of Illinois.   For decades, whenever and wherever his skills were needed to protect  the rights of workers, you could count on Tom Balanoff to be there. He  worked for the International Association of Firefighters here in  Washington, for the Allied Industrial Workers in Chicago, and the  Cement, Lime and Gypsum Workers in Kansas City before then-SEIU  president, John Sweeney, spotted Tom's exception abilities and brought  him to work for SEIU in Washington, DC.   Tom would go on to serve as trustee of John Sweeney's old SEIU local,  Local 32BJ, in New York City. After a successful tenure there, he  returned to Chicago, first as SEIU Local 46 trustee and eventually as  president of both SEIU Local 1 and president of the Illinois State  Council.   Tom always has seized opportunities to uplift disempowered workers.  In 2005, he traveled down to Houston to help unionize janitors who were  being paid as little as $20 a day. In the heart of one of the most  anti-union States in the country, Tom secured a contract for more than  5,000 janitors that doubled their pay.   Never content to settle, Tom kept the victories coming. Just a few  months later, he helped thousands of janitors in Cincinnati, Columbus,  and Indianapolis win a similar contract. It was a testament to his  lifelong belief that, when working people of all identities come  together, they win.   In the world of politics, my friend Tom has been a champion of the  downtrodden. Several years ago, he helped launch the progressive caucus  in the Chicago City Council, despite facing significant political  headwinds. Today, more than a third of the city council members belong  to that caucus.   Perhaps the most consequential decision Tom ever made as a political  changemaker was in the year 2003, when he became an early endorser of a  [[Page S971]]  community organizer running for the U.S. Senate by the name of Barack  Obama. That endorsement helped pave the way for former President  Obama's stratospheric rise in the world of politics.   And a few years later, Tom became the first labor leader in America  to endorse Barack Obama's campaign for President. At the time, Tom and  I were part of the same lonely club. I was the first U.S. Senator to  endorse President Obama's candidacy in 2007, and for more than a year,  I was the only Senator to do so. But Tom and I knew that Barack Obama  was the leader this country needed.   We had seen firsthand the amazing work he had done in Chicago,  helping displaced workers rebuild their lives and partnering with  churches to launch job training. We knew that President Obama had what  it took to unite our country. And without Tom's support, his candidacy  may never have gotten off the ground.   Tom has said one of the leaders who inspired him most during his  career was Nelson Mandela. A few years after the end of apartheid,  Nelson Mandela wrote: ``To be free is not merely to cast off one's  chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of  others.''   Tom has dedicated his life to enhancing the freedom of others. He has  stood for immigrant workers so that they could find a voice in the  workplace. He has stood in solidarity with Black workers protesting  against racial injustice. And he has worked to protect our communities  and our children by demanding climate justice as well.   In one of his final acts as president of Local 1, Tom helped make  history again. He handed the reins of leadership of that storied local  to the first Black president of the SEIU's State council. Greg Kelley  is a proven champion of working people in Illinois and across the  country. And I might add that when I sat down for breakfast to  congratulate Greg on this new opportunity, he reminded me that he had  once been an intern in my Senate office--something I am very proud of.   Tom Balanoff is leaving his post at a promising moment for the  working people of America. Since the beginning of the pandemic, service  workers have come together to demand safer working conditions, higher  wages, and better benefits.   For instance, in December, workers in Starbucks in Buffalo, NY, voted  to unionize. It will be the company's first-ever union. And those  workers will soon be represented by Starbucks Workers United, an  affiliate of SEIU. This moment is a culmination of Tom's decades of  service to the labor movement.   I want to thank Tom Balanoff for everything he has achieved for  working families in Chicago, throughout America, and literally around  the world. He has cultivated progressive political power and helped  build a fairer economy that rewards hard work, not just wealth.   Loretta and I wish him a long, joyous retirement with his wife Hetty  and their two kids.   Tom, I am looking forward to seeing you some day soon in Highland  Park--watermelon juice on me.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kelly), and the Senator from  California (Mr. Padilla) are necessarily absent.
