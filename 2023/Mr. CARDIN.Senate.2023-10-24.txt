 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

The estimated total cost was $860.4 million.       Major Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted $324.4 million of       this total.        On June 15, 2020, Congress was notified by Congressional       certification transmittal number 20-0G of an additional MDE       sale of thirty (30) All-Up-Round MK 54 Lightweight Torpedoes       (LWT). The following non-MDE items were also included: MK 54       LWT expendables; MK 54 turnaround kits; MK 54 containers; one       (1) MK-695 Torpedo Systems Test Set (TSTS); support equipment       including fire control modification platforms and spare       parts; torpedo spare parts; training; publications; software;       U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical, and       logistics support services and other related elements of       logistics and program support. The addition of these items       resulted in a net increase in MDE cost of $45 million,       resulting in a revised MDE cost of $369.4 million. The total       estimated case value increased to $940.4 million.        On June 8, 2022, Congress was notified by Congressional       certification transmittal number 22-0G of the MDE replacement       of the previously notified two (2) All Up Round MK 54 Mod 0       LWTs with two (2) Exercise MK 54 Mod 0 LWTs. Also included       was additional Engineering Technical Assistance for redesign       of Radar Signal Processing Group configuration and updates to       International Aegis Fire Control Loop design; shipsets of       SAASM units and associated spares; COMSEC equipment for use       between test sites; and removal of one (1) shipset MK 36 Mod       6 Decoy Launching System. The MDE total value remained $369.4       million; however, the non-MDE estimated value increased from       $571 million to $810.6 million. The total estimated case       value increased to $1.18 billion.        On February 27, 2023, Congress was notified by       Congressional certification transmittal number 22-0W of the       MDE inclusion of up to an additional sixty-two (62) SM-2       Block IIIB missiles in tactical and telemetered       configurations. Also included were MK 13 canisters; spare       parts and associated containers; personal training and       training equipment; publications and technical data; U.S.       Government and contractor technical assistance; and other       related elements of logistics and program support. The       addition of these items resulted in a net increase in MDE       value of $260 million, resulting in a revised MDE value of       $629.4 million. The non-MDE estimated value increased from       $810.6 million to $850.6 million. The total estimated case       value increased by $300 million to $1.48 billion.        This transmittal notifies: 1) the MDE inclusion of an       additional one hundred-ten (110) MK 54 Mod 0 Lightweight       Torpedoes (LWT) in the form of conversion kits for the       Spanish Navy's MK 46 LWTs; and 2) the replacement of the       previously notified additional up to sixty-two (62) SM-2       Block IIIB missiles with up to sixty-two (62) SM-2 Block IIIC       missiles. Also included are MK 54 LWT expendables; MK 54       turnaround kits; MK 54 containers; torpedo spare parts;       training; logistics support services; air launch accessories;       and unclassified and classified publications. The estimated       total value of the new items is $181 million. The value of       the new MDE items constitutes $75 million of this total,       resulting in a revised MDE value of $704.4 million. The       estimated non-MDE value will increase by $106 million to       $956.6 million. The total estimated case value will increase       by $181 million to $1.661 billion.        (iv) Significance: The inclusion of this MDE represents an       increase in capability over what was previously notified. The       proposed amendment will support Spain's Anti-Submarine       Warfare (ASW) capability by providing 50 MK 54 Conversion       Kits for use with surface ships and 60 Conversion Kits for       use on helicopters.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security of the United States by       improving the security of a North Atlantic Treaty       Organization (NATO) Ally, which is an important force for       political stability and economic progress in Europe. It is       vital to the U.S. national interest to assist Spain in       developing and maintaining a strong and ready self-defense       capability.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology:        The SM-2 Block IIIC Active Missile maximizes existing SM-6       Block 1 active and SM-2 semi-active missile technology to       deliver a low cost, medium range dual mode active/semi-active       missile. Improvements to the Guidance Section. communications       plate and steering control section are planned to address       obsolescence.        The Sensitivity of Technology Statement contained in the       original notification applies to additional items reported       here.        The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        (vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: October 19, 2023.                            ____________________
