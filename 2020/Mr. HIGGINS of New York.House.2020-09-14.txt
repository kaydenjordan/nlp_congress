 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  National Hispanic Heritage Month, celebrated each year between  September 15 through October 15.   This month provides our Nation the opportunity to recount the rich  cultural legacy the Hispanic community has made for our country.  [[Page H4372]]    Due to the pandemic, the Hispanic Heritage Council of Western New  York is holding a series of events virtually to chronicle the critical  contributions the Hispanic community has made to Buffalo and western  New York.   This year, the Hispanic Heritage Council is also celebrating 10 years  of work raising community awareness of the contributions our Hispanic  friends and neighbors have made towards strengthening our community's  future.   America is stronger because of its diversity. Our lives are enriched  through a greater appreciation of other experiences and cultures.   We are thankful for the opportunity to spotlight the contributions of  the Hispanic community this month and grateful to have the Hispanic  Heritage Council of Western New York committed to this mission this  year and every year.                            ____________________
