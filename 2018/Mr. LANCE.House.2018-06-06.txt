 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of the Lance-Gottheimer amendment to the  Water Resources Development Act of 2018. I thank Chairman Shuster and  his committee for the tremendous work they have done on the underlying  bill.   This amendment would direct the Secretary of the Army to expedite the  completion of the Warren Glen Dam Removal Feasibility Study in the  Musconetcong River, an important waterway in the congressional district  I serve.   The 30-foot-high, 150-feet-wide Warren Glen Dam is currently one of  the largest and most detrimental dams on the Musconetcong River in the  State of New Jersey. The dam poses downstream safety risks, worsening  the quality of drinking water in the region. The dam also blocks  migratory fish from the Delaware River, including shad, alewife and  herring. In 1981, the Army Corps classified this dam as a hazard to  public safety. It must be removed.   The Musconetcong River is an important natural resource in our region  of the country, and is well recognized for its scenic beauty,  environmental significance, and diversity of wildlife. The restoration  of the Musconetcong watershed will improve the water quality by  creating a stronger freshwater flow to push down the salt line to  enhance the protection of drinking water.   Removing the Warren Glen Dam would also open an additional 5 miles  [[Page H4830]]  to the Musconetcong as a free-flowing river for migratory fish. The  Musconetcong watershed has the potential to become an even greater site  for outdoor recreation and wildlife.   Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Gottheimer for joining me yet again on a  bipartisan, problem-solving collaboration. I urge a ``yes'' vote on  this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
