 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 2940. The bill authorizes the Temporary Assistance for Needy  Families program and the Child Care Entitlement to States, which expire  on June 30. These are vital programs that help keep children and  families out of poverty.   TANF provides an important safety net for families, and States use  the money to give very low-income families with children direct cash  assistance, childcare, and work training.   In my home State of California, TANF is critical to so many families.  Administered through the CalWORKs program, California supplements its  Federal TANF programs with its own State dollars to help lift  individuals out of poverty, and it is working.   In Los Angeles County, where my district is located, an additional  71,000 children would be living in poverty and 31,700 children in deep  poverty without TANF. Altogether, that would be over 100,000 more  children living in poverty.   California sees the value in TANF and is supplementing its TANF  dollars with increased State investments for cash assistance and  restoration of cost-of-living adjustments.   Reauthorization of Federal funds is key in ensuring that there is  progress in reducing poverty, so I urge all my colleagues to vote in  support of H.R. 2940. We must ensure that funding for families in need  continues until the end of this fiscal year.
