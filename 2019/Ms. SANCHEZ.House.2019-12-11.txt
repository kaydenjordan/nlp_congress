 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5038, the  Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2019. I would like to thank  Congresswoman Lofgren and Congressman Newhouse for convening  agriculture and labor stakeholders to develop this historic piece of  legislation.   This bill represents true bipartisan efforts to help stabilize our  nation's agriculture crisis. New workplace and legal protections for  farmworkers, including gender-based protections and heat safety  standards, are established under this bill.   Farmworkers have fought long and hard for these reforms. By voting to  strengthen health and safety standards and provide legal status to  agricultural workers, we do right by the hardworking men and women who  put food on our table.   This bill also modernizes the agricultural guest worker program in  order to address the nation's agricultural labor shortage. After months  of negotiations, I believe we have developed a commonsense solution  that will help both farmworkers and farmers.   I am proud to have worked with my colleagues to make this bill a  reality.
