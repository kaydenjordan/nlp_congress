 Mr. President, I ask that the time I use be charged  against the resolution.    Mr. President, this is the first time I have risen to  speak on this Senate floor. I want to start by thanking my fellow  Marylanders for the honor of representing them in this great United  States Senate. I want to thank my colleague Mr. Cardin, the senior  Senator from Maryland, for joining us. I thank the new Senator from  California, Ms. Harris, for joining us as well. I want to say to my  fellow Marylanders that I look forward to working every day for their  benefit and for the benefit of our Nation. I want to say to my new  colleagues in the Senate--Republicans and Democrats alike--I look  forward to working with all of you in the years to come for the good of  our Nation.   I understand it is somewhat unusual for a new Member to speak so soon  on the Senate floor, but what we are witnessing today in the Senate is  not business as usual, and these are not ordinary times. Having served  as the lead Democrat on the House Budget Committee, I know that never  before has the Senate rushed out of the gate so quickly to enact a  budget procedure to deny the minority party--and by extension, hundreds  of millions of Americans--their rights in this United States Senate.  Yet here we are, speeding to use the budget process to fast-track a so- called reconciliation bill that will destroy the Affordable Care Act  and, in doing so, wipe out access to affordable care for over 30  million Americans and create total chaos throughout the American health  care system. That is reckless. It is irresponsible, and it violates the  traditions of this institution.   I may be new to the Senate, but I am not new to the way this Senate  has proudly been described by its Members, both Democrats and  Republicans, both current and former Members. My colleague Senator  Harris will attest that one piece of advice we all received from both  Republican and Democratic Members of this Senate was to read the  chapter in Robert Caro's book about Lyndon Johnson entitled ``The Desks  of the Senate,'' where Robert Caro talks about the burnished mahogany  tops, and he tells the story of the Senate through the Senators who  were protagonists in great debates throughout our history. He  highlights the idea that this Senate is supposed to be a deliberative  body that reflects on issues with a thoughtful exchange of ideas.  Unfortunately, that certainly does not describe the Senate of this  moment. Having just arrived from the House of Representatives, what we  are witnessing today is much more like the tyranny of the majority  characteristic of that body.   This Senate is supposed to be different, but at least for now it  seems very much like the House I just left.   As a result of the fast-track process in the Senate, we will be  overriding and roughshodding over the will of a majority of the  American population, and Americans are just now waking up to learn  about the bait-and-switch scheme that has been perpetrated on them. For  more than 6 years, Republicans in this Senate and in the House of  Representatives have said repeatedly that they would repeal ObamaCare  but replace it--replace it with something, they said, that will be much  better. Now we know, as the clock ticks down, that has been a farce.  There is no Republican replacement bill to provide the kind of coverage  and benefits of the Affordable Care Act, and the consequences of that  failure are going to be devastating for the country.   Let us take a moment to look at the human toll. First, there are the  22 million Americans who previously had no health insurance before the  Affordable Care Act but are now covered through the health care  exchanges and through expanded Medicaid. These are people who have been  denied access to coverage because they had preexisting conditions or  their kids had preexisting conditions--whether it was asthma, diabetes,  heart conditions--so they were either outright denied by insurance  companies or priced out of the market. That 22 million may be a big  number, hard to comprehend, but behind that number are many families  like Carlos and Isabelle Martins, who live not far from where I live in  Silver Spring, MD. They could no longer afford health insurance through  their employer. Shortly before the Affordable Care Act was enacted,  Carlos was told he needed a liver transplant to survive. His wife  Isabelle said that without the Affordable Care Act, he would never have  received that lifesaving treatment.   There is the case of Diane Bongiorni, who now lives in Hyattsville,  MD. She previously had open-heart surgery. When her Cobra expired, it  was only because of the Affordable Care Act that she was able to get  coverage and not be denied because of that earlier, relevant  preexisting condition. Days after she was on the Affordable Care Act, a  cardiologist told her one of her heart valves was failing and she would  need another surgery immediately, and she has told us that she ``would  have died'' had she not had that coverage.   In addition to Diane and Carlos and the other 22 million Americans  who would have been denied affordable health care before the Affordable  Care Act and Medicaid expansion, there are an additional 7 million  Americans on the health care exchanges today who are projected to  totally lose that coverage if Republicans pull the plug on the  Affordable Care Act. That is over 30 million Americans who will lose  access to affordable care directly.   There is no doubt that in those health care exchanges, we have seen  increases in premiums and some of the copays, and we need to do  something about it, which is why I and many of my colleagues have put  forward ideas to address the increases we are seeing in the health care  exchanges in terms of costs. We put those ideas on the  [[Page S104]]  table, and we would welcome our Republican colleagues to join us to  improve the Affordable Care Act. You don't fix a health care system,  you don't fix those problems by blowing up the entire Affordable Care  Act. That is not a solution.    I also want to focus for a moment on the tens of millions of  Americans who are not included in that 30 million who benefit directly  from the Affordable Care Act but who are benefitting right now from  ObamaCare. They may not realize it now, but mark my word they are going  to face very unpleasant and unexpected consequences if the Affordable  Care Act is ripped apart.   First, let us take a look at the overwhelming number of Americans who  get their health care not on the health care exchanges but through  their private employer--most Members of this body, most Americans. The  premiums in those plans have actually risen much more slowly since the  Affordable Care Act was enacted than before. The overwhelming number of  Americans who are on those plans have benefited dramatically from the  reduction of costs. Why did that happen? Because all those people who  had been previously denied access to health care who are in the  ObamaCare exchanges, they used to show up in the hospital as their  primary care provider or, since they weren't getting any care at all  because they couldn't afford the bill, they were showing up at those  hospitals when there was an emergency, when cost was most expensive. We  don't deny people care in an emergency, and then they get the bill and  they can't pay the bill. That is why so many people were going bankrupt  in America before the Affordable Care Act. But somebody pays. Who pays?  Well, everybody else in the system pays. Everybody else who has private  insurance through their employer pays or taxpayers in States pay for  the uncompensated care that hospitals would otherwise have to carry. In  the end, people's premiums were going up really fast, but by providing  the health care system through ObamaCare for those exchanges, however  imperfect, it has helped those other tens of millions of Americans. Let  us look at Medicare beneficiaries, millions of seniors. Watch out.  Their costs are going to rise in three and maybe four ways right away.   First of all, their Part B premiums that every senior on Medicare  pays are going to go up. Why is that? Because as part of the Affordable  Care Act, we got rid of some of the overpayments, the excessive  subsidies that were being paid to certain providers, including some of  the managed care providers who were paid, on average, 115 percent more  than fee for service. We said that makes no sense. That is a waste of  Medicare beneficiaries' money. So we reformed that by saving the  Medicare system money. We also save the Medicare beneficiaries money in  their premiums because those premiums are set partly to the overall  cost of Medicare. If you reduce the cost of Medicare in a smart way,  you reduce those premiums. That is why seniors have seen such slow  increases in their Part B premiums since the enactment of the  Affordable Care Act. Those will go right back up.   Second, seniors on Medicare no longer have to pay for preventive  health screenings, cancer screenings, diabetes screenings, other kinds  of preventive health care because we want to encourage them to identify  the problems early and solve them for their own health care purposes  but also because it saves money in the system. You get rid of the  Affordable Care Act, those seniors are going to be paying premium  copays for those preventive health services.   Prescription drug costs. Seniors--and there are millions and millions  of them who face high prescription drug costs--are benefiting today  from the fact that we are steadily in the process of closing the  prescription drug doughnut hole. We had an absolute crisis in this  country where so many seniors were faced with the difficult choices of  getting the medications they needed to live day-to-day and keep a roof  over their head. That is why we are closing the prescription drug  doughnut hole. You get rid of the Affordable Care Act, all those  seniors who, on average, have saved thousands of dollars with the  Affordable Care Act are going to see their costs go up.   Finally, if you enact the plan that has been put forward by the  Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, and by the person who President-Elect  Trump has nominated to be his Secretary of Health and Human Services,  Tom Price--I encourage every American to look at their plan because  they want to voucherize Medicare, and they want to save the Medicare  system money by raising the prices and the risks on every Medicare  beneficiary. That is the result of that plan.   The Affordable Care Act benefits 30 million people directly, and we  need to make sure we don't put them in harm's way, but it also benefits  all these other people in the system, the people on the employer- provided health plans who have seen historically low premium increases  and seniors on Medicare.   Rural hospitals will be particularly hard hit by repealing the  Affordable Care Act. So the proposed Republican action is going to hit  those 30 million Americans, including my neighbors in Silver Spring. It  is also going to hit those other tens of millions of Americans who  right now may not realize the extent to which they are benefiting from  the Affordable Care Act. Yet our Republican colleagues have not put  forward a single plan to help either the 30 million or all the other  Americans who are benefiting from the Affordable Care Act. Instead, we  see a rush to generate chaos throughout the health care system. That is  counter to what the President-elect has said he wants. Here is what  Donald Trump said on ``60 Minutes'':         Everybody's got to be covered.    Everybody.         I am going to take care of everybody.    Well, it is really important that the majority in the Senate and the  House talk to the President--elect because they are not on the same  road when it comes to that commitment. When the President-elect was  asked about finding a way to keep the ObamaCare rules that prevent  discrimination based on preexisting conditions, he said, ``I like those  very much.'' When he was asked about the provision that allows children  to stay on their parents' insurance plans until they are 26 years old,  he said, ``We're going to very much try to keep that.''   Here is the dirty little secret. Many people--Republicans and  Democrats in this Chamber--know there are only a very few ways you can  design a health care system that meets those conditions. One way, which  many Democrats have historically supported, is the idea of Medicare for  all. The other way is the ObamaCare model. It was not always known as  the ObamaCare model.   The foundation for ObamaCare actually had its roots in the  conservative Heritage Foundation think tank reports. It was an idea  long promoted by Republicans, including many Republican Senators, some  of them still here today. It is an idea rooted in the concept of  personal responsibility, the idea that every American needs to do their  part and help pay for their health insurance, otherwise, if they don't  pay, they are going to force other people to pay when they go seek that  care in the emergency room or wherever it may be. In order for that  idea to work, the idea that was put forward by the Heritage Foundation,  the idea in ObamaCare, everyone needs to have coverage because it would  not make a lot of sense for us to be paying out all the time if we were  able to wait until we got sick and then decide to pay. That is the idea  of having everyone in the pool have insurance. The idea is, you don't  want to use it, but you buy that protection. If other people don't buy  the protection, then the rest of the folks feel like they are being  taken advantage of, which is why everyone has to be in the pool, which  is why it was an idea that came out of the Heritage Foundation.   In fact, I have the Heritage official report right here: Critical  issues--a national health care system. This was back in 1989.   I want to read the three elements in the Republican plan.   Element No. 1, every resident in the United States must by law be  enrolled in an adequate health care plan that covers major health care  costs.   No. 2, for working Americans, obtaining health care protection must  be a family responsibility.   No. 3, the government's proper role is to monitor the health market,  subsidize needy individuals to allow them  [[Page S105]]  to obtain sufficient services, and encourage competition.   That sounds like a description of ObamaCare. It is--which is why, of  course, it was dubbed ``RomneyCare'' when they adopted this model for  the State of Massachusetts. He adopted it based on the Republican's  Heritage model.   So here is the problem: Republicans can't come up with an  alternative. That is why it has not happened for 6 years, because if  you are going to come up with an alternative, you have to go to either  one of two models. One is Medicare for all. The other is the idea that  every American has to be in the system and the idea based on personal  responsibility, which at its start was a Republican idea. When  President Obama adopted it, for many months, some Republican Senators  were willing to go along, but then the politics overtook them, and  since then, we have had the Republicans opposing their own proposed  model for providing health care. So rather than repeal and replace,  since there is no replace, it is repeal and run.   Here is the problem for our colleagues politically, but more  importantly, here is the problem for all Americans and all our  constituents: No one is going to be able to hide from the devastating  consequences of undoing the Affordable Care Act, which is going to hurt  not just the 30 million Americans who are directly benefiting through  the exchanges and the Medicare expansion, the Medicaid expansion, but  also all those seniors on Medicare and the others getting health care  through their private employers.   As I said at the outset, it is truly sad to see the Senate at this  point and in this state, especially because of the terrible  consequences it is going to have on the American people.   You know, the very first time I was ever on the floor of the Senate  was in 1985. I was not thinking of running for office myself at that  time. It was the farthest thing from my mind. I was actually working-- it was in the middle of the Cold War. I was working on national  security and foreign policy issues for a moderate Republican Senator by  the name of ``Mac'' Mathias from the State of Maryland.   I talked about the desks of the Senate at the outset of my remarks.  Senator Mathias sat right there, one seat behind the seat Senator  Booker is sitting in right now.   Great to see you.   That is where Senator Mathias sat. The reason I happened to be  sitting next to him that day is he was working with Senator Kennedy  that day. Senator Kennedy was at a desk back there, I believe. It was  the second from the aisle. It had been his brother Jack Kennedy's desk  in the Senate before him. Even though there were many desks between the  desk of Senator Kennedy and the desk of Senator Mathias and the center  aisle between them, they were able to work together for the good of the  country, just as many Senators from both parties have done since. That  is the way the Senate is supposed to work. That is the way the Senate  was described in the Robert Caro book that Republicans and Democrats  alike told us to read as new Members before we came here.   I am really glad to be here. I am excited to get to work on behalf of  Marylanders and work for the good of our State and the country. I wish  it could have been at a moment when the Senate was not hellbent on  breaking the very traditions that have made it great, the tradition of  being a deliberative body and not using right out of the gate, the very  first thing, a process to short-circuit the will of the minority party.  That is not what any of us were taught the Senate was about.   It is particularly troubling that the Senate is engaged in breaking  that tradition in order to undermine affordable health care for tens of  millions of Americans and generate chaos in our health care system. I  will fight every day to prevent that from happening.   I will also fight every day to try to live up to the true tradition  of the Senate, which is people trying to work together for the good of  the country. It is disappointing to be here at a time when the Senate  is embarked on violating that tradition in order to strip Americans of  their health care. I hope we will not let that happen. I will fight  every day to prevent that from happening and then work with my  colleagues to try to make sure we address the real priorities and  concerns of the American people.   I thank my colleagues for joining me on the floor.
