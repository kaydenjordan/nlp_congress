 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from  California. We have carried this provision the past 3 years in this  very same bill. In fact, it has been signed into law, not only by  President Trump, but also by President Barack Obama. It has been  bipartisan in nature.   Retaining section 125 continues the current state of affairs as we  know it today on this very, very sensitive issue. The IRS has limited  resources at this time, but a lot of demands on them. Taking this  section away and impacting this regulation that clearly everyone  hates--we should have the IRS use their resources for the things that  it should be intended for: resources to improve customer service, to  implement tax reform law that we recently passed, reducing tax fraud,  and moving ahead in this new tax season.   Mr. Chairman, reluctantly, I have to rise in opposition and ask that  we continue the current law as it stands today.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H6534]]         Mr. Chairman, I'll close with this. I  appreciate the gentleman's sentiments towards how the IRS should use  their resources.   Being a member of the Appropriations Committee and a member of this  subcommittee my entire time on the full committee, I can assure you  that the IRS is operating at a level that was not last seen since about  2011. Their resources are tremendously limited at this time, and we  would prefer that they focus on customer service and implementing the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that we recently passed.   Mr. Chair, I'll continue to oppose the gentleman's amendment, ask the  House to do the same, and I yield back the balance of my time.
