 Mr. Speaker, I rise with an urgent plea to my  Republican colleagues. Not included in this legislation are the  Children's Health Insurance Program, Community Health Centers, and  Teaching Health Centers, whose authorization expires on September 30,  this Saturday, after this House adjourns.   They have known for 2 years about this date, yet, with no time left,  the Republicans spent precious hours today debating among themselves a  plan to cut taxes for the richest of Americans.   Nine million children rely on CHIP for their healthcare. Twenty-three  million Americans rely on Community Health Centers. That is 1 in 15  Americans, and they rely on the doctors that are trained at those  centers.   If making sure that every child in America has access to healthcare,  if that is not a priority, what is?   This is a real crisis that still can be averted in just a few minutes  of time now and not later. Families are waiting anxiously while their  health security is hanging in the balance. It is time to vote now  before it is too late.
