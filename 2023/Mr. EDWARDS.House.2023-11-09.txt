 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Brevard  High School volleyball team for winning the 2A volleyball State  championship for North Carolina for the first time in their school's  history.   The Brevard Blue Devils dominated Saturday's championship game in a  3-0 win against Camden County High School.   As a former high school athlete myself, I recognize the sacrifices  and dedication that go into making this type of victory happen.   Senior and star middle hitter Meleah Foster, with her numerous kills  and blocks, was named MVP of the State finals.   The Blue Devils have outstanding individual players, but what sets  them apart is their unity as a team. Each and every member contributed  to this historic victory.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate the Blue Devils. I wish all of them the  very best in their future endeavors and encourage them to continue to  strive for excellence on and off the court. They have made western  North Carolina proud.                            ____________________
