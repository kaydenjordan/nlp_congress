 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Black and Chairman  Bishop for including ANWR, the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, in the  budget process.   I am looking forward to this. With this legislation, we contribute  money to solving some of our national debt.   The small area of 1002 in the National Wildlife Refuge is an area of  2,000 acres, smaller than Dulles Airport.                                time  1615    Potentially, though, we have a little over 20 billion barrels of oil.  Think how much money that would bring to the Treasury immediately  through the bidding process.   This is an issue I have been working on for the last 45 years. It is  time we passed it. Once it went to the Senate, and President Clinton  vetoed it because it wouldn't help us with that embargo we had at that  time.   Now is the time to make sure this Nation is independent totally. It  won't happen overnight, but only Congress can do this. It is not a  wilderness area. It is designated to be drilled at the behest of the  Congress for the good of the Nation.   It will reduce the debt. Again, I said I expect bids of about $10  billion to $20 billion just to have the right to drill. With the new  royalties that are coming down from the Secretary of the Interior, we  will have not only a large amount going into the Treasury, we will have  about 776,000 new jobs created by the discovery of this oil.   We have already seen what we have been able to do in other States by  fracking and becoming more energy independent and how that controls the  OPEC nations. But this is the area which oil has been developed by God.  It is only going to be available to the United States, and it is time  that this Congress steps forth and brings this to fruition for the  people.   We will hear a lot from the other side of those interest groups that  have no knowledge at all about the area I am talking about. We hear  that the caribou herd will be affected. It is ironic that Prudhoe Bay  has produced 17 billion barrels of oil, and when we started, there were  5,000 caribou. Now we have about 31,000 caribou. Oil didn't disturb  them.   Oil is not evil. It is the necessity for this Nation socially to  create jobs. It will make a healthier economy. I am asking my  colleagues again to consider this legislation. It is necessary for this  Nation. It is necessary, very frankly, for the good of this Congress.  With $20 trillion in debt, I have yet to hear anything that will create  new wealth. You can cut all you want to cut, I will cut what I want to  cut, but you have to create new wealth. You have to bring it into the  fold of the general budget process and for the economy of this Nation.  [[Page H7793]]    Let's not keep putting our heads in the sand and saying: Oh, we don't  need to do this; it is not the time to do it. Now is the time for the  good of the Nation and because we are in debt.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to consider this in this budget. I  compliment Mrs. Black and her work, her chairmanship, on the budget. It  is a very difficult process.
