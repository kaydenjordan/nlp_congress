 Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of the America  COMPETES Act. This legislation incorporates two bills that my office  introduced: The Supply Chain Security and Resilience Act and the  Regional Innovation Act.   At a time when the need to finally secure our supply chains and  rebuild a Made in America economy could not be clearer, my provisions  of the bill from the Supply Chain Security and Resilience Act will put  us on the path to doing just that.   By creating a new office within the Commerce Department to promote  U.S. leadership of critical industries and supply chains that are  essential to our national and economic security, we will join  businesses and government in common, national effort.   The Regional Innovation Act would establish a Regional Technology and  Innovation Hub program at the Department of Commerce to support  regional economic development and innovation hubs nationwide. We can  ensure that workers and businesses from all corners of our country, not  just the coasts, benefit from investment.   My community, Pennsylvania's Greater Lehigh Valley, is full of  workers and businesses who have the vision, the talent, and the grit to  reach global economic heights. They deserve the exposure to get their  products to market. Our country has extraordinary promise. Let's pass  this bill.
