 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of amendment 358,  directing the Secretary of Defense along with the Secretary of  Agriculture to review the potential to incorporate innovative wood  products in constructing or renovating facilities owned or managed by  the Department of Defense.   Earlier this year, I chaired a hearing of the Subcommittee on  Conservation and Forestry on the topic of innovative wood products and  their potential contributions. As our witnesses noted, innovative wood  products can offer a range of options for construction that address  mission-readiness, sustainability, carbon sequestration, and provide  high-paying jobs in rural communities across the community, including  in central Virginia.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Austin Scott, for coauthoring  this amendment, as well as the House Committee on Armed Services for  their support.
