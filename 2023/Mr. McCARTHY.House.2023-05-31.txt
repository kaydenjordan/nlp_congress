 Mr. Speaker, let me first say how grateful I am to  Congressmen Graves and McHenry. They have given their time and talents  to this effort for more than a month. Our entire Conference and country  owes them a debt of gratitude.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my Conference. They worked hard. When I went to  see the President on February 1, I sat in the Oval Office right in the  chair across from him. I said, Mr. President, the debt limit is coming.   At that time, Janet Yellen said it would be into maybe July, August.   I said that we should work together. I said that there are only two  things, Mr. President: Never raise taxes, and we have to spend less  than we spent this year.   He said that we would meet, but for 97 days we would never meet. It  wasn't until this House took action to pass a bill. I sit back and I  think for one moment, what if that bill didn't pass, because nothing  passed in the Senate? If that bill had not passed, the only other  option was sitting over here in a discharge petition. It just needs a  few more signatures, and it would be: Just raise the debt. Just raise  the debt.   But tonight is going to be different. Tonight, we are going to do  something we haven't done before. Tonight, we are going to give America  hope. Tonight, we are going to vote for the largest savings in American  history: over $2.1 trillion. That is what we will vote on.   Mr. Speaker, every great nation that has overextended itself has  collapsed. Mindful of this truth, George Washington said in his  Farewell Address that a healthy public credit is a source of strength  and security for a nation.   By that same token, an unhealthy debt burden is a source of weakness  and insecurity.   President Washington's words ring true today. We are seeing the  negative effects of runaway spending in real time: record inflation,  rising interest rates, broken supply chains, and economic uncertainty.   Runaway spending is also making America more dependent on foreign  debt holders. The total debt we owe to other countries is $7.4  trillion. Countries like China are buying more of our farmland, more of  our businesses, and more of our debt. This is unsustainable; but what  is even worse, it is dangerous.   However, runaway spending is more than a national and economic  security problem. My belief, Mr. Speaker, is that it is a moral  problem.   Mr. Speaker, this is Halle. Halle was born at 9:58 a.m. on April 11  of this year. She weighed 6 pounds, 7 ounces. Her blue eyes, she got  that from her dad. That button nose, she got that from her mom. The  $95,000 bill, she got that from Washington. Not a very good gift for a  newborn. That is Halle's portion of the national debt.   Sadly, Halle is not alone. Every child who is born today owes $95,000  in debt. Mr. Speaker, that is $10,000 more in debt for every child  since this President took office.   It reminds me of what Ronald Reagan once said: ``When a business or  an individual spends more than it makes, it goes bankrupt. When  government does it, it sends you the bill.''   Mr. Speaker, to continue Washington's spending addiction is both  irresponsible and just wrong, so let's stop it. I will be honest,  tonight's bill doesn't stop it, but for the first time, we begin to  turn the ship. This shouldn't be our last. It shouldn't even be a  debate. We should challenge each other for how could we put ourselves  on a fiscal path even better.    For months, President Biden and Senator Schumer were adamant that  they would not negotiate spending cuts. Mr. Speaker, I remember  watching Senator Schumer on George Stephanopoulos one Sunday. He said:  Just watch, we are going to break them. The Republicans can't get  together. They can't pass a bill, and it is going to be a clean debt  ceiling. You just watch.   The only person that didn't pass the bill was the person that made  that quote. They demanded a clean debt limit, which really means they  spend more, and you just pay more in taxes.   House Republicans said no. Over the past 4 months, we fought hard to  change how Washington works. We stopped the Democrats from writing a  blank check for more spending after the largest spending binge in  American history that brought us some of the worst inflation our Nation  has ever known.   We used the power we had to force the President to negotiate. You  watched me day after day requesting to negotiate with the President. We  produced a bill that in a divided government takes a step toward  smaller government, less regulation, more economic growth, and more  take-home pay.   Unlike previous Speakers, Members didn't have to pass the bill to  find out what is in it. They had 72 hours to read it, and it is only 99  pages. Fifteen of those pages were just rescissions, just money that we  had spent that sat there.   Here is the bottom line, Mr. Speaker: The Fiscal Responsibility Act  is the biggest spending cut in American history.   I, for one, Mr. Speaker, don't want to be on the wrong side of  history. Yes, I could say I am going to vote ``no'' because there is  something not in the bill. If I took that philosophy, I would never  vote ``yes.''   I simply read the bills in front of me and decide: Is this good for  the country? I would say that answer is easily yes.                                time  2000    Taxpayers will save an additional $2.1 trillion. For the first time  in more than a decade, Congress will spend less next year than this  year.   In fact, the Fiscal Responsibility Act is the only bill that reduces  overall spending, reduces nondefense spending, and reduces the deficit,  unlike any other debt limit increase in recent history.   We are finally bending the curve on discretionary spending because of  this bill. We are doing it while at the same time raising our national  defense, with our veterans fully funded, with Social Security and  Medicare preserved, and without raising a penny in new taxes.   That is a major victory.   Mr. Speaker, it is only part of the story. Tens of billions of  dollars in unspent COVID funds will be clawed back for taxpayers  because of this bill's spending rescissions, the largest in American  history. If you add up all the rescissions in American history, this is  larger than that. I think it is only common sense that if the pandemic  is over, but billions of dollars have not been spent, why would you  spend them now if the pandemic is over? Why don't we provide them back  to the hardworking taxpayer that has to pay it, like Halle.   Mr. Speaker, just listen to some of the programs we are slashing:   $400 million from the CDC's global health fund. Don't get worried  because  [[Page H2697]]  that is not going to help you. That is your hardworking taxpayer money  being sent to countries like China. I guess that is to help China be  able to buy our bonds, and we will pay for their healthcare. I would  rather focus on America.   What about work-capable adults without dependents? They are going to  get a job. They are going to learn new skills, and they are going to  earn a paycheck because of this bill's new welfare reforms. These  reforms are going to change people's lives. When we vote on this bill  today, somebody is going to have a better job tomorrow because of your  vote. Families will be stronger and more self-sufficient. People will  be lifted out of poverty.   Don't believe anyone who says our plan hurts America's social safety  net. We are such a generous Nation, and when people fall on tough  times, we help them. That will not change.   This is important: Assistance programs are supposed to be temporary,  not permanent--a hand up, not a handout; a bridge to independence, not  a barrier.   If you also vote for this bill tonight, new roads, bridges, highways,  and pipelines are going to be built sooner and faster because of this  bill's permitting reform.   Mr. Speaker, I know that is a bipartisan view. We talk about it all  the time. We see it in our homes. We get frustrated that you will vote  for a transportation bill, you will serve 10 years in the Congress, and  once you leave, the person who follows you 6 years later will be at the  groundbreaking because we spent all that time studying.   I think America wants to compete. They want to cut the red tape. They  just want a fair process.   This is going to save families money and make America less dependent  on China, changing America for the better for decades to come.   Finally, taxpayers will be more protected from harassment and costly  new burdens. We rejected every single one of President Biden's demands  for new tax hikes and new government mandates. Believe me, from the  person sitting in the room with the President, he asked every single  time.   Instead, this bill eliminates the funding that would have been spent  this year to hire Biden's army of new IRS agents. Overall, we have cut  more than $20 billion from Biden's IRS slush fund. To date, they  haven't been able to hire a single one of Biden's 87,000 new IRS  agents. I will come back year after year to keep it that way because  the government should work for you, not go after you.   Mr. Speaker, passing the Fiscal Responsibility Act is a crucial first  step for putting America back on track. It does what is responsible for  our children, what is possible in a divided government, and what is  required by our principles and promises. Yes, it may not include  everything we need to do, but it is absolutely what we need to do right  now.   Moving forward, House Republicans will build on its structural  reforms. As we do, the American people can be confident in this: I am  never giving up. I heard the detractors.   I am an optimist. I have to be. I sat there 15 rounds.   I am an optimist. I waited 97 days and listened to the President tell  me he will never meet with me, but I woke up every morning thinking  this might be the day.   I am an optimist. I watched division in this House, but tonight, we  might come together and do something very big for this Nation.   Don't mistake that it is the solution. It is the beginning. We should  wake up the next morning on how we can do even better tomorrow. You  see, I will never give up on the American people, and I will never give  up on keeping our Commitment to America.
