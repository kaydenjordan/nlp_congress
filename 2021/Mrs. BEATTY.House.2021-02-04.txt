 Mr. Speaker, it is a shame that we must use precious  time on the floor of the people's House to address the inflammatory  remarks of Member Marjorie Taylor Greene. But just as we are in the  midst of three crises of the coronavirus, the economic distress, and  social injustice, we must also act against a crisis of extremism and  unhinged conspiracy theories.   Disturbing and dangerous words and actions like those we have heard  and seen from this individual in this House are below the dignity of a  Member of Congress. And if they did not stop when we were all sworn in,  then, if anything, these backward views gained a national platform.   Well, I stand here to tell you, Mr. Speaker, I will stand up to  bullies who threaten students and threaten and celebrate violence  towards our Speaker and our colleagues. Today, as the conscience of the  Congress, it is important that we take this step to affirm that  conspiracy theories and outrageous lies have no place in the Congress  and no place in the people's House. No place. No place.
