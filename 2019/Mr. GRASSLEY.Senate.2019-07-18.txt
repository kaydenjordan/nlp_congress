 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for 1 minute.    Madam President, with the record rainfalls and the  negotiations of Chinese tariffs going on, our farmers are hurting, but  we can give them some certainty by passing the U.S.-Mexico-Canada  Agreement on trade.   In my home State, 86,500 Iowans in farming depend upon agricultural  exports to Canada and Mexico, adding $10.3 billion to our State's  economy. Manufacturing and services are also going to have a big boom  out of this agreement being agreed to. Every third row of Iowa soybeans  are exported, and this trade deal will ensure that these farmers  continue to have duty-free access to our North American neighbors.   The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement also provides new export  opportunities for American dairy farmers, poultry, and egg producers.   Let's give a boost to our farmers and all the jobs related to farming  and in cities and also give a boost to the entire country, by passing  the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and do it very soon.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
