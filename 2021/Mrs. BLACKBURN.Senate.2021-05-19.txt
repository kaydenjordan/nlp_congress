 Madam President, one of the benefits of vaccine rates  going up is that school districts will no longer have an excuse to keep  kids and teachers at home for virtual learning. But if I know kids--and  as a mom and a grandmom, I can assure you, I understand the kiddos-- getting them back in the classroom won't get them away from the  screens.   These big tech companies in China and the Silicon Valley have done  their jobs well. For many American kids, devices are integrated into  their everyday lives. There is no escaping that 4-inch plate of glass  in their pockets. It has become a part of their culture.   Now, this addiction to tech doesn't sit well with many parents and  watchdogs. We have all heard arguments that in order to break this  addiction, we need to somehow change the culture and persuade young  people to break their own ties with Big Tech. I have a different  argument: It is Big Tech that needs to change its culture.   As we all know, many of these companies are little more than  glorified ad agencies. Facebook, Twitter, Google, and TikTok have all  been successful because of their advertising strategies. Their job is  to get eyeballs on content and keep fingers scrolling up and down the  screen. This means that with every shiny new update, their advertising  algorithms have also gotten an update.   The more complex and pervasive these tracking figures become, the  harder it is for users to understand what data these companies are  collecting and how that data is going to be used. Not even tech-savvy  adults can keep up with the legalese in those updated privacy policies.   I think if I went around this Chamber and asked ``When is the last  time you read the terms of service on an app update?'' I am willing to  bet the answer for most of us would be ``Well, it was a long time  ago,'' or it could be maybe even never.   Big tech companies have taken advantage of that, and they have  created  [[Page S2767]]  within their sphere a culture of pushing boundaries. It is do first,  apologize later, and never ever respond to questions about their  policies with a straight answer.   This Congress, I reintroduced the BROWSER Act as a way of pushing  that culture toward a more consumer-friendly consent model. It would  require tech companies to add opt-in and opt-out features to their data  collection policies and inject some transparency into the relationship  between the user and the service provider. It is a great place to start  and a key element of my virtual new protection agenda.   Regulation hasn't kept up with innovation--that much is clear--but  neither has demand for corporate responsibility and transparency. It is  time to change that, and I encourage all of my colleagues on each side  of the aisle to take a look at the BROWSER Act.   But what about those kids? Tech companies are increasingly catering  to young demographics, which means the kids are exposed to more of the  online world every day, which, depending on what corner you find  yourself in, is a productive educational experience, or it could be a  life-and-death situation   Now, the science tells us that, physically, children do not have the  cognitive ability to understand the advertisements and data collection  scenarios that they are being thrown into. Their brains are simply not  developed enough. But the security moms out there are keeping an eye on  all of this, and they will tell you they do not need an anatomy lesson  to know when their child is in over their head. They see their children  following trails left for them by predators, and they are bothered.  They see their daughters falling apart over body image and self-esteem  issues made worse by photoshopped images. They see the violence and the  sexual content in music and movies that is created for adults, but  children are being exposed to this.   They have a really bad feeling about the expanding role of technology  in their child's life. The stats and the scandals we are seeing every  day back up their concerns.   According to Common Sense Research, 98 percent of children in this  country--98 percent of children in this country--under the age of 8  have access to a mobile device at home. In 2011, just over half of the  children had that kind of access. This means that 98 percent of  children under age 8 are subjected to unprecedented levels of  surveillance, data collection, and advertising attacks, even in  supposedly kid-friendly apps.   Alphabet, Google's parent company, got caught tracking children on  their school-provided devices outside of school hours. Amazon got  caught collecting recordings from children's Echo Dot Kids devices.  Parents and regulators have raked Google, TikTok, and Facebook over the  coals for pushing products to children that would increase social media  addiction.   In 2020, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  received a recordbreaking 21.7 million reports of suspected child  sexual exploitation, and 21.4 million of those reports came from  electronic service providers. If you are looking for the danger, there  it is.   During yesterday's meeting of the Commerce Committee's Consumer  Protection Subcommittee, Baroness Kidron had it right when she said  that Facebook has not earned our trust, and I would encourage my  colleagues working with me on this issue to apply this fact to Big Tech  in general.   These companies are entangled in our daily lives and in the lives of  our children, and they have no incentive to loosen their grip on our  attention by making things easier to understand. Therefore, we have no  incentive to assume they are acting with the interest of their  customers in mind.   Remember that terms of service agreement we talked about earlier?  Well, imagine standing by and asking a child to read, understand, and  make an informed choice about whether to click the ``accept'' button.  This is preposterous. We need to bring the parents back into the  conversation and inject accountability and transparency into the  process.   Last Congress, I introduced the SAFE DATA Act with my colleagues,  Senators Wicker, Thune, and Fisher. This bill contained a requirement  that companies not transfer data collected from children between the  ages of 13 and 16 without the explicit consent of their parent or  guardian. This Congress, I hope my colleagues, Democratic and  Republican, will be willing to work with me on similar legislation that  truly targets this problem of child exploitation online.   We will never change the culture of Big Tech--the culture Big Tech  has created for itself--if we don't take steps right now to  deincentivize the monetization of children's attention and browsing  habits. This is a bipartisan issue.   The Zuckerbergs and the Dorseys and the Pichais of the world who have  come to testify before the Commerce Committee--they understand this. It  wasn't a pleasant experience for them, but I do believe they have  gotten the point. They need to understand that when it comes to privacy  and safety mistakes, there is no safe harbor to be found here in the  U.S. Senate, especially when it concerns the exploitation of our  precious children.   What we have going on is going to be even more unpleasant when these  security moms start upping the ante and start cutting off the flow of  all that valuable underage data that is produced by their children  online that is being data-mined by these big tech companies and then  sold to advertisers, sold to the highest bidder. That is the breaking  point we are rapidly approaching.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, in Music City, we have a  saying: ``It all begins with a song.'' It is our universal truth and  the foundation of hundreds of iconic moments in country music. This  year, we have the privilege of celebrating the breakthrough of one of  Nashville's most promising young artists. Her moment appropriately  began with a very special song and a very special group of songwriters.   It is my pleasure to recognize for the Congressional Record the first  song in country music written, performed, and produced by an all-female  team to hit the No. 1 spot on the charts.   Congratulations to songwriter and performer Tenille Arts, songwriter  Allison Cruz, and songwriter and producer Alex Kline on the historic  success of ``Somebody Like That.'' On behalf of the entire Tennessee  congressional delegation, I thank you for your stunning contribution to  the beautifully female future of country music.                            ____________________
