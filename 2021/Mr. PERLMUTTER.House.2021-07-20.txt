 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the heroes from  [[Page H3675]]  the movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colorado, on July 20, 2012, and  all of the everyday heroes who make sacrifices for their community,  including those heroes we have seen during this COVID-19 pandemic.   Nine years ago today, 12 lives were taken, 70 were wounded, and  hundreds more suffered emotional trauma.   Yet even in this tragedy, we saw incredible heroism, those who  carried the wounded to safety, and the first responders, law  enforcement, firefighters, and medical teams whose tireless efforts  saved many lives.   I would like to recognize those who lost their lives that night: AJ  Boik; Jesse Childress; Gordon Cowden, whose two teenage children were  in the theater when he was killed; Jessica Ghawi; Micayla Medek;  Veronica Moser-Sullivan, age six, whose mother was shot in the chest  and miscarried a week after the attack; Rebecca Wingo; and Alex  Sullivan, who was celebrating his 27th birthday and was 1 week away  from his first wedding anniversary.   I would also like to recognize the four who died while saving and  shielding others: Jonathan Blunk, John Larimer, Matt McQuinn, and Alex  Teves.   During trying times, it is important to remember the heroes among us  who, on a daily basis, answer the call to step up for their community  and especially on July 20, a day we think of as National Heroes Day.   These everyday heroes such as healthcare workers, frontline workers,  essential personnel, and those who helped develop and administer the  COVID-19 vaccines, among others, have been particularly visible during  this coronavirus pandemic, and I would like to recognize their  tremendous acts of selflessness and bravery.   Join me in saying ``thank you'' to the hero in your life. Let's  exhibit the same spirit of courage and service today and throughout the  year.                            ____________________
