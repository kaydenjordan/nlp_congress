 Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the United  States Climate Leadership on International Mitigation, Adaptation, and  Technology Enhancement Act of 2021--the U.S. CLIMATE Act. Mr.  President, climate change represents a clear and present threat to the  stability, security and prosperity of nations around the world,  including the United States. The cost of climate-induced disasters  becomes more indisputable and devastating with every passing year.  Barring swift and ambitious action, the situation will only worsen.   We've all seen the devastating impacts of climate change. For years,  unprecedented tropical storms have destroyed communities in Mozambique,  Central America, and the United States, including communities in my  home state of New Jersey. This past February, incredibly abnormal and  brutal winter weather, exacerbated by climatic disruption to the  Arctic's polar vortex, killed eleven people and left thousands in Texas  without power and water. Less than a year prior, deadly wildfires,  exacerbated by climate change engulfed California, killing 31 people,  and Australia, killing 34 people, and forced thousands to flee their  homes and lose their livelihoods. And yet, while hurricanes and storm  surges are horrific, climate change is also increasing the intensity,  length and geographic expanse of droughts around the world contributing  to food insecurity, natural resource scarcity and desertification.   Likewise, intensifying effects of climate change pose an existential  threat to hundreds of millions of people and exacerbate global forced  migration. Nations like Bangladesh, India, and Indonesia are incredibly  vulnerable to mass displacement due to rising sea levels. Island  nations like Tuvalu, Seychelles, the Republic of the Marshall Islands  and Kiribati are already managing internal migration due to climate  change induced sea-level rise. Without ambitious action to both keep  global leverage temperatures well below an increase of two degrees  Celsius above preindustrial levels it is forecasted that the entirety  of certain nations may become uninhabitable within my grandchildren's  lifetime. It is a moral imperative for the Senators in this body, and  humanity, to act to ensure that is not the world we leave for the  generations that will come after us. Today's generations are the first  people to personally and regularly experience the effects of climate  change on the natural world and its impact on humanity . . . and we are  also the last generations that can, and must, act to prevent the worst  forecasts from becoming reality.   Changing climate and weather patterns intensification of global food  insecurity and resource scarcity especially threaten the lives and  security of the world's most vulnerable populations. For months, heavy  rainfall and warmer temperatures have triggered a locust plague in East  Africa that has lasted more than an entire year. This historic locust  plague--triggered by conditions exacerbated by climate change--has  threatened agricultural and pastoral livelihoods and worsened already  acute food insecurity in the region. At the same time, similar extreme  weather patterns are expected to expand and shift the ranges of life- threatening diseases like malaria, West Nile Virus, cholera, and  others. Beyond the palpable destruction and devastation of climate- induced crises, climate change is a ``threat multiplier,'' a term  coined by the CNA Corporation's Military Advisory Board in 2007 to  express the way in which climate change exacerbates instability;  conflict and subsequent displacement; terrorism; and other vital  security matters.   Clearly, climate change does not begin nor end at any nation's  borders. No one is immune to the effects of climate change--which is  why we must not only work with the rest of the  [[Page S2014]]  world to combat this crisis, but lead the charge. It is simply not  enough to enact robust domestic policies--this is a global problem that  requires internationally collaborative solutions. What's more, our  leadership and renewed international engagement can generate  opportunities for Americans. By committing to international agreements  and adhering to emerging international production norms, we are opening  the global markets for the innovation, ingenuity, and leadership of the  American private sector.   I commend the Biden administration's commitment to returning the  United States to the global stage, thereby granting us the capacity to  reengage and lead the international community in tackling the greatest  threat of our time. President Biden's Executive Order on Tackling the  Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad has designated climate action as a  core tenant of U.S. diplomacy and national security planning. He has  appointed former Secretary of State John Kerry as Special Presidential  Envoy for Climate, ensuring that climate considerations have a strong  advocate where important decisions are being made. And, under the  leadership of President Biden, the United States has officially  rejoined the Paris Agreement.   The time for debate and discussion on why and how we must tackle this  crisis is over. The science is clear: we must achieve net zero  emissions by 2050 in order to ensure a safe and prosperous future for  ourselves and our posterity. Now is the time for action and  implementation of crucial efforts to save our planet.   Congress can and must do more to support the restoration of the  United States' climate diplomacy and leadership. That is why I am  introducing the United States Climate Leadership in International  Mitigation, Adaptation, and Technological Enhancement Act, or the U.S.  CLIMATE Act, of 2021, a comprehensive piece of legislation to bolster  President Biden's bold commitment to U.S. climate leadership by  providing resources, programs and policy to support and expedite the  realization of United States action that will be essential to regaining  the international community's trust and partnership with the U.S. in  the global climate fight. It represents a bold course of action that  Congress should take to support forward-looking leadership in the White  House in their commitment to preventing the worst-case scenarios of  climate change from becoming reality.   Title I of the bill establishes climate change as a cross-cutting  imperative at the State Department. It also calls for the integration  of climate models and forecasting into national security planning  across all federal agencies and features directives on protecting our  security and environmental interests in the Arctic.   Title II declares support for U.S. cooperation and engagement in  international agreements. This includes directives on re-entry into the  Paris Agreements; ratification of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal  Protocols; compliance with environmental initiatives of the  International Civil Aviation Organization; and the establishment of new  international efforts to mitigate transportation sector and greenhouse  gas emissions.   Title III integrates climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts  into a range of tools and initiatives at USAID, the Department of the  Treasury, the Department of State, the DFC, and the United Nations.   Title IV incorporates a clean energy mandate into the United States'  diplomatic and development efforts, thereby protecting our own energy  security interests and promoting responsible global energy production.   Title V of the bill addresses the United States' bilateral and  multilateral engagement on climate change, encouraging U.S. cooperation  with China, India, the European Union and other key partners.   Title VI of the U.S. CLIMATE Act integrates our colleague from  Hawai'i, Senator Hirono's Women and Climate Change Act, which  acknowledges and addresses the disproportionate effects of climate  change on women and girls around the world.   The science is clear: we are running out of time to stave off the  most devastating effects of climate change that will directly impact  our children and our children's children. After four years of being  absent from the conversation, it is time for the United States to not  only return to the table, but lead the charge to protect our shared  home. We cannot solve this crisis alone--this is not an American  problem, this is a global crisis that can only be combatted with  coordinated, international action. The U.S. CLIMATE Act of 2021  provides the essential resources, programs, and support for the United  States to lead the world forward in the existential fight to save our  planet. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the  legislation be printed in the Record following my remarks, I yield the  floor and note the absence of a quorum.   So ordered.                                  S. 1201         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:  [[Page S2015]]         (1) The Special Report: Global Warming of 1.5C, published       by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on October       8, 2018, and the Fourth National Climate Assessment, first       published by the United States Global Change Research Program       in 2018, concluded that--        (A) the release of greenhouse gas emissions, most notably       the combustion of fossil fuels and the degradation of natural       resources that absorb atmospheric carbon from human activity,       are the dominant causes of climate change during the past       century;        (B) changes in the Earth's climate are--        (i) causing sea levels to rise;        (ii) increasing the global average temperature of the       Earth;        (iii) increasing the incidence and severity of wildfires;       and        (iv) intensifying the severity of extreme weather,       including hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons, flooding, droughts,       and other disasters that threaten human life, healthy       communities, and critical infrastructure.        (2) An increase in the global average temperature of 2       degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrialized levels would       cause--        (A)(i) the displacement, and the forced internal migration,       of an estimated 143,000,000 people in Latin America, South       Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa by 2050 if insufficient action       is taken (according to the World Bank); and        (ii) the displacement of an average of 17,800,000 people       worldwide by floods every year (according to the Internal       Displacement Monitoring Centre) because of the exacerbating       effects of climate change;        (B)(i) more than $500,000,000,000 in lost annual economic       output in the United States (a 10 percent contraction from       2018 levels) by 2100 (according to the Fourth National       Climate Assessment); and        (ii) an additional 100,000,000 people worldwide to be       driven into poverty by 2030 (according to the World Bank);        (C)(i) greater food insecurity and decreased agricultural       production due to climate change's effects on the increased       frequency and intensity of extreme weather events; and        (ii) the proliferation of agricultural pests and crop       diseases, loss of biodiversity, degrading ecosystems, and       water scarcity (according to the United Nations Food and       Agriculture Organization); and        (D) more than 350,000,000 additional people worldwide to be       exposed to deadly heat stress by 2050.        (3) According to the International Monetary Fund, a       persistent annual increase in average global temperature of       .04 degrees Celsius would reduce global real gross domestic       product per capita by 7.22 percent by 2100.        (4) According to the United Nations Environment Programme,       climate change is exacerbating unusual regional weather       conditions, which is driving the current and prolonged desert       locust outbreak that is threatening food security across East       Africa and Southeast Asia.        (5) According to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy       Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services--        (A) an increase in the global average temperature of       between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius will result in a       significant reduction in the worldwide number of land       species;        (B) an increase in the global average temperature of 2       degrees Celsius--        (i) will place 5 percent of world's species at risk of       extinction; and        (ii) will result in the destruction of more than 99 percent       of all coral reefs worldwide; and        (C) an increase in the global average temperature of 4.3       degrees Celsius will place 16 percent of world's terrestrial       species at risk of extinction.        (6) According to the International Energy Agency, the       United States, China, India, and the European Union       (including the United Kingdom) account for more than 58       percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.        (7) China, which is the world's top greenhouse gases       emitter and has an outsized impact on the United States' core       interest in climate stability--        (A) is likely to achieve its carbon emissions mitigation       pledge to the Paris Agreement, contained in its 2015       nationally determined contribution, to ``peak'' emissions       around 2030 ahead of schedule;        (B) announced, on September 22, 2020, a pledge to achieve       carbon neutrality by 2060; and        (C) has yet to announce an updated nationally determined       contribution.        (8) On October 26, 2020, Japan, the world's third largest       economy and fifth greatest carbon emitter, announced a pledge       to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Despite apprehension       about growing nuclear energy sources, Japan aims to increase       its share of renewable and nuclear energy following new       targets unveiled next year.        (9) India has met its growing energy demands by becoming a       global leader in renewable energy generation. Despite       significant investments in renewable energy, and the       implementation of strong national greenhouse gas mitigation       policies, India continues to operate some of the world's       dirtiest fossil fuel power plants and has high emissions       generated from its transportation sector. India is a critical       market for foreign investment and will be a major competitor       in international clean energy development futures.        (10) India's leadership within the Clean Energy       Ministerial, the Mission Innovation initiative, and the       International Solar Alliance has put India at the forefront       of renewable energy development and helped India achieve a       top 5 global rank among clean energy producers. Installed       electricity capacity from renewables in India grew by 144       percent between 2014 and 2020. Approximately $42,000,000,000       was invested into India's renewable energy sector between       2014 and 2019.        (11) The European Union demonstrated its strong commitment       to climate action by making the ambitious pledge to reduce       the collective greenhouse gas emissions of its 27 member       nations by at least 55 percent by 2030 (compared to 1990       levels) and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The       European Parliament went even further, voting to reduce its       collective economy wide greenhouse gas emissions by 60       percent by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels). These commitments       represent substantial improvements from the previous goal of       a 40 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.        (12) The European Union's member nations have also provided       the equivalent of approximately $120,000,000,000 between 2014       and 2020 in support and financing to build climate change       resilience and develop low carbon energy capacity throughout       the developing world.        (13) The European Union has traditionally been a steadfast       partner with United States in the United Nation's Framework       Convention on Climate Change by pushing for improved       accountability, transparency, and shared responsibility among       parties in mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions. As the       United State Government's executive branch has pulled away       from climate action commitments, the European Union has       increased its cooperation with coalitions of States through       partnerships such as the United States Climate Alliance.        (14) Among the world's top greenhouse gas emitters, the       United States is the only country that--        (A) has rescinded national policies to reduce greenhouse       gas emissions;        (B) has advanced policies aimed at bolstering fossil fuel       consumption and extraction, including through the removal of       Federal protections of public lands that are critical       wilderness areas vital to maintaining healthy natural       ecosystems; and        (C) has abstained or withdrawn itself from several global       cooperative efforts acknowledging and addressing the climate       crisis.        (15) United States leadership during deliberations over the       Paris Agreement--        (A) was exemplified by--        (i) its commitment to reduce national emissions by 26 to 28       percent below 2005 levels;        (ii) its leadership in the ``Umbrella Group'' and its role       as cofounder of the ``High Ambition Coalition'';        (iii) its co-facilitation of the UNFCCC;        (iv) its work with the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Paris       Agreement on agenda item 5: Modalities, procedures and       guidelines for the transparency framework for action; and        (v) its support for the enhanced transparency framework for       action and support referred to in Article 13 of the Paris       Agreement;        (vi) its pledge of $3,000,000,000 to the Green Climate Fund       (of which the United States still owed $2,000,000,000) in       support of developing countries' efforts to adapt to climate       change and to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions; and        (vii) the development of critical bilateral climate action       cooperation initiatives with China and India; and        (B) established the United States as essential to uniting       the world in climate action cooperation.        (16) The United States' reversal on nearly all climate       action policies since 2017, including repealing the Clean       Power Plan (announced by President Obama in August 2015),       cancelling contributions to the United Nation's Green Climate       Fund, abstaining from all G7 and G20 climate action       communiques, and withdrawing the United States from the Paris       Agreement--        (A) undermines the viability of the Paris Agreement;        (B) harms American diplomacy;        (C) disadvantages the ability of the United State private       sector to compete in a clean energy global economy, for which       the International Finance Corporation estimates that       investments spurred by the Paris Agreement will creates up to       $23,000,000,000,000 in new investment opportunities;        (D) erodes the United States' leadership, standing, and       trust within the international community; and        (E) concedes leadership and economic opportunity to foreign       governments keen on taking advantage of the United States'       absence from international climate action initiatives.        (17) The Paris Agreement's central aim is--        (A) to strengthen the global response to the threat of       climate change by maintaining the global temperature rise       well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels; and        (B) to pursue efforts to further limit the temperature       increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius.        (18) The Paris Agreement--        (A) specifies the need for a strong global response to       climate change;        (B) acknowledges that all ``[p]arties should, when taking       action to address climate change, respect, promote and       consider their respective obligations on human rights, the       right to health, the rights of indigenous  [[Page S2016]]       peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with       disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the       right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment       of women and intergenerational equity'';        (C) notes the importance of ``climate justice'' when       mitigating and adapting to climate change;        (D) recognizes ``the need for an effective and progressive       response to the urgent threat of climate change'';        (E) requires all parties to put forward their best efforts       through nationally determined contributions and to strengthen       these efforts in the future;        (F) requires each party to update its nationally determined       contribution every 5 years, with each successive nationally       determined contribution representing a progression beyond the       previous nationally determined contribution, and reflecting       the party's highest possible ambition;        (G) recognizes that marine ecosystems covering more than 70       percent of the Earth's surface have an integral role in       climate balance; and        (H) was developed under the UNFCCC, an international       environmental treaty which the United States ratified, with       the advice and consent of the Senate on October 15, 1992.        (19) Seventy percent of the Paris Agreement signatories'       nationally determined contributions in support of the goals       of the Paris Agreement are ocean-inclusive, and 39 Paris       Agreement signatories are focused on the inclusion of ocean       action in nationally determined contributions through the       Because the Ocean initiative.        (20) The United States communicated its nationally       determined contribution--        (A) to achieve, by 2025, an economy-wide target of reducing       its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below its       2005 level; and        (B) to make best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28       percent.        (21) A thriving clean energy industry in the United States,       which employs more than 500,000 Americans, is essential in       achieving these targets.        (22) A number of existing laws and regulations in the       United States also are relevant to achieving this target,       including--        (A) the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.);        (B) the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-486); and        (C) the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007       (Public Law 110-140).        (23) On November 4, 2020, the United States withdrawal from       the Paris Agreement became effective, which at the time       resulted in the United States being the only state party (out       of 197 parties) to the UNFCCC that is not a party to the       Paris Agreement.        (24) On January 20, 2021, President Biden initiated the       process for reentering the United States into the Paris       Agreement. On February 19, 2021, the United States officially       rejoined the Paris Agreement.        (25) Article 8 of the Paris Agreement states, ``Parties       recognize the importance of averting, minimizing and       addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse       effects of climate change, including extreme weather events       and slow onset events, and the role of sustainable       development in reducing the risk of loss and damage.'' Such       adverse effects include strong winds from hurricanes and       tropical storms, and flooding from storm surges and heavy       rain, that inflict losses on various sectors of the United       States economy.        (26) The Paris Agreement requires that parties ``should       strengthen their cooperation on enhancing action on       adaptation, taking into account the Cancun Adaptation       Framework'', which includes measures to enhance       understanding, coordination and cooperation with regard to       climate change induced displacement, migration and planned       relocation, where appropriate, at the national, regional and       international levels.        (27) The Paris Agreement is an example of the multilateral,       international cooperation needed to overcome climate change-      related challenges facing the global community, such as       reducing emissions, promoting economic growth, and deploying       clean energy technologies.        (28) The Paris Agreement recognizes ``the fundamental       priority of safeguarding food security and ending hunger, and       the particular vulnerabilities of food production systems to       the adverse impacts of climate change.''.        (29) The Paris Agreement recognizes that--        (A) adaptation is a global challenge facing all countries,       with local, subnational, national, regional, and       international dimensions; and        (B) adapting to the effects of climate change is a key       component of the long-term global response to climate change       to protect people, livelihoods, and ecosystems.        (30) American leadership during the Paris Agreement       negotiations encouraged widespread international       participation in the Paris Agreement.        (31) American States, cities, and businesses are stepping       up and pledging to meet the Paris Agreement goals in the wake       of absent and uncertain leadership by the President.        (32) The Paris Agreement--        (A) has driven innovation in developing cleaner, more       reliable, and more affordable forms of energy;        (B) has demonstrated that addressing climate change and       providing affordable energy to American consumers are not       mutually exclusive; and        (C) has encouraged the United States to develop the Mid-      Century Strategy for Deep Decarbonization, which--        (i) was released on November 16, 2016; and        (ii) states, ``Energy efficiency improvements enable the       energy system to provide the services we need with fewer       resources and emissions. Over the past several years, the       United States has demonstrated that programs and standards to       improve the energy efficiency of buildings, appliances and       vehicles can cost-effectively cut carbon pollution and lower       energy bills, while maintaining significant support from U.S.       industry and consumers.''.        (33) Global temperatures must be kept below 1.5 degrees       Celsius above pre-industrialized levels to avoid the most       severe impacts of a changing climate, which will require--        (A) global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from       human sources of 40 to 60 percent from 2010 levels by 2030;       and        (B) net-zero global emissions by 2050;        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) when the United States proffers a strong commitment and       focused leadership on climate action, the rest of the world       will likely follow its example;        (2) when the United States abdicates leadership on such       matters, other countries are likely to waiver on their       commitments to action and retract to insular posturing on       matters that require cooperation; and        (3) in order to avert the worst impacts of climate change,       which is in the core national interest of the United States,       the United States should--        (A) prioritize climate change in its foreign policy, and       ensure that climate change is taken into account in all       foreign policy decision making;        (B) set the standard for ambition on climate action;        (C) use its diplomatic leverage to create incentives for       other countries to take strong action on climate change;        (D) broker, with other world powers, bilateral commitments       on emissions reductions and climate finance and support for       developing countries, which are critical for--        (i) building trust and consensus around global cooperation       on climate action; and        (ii) sending important investment signals to private       finance and private industry on investment and development       trends;        (E) be transparent in how the United States is delivering       on its commitments;        (F) ensure it is adopting and implementing consistent       policies and practices with respect to climate change across       bilateral and multilateral development finance institutions;        (G) hold other world powers accountable for making and       meeting strong commitments;        (H) call for reciprocal standards of transparency; and        (I) support developing countries, in an inclusive manner--        (i) to expand deployment and access to clean energy;        (ii) to plan and invest in climate change adaptation       solutions;        (iii) to improve climate change resilience capacities; and        (iv) to promote--         (I) sustainable agriculture practices;        (II) food security; and        (III) natural resource conservation.

       (5) United States collaboration with other nations,       especially developing countries most impacted by the need to       transition carbon intensive industrial sectors, and the       workforces of these affected industries, on the global       transition to environmentally sustainable economies and       societies to ensure workers benefit from opportunities that       arise in a transition to economies powered by clean energy,       including engagements on--        (A) realizing the potential to create significant net gains       in employment opportunities through increases in the number       of decent jobs through investments in environmentally       sustainable production and consumption and management of       natural resources;        (B) improving the quality of jobs and increased incomes on       a large scale from more productive processes, and       environmentally sustainable products and services in sectors       such as agriculture, renewable energy, transport,       construction, recycling, and tourism;        (C) social inclusion through improved access to affordable,       environmentally sustainable energy and payments for       environmental services, which are of particular relevance to       women and residents in rural areas who face more economic       challenges;        (D) protections from the effects of economic restructuring       that would otherwise result in the displacement of workers       and possible job losses;        (E) training and access to new job opportunities       attributable to new environmentally sustainable and clean       energy powered enterprises and workplaces;        (F) attracting new environmentally sustainable and clean       energy powered enterprises and workplaces to communities       transitioning to low carbon economies and assist with       adapting to climate change to avoid loss of assets and       livelihoods and involuntary migration; and        (G) avoiding adverse effects on the incomes of poor       households from higher energy and commodity prices; and        (6) the United States should communicate its intention to       achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.       SEC. 202. ENHANCED UNITED STATES COMMITMENT TO THE PARIS                     AGREEMENT.         (a) Sense of Congress Regarding Need for Updated United       States Nationally Determined Contribution.--It is the sense       of Congress that--        (1) all parties determine their voluntary contributions to       the Paris Agreement, in accordance with Article 4.2 of the       Paris Agreement;        (2) the development and submission of a new United States'       nationally determined contribution should be prioritized, in       accordance with Article 4.9 of the Paris Agreement;        (3) the new United States' nationally determined       contribution should--        (A) represent an ambitious 2030 target, in accordance with       Articles 4.2 and 4.3 of the Paris Agreement; and        (B) put the United States on an appropriate trajectory       towards achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050;       and        (4) the plan required under subsection (b) should--        (A) be developed in accordance with Article 4.13 of the       Paris Agreement;        (B) inform United States' obligations under Article 13.7 of       the Paris Agreement; and        (C) clearly demonstrate how the United States will achieve       the target referred to in paragraph (3).        (b) Plan for Developing the United States' Nationally       Determined Contribution.--At least 20 days before the United       States submits a new or provisional nationally determined       contribution, the President shall consult with, and provide       embargoed drafts of the nationally determined contribution       to, the appropriate congressional committees.        (c) Public Transparency.--The President shall make       available to the public a plan for the United States to meet       its nationally determined contribution, which shall include--        (1) ambitious, economy-wide, short-term greenhouse gas       emissions reductions targets for 2025 and 2030, with relevant       addenda to the plan following its initial submission;        (2) considerations made for populations, regions,       industries, and constituencies that could be affected by       actions to meet the targets described in paragraph (1) and       the failure to meet such targets, including the effect of       such actions on--        (A) United States' jobs, wages, and pay;        (B) the cost of energy (such as electricity and gasoline)       for consumers; and        (C) the ability to develop and deploy new, innovative,       domestically produced technologies;        (3) a description of how the United States may use--        (A) multilateral and bilateral diplomatic tools, in       addition to the expert committee established under Article 15       of the Paris Agreement, to encourage and assist other parties       to the Paris Agreement to fulfill their announced       contributions; and        (B) the mechanisms under Articles 12 and 13 of the Paris       Agreement to urge enhanced actions from other parties to       achieve the overall objectives of the Paris Agreement;        (4) a description of how the Paris Agreement's loss and       damage provisions would affect infrastructure resiliency in       the United States;        (5) a coherent and stable policy framework for sustainable       enterprise development and decent work opportunities for all       United States residents that--        (A) is developed through engagement in social dialogue,       particularly in--        (i) communities that have historically experienced       environmental injustice; and        (ii) communities with economies that are heavily dependent       on fossil fuel production or consumption; and        (B) maintains such social dialogue, in line with       international labor standards--        (i) at all stages, from policy design to implementation and       evaluation; and        (ii) at all levels, from the national level to the       enterprise; and        (6) an accounting of other relevant activities that advance       United States foreign policy objectives of--        (A) advancing global greenhouse gas mitigation;        (B) supporting climate change adaptation activities; and        (C) improving global climate security.        (d) Education and Public Awareness.--        (1) In general.--The plan developed under subsection (c)       shall be consistent with Article 12 of the Paris Agreement,       which states ``Parties shall cooperate in taking measures, as       appropriate, to enhance climate change education, training,       public awareness, public participation and public access to       information, recognizing the importance of these steps with       respect to enhancing actions under this Agreement.''.        (2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this Act may be       construed to require or prohibit the President from including       in the plan developed under subsection (b), consistent with       the prohibition described in section 438 of the General       Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232a), recommendations       to support State and local educational agencies, in       integrating instruction on human-caused climate change and       the societal, environmental, and economic effects of such       climate change into curricula taught in elementary and       secondary schools under the control of such State and local       educational agencies, in order to meet the goals and       ambitions of the Paris Agreement to ensure climate education       and awareness in schools.

SEC. 203. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING RATIFICATION OF THE                     KIGALI AMENDMENT TO THE MONTREAL PROTOCOL.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) The chemical refrigerant alternative, hydrofluorocarbon       (HFC), and its chemical derivatives identified in Annex F of       the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone       Layer, done at Montreal September 16, 1987, which replaced       hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) and chlorofluorocarbon (CFC),       are short-lived and highly potent greenhouse gases.        (2) Some HFCs are 4,000 times more potent greenhouse gases       than carbon dioxide. The expansion of mass production and       worldwide use of HFCs have significantly contributed to the       recent worsening of the global climate crisis.        (3) In October 15, 2016, the parties at the 28th Meeting of       Parties to the Montreal Protocol, with the support of the       United States, adopted an amendment (referred to in the Act       as the ``Kigali Amendment'') to the Montreal Protocol to       globally phase down the production and application of       hydrofluorocarbons, most commonly used as refrigerants in air       conditioners and for cold storage.        (4) The Kigali Amendment calls for parties to cut the       production and consumption of HFCs by more than 80 percent       during a 30-year period--        (A) to eliminate an estimated 80,000,000,000 metric tons of       carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 2050; and        (B) to avoid up to 0.5 degree Celsius warming by the end of       the century, while continuing to protect the ozone layer.        (5) United States' ratification of the Kigali Amendment       will require the advice and consent of the Senate. There is       broad bipartisan support for the Kigali Amendment in the       Senate, as evidenced by a letter sent by 13 Republican       senators to the President on June 4, 2018, urging the       President to submit the Kigali Amendment to the Senate for       advice and consent.        (6) The Environmental Protection Agency received sufficient       domestic legal authority to comply with the international       obligations of the Kigali Amendment under title II of the       Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies       Appropriations Act, 2021 (division G of Public Law 116-260),       which was enacted on December 27, 2020.        (7) As of the date of the introduction of the Act, the       President has not submitted the Kigali Amendment to the       Senate for advice  [[Page S2021]]       and consent and the United States Government has neither       ratified nor implemented policies to comply with the Kigali       Amendment.        (8) The Kigali Amendment, which has been ratified by 100       parties, entered into force on January 1, 2019.        (9) Adoption of the Kigali Amendment and United States'       ratification of and compliance with the Kigali Amendment is       supported broadly by affected industry stakeholders and       environmental public interest organizations.        (10) Industries in the United States that use and produce       fluorocarbons--        (A) contribute more than $158,000,000,000 annually in goods       and services to the economy of the United States; and        (B) employ more than 700,000 individuals, with an annual       industry-wide payroll of more than $32,000,000,000.        (11) Foreign competitors to United States chemical       refrigerant and refrigeration equipment based and operating       in countries that have ratified the Kigali Amendment and are       implementing policies in compliance with the Kigali Amendment       are gaining an advantage on United States based industries in       the manufacturing and used of next-generation chemicals and       equipment.        (12) The United States' ratification of the Kigali       Amendment--        (A) would support and promote the technological leadership       of the United States' industries to lead global production       and marketing of replacement refrigerants and equipment in       compliance with the Kigali Amendment; and        (B) according to industry analysis, would potentially       create approximately 33,000 new manufacturing jobs in the       United States and add approximately $12,500,000,000 per year       to the economy of the United States.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the President should immediately submit the Kigali       Amendment to the Senate for advice and consent; and        (2) the Senate should promptly provide its advice and       consent on the Kigali Amendment.

The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration       shall promulgate regulations establishing uniform policies       and take other necessary actions to implement the terms of       the Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International       Aviation (commonly known as ``CORSIA''), which was adopted by       International Civil Aviation Organization in October 2016 as       Assembly Resolution A39-3, and any amendments to such       Resolution with which the United States concurs, as means to       secure a single global carbon emissions market-based       mechanism to facilitate the participation of operators of       civil aircraft of the United States in international       aviation.       SEC. 205. SHORT-LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS.         (a) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) High-GWP hfc.--The term ``high-GWP HFC'' means newly       manufactured hydrofluorocarbons with a global warming       potential calculated over a 100-year period of greater than       150, as described in the Fifth Assessment Report of the       Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.        (2) Short-lived climate pollutants.--The term ``short-lived       climate pollutants'' means--        (A) black carbon;        (B) methane; and        (C) high-GWP HFC.        (b) In General.--The President shall direct the United       States representatives to appropriate international bodies       and conferences (including the United Nations Environment       Programme, the UNFCCC, the Montreal Protocol, the Arctic       Council, the Group of 7, the Group of 20, the Organization       for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), the       Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Asia Pacific       Economic Cooperation, the Arctic Council, the Climate and       Clean Air Coalition on Short-Lived Climate Pollutants, and       the Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture) to use the       voice, vote, and influence of the United States, consistent       with the broad foreign policy goals of the United States, to       advocate that each such body or conference--        (1) commit to significantly increasing efforts to reduce       short-lived climate pollutants;        (2) invest in and develop alternative energy sources,       industrial and agricultural processes, appliances, and       products to replace sources of short-lived climate       pollutants;        (3) enhance coordination with the private sector--        (A) to increase production and distribution of clean energy       alternatives, industrial processes, and products that will       replace sources of short-lived climate pollutants;        (B) to develop action plans to mitigate short-lived climate       pollutants from various private sector operations;        (C) to encourage best technology, methods, and management       practices for reducing short-lived climate pollutants;

(c) Enhancing International Outreach and Partnership of       United States Agencies Involved in Greenhouse Gas       Reductions.--        (1) Finding.--Congress recognizes the success of the United       States Climate Alliance and the greenhouse gas reduction       programs and strategies established by the Environmental       Protection Agency's Center for Corporate Climate Leadership.        (2) Authorization of efforts to build foreign       partnerships.--The Secretary of State shall work with the       Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to build       partnerships, as appropriate, with the governments of foreign       countries and to support international efforts to reduce       short-lived climate pollutants and combat climate change.        (d) Negotiation of New International Agreements and       Reassertion of Targets in Existing Agreements.--Not later       than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the       Secretary of State shall submit a report to Congress that--        (1) assesses the potential for negotiating new       international agreements, new targets within existing       international agreements or cooperative bodies, and the       creation of a new international forum to mitigate globally       short-lived climate pollutants to support the efforts       described in subsection (b);        (2) describes the provisions that could be included in such       agreements;        (3) assesses potential parties to such agreements;        (4) describes a process for reengaging with Canada and       Mexico regarding the methane targets agreed to at the 2016       North American Leaders' Summit; and        (5) describes a process for reengaging with the countries       of the Arctic Council regarding the methane and black carbon       targets that were negotiated in 2015 through the Framework       for Action.        (e) Consideration of Short-lived Climate Pollutants in       Negotiating International Agreements.--In negotiating any       relevant  [[Page S2022]]       international agreement with any country or countries after       the date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall--        (1) consider the impact short-lived climate pollutants are       having on the increase in global average temperatures and the       resulting global climate change;        (2) consider the effects that climate change is having on       the environment; and        (3) ensure that the agreement strengthens efforts to       eliminate short-lived climate pollutants from such country or       countries.       SEC. 206. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION REGARDING CLEAN                     TRANSPORTATION AND SUSTAINABLE LAND USE AND                     COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Agriculture, forestry, and other land use accounted for       24 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions during 2010,       which--        (A) is caused primarily from agriculture (cultivation of       crops and livestock) and deforestation; and        (B) does not take into account the carbon dioxide that       ecosystems remove from the atmosphere by sequestering carbon       in biomass, dead organic matter, and soils, which offset       approximately 20 percent of emissions from this sector.        (2) The transportation sector accounts for 14 percent of       global gas emissions and 28 percent of the United States'       greenhouse gas emissions.        (3) According to the National Center for Biotechnology       Information's report, ``National Mitigation Potential from       Natural Climate Solutions in the Tropics''--        (A) better land stewardship is needed to achieve the Paris       Agreement's temperature goal of holding the increase of       global average temperatures well below 2 degrees Celsius,       particularly in the tropics;        (B) as countries enhance their nationally determined       contributions, confusion persists about the potential       contribution of better land stewardship to meeting such goal;        (C) in 50 percent of the tropical countries, cost-effective       natural climate solutions could mitigate more than 50 percent       of national emissions;        (D) in more than 25 percent of the tropical countries, cost       effective natural climate solutions potential is greater than       national emissions; and        (E) natural climate solutions can transform national       economies and contribute to sustainable development goals.        (4) According to the International Energy Agency--        (A) global transport emissions increased by less than 0.5       percent in 2019 (compared with an average annual increase of       1.9 percent since 2000), owing to efficiency improvements,       electrification, and greater use of biofuels;        (B) transportation is responsible for 24 percent of direct       carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion;        (C) electric car deployment has grown rapidly since 2010,       with the global stock of electric passenger cars passing       5,000,000 in 2018 (an increase of 63 percent from the       previous year);        (D) in 2018--        (i) approximately 45 percent of all electric cars on the       road were in China;        (ii) approximately 24 percent of such cars were in Europe;       and        (iii) approximately 22 percent of such cars were in the       United States;        (E) existing measures to increase efficiency and reduce       energy demand must be deepened and extended for compliance       with the Sustainable Development Scenario of the       International Energy Agency's World Energy Model;        (F) prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, emissions from aviation       and shipping were increasing faster than all other       transportation modes; and        (G) energy demand and emissions have continued to rise in       all modes of road transport (cars, trucks, buses, and 2- and       3-wheelers), particularly in heavy-duty road freight       transport, which account for 75 percent of global       transportation sector emissions.        (5) The worldwide market share of sport utility vehicles       rose 15 percentage points between 2014 and 2019, and now       comprises 40 percent of the global light-duty vehicle market.        (6) China is the world's largest automobile market, with       more than 23,700,000 light vehicles sold in China in 2018. As       China's road network rapidly continues to expand, the number       of vehicle miles traveled per capita will most likely lead to       growth in China's transportation sector carbon dioxide       emissions.        (7) Even with India's advancement of policies to promote       electric vehicles and biofuels--        (A) India relies heavily on oil, and comprises 29 percent       of India's total energy consumption;        (B) prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, India was the world's       fastest growing aviation market, with passenger numbers for       domestic and international flights doubling since 2010;        (C) India is planning to build 100 new airports between       2020 and 2035, and industry analysts have projected up to       520,000,000 Indian air travelers annually by 2037; and        (D) the World Health Organization reports that 15 of the       cities worldwide with the worst air pollution are in India,       largely due to urban vehicle emissions.        (8) In 2013, Mexico became the first vehicle market in       Latin America to establish fuel economy or carbon dioxide       emissions standards.        (9) The Department of State, the National Highway Traffic       Safety Administration, and the Environmental Protection       Agency do not have a program in place to encourage other       countries to adopt standards that are compatible with United       States fuel economy and emissions standards.        (10) Many countries adopt European emissions standards       rather than United States standards, in part because of       European diplomatic engagement, disadvantaging United States       automakers in international markets.        (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United       States to partner, consult, and coordinate with foreign       governments, civil society, international financial       institutions, subnational communities, agribusiness and       automobile industry leaders, and the private sector in a       concerted effort--        (1) to raise awareness of--        (A) the greenhouse gas emission contributions from       agriculture, forestry, other land uses, and the       transportation sector to the annual total of anthropogenic       greenhouse gas emissions globally; and        (B) the importance of working cooperatively on the       development of multi-faceted and country specific policies       and strategies--        (i) to effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions from       agriculture, forestry, other land uses, and the       transportation sector; and        (ii) to promote economic growth, opportunities, sustainable       land management, and equitable access to mobility,       transportation services, and resources among all populations;        (2) to mitigate land use sector emissions through enhanced       land use planning, sustainable agriculture practices,       sustainable forest management, and community-led conservation       and development and other natural climate solutions;        (3) to use the voice and vote of the United States in       multilateral institutions to advance international efforts to       advance sustainable land-use planning, climate-smart       agriculture, sustainable forest management, and community-led       conservation and development;        (4) to improve the reliability and sustainability of       transportation systems, particularly in developing countries,       through a focus on mitigating carbon emissions, improving       health and safety outcomes through improved land use and       community design, and improved mobility for all populations;        (5) to promote collaboration regarding international       research and development in--        (A) zero-emission vehicles;        (B) sustainable urban development and smart growth; and        (C) advanced low carbon biofuels for transportation;        (6) to facilitate and support the ability of parties to the       Paris Agreement to more accurately monitor, record, and       report transportation sector emissions;        (7) to develop greater cooperation among parties for       strengthening the rules and ambition of the Paris Agreement's       mitigation targets for transportation sector emissions;        (8) to improve the structural integrity of critical       transportation infrastructure to withstand current and       forecasted effects of climate change and support community       resilience, improved access to jobs, and adaptability to the       effects of climate change; and        (9) to explore new opportunities or seek enhanced       initiatives within existing multilateral and bilateral       agreements to develop mechanisms and policies for reducing       transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions.        (c) International Cooperation.--In implementing the policy       described in subsection (b), the President should direct the       United States representatives to appropriate international       bodies to use the influence of the United States, consistent       with the broad foreign policy goals of the United States, to       advocate that each such body--        (1) promote transportation sector investment in--        (A) electric vehicles and other low and zero carbon       transportation technologies; and        (B) sustainable land use development that incorporates--        (i) multi-modal transportation designs aimed at reducing--         (I) traffic congestion;        (II) carbon emissions from motor vehicles;        (III) travel times between high volume destinations within       a community;        (IV) vehicle crashes and other threats to motorist and       pedestrian safety; and        (V) stormwater runoff from impervious road surfaces,       vehicle conflicts with wildlife, habitat destruction, and       other forms of environmental degradation commonly associated       with roads and motor vehicles;         (ii) multi-use community designs and dense development that       accounts for locating residential development near essential       goods, services, and job opportunities (to reduce individual       reliance of motorized personal transportation);        (iii) transportation systems designed--         (I) to maximize the safety of all users; and        (II) to reduce the probability of motorized vehicle       crashes, including motorized vehicle crashes that injure or       kill pedestrians and bicyclists;         (2) strive to improve mobility by advancing equitable       access to transportation services among all populations,       particularly historically underserved or marginalized       populations and communities;        (3) improve environmental quality and community health       outcomes through--  [[Page S2023]]         (A) safer and more efficient multi-modal transportation       systems that reduce vehicle pollution and congestion;        (B) reductions in the amount of impervious surfaces; and        (C) integration of safe pedestrian and bicycling       infrastructure;        (4) addresses unique transportation and economic needs of       countries' diverse populations and communities in ways that       also support a country's achievement of ambitious greenhouse       gas mitigation commitments;        (5) enhance coordination and engagement with private sector       stakeholders;        (6) provide technical assistance to foreign regulatory       authorities and governments to remove barriers to investment       in transportation systems, infrastructure and electric       vehicles and low and zero carbon fuels; and        (7) use clear, accountable, and metric-based targets to       measure the effectiveness of such projects.        (d) Vehicle Fuel Economy and CO2 Emissions       Diplomacy Initiative.--        (1) Development.--The Secretary of State, in consultation       with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of       Transportation, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the       Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, shall       develop a Vehicle Fuel Economy and CO2 Emissions       Diplomacy Initiative to promote the worldwide adoption of       vehicle fuel economy and vehicle carbon dioxide emissions       standards that are compatible with United States standards.        (2) Responsibilities and duties.--        (A) Diplomatic efforts.--The Secretary of State shall lead       diplomatic efforts to encourage foreign governments to adopt       vehicle fuel economy standards and vehicle carbon dioxide       emissions standards.        (B) Technical assistance.--The Administrator of the       National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the       Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall       provide technical assistance to other countries to help such       countries to develop new standards, testing regimes, and       compliance strategies.        (3) Program scope.--The Vehicle Fuel Economy and       CO2 Emissions Diplomacy Initiative should--        (A) have the goal of reducing oil consumption by at least       2,000,000 barrels per day by 2030, in addition to the       reduction anticipated by the implementation of standards in       existence as of the date of the enactment of this Act;        (B) include input in developing the program from leaders in       United States industry; and        (C) focus special attention on Latin America.       SEC. 207. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES REENGAGEMENT                     WITH THE GROUP OF SEVEN AND THE GROUP OF TWENTY                     ON CLIMATE ACTION.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) President Trump has abstained from several heads of       state meetings on climate action and cooperation with the       heads of state from countries comprising the Group of Seven       (referred to in this section as the ``G7'') and the Group of       Twenty (referred to in this section as the ``G20'').        (2) The G7 summit held in Charlevoix, Quebec in June 2018       produced a climate action communique that was signed by the       heads of state from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,       and the United Kingdom, but was not signed by the United       States.        (3) The G7 climate action communique states, ``Canada,       France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the       European Union reaffirm their strong commitment to implement       the Paris Agreement, through ambitious climate action, in       particular through reducing emissions while stimulating       innovation, enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening and       financing resilience and reducing vulnerability; as well as       ensuring a just transition, including increasing efforts to       mobilize climate finance from a wide variety of sources.''.        (4) In 2019, the United States blocked the G7 from making       any new or additional commitments on climate change, to the       expressed disappointment and frustration of the other six       heads of state.        (5) The G7, without the active participation of the United       States, continues to work together to fulfill clean energy       commitments on initiatives such as the 2014 Rome Initiative       for Energy Security, the 2015 Hamburg Initiative for       Sustainable Energy Security, the 2016 Kitakyushu Initiative       on Energy Security for Global Growth, and the Africa       Renewable Energy Initiative. However, United States       objections to global cooperative climate action have       prevented the G7 from undertaking new clean energy and       climate action initiatives in recent years.        (6) The 2018 Buenos Aires Leaders Declaration by the G20--        (A) recognizes the risks that climate change poses to       global security, global health, and economic development; and        (B) affirms the significance of the Paris Agreement.        (7) The United States insisted on the inclusion of a       statement in the G20 Buenos Aires Leaders Declaration, for       which the United States was the only subscriber, expressing       dissenting opinions on international climate action       cooperation and equivocation on ``utilizing all energy       sources and technologies, while protecting the environment''.        (8) In 2019, the G20 narrowly avoided concluding without a       leaders' declaration, when the President unsuccessfully tried       to pressure the other 19 heads of state to weaken commitments       on combating climate change in the 2019 G20 Osaka Leaders       Declaration, leaving the United States to provide a       dissenting provision articulating its outlier position on       climate action in the Declaration.

SEC. 303. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES ENGAGEMENTS AT                     THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) In 2020, the World Economic Forum (referred to in this       section as the ``WEF'') in Davos, Switzerland, put addressing       the climate crisis at the top of its agenda. World and       business leaders reinforced the need for urgent action to       avoid human destruction from the clear and present climate       crisis.        (2) At the 2020 annual meeting of the WEF, the President,       accompanied by the Secretary of the Treasury, delivered a       contrarian message, claiming, ``To embrace the possibilities       of tomorrow, we must reject the perennial prophets of doom       and their predictions of the apocalypse.''.        (3) Nevertheless, the WEF, without support from the United       States, announced climate initiatives on sustainable markets,       reaching carbon neutrality on insurance investment       portfolios, decarbonizing the automotive sector through       circular economies, and transitioning to healthier, more       sustainable food systems.        (4) The one initiative the United States did agree to join       is the Trillion Tree Campaign, which aims to grow, restore,       and conserve 1 trillion trees by 2030.        (5) The President's dismissal of the threat climate change       poses to economic growth and global security has isolated the       United States from the 117 represented countries at the WEF       that support its climate agenda and are accelerating their       national commitments in other international fora to address       climate change.

(a) In General.--The President shall develop a strategy to       seek opportunities for trilateral cooperation between the       United States, Mexico, and Canada--        (1) to support increased ambition on reducing greenhouse       gas emissions among these countries; and        (2) to advance collaboration on the development and       promotion of shared climate action goals and interests within       multilateral bodies and conferences, including aligning, to       the extent possible, the voices, votes, and influence,       consistent with the broad foreign policy goals of the United       States, to address issues related to climate change and clean       energy development.        (b) Elements and Priorities.--The strategy described in       subsection (a) shall include efforts--        (1) to ensure that potential projects and investments       pursued under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement--        (A) are compatible with long-term climate goals and the       collective targets established under the Paris Agreement; and        (B) meet all environmental and social responsibility       standards required under the USMCA;        (2) to explore shared and common interests and cooperative       actions to promote clean energy development, climate       security, and climate change mitigation strategies within       institutions (such as the UNFCCC, the Montreal Protocol, the       Green Climate Fund, the Group of Twenty and the United       Nations) with programs, initiatives and actions to address       the climate crisis that may include--        (A) providing support in developing mid-century low-carbon       strategies;        (B) extending coal finance restrictions to coal mining       operations; and        (C) strengthening and expanding carbon pricing by--        (i) considering the cost of carbon in long-term decision       making;        (ii) supporting the development of national or subnational       systems;        (iii) sharing technical expertise; and        (iv) making efforts to align pricing instruments where       feasible;        (3) to commit to a methane reduction goal and cooperate to       reduce black carbon and to recommit to the formal agreement       reached at the June 2016 North American Leaders Summit in       Ottawa to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas       sector by 40 to 45 percent by 2025, and to work to develop a       new, more ambitious target for 2030;        (4) develop and implement a North American strategy for       sustainable transportation--        (A) to encourage State and provincial leaders to negotiate       interstate and interprovincial sustainable transportation       agreements between Mexican, American, and Canadian       jurisdictions;        (B) to expand the West Coast Electric Highway between       Canada, the United States, and Mexico; and        (C) to work with automakers to standardize charging       infrastructure;        (5) develop and implement coordinated forest and land use       strategies to further contribute to emissions mitigation       through the adoption of practices and policies that increase       carbon sequestration in new and existing forests and reduce       emissions from forest conversion to other land uses;        (6) strengthen resilience and equity among low-income and       indigenous communities; and        (7) engage international partners in an existing       multilateral forum or, if necessary, establish a new       multilateral forum to improve global cooperation by--        (A) encouraging the adoption of an emissions reduction       target by the International Maritime Organization; and        (B) collaborating with the International Civil Aviation       Organization to establish a market-based measure to reduce       aviation emissions.       SEC. 502. ACCOUNTABILITY AND COOPERATION WITH CHINA.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) successful mitigation of global greenhouse gas       emissions to sufficiently avoid the worst forecasted effects       of climate change requires global cooperation and       coordination of efforts;        (2) all other countries look towards the United States and       China, as the world's largest emitters and largest economies,       for leadership by example to effectively mitigate  [[Page S2030]]       greenhouse gas emissions, develop and deploy energy       generation technologies, and integrate sustainable adaptation       solutions to the inevitable effects of climate change;        (3) given the volume of China's greenhouse gas emissions       and the scientific imperative to swiftly reduce global       greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero emissions around 2050,       China should--        (A) revise its long-term pledge;        (B) seek to immediately peak its emissions;        (C) begin reducing its greenhouse gas emissions       significantly to meet a more ambitious long-term 2050       reductions target; and        (D) update its nationally determined contribution along a       trajectory that aligns with achieving a more ambitious net-      zero by 2050 emissions target;        (4) it is in the United States' national interest to       prioritize climate change in its bilateral engagement with       China, as global climate risks cannot be mitigated without a       significant reduction in Chinese domestic and overseas       emissions;        (5) the United States and China, to the extent practicable,       should coordinate on making and delivering ambitious pledges       to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with aspirations towards       achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050;        (6) the United States and its allies should work together,       using diplomatic and economic tools, to hold China       accountable for any failure by China--        (A) to increase ambition in its 2030 nationally determined       contribution, in line with net zero greenhouse gas emissions       by 2050 before the 26th Conference of the Parties to the       UNFCCC scheduled for November 2021 and meeting a more       ambitious nationally determined contribution;        (B) to work faithfully to uphold the principles, goals, and       rules of the Paris Agreement;        (C) to avoid and prohibit efforts to undermine or devolve       the Paris Agreement's rule or underlying framework,       particularly within areas of accountability transparency, and       shared responsibility among all parties;        (D) to eliminate greenhouse gas intensive projects from       China's Belt and Road Initiative and other overseas       investments, including--        (i) working with allies and partners of the United States       to eliminate support for coal power production projects in       China's Belt and Road Initiative;        (ii) providing financing and project support for cleaner       and less risky alternatives; and        (iii) undertaking ``parallel initiatives'' to enhance       capacity building programs and overseas sustainable       investment criteria, including in areas such as integrated       energy planning, power sector reform, just transition,       distributed generation, procurement, transparency, and       standards to support low-emissions growth in developing       countries; and        (E) to phase out existing coal power plants and reduce net       coal power production;        (7) the United States should pursue confidence-building       opportunities for the United States and China to undertake       ``parallel initiatives'' on clean energy research,       development, finance, and deployment, including through       economic and stimulus measures with clear, mutually agreed       upon rules and policies to protect intellectual property,       ensure equitable, nonpunitive provision of support, and       verify implementation, which would provide catalytic progress       towards delivering a global clean energy transformation that       benefits all people; and        (8) the United States should pursue cooperative initiatives       to shift toward the import and consummation of forest and       agricultural commodities that are produced in a manner that       does not contribute to deforestation.       SEC. 503. UNITED STATES AND EUROPEAN UNION COOPERATION ON                     CLIMATE FINANCE FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.         (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is--        (1) to restore the historic alliance between the United       States and countries of the European Union on climate action;       and        (2) to renew the United States' commitment to advancing       global cooperation on addressing climate change and achieving       the goals of the Paris Agreement.        (b) Sense of Congress Regarding the United States-European       Union Security and Development Dialogue.--It is the sense of       Congress that the United States should restart the United       States-European Union Security and Development Dialogue to       focus specifically on climate action, climate security, and       clean energy cooperation, including--        (1) partnering and formulating strategies to counter       efforts to weaken or change critical elements of the       implementation of the Paris Agreement that would disadvantage       the United States or the European Union;        (2) building coalitions of like-minded parties committed to       achieving large reductions in greenhouse gas emissions under       the Paris Agreement and putting pressure on all parties to do       the same;        (3) coordination on joint strategies to promote climate       action by the People's Republic of China, and deter Chinese       domestic and international investment in high carbon       infrastructure;        (4) finding opportunities to engage and facilitate private       sector collaboration regarding clean energy and innovations       on greenhouse gas emissions reductions;        (5) exploring the creation of United States-European Union       clean energy and climate adaptation, development, and finance       mechanisms to support and leverage private sector investment       in projects and activities to improve developing countries'       resilience capacities, ability to adapt and thrive in the       face of the effects of climate change and clean energy       development;        (6) scientific research, modeling, forecasting, and data       collaboration to improve global understanding and preparation       for the compounding effects of climate change; and        (7) intelligence sharing.        (c) Development Finance Cooperation.--        (1) In general.--The President should seek opportunities to       partner with European Development Finance Institutions to       develop financing tools based on shared development finance       criteria and mechanisms to support investments in developing       countries that support low carbon economic development and       promote climate change resiliency and adaptation        (2) Partnership fund.--The Chief Executive Officer of the       United States International Development Finance Corporation       should partner with the European Bank for Reconstruction and       Development to create a fund or multilateral financing       mechanism to support clean energy development and climate       change adaptation and resilience activities in developing       countries.        (3) Response to the people's republic of china's belt and       road initiative.--The President shall work with European       counterparts to establish a formal United States-European       Commission Working Group to develop a comprehensive strategy       to respond to the Belt and Road Initiative established by the       Government of the People's Republic of China. United States       participants in this proposed working group shall seek to       integrate existing efforts into the strategy, including--        (A) the European Union Strategy on Connecting Europe and       Asia;        (B) the Three Seas Initiative;        (C) the Blue Dot Network among the United States, Japan,       and Australia;        (D) a European Union-Japan initiative that has leveraged       $65,000,000,000 for infrastructure projects and emphasizes       transparency standards; and        (E) efforts to address the Government of the People's       Republic of China's use of the United Nations to advance the       Belt and Road Initiative, including the proliferation of       memoranda of understanding between the People's Republic of       China and United Nations funds and programs on the       implementation of the Belt and Road Initiative.

SEC. 506. CARIBBEAN ENERGY INITIATIVE.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The countries of the Caribbean are heavily reliant upon       imported oil to provide for approximately 90 percent of their       energy production.        (2) The level of dependence is even higher including--        (A) Jamaica, which relies on oil for 95.9 percent of its       electricity;        (B) Barbados, which relies on oil for 96 percent of its       electricity;        (C) The Virgin Islands, which relies on oil for nearly 100       percent of its electricity; and        (D) St. Lucia, which relies on oil for 100 percent of its       electricity.        (3) Overreliance on imported fossil fuels has had a       detrimental effect on economic development, growth, and       competitiveness in the Caribbean.        (4) Since 1970, more than 80 percent of Caribbean coral       reefs have been lost due to coastal development and       pollution. Soot particulates and climate change caused by       burning fossil fuels have seriously damaged coral reefs,       which are a significant source of tourism dollars, fishing,       biodiversity, and natural beauty.        (5) Air pollution caused by burning oil for electricity--        (A) has serious health impacts in the form of higher rates       of asthma and other lung ailments; and        (B) can also exacerbate climate change.        (6) The Caribbean region is particularly vulnerable to sea       level rise and stronger storms        (7) Between 2005 and 2018, the dependence of the countries       of the Caribbean on oil was perpetuated by the Venezuelan-led       Petrocaribe oil alliance, which--        (A) offered preferential terms for oil sales; and        (B) supplies some countries with up to 40 percent of their       energy production needs.        (8) The ongoing domestic economic crisis and political       turmoil in Venezuela has forced the Government of Venezuela       to retract its commitments to the Petrocaribe oil alliance       and step away as a regional power. Only Cuba still receives       preferential Petrocaribe pricing on fuel exports from       Venezuela, while other Petrocaribe member countries are       experiencing a destabilized flow of oil.        (9) China has spent more than $244,000,000,000 on energy       projects worldwide since 2000, 25 percent of which was spent       in Latin America and the Caribbean. Although the majority of       this spending was for oil, gas, and coal, China has also been       the largest investor in clean energy globally for almost a       decade.        (10) The World Bank estimates that the Caribbean will need       $12,000,000,000 in power investments through 2035.        (11) Renewable energy technology costs have decreased       dramatically in recent years, offering a more viable economic       alternative for energy production. Solar energy prices have       fallen by 80 percent since 2008, causing significant market       growth, and according to data released by the International       Renewable Energy Agency, 1/3 of global power capacity is       based in renewable energy.        (12) In 2016, the International Monetary Fund estimated       that transportation accounted for 36 percent of the total       primary energy consumed in the Caribbean subregion.        (13) According to the United Nations Environment Programme,       Latin America and the Caribbean could achieve annual savings       of $621,000,000,000 and a reduction of 1,100,000,000 tons of       CO2 by 2050 if the region's energy and transport sectors       reach net zero emissions.        (14) The Caribbean has an abundance of onshore and offshore       resources needed for renewable energy, including sun, wind,       geothermal, and some hydropower production capacity.        (15) The United States Government is deeply engaged in       providing technical and policy assistance to countries of the       Caribbean on energy issues through--        (A) the Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas;        (B) Connecting the Americas 2022; and        (C) bilateral assistance programs.        (16) On February 19, 2014, at the North American Leaders'       Summit, President Barack Obama, Prime Minister Stephen Harper       of Canada, and President Enrique Pena Nieto of Mexico       reaffirmed their commitment to bring affordable, reliable,       and increasingly renewable power to the Caribbean, while       opening wider markets for clean energy and green technology.        (17) On June 19, 2015, President Barack Obama announced the       Caribbean Energy Security Initiative, which would partner       with individual countries--        (A) to transform its energy sector;        (B) to work to increase access to finance, good governance,       and diversification; and        (C) to maximize the impact of existing donor effects.        (18) On May 4, 2016, at the United States-Caribbean-Central       American Energy Summit, the energy security task force       formally launched the Caribbean Sustainable Energy Roadmap       and Strategy (C-SERMS) as a mechanism to manage regional       coordination and action on energy security and agreed to       expand the regional market and transmission system.        (19) The United States has an important opportunity--        (A) to deepen this engagement;        (B) to work as a partner with Caribbean countries on a more       regional and coordinated basis;        (C) to help ease the region's dependence on imported oil;       and  [[Page S2032]]         (D) to promote affordable alternative sources of energy.        (b) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Caribbean countries.--The term ``Caribbean countries''       means countries in the Caribbean region, but does not       including Cuba or Venezuela.        (2) Caribbean governments.--The term ``Caribbean       governments'' means the national governments of the Caribbean       countries.        (c) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to help       Caribbean countries--        (1) achieve greater energy security and improve domestic       energy resource mobilization;        (2) lower their dependence on imported fuels;        (3) eliminate the use of diesel, heavy fuel oil, other       petroleum products, and coal for the generation of       electricity;        (4) increase production of renewable energy; and        (5) meet the greenhouse gas mitigation goals of their       national determined contributions to the Paris Agreement.        (d) Strategy.--        (1) Submission.--Not later than 120 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall       submit a multi-year strategy to the Committee on Foreign       Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs       of the House of Representatives that describes how the       Department of State will promote regional cooperation with       Caribbean countries--        (A) to lower dependence on imported fuels, grow domestic       clean energy production in the region, strengthen regional       energy security, and lower energy sector greenhouse gas       emissions;        (B) to decrease dependence on oil in the transportation       sector;        (C) to increase energy efficiency, energy conservation, and       investment in alternatives to imported fuels;        (D) to improve grid reliability and modernize electricity       transmission networks;        (E) to advance deployment of innovative solutions to expand       community and individuals' access to electricity;        (F) to help reform energy markets to encourage good       regulatory governance and to promote a climate of private       sector investment; and        (G) to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from the energy       and transportation sector.        (2) Elements.--The strategy required under subsection (a)       shall include--        (A) a thorough review and inventory of United States       Government activities that are being carried out bilaterally,       regionally, and in coordination with multilateral       institutions--        (i) to promote energy and climate security in the Caribbean       region; and        (ii) to reduce the region's reliance on oil for electricity       generation;        (B) opportunities for marshaling regional cooperation--        (i) to overcome market barriers resulting from the small       size of Caribbean energy markets;        (ii) to address the high transportation and infrastructure       costs faced by Caribbean countries;        (iii) to ensure greater donor coordination between       governments, multilateral institutions, multilateral banks,       and private investors; and        (iv) to expand regional financing opportunities to allow       for lower cost energy entrepreneurship;        (C) measures to ensure that each Caribbean government has--        (i) an independent utility regulator or equivalent;        (ii) affordable access by third party investors to its       electrical grid with minimal regulatory interference;        (iii) effective energy efficiency and energy conservation;        (iv) programs to address technical and nontechnical issues;        (v) a plan to eliminate major market distortions;        (vi) cost-reflective tariffs; and        (vii) no tariffs or other taxes on clean energy solutions;       and        (D) recommendations for how United States policy,       technical, and economic assistance can be used in the       Caribbean region--        (i) to advance renewable energy development and the       incorporation of renewable technologies into existing energy       grids and the development and deployment of micro-grids where       appropriate and feasible to boost energy security and       reliability, particularly to underserved communities;        (ii) to increase the generation of clean energy       sufficiently to replace and allow for the retirement of       obsolete fossil fuel energy generation units in Caribbean       countries;        (iii) to create regional financing opportunities to allow       for lower cost energy entrepreneurship;        (iv) to deploy transaction advisors in the region to help       attract private investment and break down any market or       regulatory barriers; and        (v) to establish a mechanism for each host government to       have access to independent legal advice--         (I) to speed the development of energy-related contracts;       and        (II) to better protect the interests of Caribbean       governments and citizens.         (3) Consultation.--In devising the strategy under this       subsection, the Secretary of State shall work with the       Secretary of Energy and shall consult with--        (A) the Secretary of the Interior;        (B) the Secretary of Commerce;        (C) the Secretary of the Treasury;        (D) the Board of Directors of the Export-Import Bank of the       United States;        (E) the Board of Directors of the Development Finance       Corporation;        (F) the Administrator of the United States Agency for       International Development;        (G) the Caribbean governments;        (H) the Inter-American Development Bank;        (I) the World Bank Group; and        (J) the Caribbean Electric Utility Services Corporation.       SEC. 507. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON CONSERVATION OF THE AMAZON                     RIVER BASIN.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The Amazon River basin and the Amazon rainforest, often       referred to as Amazonia--        (A) covers more than 2,670,000 square miles in Bolivia,       Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru,       Suriname, and Venezuela; and        (B) is home to more species of plants and animals than any       other terrestrial ecosystem on the planet, housing nearly 30       percent of the world's species, which apart from their       intrinsic value as living organisms, have potential value in       the form of medicine, research, textiles, food, and other       products for the region's population.        (2) Tens of millions of people depend on services afforded       by the Amazon forest, including--        (A) the use of rivers for transportation;        (B) reliance on logging and collection of non-timber forest       products as major industries for employment; and        (C) the cultivation of nutrients in floodplain areas for       agriculture and areas for which the Amazon Basin is a       watershed.        (3) The Amazon River has long been recognized as an       important repository of biodiversity and natural resources,       not only for local peoples and indigenous communities, but       also for the rest of the world due to--        (A) its fresh water, which provides countless services for       humans in the form of water agriculture, transportation, and       food and serves as an important habitat for countless       species, including over 2,500 species of fish and river       dolphins;        (B) its medicinal plants, which are continually used by       local peoples to treat traditional diseases, including       malaria (one of the most lethal diseases in the tropics), and       which constitute 70 percent of the plant species in the world       found to have anti-cancer properties;        (C) its important role as an oxygen source, producing 20       percent of the Earth's oxygen and earning the Amazon forest       the nickname ``lungs of our Earth'' for its role in taking in       enormous amounts of the carbon dioxide emitted by human       activity and the burning of fossil fuels and replacing it       with the oxygen we breathe through the process of       photosynthesis;        (D) its food supply, which is associated with rainforests,       including coffee, rice, chocolate, tomatoes, potatoes,       bananas, black pepper, pineapples, and corn;        (E) its role in climate control caused by its exchange of       enormous quantities of water and energy with the surrounding       atmosphere, which is estimated as being responsible for       creating 75 percent of its own rainfall, which feeds the       nearby rivers through evapotranspiration before flowing       directly into the ocean and influencing the currents that       impact the climate; and        (F) ecotourism, which produces annual profits of more than       $11,600,000, which benefits the local economy, enhances the       quality of living through securing more jobs, and educates       global citizens regarding the importance of maintaining the       world's natural spaces.        (4) Public opinion research, conducted by the Brazilian       polling firm Datafolha in 2020, found that--        (A) 87 percent of the respondents felt strongly that       conservation of the Amazon is very important;        (B) 73 percent of the respondents are concerned with the       rate of increased deforestation in the Amazon basin;        (C) 77 percent of the respondents believed strongly that       the conduct and policies of the ministries responsible for       management and conservation of the Amazon have contributed to       deforestation in the Amazon;        (D) 92.5 percent of the respondents believe Brazil should       prioritize the pursuit of economic activities in the Amazon       basin that do not contribute to deforestation; and        (E) only 5.6 percent of the respondents think that forests       need to be cut down to promote economic growth in the region.        (5) The recent 8,850 square kilometer reduction of the       Amazon forest, exacerbated by climate change, has resulted in       a significant decrease in the ample benefits described in       paragraph (3), in addition to the displacement of many       indigenous peoples due to the lessened economic opportunity.        (6) Clear cutting has disrupted the habitat for plants and       animals in the region, fracturing the fragile forest ecology       by causing species to migrate and sometimes disappear.        (7) As of September 2020, Brazil's National Institute for       Space Research reported that 45,067 fires have burned in the       Amazon River basin and more than 63,000 fires have burned in       all of Brazil in 2020.        (8) The removal of trees from the Amazon River basin has       decreased water and nutrient uptake, while increasing runoff       with greater  [[Page S2033]]       loads of both nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations,       deteriorating the quality of fresh water, and putting the       environment at greater risk for disasters like flooding and       landslides.        (9) The Government of Brazil has historically recognized       the negative repercussions of deforestation via processes       like clear cutting, which had facilitated Brazil's       establishment and maintenance of numerous successful       conservation policies and payments for environmental service       programs, such as--        (A) Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest       Degradation projects, such as the Juma project in Amazonas       and the Surui project in Acre and subnational-scale program       in Acre and Mato Grosso, which seek to reduce global warming       by stopping emissions related to deforestation;        (B) jurisdictional programs involving the collaboration of       several groups, including farmers, government officials,       businesses, and nongovernmental organizations, to achieve       consensus on sustainability milestones;        (C) the Amazon Fund, which is primarily funded by the       Government of Norway to implement payments for forest       conservation activities; and        (D) the Bolsa Floresta program in the Brazilian state of       Amazonas, which pays landowners and communities to help       protect forest areas.        (10) United States and multilateral cooperation efforts to       protect and restore the Amazon have yielded significant       beneficial impacts, such as--        (A) the reduction of deforestation by more than 80 percent;       and        (B) the World Bank's establishment of more than 25 percent       of the areas protected from correspondence.        (11) The UNESCO World Heritage site verifies the importance       of the Amazon River basin being one of the richest areas in       the planet in terms of biodiversity, ecological and       biological processes. Deforestation and potential new       policies could harmfully limit its natural resources if their       benefits are not taken into serious consideration.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the President should--        (A) engage with the Government of Brazil, through bilateral       and multilateral efforts, on its Amazon development and       deforestation policies, in support of the Brazilian people's       and the private sector's interest in conserving the Amazon       rainforest;        (B) promote stewardship and conservation policies that       support sustainable economic growth activities in the Amazon       River basin;        (C) consider the Government of Brazil's management and land       use conversion of the Amazon River basin policies when       assessing, negotiating, or developing new bilateral       agreements with Brazil, including trade agreements, or       engaging in relevant international forums;        (D) in the spirit of Brazil's leadership hosting the 1992       Rio Summit, which led to the establishment of the UNFCCC,       urge the Government of Brazil to enhance the ambition of       Brazil's efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions; and        (E) encourage the Government of Brazil, through bilateral       and multilateral efforts, to immediately work proactively to       address climate change and to promote low carbon and       sustainable economic development;        (2) the United States Ambassador to Brazil should       immediately engage with the Government of Brazil to support       improvements to stewardship efforts of the Amazon rainforest       and to assist with urgent efforts to combat fires burning       across the Amazon River basin by--        (A) amplifying the Brazilian people's concerns--        (i) about climate change and seeking opportunities for       cooperative climate action through the United States-Brazil       bilateral relationship; and        (ii) with Brazil's management and land use conversion       policies affecting the Amazon River basin;        (B) reinforcing United States' support for the important       role civil society is playing to keep the public informed       about the importance of Amazon conservation, particularly as       it relates to regulating carbon in the Earth's atmosphere;       and        (C) offering support for efforts to combat fires in the       Amazon River basin that are exacerbating Brazil's       environmental crisis; and        (3) the Secretary of the Treasury should provide financial       and technical assistance to combat wildfires burning across       the Brazil, including in the Amazon River basin.        (c) Policy Statement.--The Secretary of State shall elevate       bilateral engagements around cooperation and peer-to-peer       accountability on Brazil's climate action commitments by--        (1) supporting the efforts of the Government of Brazil to       increase sustainable development of the Amazon region,       including by strengthening environmental enforcement and       ending illegal deforestation;        (2) encouraging the Government of Brazil to enforce its       conservation laws, which include--        (A) restoring the responsibility of managing indigenous       reserves and the demarcation of lands back to indigenous       peoples;        (B) deescalating violence against indigenous peoples,       prosecuting individuals and entities that threaten or harm       indigenous peoples or communities, and maintain the National       Indian Foundation;        (C) addressing activities that increase deforestation rates       in the Amazon basin, which include--        (i) curtailing indigenous people's land rights; and        (ii) unsustainable cattle ranching, soy bean farming,       mining, hydropower dam construction, and highway construction       activities;        (D) threatening to degrade Brazil's carbon emissions       reductions commitments that are heavily based upon the       conservation of Brazil's rainforests; and        (E) addressing challenges for civil society to operate,       oversee, and advocate for the continued conservation and       restoration of the Amazon River basin;        (3) encouraging, to the maximum extent practicable, the       Government of Brazil to develop and deliver ambitious pledges       to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement,       while holding Brazil accountable for delivering on its       commitments;        (4) supporting the voice of Brazilian civil society and the       role civil society plays in advancing civil society's efforts       to protect Brazil's natural resources and helping ensure       civil society's abilities to operate, oversee, and advocate       for the continued conservation and restoration of the Amazon       River basin;        (5) advancing the rights and protections of indigenous       peoples whose communities, well-being, and opportunities for       economic growth are frequently put at risk by deforestation,       extractive industries, commercial scale agriculture, and       hydropower dam construction;        (6) listening to and engaging with the people of Brazil on       their country's commitments to advancing conservation efforts       in the Amazon River basin that allow for sustainable economic       growth, while protecting the Amazon rainforest and Amazon       River basin's important and unique resources despite the       proposed changes;        (7) renewing support for programs that support Amazonian       nations, civil society, and local leaders, including       indigenous communities, in maintaining critically important       conservation efforts to protect and restore the Amazon River       basin ecosystem; and        (8) supporting efforts by subnational governments and the       private sector to advance sustainable development and reduce       deforestation in the Amazon region.       SEC. 508. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING RENEWABLE ENERGY IN                     INDONESIA.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) cooperation on the development and deployment of       renewable energy technologies should be a priority in       relations between the United States and Indonesia and the top       priority in the countries' energy diplomacy;        (2) it is in the interest of United States to support the       growth of Indonesia's renewable energy sector in       environmentally and socially responsible ways that--        (A) reduce reliance on fossil fuels in ways that do not       increase pressure on the land sector or increase land-based       emissions;        (B) mitigate greenhouse gas emissions;        (C) provide economic opportunities; and        (D) improve the climate security of Indonesia;        (3) the United States, through the Bureau of Energy       Resources of the Department of State, the United States       International Development Finance Corporation, the Department       of Energy, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, the       International Trade Administration, and the United States       Agency for International Development, should encourage       private sector investment in and financing for the       development and deployment of renewable power sources in       Indonesia;        (4) the United States should--        (A) support and encourage Indonesia to pursue ambitious       growth from solar and wind sources of energy generation; and        (B) provide technical assistance to the Government of       Indonesia and subnational authorities on regulatory reforms       and addressing other barriers to deployment of renewable       energy; and        (5) it is in the interest of United States refrigeration       and refrigerant production industries to help serve       Indonesia's increased demand for refrigeration and air       conditioning, and the adoption of the Kigali Amendment to the       Montreal Protocol, is driving innovation and investments in       next-generation refrigeration equipment and refrigerants in       Indonesia.                   TITLE VI--WOMEN AND CLIMATE CHANGE ACT       SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.         This title may be cited as the ``Women and Climate Change       Act''.       SEC. 602. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Women in the United States and around the world are--        (A) the linchpin of families and communities; and        (B) often the first to feel the immediate and adverse       effects of social, environmental, and economic stresses on       their families and communities.        (2) The United Nations has recognized, as a central       organizing principle for its work, that ``no enduring       solution to society's most threatening social, economic and       political problems can be found without the full       participation, and the full empowerment, of the world's       women.''.        (3) The United Nations Development Programme's Human       Development Report 2013 predicted that the number of people       living in extreme poverty could increase by up to  [[Page S2034]]       3,000,000,000 by 2050 unless environmental disasters are       averted by coordinated global action.        (4) Climate change is already forcing the most vulnerable       communities and populations in developing countries to face       unprecedented climate stress, including--        (A) slow onset effects of climate change, such as sea level       rise, increasing temperatures, water scarcity, and drought;       and        (B) severe weather events and floods, which can lead to       reduced agricultural productivity, food insecurity, and       increased disease.        (5) Climate change--        (A) exacerbates issues of resource scarcity and lack of       accessibility to primary natural resources, forest resources,       and arable land for food production;        (B) contributes to increased tension and instability,       particularly in countries and regions with poor or weak       governance systems; and        (C) increases the workload and stresses on women farmers,       who are estimated to produce nearly 50 percent of the food       consumed in most developing countries, which exacerbates food       insecurity.        (6) Women will disproportionately face harmful impacts from       climate change, particularly in poor and developing countries       in which women regularly assume increased responsibility       for--        (A) growing the family's food;        (B) collecting water, fuel, and other resources;        (C) earning money; and        (D) sending remittances.        (7) Epidemics, such as malaria and Zika, are expected to       worsen and spread due to variations in climate, putting women       and girls (especially those who are pregnant, who are       lactating, or who hope to become pregnant) and children       without access to prevention and medical services at risk.        (8) The direct and indirect effects of climate change have       a disproportionate impact on marginalized women, including       refugees, displaced persons, migrants, religious, racial, or       ethnic minorities, adolescent girls, lesbian and trans women,       women living in poverty, and women and girls with       disabilities and those infected with HIV.        (9) Conflict has a disproportionate impact on the most       vulnerable communities and populations, including women, and       can be exacerbated in regions of the world with changing or       harsher climates, leading to migration, forced displacement,       and conflicts over scarce natural resources, including land       and water.        (10) Internally displaced, refugee, and stateless women and       girls face extreme violence and threats, including--        (A) being forced to exchange sex for food and humanitarian       supplies;        (B) being at increased risk of gender-based violence,       sexual exploitation, and abuse;        (C) reduced access to services and care; and        (D) increased risk for contracting HIV or sexually-      transmitted infections, having an unplanned pregnancy, and       experiencing poor reproductive health        (11) Climate change is predicted to lead to increasing       frequency and intensity of extreme weather conditions,       precipitating the occurrence of natural disasters around the       globe.        (12) The relocation and death of women as a result of       climate change-related disasters often has devastating       impacts on social support networks, family ties, and the       coping capacity of families and communities.        (13) The ability of women to adapt to climate change is       constrained by underlying gender inequality, including a lack       of--        (A) economic freedoms;        (B) property, land tenure, and inheritance rights;        (C) access to financial resources, education, family       planning, and reproductive healthcare services; and        (D) quality tools, equipment, and technology that support       economic opportunity and independence.        (14) Despite having unique capabilities and knowledge to       promote, plan, and execute activities to enhance communities'       climate change adaption and resilience capacities, women       often have insufficient resources, are not empowered to take       such actions, and are often excluded from leadership and       decision-making processes.        (15) Women have a multiplier effect because women use their       income and resources, when given the necessary tools, to       increase the well-being of their children and families,       playing a critical role in reducing food insecurity, poverty,       and socioeconomic effects of climate change.        (16) Women are often underrepresented in the development       and formulation of policy regarding mitigation and adaptation       to climate change, even though women are often in the best       position to provide and consult on adaptive strategies.
