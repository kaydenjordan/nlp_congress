 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Lesley Robinson of Phillips County. Lesley recently made  history when she became the first woman elected as the Montana  Stockgrowers Association's second vice president.   Lesley is not afraid to be the first in any venture. Her past  experience as a leader in Montana began in 1996 when she became the  second woman ever elected to serve on the board of directors for the  Montana Stockgrowers. Lesley also ran for office and was elected as a  Phillips County commissioner in 2005. During her 12-year tenure as a  commissioner, Lesley was a strong advocate for Phillips County and  rural Montana. She also had a leadership role on the Executive  Committee for the National Association of Counties. Most recently,  Lesley served as former Congressman Greg Gianforte's State director.   As a fourth-generation rancher, Lesley knows the importance of hard  work. She and her husband, Jim, own a commercial cow/calf and yearling  operation near Zortman, MT. Her past leadership roles and ranching  experiences have led her to be a fierce voice for agriculture and the  importance it has as Montana's No. 1 economic driver.   It is my honor to recognize Lesley for her leadership and service to  Montana. I look forward to hearing about her continued success.                            ____________________
