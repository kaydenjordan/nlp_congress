 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  having this Special Order.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I come before this Chamber to ask when will  this administration address the ever-growing crisis at our southern  border.   Every day that passes, from sunup to sundown, our Nation's  immigration laws are being violated by thousands of illegal border  crossers. For the life of  [[Page H5779]]  me, I don't understand why--and let me say this again--I don't  understand why our Commander in Chief refuses to go and see the mess  that he and his open border politics have created.   But I have seen this crisis myself so let me paint him a picture. And  I am going to use a paint brush with some facts.   In fiscal year 2020, 458,000 illegal aliens were apprehended at our  southern border; that was in 2020. Fast forward to fiscal year 2021,  under President Biden's ``leadership,'' the number skyrocketed to 1.7  million.   And that is not a crisis? That doesn't even warrant a ``pick your  head up and open your eyes and go down to the border.'' From 458,000 to  1.7 million, I would hate to see what a crisis would look like under  his watch.   Last month, more than 12,000 illegal aliens from Haiti squatted under  a bridge until President Biden's Department of Homeland Security began  moving those illegal aliens into the interior of our country.   The problem doesn't stop with people coming in illegally. Illegal  drugs from the border are coming to a town near you. And we are already  seeing it. Again, let me use some facts:   In fiscal year 2021, Border Patrol agents at the southwest border  seized 900 pounds of fentanyl. That is what they seized. Doing the  math, that is enough to kill nearly 200 million people. That is nearly  two-thirds of the country.   To all of my colleagues, I beg of you, I implore you, we must fix  this crisis at the border, but you can't fix a problem you don't think  exists.
