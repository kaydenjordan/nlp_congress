 Mr. President, amendment No. 167 is a side-by-side. This  amendment makes good on two promises to the American people. One is to  [[Page S255]]  repeal ObamaCare, which has increased costs, limited health care  choices, and has raised $1.1 trillion in taxes on the American people  in the middle class.   It also makes good on a second promise; that is, Congress will  replace ObamaCare with health care reforms that provide access to  quality, affordable health care coverage, not just to dependents under  the age of 26 but to all Americans--women, children, seniors, and  disabled. We shouldn't be choosing winners and losers.   A vote against this amendment is a vote against affordable, quality  health care for all, and I urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that act and applicable budget resolutions for the purposes of my  amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
