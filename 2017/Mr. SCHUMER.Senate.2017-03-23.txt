 Mr. President, first, I would like to thank the senior  Senator from the State of Washington, the ranking member of the Health  Committee, for her outstanding work on this issue. She knows this issue  better than just about anybody in this Chamber. She is passionate and  also fact-driven about her views and has had great influence on this  Chamber.   I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will review what  she said. To rush through a bill for a campaign promise--a bill that is  fraught with problems and difficulty, many of which will probably not  come to light until after the bill comes to the floor--is the wrong  thing to do. I thank the senior Senator from the State of Washington.                           Terror Attack in London    Mr. President, first, I want to just say a few words. My heartfelt  condolences go to the families of the victims in London.   Terrorism strikes everywhere. It was so close to the symbol of Great  Britain--Parliament, Big Ben, a place we have all seen in pictures and  some of us have had the opportunity to see in person. It reminds us  that the scourge of terrorism needs to be eradicated in any way we can.  I am committed to that, and I know the 100 Members of this Senate body  are as well.   Our hearts go out to those who were lost.                          Nomination of Neil Gorsuch    Mr. President, now I will move on to the subject I wish to speak  about at length this morning, and that is Judge Gorsuch.   I have had the opportunity these past 3 days to watch Judge Neil  Gorsuch in the Judiciary Committee and to review his credentials and  record on the Tenth Circuit and before that.   I would particularly like to recognize the outstanding work done by  every Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee. They were  outstanding in questioning Judge Gorsuch despite his lack of candor and  desire to answer. I would like to particularly call out our exceptional  ranking member, Senator Feinstein, who has done a wonderful job leading  that committee.   I have thought long and hard about his nomination and what it means  for the future of the Supreme Court and for the future of our country.  What is at stake is considerable. The decisions we make here in the  Senate over the next few weeks about Judge Gorsuch, as on any Supreme  Court nominee, will echo through the lifetime tenure of that judge,  through a generation of Americans.   Discussions of the Supreme Court can get wonky and technical, with  invocations of precedent and canons of interpretation. What is at  stake, however, is not at all abstract; it is real and it is concrete  for Americans, whose lives, health, happiness, and freedoms are on the  line at the Supreme Court. Closely divided decisions recently have  meant the difference between the ability to marry the person you love  or not, the ability to have your right to vote protected or not, the  ability to make personal choices about your own healthcare or not. The  Supreme Court matters a great deal. It matters for workers who want to  protect both their lives and their jobs, for employees who need to be  able to seek redress for discrimination, and for parents who want their  kids to get a fair shake in the education system.   It is with all this in mind that I have come to a decision about the  current nominee. After careful deliberation, I have concluded that I  cannot support Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court.  His nomination will face a cloture vote. He will have to earn 60 votes  for confirmation. My vote will be no, and I urge my colleagues to do  the same.   To my Republican friends who think that if Judge Gorsuch fails to  reach 60 votes, we ought to change the rules, I say: If this nominee  cannot earn 60 votes--a bar met by each of President Obama's nominees  and George Bush's last two nominees--the answer isn't to change the  rules, it is to change the nominee.   This morning, I would like to lay out the reasons I will be voting no  on this nomination.   First, Judge Gorsuch was unable to sufficiently convince me that he  would be an independent check on a President who has shown almost no  restraint from Executive overreach.   Second, he was unable to convince me that he would be a mainstream  Justice who could rule free from the biases of politics and ideology.  His career and judicial record suggest not a neutral legal mind but  someone with a deep-seated conservative ideology. He was groomed by the  Federalist Society and has not shown 1 inch of difference between his  views and theirs.    Finally, he is someone who almost instinctively favors the powerful  over the weak, corporations over working Americans. There could not be  a worse time for someone with those instincts.   Judge Gorsuch's opportunity to disabuse us of all these objections  was in the hearing process, but he declined to answer question after  question after question with any substance. Absent a real description  of judicial philosophy, all we have to judge the judge on is his  record.   First, I want to address the first issue I raised, that of judicial  independence. It is so clear that at this moment in our history, our  democracy requires a judge who is willing to rule against this  President. This administration seems to have little regard for the rule  of law and is likely to test the Constitution in ways it hasn't been  challenged in decades. It is absolutely the case that this Supreme  Court will be tried in ways that few courts have been tested since the  earliest days of the Republic when constitutional questions abounded.   The President himself has attacked individual judges and the  credibility of the judiciary at large. The President has attacked a  three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit and said if they didn't decide  with him, they would be responsible for the next terrorist act. I have  never heard any President in my lifetime or read about any President in  previous history who dared do that. We are in uncharted territory with  this President and with judicial independence. It requires a strong  independent backbone. Judge Gorsuch has shown none. Senators on the  Judiciary Committee rightly asked Judge Gorsuch direct questions about  this issue. I did so myself in my meeting with the judge. While the  judge repeatedly asserted his independence, he could not point to  anything in his record to guarantee it. Judge Gorsuch offered the  Judiciary myriad platitudes on this point. ``No man is above the law,''  he said. He said he was ``disheartened'' by the President's attacks on  the judiciary. The President, for his sake, said that Judge Gorsuch  didn't mean him, and everyone left it at that.   If Judge Gorsuch had an ounce of courage, had shown a scintilla of an  ability to be independent, he would have said: No, Mr. President. No,  President Trump, I did mean you. Instead, he just tells us in general  that he is demoralized, disheartened. Telling us is not the same as  showing us. He is asking us to take him at his word, but his record  suggests that he has long been someone who has advocated extreme  deference to assertions of broad Presidential power.   That leads me to my second point; that Judge Gorsuch was unable to  convince me that he would be a neutral judge, free of ideology and  bias. The hearings this week were an opportunity for Judge Gorsuch to  explain his record, to tell us how he thinks and how his judicial  philosophy does not fundamentally advantage the powerful. Instead, we  got banalities and platitudes. We didn't get any real answers to any  real questions about what he thinks about the law and why. He refused  to answer general questions on dark money in politics, LGBTQ rights,  the constitutionality of the Muslim ban. I couldn't believe it, when I  asked him: Is a law that bans Muslims, a law that just said all Muslims  are banned from the U.S. unconstitutional, he couldn't even answer  that. He refused to say whether he agreed with Supreme Court decisions  in seminal cases like Brown v. Board, Roe v. Wade, Griswold v.  Connecticut, despite the fact that his predecessors, Justices Roberts  and Alito, said they agreed with those cases.   He refused to answer questions about the emoluments clause, a section  of the  [[Page S1946]]  Constitution that prohibits foreign corruption of U.S. officials.  Instead of an umpire calling balls and strikes in baseball, what we  really saw was a well-trained expert in dodgeball.   My friend, the ranking member of the committee, said it best. ``What  worries me,'' she told the nominee, ``is that you have been very much  able to avoid any specificity like no one I have ever seen before.''   Let me repeat. There is no legal standard, rule, or even logic for  failing to answer questions that don't involve immediate and specific  cases that are or could come before the Court. It is evasion, just  evasion, plain and simple, and it belies a deeper truth about this  nominee.   If anyone doubts that Judge Gorsuch doesn't have strong views, that  thinks he would be a neutral judge calling balls and strikes as Judge  Roberts once put it, just look at the way he was chosen. He was  supported and pushed forward by the Heritage Foundation and the  Federalist Society, and groomed by billionaire conservatives like Mr.  Anschutz. President Trump simply picked someone from off their list.   President Trump sought the advice and consent from the Federalist  Society instead of from the U.S. Senate. Does anyone think the  Federalist Society would choose someone who just called balls and  strikes? Does anyone think they would put on their list a neutral,  moderate judge when they haven't ever supported anyone but judicial  conservatives, almost all hard-right judicial conservatives in their  history? The Federalist Society has been dedicated for a generation to  influence the courts to favor corporations and special interests. If  anyone doubts that Judge Gorsuch could be an activist judge with views  eschewing the interests of average people, look at how he was  selected--by a group that is not neutral, a group that has been  dedicated to changing the judiciary and placing activist, hard-right  judges on the bench. Now that he is nominated, look at how much money,  dark, secret, undisclosed money--it is a good bet from the very  corporations Judge Gorsuch has been defending his whole career. If he  were so neutral, would they be spending this money? I doubt it.   Anyone groomed by the Federalist Society will not call balls and  strikes. Their views are best foretold by the ideology of the people  who groomed them. To say Judge Gorsuch has no ideology whatsoever is  absurd. He just will not admit it to the American people. To say he is  just neutral in his views is belied by his history since his college  days and by his own judicial record. He even tried to deny it. In the  hearings, Judge Gorsuch repeated the hollow assertion that judges don't  have parties or politics. He said there are no Democratic judges or  Republican judges, but if that were true, we wouldn't be here, would  we? If that were true, if the Senate were merely evaluating a nominee  based on his or her qualifications, Merrick Garland would be seated on  the Supreme Court right now. Merrick Garland is not a Justice. We all  know why. We all know my friends across the aisle held the Supreme  Court seat open for over 1 year in hopes that they would have the  opportunity to install someone handpicked by the Heritage Foundation  and the Federalist Society to advance the goal of Big Money interests  entrenching their power in the Court.    They don't even mind that this nomination is moving forward under a  cloud of an FBI investigation of the President's campaign. The  Republicans held a Supreme Court seat open for a year under a  Democratic President who was under no investigation but now are rushing  to fill the seat for a President whose campaign is under investigation.  It is unseemly and wrong to be moving so fast on a lifetime appointment  in such circumstances.   Finally, Judge Gorsuch came into this hearing with a record that  raises deep concerns about whether he would consider fairly the plight  of the average citizen before the interests of powerful special  interests. I examined his record. I saw a judge who repeatedly decided  with insurance companies that wanted to deny disability benefits to  employees. I saw a judge who, in unemployment discrimination, sided  with employers the great majority of the time. I saw a judge who, on  the issue of money and politics, seems to be in the same company as  Justices Thomas and Scalia, willing to restrict the most commonsense  contribution limits.   In the hearings, Judge Gorsuch did nothing to explain his philosophy,  did nothing to assuage those concerns. We will just have to go by his  record, a record that shows time and time again his rulings favor the  already powerful over ordinary Americans.   Judge Gorsuch ruled against a teacher, Grace Hwang, who, having been  through two bouts of cancer, was advised by her doctors not to return  to the college campus during a flu epidemic lest she put her life at  risk. She was fired for taking sick leave. Judge Gorsuch, true to form,  voted to uphold that dismissal. Her daughter Katherine told us last  week:         This decision to protect her health cost my mom her job.       When Judge Gorsuch issued his ruling, he didn't think about       the impact that this had on our family. The law calls for       ``reasonable accommodation for those who are disabled.''    Judge Gorsuch ignored the human cost.   Judge Gorsuch ruled against a truckdriver, Alfonse Maddin, who had to  make a similar choice between his employer and his life. I met with  him. He told me a harrowing story of being stuck in the cab of a  tractor-trailer with frozen brakes, no heat, temperatures outside  dipping to 27 below zero. He had a choice, leave the trailer with  broken brakes and drive the cab to safety or stay in the trailer and  freeze to death. He radioed his company to explain his predicament.  They told him that the cargo was the most important thing; he couldn't  leave it. Rather than risk the lives of other motorists on a freezing  highway by driving a trailer with frozen brakes, Mr. Maddin struggled  to unhitch his trailer and drive his cab to safety--returning later for  it once he was not at risk of dying from the cold. For that, his  company fired him. He sued. Seven judges heard this case as it went  through appeal. Only one, Judge Gorsuch, in dissent, ruled against him.  Judge Gorsuch used an exceptionally technical and illogical reading of  the statute to reach the absurd conclusion that Mr. Maddin was  obligated to risk his life to protect his cargo.   Mr. Maddin said that Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court  gives him ``pause for concern'' because he ``demonstrated a willingness  to artfully diminish the humane element that encompassed the issue.''   Judge Gorsuch also ruled against a parent of a severely autistic  child, Luke, who sought what the Individuals with Disabilities in  Education Act guarantees him--the right to an education that met his  needs. Jeff Perkins, Luke's father, is testifying before the Judiciary  Committee today. Their story is powerful. Judge Gorsuch ruled that Luke  was not entitled to attend a specialized school because he was able to  make more than de minimis progress in the normal educational system.   Just yesterday, the Supreme Court unanimously--including Justice  Alito and so many others who are so conservative--rejected Judge  Gorsuch's interpretation of the IDEA. The Court held that ``when all is  said and done, a student offered an educational program providing  `merely more than a de minimis progress from year to year can hardly be  said to have been offered an education at all.' '' That puts Judge  Gorsuch's interpretation of the IDEA law to the right of even Justice  Thomas--a very difficult feat.   Whom we put on the bench, their basic judgment, matters. While I do  not think that the personal views and experiences should bear on the  decisions of day-to-day cases, there is a reason we don't program  computers to decide cases. We do not want judges with ice water in  their veins. What we want and need are judges who understand the  litigants before them and bring a modicum--at least a modicum--of human  judgment into the courtroom. You can call this trait empathy or mercy.  I think it falls in the category of common sense. It is common sense  that necessarily comes from each person's own, unique life experience.  Even Judge Gorsuch acknowledged this when he told the committee ``I am  not an algorithm.'' Yet he wouldn't tell us how, as a human--a  nonalgorithm--he would uniquely approach a case.    When it comes to the application of the law, that empathy, that  mercy,  [[Page S1947]]  that ``humane element'' of common sense--as Alphonse Maddin, the  truckdriver, put it--is the most important judicial trait of them all  because ultimately the law is abstract, but the people and situations  are real. The task of the judge is to apply those abstract legal  doctrines to very humane and sometimes very messy situations. It is a  hard thing to do to bring fairness and justice to a world that is too  short on both.   I am reminded of the words spoken by Portia, the great lawyer in  ``The Merchant of Venice,'' who spoke of the blessings and necessity of  mercy in applying the law.   He said:       The quality of mercy is not strain'd,      It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven      Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest:      It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.      'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes      The thron-ed monarch better than his crown;      His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,      The attribute to awe and majesty,      Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;      But mercy is above this sceptred sway,      It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,      It is an attribute to God himself.    Judge Gorsuch told us he is not God, and that is true, but his  humanity does not excuse him from the attribute of mercy. Instead, his  humanity should require it.   Alphonse Maddin sought the mercy of the law. The Hwang family sought  the mercy of the law. Luke, the autistic child whose school was failing  him, sought the mercy of the law. The man who had the power to see  plain sense in their cases, who could rule in their favor and right the  wrongs that had been done to them as other judges had done in each of  those cases--Judge Neil Gorsuch--said no.   I am voting no on Gorsuch for Alphonse Maddin and workers across the  country, for the Hwang family and others who do not want to choose  between their health and providing for their children, and for the  Perkins family, who loves their children just as they are and wants for  them no fewer than the opportunities afforded to every other child in  America.   The American people deserve someone who sees average litigants as  more than incidental consequences of precedent, when that precedent  produces an absurd result, whose view of the law is not so cold and so  arid so as to wring out every last drop of humanity and common sense.  It requires only the bare minimum of judicial decency to rule the right  way in the cases I have mentioned, and Judge Gorsuch did not.   That is all the evidence my colleagues should need to vote no, and I  urge them and will urge them in the days ahead to do so.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
