 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Arizona for his very  informative speech here about our coming, looming economic issues.   Mr. Speaker, for the last 2 weeks, the majority has attacked the  First Amendment; and now they are attacking the Second Amendment. The  Second Amendment clearly states the right of the people to keep and  bear arms shall not be infringed. And as Justice Scalia noted in his  decision in Heller, the Second Amendment does not give Americans a  right; it protects a preexisting right. Hence, the phrase, ``Shall not  be infringed.''                                time  2130    Our theme for the next 30 minutes will be about H.R. 8 and the damage  it will do to the Second Amendment which is, as Justice Scalia noted, a  preexisting right.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Hice).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Ohio (Mr.  Davidson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Budd).  [[Page H1183]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his speech.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Texas (Mr. Cloud).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs.  Greene).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Colorado  (Mrs. Boebert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Montana (Mr.  Rosendale).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois  (Mrs. Miller).    Mr. Speaker, it is now my privilege to yield to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the gentleman from Georgia. I thank all of my colleagues. I  appreciate the opportunity to be with so many of my friends who support  the Second Amendment and oppose H.R. 8.   I was talking earlier tonight about the Heller decision, where  Justice Scalia said the Second Amendment is a preexisting right.  Justice Scalia wrote: ``There seems to us no doubt, on the basis of  both text and history, that the Second Amendment conferred an  individual right to keep and bear arms.'' He did state ``the right was  not unlimited,'' but the bill being considered goes well beyond  acceptable limitations.   H.R. 8 is another bill that the majority is bringing to the floor  this session without a hearing or markup in the Judiciary Committee.   Last Congress, the markup of H.R. 8 was cut short when the chairman  of the committee introduced an amendment in the nature of a substitute  right in the middle of the markup after Republicans repeatedly offered  amendments highlighting flaws in the bill. He didn't allow Members  opposed to the amendment to speak or offer amendments. He then called  for the vote on the substitute amendment. This hurried process  demonstrated that Democrats cared more about simply passing a bill than  passing a good bill.   H.R. 8 would not have prevented recent shootings. In Parkland, the  shooter acquired the firearm legally from an FFL after undergoing a  NICS check.   In Sutherland Springs, Texas, the shooter made purchases from an FFL  following a NICS check.   In Las Vegas, the shooter purchased his firearms from an FFL after a  background check.   In Orlando, the shooter purchased his firearms legally from an FFL  following a NICS check.   I can go on, but there are so many more examples that are just the  same because criminals who seek to do harm will get guns, regardless of  the new restrictions imposed by H.R. 8. That is just the nature of  criminals.   I was a prosecutor and a criminal defense attorney. I can tell you,  that is the way criminals are. They violate the law.   With very limited exceptions, H.R. 8 makes it illegal for Americans  to get a gun if a nonlicensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer is  involved. And how will the government know if an illegal transfer  occurs?   Eventually, the government will have to create a registry of all  firearms and firearm owners so that they can track all transfers. That  is what they want to do here. Without a registry, this bill is utterly  unenforceable.   I have heard supporters of this bill say that other countries have  similar restrictions, so we need to do the same as well. But the  reality is, there is no other country on the face of this planet that  has a Second Amendment, where the Founders of that country said the  right to bear arms and protect yourself against government and  individuals is a God-given right and deserves to be protected. It is,  as Justice Scalia said, a preexisting right.    Supporters say that this bill is about saving lives. If that is what  is important, then I would encourage every supporter of this bill to  join me in cosponsoring the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection  Act, which actually will save lives. I urge Speaker Pelosi to bring  that bill to the floor today.   I oppose this bill. I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for being here tonight, and I  yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
