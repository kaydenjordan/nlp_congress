 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the expanded  child tax credit. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, working families  across the country will receive a monthly child tax credit payment of  up to $300 per child, covering nearly 90 percent of all children and  cutting child poverty in half.   In my district, the expanded child tax credit will improve the lives  of families from Newton to Fall River, helping almost 60 percent of  children and lifting 3,800 children out of poverty. As a father, I am  committed to providing parents with the support needed to navigate the  high cost of raising a child.   From affording their food bills to paying for childcare, this  substantial tax relief will set our parents and children up for  success. The expanded child tax credit is a necessary investment in our  families so that we can build an economy that works for everyone. We  must make the expansion permanent.                            ____________________
