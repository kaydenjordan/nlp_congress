 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to  me.   There is a great Chinese scholar, Professor Sheridan wrote a book  called ``China in Disintegration,'' and he analyzed the fall of China's  government in the early 1900s before you moved to kind of an anarchical  situation where you saw the rise of Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang  versus, ultimately, post-World War II Mao Zedong and the Chinese  Communist long march as they marched around and eventually the U.S.  wavered and China fell to communism under Chairman Mao.   What was the premise of ``China in Disintegration''? It was an  analysis of why great powers, great nations, great empires fail. They  fail because of a loss of geographical integrity. They fail for--that  is the first thing.   The second thing is they fail because their currency loses value and  trust. Once that goes, and the culture begins to change, they are  either overextended, or they allow individuals with malevolent  intentions to come into their country and influence the population.   So what do we have? We have a wide-open border, so we have lost our  geographical integrity. We have $31.4 trillion in national debt and  rising inflation.   We have nations like India contemplating moving to the Chinese yuan  for their currency of exchange instead of the dollar. They have settled  on the rupee.   We have lost economic integrity as well.   What has happened? Well, China views, as they always have, themselves  as the center of the universe. They have viewed Westerners as  barbarians. Mao and his ambitions were superseded ultimately by Deng  Zhao Ping, who said we are going to put a unique spin and have a  hybridized economy, and it is going to have some elements of  capitalism, but it is going to be Communistic overall.   Now, why did he do that? Because they were failing as a Communist  state.   We built the Chinese middle class. We built the Chinese deep water  navy. We gave China superior telemetry.   Ladies and gentlemen, we have basically given China our technology.  What we haven't given them, they have stolen.   Now you have reached a point where you have a CEO of a company like  Nike, who says, we are not an American company anymore, we are a  Chinese company.   How have they done that? There are literally tens of thousands of  Chinese national students in our universities. When we talk about the  billions of dollars that have come in in donations, a more insidious  thing is the out-of-State tuition that funds these State universities  who rely on out-of-State tuition, so they come in and they pay that  tuition.    It is not a normalized situation. To come over here as a student, you  have to be a member of the CCP.   There are 330 million people in the CCP, as many as we have living in  the United States today.   They send their students over here and they exit. They leave and they  go home with what? Our technology and experience that we have given  them to defeat ourselves.   We can continue to put our head in the sand and hope that it isn't  true. There are those who believe it is xenophobic to talk about this.   I appreciate the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bean) being here tonight  and leading this Special Order because Americans need to know the peril  that we are in because China doesn't view us as an economic opponent or  competitor. They view us as an adversary, a geopolitical adversary.  [[Page H1755]]    For them, they want to be the world's dominant hegemon. That isn't me  saying it. You can look at any modern writing within the top leadership  of the CCP. It is pretty clear.   I would suggest that we need to take back our educational  institutions. Couple that with the integration, we need to decouple our  economic integration and dependence upon China. They know we are  dependent. They know they can exploit that. We saw how they exploited  it just recently in the COVID-19 epidemic.   Let's be wise. We are going to have to take action.                                time  2120     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, we are going to talk tonight about this debt  ceiling, this mysterious debt ceiling that we hear so much about. I am  joined by two of my colleagues who have strong ideas about this, as  well.   I want to just relate something to America, so you can hear this.   We had a meeting several weeks back talking about the debt ceiling. I  don't think anybody had ever asked this question, and I started asking  it at every meeting. I said: How much does the Biden administration  want to raise the debt?   We stand at $34.1 trillion now. We spend $6.1 trillion a year, but we  raise $4.9 trillion. Every month, we fall short by about $100 billion.   I said: How much do they want?   Well, when I first started asking the question, everybody says: I  don't know. We don't know.   Now, it is $4 trillion. That is what I am hearing, $4 trillion.  Tonight, we heard $3.5 trillion. In any event, it is $3.5 trillion to  $4 trillion.   I asked the next question. I said: Look, I really want to know what  happens if we don't lift the debt ceiling. I don't know. These guys  might have been there.   The fellow was nonplussed. This former deputy at the OMB, the Office  of Management and Budget, an economist, stood there for probably 2  minutes. Nobody had ever asked him that question before. He says:  Nothing. Nothing will happen.   I said: How can that be? I am hearing that it is collapse city. Tell  me, how can that be?   He said: All the bills go to OMB. They get forwarded on to the Fed,  and they all get paid as they come due. They just keep paying them.   I am here to tell you that the debt ceiling is mysterious. It is a  black box. It is the Wizard of Oz behind the curtain. And it is time  for us to face the facts.   If they are going to try to leverage us, then we have to do something  to make this more responsible, this spending more responsible, and get  our budget back together.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Rosendale).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Montana. He  mentioned unauthorized programs that we are continuing to fund. There  are more than 1,200 Federal programs that are unauthorized right now.  $500 billion. That is what we spend every year for those 1,200  unauthorized programs. Congress hasn't authorized them. They have  expired. We haven't reauthorized, but we are still spending $500  billion a year. People wonder what is crazy about D.C. Well, let me  give you one more datapoint.   That same meeting that we were talking about, the gentleman was  getting ready to leave, this economist, and then we had a former head  of OMB there with us. I asked them: Can you tell me how many agencies  there are in the Federal Government?   The answer was ``no.''   I said: What?   He said: Nobody knows. That is hard to believe. I couldn't believe  it. I did some more digging. Nobody can tell me. Nobody can tell me how  many Federal agencies there are. We can tell you how much we are  spending. We are spending over $100 billion every month more than we  bring in.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Good).    I thank the gentleman for his remarks.   May I inquire of the Speaker how much time I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, HFC put in a proposal just recently. I think  this is really important. The idea is to shrink Washington and grow the  country again. We proposed it in early March.   The first thing is we cancel the student loan forgiveness plan which  totals $609 billion. We cut the wasteful, woke, weaponized spending  programs and get the Nation back on track. We eliminate Green New Deal  tax credits and subsidies.   I recently scored it at 350. I am told now it is $400 billion.  Between those two items alone, Mr. Speaker, we are moving towards $1  trillion.   We cut the IRS expansion. We already passed that out of the House.  That is $80 billion. We take into account the 500 targeted reductions  that we have made. Maybe we don't do all of them. Maybe we just do half  of them. Maybe we do 50, 70, $85 billion worth.   Then I will tell you something else, Mr. Speaker, that you have to  do. You take back the COVID money that we sent out. There is about $80  billion of that that hasn't been spent. Bring that back.   All of that is in the first year, and I haven't even talked about  reductions. That is the rescissions.   Then we start reducing, and we can make it targeted. We can do the  discretionary.   Guess what?   We start getting to a place where we are not in the hole $100 billion  per month.   How about doing that for a year?   How about doing that for a year?   I am told that a lot of these folks don't really want to do that, and  I find that hard to believe.   So in fiscal year 2024 alone, if we add to what I just outlined, what  we proposed, what we cosponsored, those 500 bills, we just want you to  look at them for mercy's sake.   If we took all of them, then we would be a little over $100 billion  in savings in fiscal year 2024 alone.   There are ways out of this, aren't there?   But it is going to take some courage and some discipline. Quite  frankly, part of the reason that I wanted to do this tonight is I am  hearing all the time that we don't know where you guys are.   I say: How can you not know where I am?   I have been so explicit, and I am transparent. Everybody knows where  Biggs is because Biggs doesn't keep his mouth shut.   This is where we need to be. We need to be telling the truth. The  American people need to understand clearly what is about to happen to  them. What is about to happen to them is they are going to raise that  debt ceiling. Somebody is going to raise the debt ceiling.   The idea that they are talking about now--just so people know--is  anywhere from 1.5 to $4 trillion. That is what they are talking about.   They are going to trade it for 10 years with maybe $3.5 to $4  trillion in reductions in savings, net savings--not even net savings,  I'm sorry to say that, gross savings.   So over here on that ledger, Mr. Speaker, you have to get $4 trillion  over 10 years. But if you raise the debt ceiling by $1.5 to $4 trillion  over that year, 18 to 24 months, now extend that out for the rest of  that 10-year cycle.   We are not raising the national debt by $24 trillion. We are raising  it by $19 trillion.   So we are still hitting 50-plus trillion dollars because we didn't  have the courage to make the reductions and the hard choices this year.   My favorite thing to hear around here is that we are going to have a  10-year plan to balance the budget. Mr. Speaker, I could go back and  show you from 15 years ago. They still relive that first year over and  over again because it is like deja vu.   So this year they are telling everybody: We are going to do a 10-year  plan. It is going to be great. We think we can get balanced in 10  years. We are going to have to make some tough decisions.   But next year they will come back and say: We have got a 10-year  plan. You have to make some tough decisions.   Two years they will come back and say: We have a 10-year plan.   Do it now. Do it now.   People tell me: You are conflating the budget with the debt ceiling.   Do you know why, Mr. Speaker?   Because I can tell you that if we don't do it now in the debt  ceiling, when that budget comes around, you are going to have an  omnibus bill. You are going to have an omnibus bill. That is what is  going to happen. That may not work, so you get a CR.   Part of the package that HFC put out is that if you end up with a  mandatory CR, then you start reducing funding on that. So you never  have a government shutdown, which is in some ways too bad, quite  frankly.   Then we have also proposed adding the REINS Act. The REINS Act says  that before a bureaucratic agency can impose rules on anything that  will impact more than--it is $100 million--I think that is way too  high. It should be like $10 million, but they are telling me it is $100  million--then we have to bring it back to Congress.   I think that is a great place to start.   Do you know why, Mr. Speaker?   We have delegated our authority to bureaucracy. So we have the  bureaucracy out there, and they are making rules. That is the same  thing as legislating. They are enforcing the rules. That is the  executive branch power. They are adjudicating whether you have  committed a violation of the rules and fining you.   In some cases most of the 40,000 crimes that are Federal in nature  were created under the rulemaking process.   Mr. Speaker, I am just telling you: Our government is out of control,  and our spending is out of control.   Guess what, Mr. Speaker?   If we went back to 2019 levels--which is what we have proposed--if  you go back to 2019 levels which nobody would say: Oh, we had too  little government in 2019. If you go back to those levels, Mr. Speaker,  guess what?   You can pay it because we were spending about $5 trillion, and now we  are bringing in about $5 trillion. So let's go back to the 2019 levels,  for Pete's sake, and then let's do the rescissions to boot, and let's  stop the seemingly endless cycle of a national debt increase.   If we do that, then we stop the imminent bankruptcy of this country,  we stop the devaluation of our currency around the world, and we stop  the inflationary pressures. Then once we do things like reduce some  more taxes, reduce some more regulations, and get some better energy  production, then we will, again, be the world's economic leader.   I am just here to tell you, Mr. Speaker, we have got a plan. We  presented our plan. I don't think anybody should ever say that Mr.  Good, Mr. Rosendale, Mr. Biggs, and the half dozen others or so, that  they don't know where we are. I have never voted to raise the debt  ceiling. I don't think that is what I was sent here to do, and I am  finding it awfully hard to believe that there is any justification for  raising it $2 to $4 trillion.   I encourage everyone to understand that we can put an end to this  cycle of self-immolation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
