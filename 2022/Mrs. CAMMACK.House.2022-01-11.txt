 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize National Human  Trafficking Day. This issue, the issue of human trafficking, is not a  Republican or Democrat issue. It is an American issue. It is a human  issue.   That is why today I am proud to wear blue to show my support to all  those fighting this terrible scourge and also to the victims of  trafficking, to stand in solidarity as we fight for resources and  support and also to educate fellow Members and citizens about this  terrible scourge. We need to be loud.   Trafficking occurs in every State, in every district, and in every  city, which is why every single Member here today needs to come  together as we fight this modern-day slavery.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle as we work to strengthen resources for those on the front lines  and continue to expose the awful scourge of modern-day slavery that we  know as trafficking.                        Honoring Corporal Duane Dewey     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and service  of a remarkable American hero. Corporal Duane Dewey of the United  States Marine Corps embodied what it meant to be an American soldier  and patriot.   A Bronze Star and Purple Heart recipient, Corporal Dewey displayed  courageous and meritorious actions during his service in the Korean  war. Already riddled from shrapnel from a grenade, Corporal Dewey used  his own body as a human shield and covered a grenade as it exploded. In  doing so, he protected his fellow soldiers and showed true sacrifice in  service. Miraculously, he survived.   In 1953, President Eisenhower presented Corporal Dewey with the Medal  of Honor and described his remarkable service as ``indomitable courage,  outstanding initiative, and valiant efforts on behalf of others in the  face of almost certain death reflect the highest credit upon Corporal  Dewey.''   Now, after 26 years serving in the Marine Corps Corporal Dewey  retired and spent many winter seasons in my home county of Alachua. He  was well known in the veteran community and throughout Florida for his  incredible bravery during battle and as an example of giving one's all  for their Nation, no questions asked.   Mr. Dewey recently passed away after a long and distinguished life of  service. His life will be remembered through the many people who had  the honor of meeting and knowing Corporal Dewey and through the Duane  E. Dewey AMVETS Post 1988 of Baldwin, where many of his service records  are on display.   We will continue to thank today but also every day the brave men and  women of the U.S. Armed Forces, like Corporal Dewey, for their service  and sacrifice on behalf of our Nation.   God bless Corporal Dewey. May he rest easy.                                time  1030                           Congratulating Jeb Smith     Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the newest  president of the Florida Farm Bureau, Mr. Jeb Smith. Before his  election to this position, Mr. Smith served on the State board of the  Florida Farm Bureau and on the Putnam-St. Johns County Farm Bureau  board of directors.   Jeb's family has over a century of experience farming in Florida.  Their current cattle, hay, and sod operation in St. Johns County have  been going strong for decades, and their operation will be recognized  next year as a Century Pioneer Family Farm.   Mr. Smith started as a volunteer leader with the Florida Farm Bureau  and, in the following decades, has been recognized as the Florida Farm  Bureau Outstanding Young Farmer, among many other accolades.   In addition to serving as the bureau's president, Jeb is also a St.  Johns County commissioner and a board member of the Rodeheaver Boys  Ranch. He also founded the God's Way Baptist Church in Hastings and has  served as its pastor.   I am sure that his wife of 27 years, Wendy, and his four children are  proud of his accomplishments.   Congratulations to my friend, President Smith, on his election. I  wish him the best as he leads the Florida Farm Bureau and the  incredible people who continue to champion our farmers, ranchers, and  producers in Florida. We wish Jeb the very best of luck and offer him  our congratulations.                            ____________________
