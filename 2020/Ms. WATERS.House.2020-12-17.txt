 Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic crisis continues to  have a terrible impact throughout the Nation.   Cases are surging, and thousands are dying from the virus every day.  There have been over 16 million United States cases, and over 300,000  people have lost their lives in the United States.   Over 20 million people across the country are collecting unemployment  and struggling to make ends meet. In California, more than 1.3 million  people have become unemployed over the past year.   Hunger is growing across the Nation. One in five renters is behind on  paying their rent, meaning that millions are on the brink of eviction  as months of back rent are coming due.   The Federal Reserve estimates that renters in California will owe  $1.7 billion in unpaid rent by the end of the year, representing almost  a quarter of the total rental debt that will have accrued nationwide  during the pandemic.   Small businesses are struggling. As many as one-third of small  businesses, including more than 40 percent of Black-owned and Latinx- owned small businesses, say they will be forced to close their doors  for good without immediate relief from Congress.   Families across the country desperately need relief.   So, it is absolutely essential that Congress finally come to a  bipartisan agreement for a relief bill. As Democrats are nearing a  compromise with our Republican colleagues, we must ensure that the  legislation helps all of those who are struggling during this pandemic.   It is especially important that the relief bill contains another  round of direct stimulus payments for individuals and families to help  them make ends meet. We must also provide additional unemployment  assistance to those who have lost their jobs as a result of the crisis.   As chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, I am working  hard to secure the inclusion of much-needed emergency rental assistance  in the bill and the extension of the eviction moratorium, as well as  funding for community development financial institutions and minority  depository institutions that support access to credit and investment in  communities of color, which have been hit hard by this crisis.   As this pandemic continues to rage, it would be completely  irresponsible and foolish to take away the Federal Reserve's and the  Treasury's crisis management tools that can help address threats to  jobs, small businesses, municipal government, and the economy.   Let me be clear that the compromise bill that is now being worked on,  while important, will not be enough by itself. Families across the  country will need more help. Congress must work with the incoming Biden  administration to take additional action to support those who are  struggling every day and put the country on a path to recovery.                            ____________________
