 Mr. President, today I recognize a pillar of  the community in Reno, NV: Evelyn Mount. For over 41 years, Evelyn has  graciously provided Reno residents and families in times of need with  the comfort of a holiday meal. This year marks the end of an era in  community leadership in Reno, as Evelyn intends to step away from the  role of organizing and coordinating her annual food drive.   Growing up in the small city of Tallulah, LA, Evelyn's family  instilled in her the importance of the values of sacrifice and service.  Those values have been at the core of how Evelyn has lived her life,  putting the needs of others ahead of her own. It wasn't until 1976 that  Evelyn and her husband Leon brought this selflessness to Reno, NV. Soon  after her arrival, she began work as a telephone operator at the  airport. Committed to assisting those in need, Evelyn started  collecting food donations in her spare time. Her devotion to the Reno  community did not go unnoticed, as employees from other departments  quickly contributed to her food collection. To her credit, Evelyn was  able to collect more than 200 bags of food to distribute amongst  members of the northern Nevada community. Her success prompted the  expansion of her operations, which now includes an outreach center and  several volunteers.   Nevadans who know Evelyn have come to understand her sense of duty to  community and affiliate the autumn season as ``Evelyn Mount food drive  season.'' The sense of community, care, and inclusion that Evelyn has  given Reno residents is perhaps her most important legacy. She has  inspired countless volunteers to donate their time and money, while  providing hope to families who are down on their luck. Because of her,  a compassionate community of selfless volunteers has grown in northern  Nevada, including some who were once on the receiving end of food  donations. Recognizing Evelyn's profound commitment to our community,  the city of Reno renamed a community center near Evelyn's home, titling  it the Evelyn Mount Northeast Community Center. This center reminds us  all of the difference just one person can make in the lives of many.   I ask my colleagues to join me in further recognizing Mrs. Evelyn  Mount's legacy for a life of humanitarianism and service to her  community, for her sense of responsibility to others, and for her fight  against hunger in Reno, NV. Evelyn Mount is the epitome of a community  leader, and I admire her unparalleled ability to inspire others to  donate their time and energy to a cause greater than  themselves.                            ____________________
