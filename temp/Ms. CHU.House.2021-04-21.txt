 Madam Speaker, as chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific  American Caucus, I rise today to join my colleagues in the Tri-Caucus  to ensure equitable access to the COVID-19 vaccine for communities of  color.   While we are all equally susceptible to the coronavirus, we are not  all equally impacted by it. Communities of color are disproportionately  likely to be in frontline jobs with greater exposure to the virus; have  less access to quality healthcare; and, as a result, have been  experiencing higher infection and mortality rates throughout the  pandemic.   With over 150 deaths per 100,000 cases, Native Hawaiians and Pacific  Islanders have one of the highest mortality groups of all groups from  this virus.   That is why we will be introducing a resolution to address this. If  we rely on communities of color to get us through this pandemic, then  we need to ensure they are provided equitable access to the vaccine so  they can stay healthy. We must ensure all Americans have an equal shot  to be vaccinated.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my  legislation, the NO BAN Act.   The Muslim ban was always wrong, needless, and cruel. Today, we can  make sure it never happens again.   First, this policy was wrong. America does not ban people because of  their religion, and the Supreme Court acknowledged this. When they  upheld the  [[Page H2007]]  third iteration of Trump's Muslim ban, the Court insisted that, in  order to prove this wasn't just a religious ban, the Trump  administration would have to issue waivers to allow those we know not  to be a threat to travel here. But that waiver process was a sham, with  almost all requests ignored, proving the purpose of the ban was to keep  Muslims out of the country, just as Donald Trump always said it was.   Second, the policy was needless. As the Supreme Court's waiver  requirement recognized, America has the best and strongest vetting  system in the world. Many of those stopped by the Muslim ban had been  vetted by U.S. officials many times over many years. I have met with  many of them myself. These are people who are trying to escape  dangerous situations or who simply wanted a chance at a better life.  They turned to the U.S., as countless others have done over the  generations. But instead of opportunity, they were met with bigotry,  sometimes just days before they were supposed to arrive here.   Which is why, thirdly, this ban was about cruelty. Afraid to leave  America out of fear they wouldn't be able to return, or unable to visit  here at all, families were intentionally isolated from each other,  missing weddings, funerals, births, and graduations.   This past year has shown us what the impact of missing such  milestones feels like. To do it deliberately is inexcusable.   Thousands of families were separated by this policy simply because of  a lie that Muslims are dangerous, a lie that encouraged bigotry and  xenophobia, even as hate crimes are on the rise.   Fortunately, President Biden understood the harm of this policy and  rescinded the Muslim bans on his first day in office. But we must make  sure no President is ever able to ban people from coming to the U.S.  simply because of their religion, which is why I am so pleased that we  are voting to pass the NO BAN Act today.   While preserving a President's ability to respond to national  emergencies like pandemics, this bill amends the Immigration and  Nationality Act to require that any future travel ban is based on  credible facts and actual threats. The bill also requires the President  to work in consultation with the Departments of State and Homeland  Security to provide evidence of why a ban is needed in the first place.   I am so grateful to Chairman Nadler, as well as my House and Senate  cosponsors, for their support, and I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes.''
