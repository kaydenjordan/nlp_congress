 Mr. President, for 24 years, Chief Crutchfield has served  the nation with honor and professionalism. Now, as he retires from his  post as Assistant Director for General and Flag Officer Matters in the  Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Military  Personnel and Policy, we are privileged to thank him for his decades of  service.    Mr. President, in addition to extensive service around  the country, Don also deployed overseas three times, including 13  months in Iraq in 2004, 9 months in Afghanistan in 2012, and 8 months  in Kuwait in 2014. He answered the call to duty time and time again  with absolute selflessness, and we all live in a safer and more  prosperous nation because of Americans like him.    Mr. President, we are proud to honor the achievements of  Chief Warrant Officer Donald Crutchfield, and, on behalf of a grateful  nation, we salute his service. We offer him our thanks and congratulate  him on a well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
