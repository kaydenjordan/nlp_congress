 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Flying Horses of  Troy High School football team for an extraordinary achievement:  winning a second consecutive New York State Public High School Athletic  Association Class AA State Championship.   Troy's Flying Horses are the first team in section 2 history to  accomplish back-to-back undefeated seasons and State championship wins.   Their 41-26 championship win this past Sunday over an impressive  Lancaster Legends team showed the dedication and heart of each and  every one of the players, their families, and their coach--their  supercoach--Bobby Burns.   On behalf of countless proud fans and supporters throughout New York  State's capital region, I wish the players great success in all of  their future endeavors. I, again, congratulate them and salute their  passion, their dedication, and their sportsmanship. They are, indeed,  an inspiration to all of us.                            ____________________
