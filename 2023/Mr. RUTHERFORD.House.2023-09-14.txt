 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from Texas for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, today I stand before you proud as an American and the  son of a Navy veteran. Throughout my life I had the opportunity to  witness our servicemembers' unwavering commitment to this Nation.   I rise today to recognize the 50th anniversary of our all-volunteer  force in the United States military.   In January 1973, the Department of Defense replaced mandatory service  with an opportunity for brave men and women to voluntarily step up and  serve.   Over 15 million proud Americans have served over the last five  decades with more than 2 million voluntarily serving today. These  American heroes epitomize patriotism through their courage, honor, and  selflessness and represent the cornerstone of our military's  unparalleled strength.   We may think of our military strength in regard to weapons systems  and ships and aircraft, but, Madam Speaker, this does not highlight our  biggest military advantage, which is our people.   We have the most professional military in the world with a clear  command and control structure. As we face  [[Page H4336]]  recruiting challenges among the services, we must remind our younger  generations of the honor to serve, protect, and defend the Constitution  against all enemies foreign and domestic.                                time  1730    I have to tell you, I am very hopeful for our future when I think of  the brave men and women who will join our all-volunteer force over the  next 50 years.   I have to tell you, every Congress Member knows, as my good friend  from Texas knows, one of the greatest privileges we have is to nominate  young men and women to attend our military academies. I can tell you,  those men and women give me great hope for the future of the United  States military.   I thank all of those who volunteer, like Commander Jake Ellzey right  here. Thank you for your service. I thank your friend Brian Ferguson,  who I don't know, but I thank him for his service, and I thank him for  working on that film. It is one of my favorites.   May God bless the United States and those who willingly defend it.
