 Mr. President, first, let me add my words of fond  farewell to my friend Lamar Alexander and the touching moment between  the leader and the senior Senator from Tennessee, which is moving to  all of us.   Now, Senator Alexander and I have not always agreed, but what an  amazing and capable legislator and true statesman he has been. He has  been in the middle of things for much of his 18 years in the Senate.  That is because he is not some ideologue who stood alone in his corner.  It is because he is someone who has been always willing and insistent  on reaching across the aisle, on hearing another Senator's perspective,  and on searching for common ground, however narrow it may be. He  searches to do the right thing.   I remember when we did the immigration bill. There was a lot of  pressure on Senator Alexander to vote against it, and I watched him  wrestle with it and churn and churn, and I sort of knew in my heart he  would do the right thing, in my judgment, and vote for that bill, as he  did, at some real political consequence to himself. And that is who he  was and is--a man of principle.   We often would talk in the Senate gym almost every morning for a  prolonged period of time--I don't go to the Senate gym post-COVID--and  more often than not, we found each other on opposite sides of the  Senate gym. We helped open up the amendment process on childcare  legislation. Together, we led the Rules Committee for a number of  years, and we come from very different backgrounds. But I will never  forget the weekend that Iris and I spent with Honey and Lamar at  Blackberry Farms, and it was a beautiful weekend for us that we will  always, always cherish and remember.   Given the opportunity to put a stamp on the Presidential  inauguration, Lamar and I said whoever is in the majority--we didn't  know--we would give each other time to speak, and it served us both  well. This is the kind of person he has been: someone who is willing to  reach out; someone who is willing to see the other side; and someone,  above all, in tumultuous and very difficult times for all of us, who is  a man of principle and conscience.   Senator Alexander will leave this Chamber with a legacy that every  Senator would be proud of. I wish him and his family the very best.                            ____________________     Now a few other remarks. We have a going and we have a  coming, and our coming is of a new Senator who will be installed today,  and that is CAPT Mark Kelly, who will be sworn in as the next Senator  from Arizona.   It may not be the role he expected for himself earlier in his life as  a U.S. Navy captain and then an astronaut aboard the International  Space Station. As Mark likes to say, his wife Gabby was already the  member of the family in Congress. But tragedy upended both their lives  and changed so  [[Page S7146]]  many of their plans. Everyone continues to be inspired by Gabby's  recovery, by Mark's devotion, and by the courage it took for their  family to reenter public life and public service. But that is who Mark  Kelly is--a devoted and honorable man--and we are delighted to welcome  him to the Senate Democratic caucus and the wider Senate family.   So a fond adieu to my friend Lamar, and a fond welcome to my new  friend Mark Kelly.   I have some more remarks on the topics, but I think I will defer  those, with unanimous consent that I could talk about those later, so  we can get right to Senator Alexander's remarks at the 10:30 scheduled  time.                            ____________________     Madam President, first, I spoke earlier about Senator  Alexander, but I would like to compliment my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle. This is a fine and rare moment of bipartisanship and  support of somebody we all admire and respect.
