 Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's  longtime interest in institutions such as Piney Woods. These  institutions provide an opportunity to learn and to help these students  go on to live extraordinary lives.   As a matter of fact, my father's roots are in Mississippi. And about  60 years ago, when I was 13 years old, my parents were strongly  considering sending me to Piney Woods to complete my high school  education. Piney Woods has a strong reputation.   I have worked with the gentleman on issues like this over the years.  I, too, share your interest in preserving institutions like this for  future generations.   Congress has developed programs like the Community Facilities program  to help institutions just like this. I look forward to working with my  colleague to take steps toward making resources available to preserve  historic institutions and facilities like the Piney Woods School in  Mississippi.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding me the time, and I rise in support of H.R. 7608.   As chairman of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, I am pleased to  highlight the national priorities that are funded in the division that  is covered in this bill.   First, Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank our distinguished ranking  member, Mr. Fortenberry. I hope he is not getting too embarrassed by my  endless thanks and praise, but it is really genuine.   Drafting legislation can be complicated, but we have been able to  maintain an open line of communication, and I am proud of our  bipartisan relationship. We have produced a good work product that  makes important investments that will improve the life of every  American.   Our fiscal year 2021 allocation is almost $24 billion, 2 percent  above the fiscal year 2020 and more than $4.1 billion above the budget  request.   The bill provides $3.2 billion for rural development initiatives to  fund critical infrastructure, such as water and wastewater systems, and  rural housing needs.   The bill also funds the ReConnect Program at $990 million, which is  an increase of $435 million, or 78 percent. I am extremely proud of the  investments that we make to close the digital divide. The coronavirus  pandemic has made everyone aware of just how important it is for  students and workers to be connected to the internet, and our bill  reflects that.   The bill, once again, includes the 10-20-30 antipoverty formula for  Rural Development programs that is designed to target much-needed  Federal resources to rural communities in need. Persistent-poverty  communities for too long have suffered from neglect, and this provision  will assist in reversing that and help these communities to thrive.   The bill provides $1.83 billion for farm production programs. I am  particularly proud of the $33 million in loan authority that will help  resolve ownership and succession of farmland issues, also known as the  ``heirs' property'' issue, which predominantly affects Black farmers  and has led to the loss of millions and millions of acres of privately  held farmland for over a century.    Since the beginning of the pandemic, hunger has become a new reality  for millions of Americans, and our bill fully funds the SNAP, child  nutrition, and WIC programs to meet the expected participation in  fiscal year 2021.   We also provided a big boost, $45 million, 18 percent, to the  Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which serves the elderly poor.   Our bill also blocks two unconscionable SNAP rules. The Able-Bodied  Adults Without Dependents final rule and the Standard Utility Allowance  proposed rule are both designed to restrict program eligibility.   The bill provides $3.3 billion for agricultural research to ensure  that America retains its role as the leader of global agricultural  science. That number includes an increase of $29.5 million for programs  that support the 1890 land-grant institutions.   We rejected the administration's proposed elimination of the Food for  Peace and the McGovern-Dole programs. Respectively, we provide $1.775  billion and $235 million for these programs, which is an increase  totaling $65 million, to ensure that American agriculture remains an  essential tool of diplomacy.   The Food and Drug Administration is funded at $3.2 billion in  discretionary funding, the increased funding dedicated to new  initiatives that would advance influenza vaccine technologies and  enhance the safety of medical products and the Nation's food supply,  especially in light of COVID-19.   The bill also gives the FDA the authority to require mandatory  recalls of  [[Page H3792]]  unsafe prescription and over-the-counter drugs. This is the same  authority that the FDA already has to recall unsafe foods, infant  formula, vaccines, and medical devices, a need that has become  increasingly apparent in the past few weeks.   The bill also funds the Commodity Futures Trading Commission at $304  million, which is the same as the administration's request.   Mr. Speaker, I am extremely proud of this division of the minibus,  and I am supportive of the whole package. I urge my colleagues to  support it.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my personal staff, Michael Reed and Maya  Solomon; and the subcommittee staff, Martha Foley, Diem-Linh Jones,  Perry Yates, Joe Layman, Randy Staples, Justin Masucci, and our intern  Xavier Roberts for their hard work on the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank Tom O'Brien of the minority staff of the  subcommittee as well as the minority staff of the full committee, and a  special thanks to our majority clerk, Shalanda Young, for her steady  hand in leading the majority full committee staff.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Granger  for her hard work and her commitment and her public service.   Finally, I want to say a special thank you to Chairwoman Lowey. This  is likely to be her last Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies appropriations bill, and it has  been a tremendous pleasure and honor working with her. We will miss  her. But Americans and people all over the world are better for her  many years of service to this Congress.
