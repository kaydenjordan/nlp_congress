 Madam Speaker, this week we said good-bye to a brave  member of the Greatest Generation. Arleigh Birk, Minnesota's last known  survivor of the horrific attack on Pearl Harbor, passed away just 2  days before his 100th birthday.   Arleigh Birk was born and raised on a farm in North Dakota and joined  the Navy when he was 19 years old. He was a 21-year-old Navy gun  director stationed aboard the USS Honolulu when Pearl Harbor was  attacked on Sunday, December 7, 1941.   As enemy forces dropped bombs, Arleigh courageously returned fire.  His ship suffered damage during the attack, and Arleigh was transferred  to the USS Denver, where he fought numerous battles throughout the  Pacific theater.   After that war, he was honorably discharged and married the love of  his life, Marion. Together, they had five children.   On Minnesota's Iron Range, Arleigh became a local legend, known for  his kindness and record of service.    Over the years, he kept in touch with many of his fellow veterans  through the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association and often attended local  events to honor the Americans lost on that infamous day.   Madam Speaker, Arleigh lived an inspiring life, and I am proud to  honor him here today. While he may be gone, Arleigh's legacy of  service, sacrifice, and courage will live on in our hearts and our  minds forever.                            ____________________
