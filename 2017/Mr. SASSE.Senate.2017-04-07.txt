 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gardner). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I would like to add my voice to yours in  commending the chairman of the Judiciary  [[Page S2444]]  Committee, the Senator from Iowa, for the honorable, principled, and  commonsense way in which he led this committee through the last number  of weeks and months as he shepherded through this body the confirmation  of Judge--on Monday, Justice--Gorsuch.   The chairman from Iowa is a special man, and the 100 of us--or the 99  of us--who are privileged and blessed to serve with him know he is the  model of how to conduct oneself honorably in this job, and America will  benefit from Judge Gorsuch's joining the Court.   I add my voice to those commending the senior Senator from Iowa for  the way he has helped shepherd this body.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The majority leader.       Congratulating Neil Gorsuch and Thanking Those Involved in the                            Confirmation Process    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am proud to say the Senate has now  confirmed Judge Neil Gorsuch as an Associate Justice on the Supreme  Court. I want to congratulate Judge Gorsuch on this significant  achievement. I look forward to observing his good work in the years to  come.   The confirmation process was certainly a significant undertaking--one  that would not have been possible without the dedicated efforts of so  many. I would like to take a moment to recognize them now.   First, I would like to thank the man who made this moment possible by  sending us this outstanding nominee. He is our President, Donald Trump.  This has been one of the most transparent judicial nomination processes  anybody can remember, and President Trump should be commended for his  efforts.   I also appreciate the role Vice President Pence played in moving this  nomination forward as well as the outstanding work of the White House  staff, led by Don McGahn, and for the wise counsel they provided  throughout this process.   Of course, we all know how tirelessly our dear friend Senator  Grassley has worked in leading the Judiciary Committee through this  process. He has been an unwavering leader, though we know it has not  always been easy. Chairman Grassley worked long and hard to ensure this  process ran efficiently, to give Members on both sides ample  opportunity to review the nomination, to see that the nominee was  treated respectfully, and, ultimately, to help bring this well- qualified jurist over the finish line.   I would be remiss if I did not also mention the work of the Judiciary  Committee collectively for its time and effort as well. I am referring  to members of the committee, and I am referring to Chairman Grassley's  excellent Judiciary staff as well. They were critical to this effort.   Specifically, I thank the following: Staff Director Kolan Davis,  Chief Nominations Counsel Ted Lehman, Communications Director Beth  Levine, Megan Lacy, Lauren Mehler, Kasey O'Connor, Katharine Willey,  Bill Lane, Carol Szurkowski, Dan Guarnera, and Katie Roholt.   To that end, I would also like to acknowledge our former colleague  Kelly Ayotte. From dozens of meetings with Senators to lengthy days- long hearings, she helped to ensure that this process ran as smoothly  as possible, and she did so with a sense of grace that we all came to  know when she was one of our colleagues.   Similarly, I want to recognize several White House Legislative  Affairs staff who helped guide Judge Gorsuch through this process,  including Mary Elizabeth Taylor, Marc Short, and Amy Swonger.   There are several others I would like to thank as well.   To the floor staff, Laura Dove, Robert Duncan, and their team, thank  you for keeping the floor running smoothly and guiding us through  Senate procedure. You all do incredible work and very difficult work,  and you make it look effortless during each and every time.   To the folks who keep our institution running--the Parliamentarians,  the clerks, the reporters of debates, the doorkeepers, Capitol Police,  and numerous others who have sacrificed and worked long--often  grueling--hours, thank you for everything you do and for always doing  it with a smile.   Of course, I would also like to thank my Republican colleagues for  their months of hard work. It has been a winding and sometimes bumpy  road, but together we were able to confirm a judge who, I believe, will  serve his country very well.   In particular, let me thank Republican whip, John Cornyn, and his  team, led by Monica Popp, for their efforts. Theirs is certainly not an  easy job, but it is a necessary one.   There are a few others I could not leave today without mentioning.   To each and every member of my own staff, I want to express my  sincere appreciation. There are almost too many names to mention, but,  if I may, I would like to acknowledge a few individuals who have been  particular assets through this entire process.   My chief of staff, Sharon Soderstrom, led our team through this  lengthy and arduous confirmation process while balancing a never-ending  list of demands. She has been a constant source of support and, as  always, an indisputable and fearless leader.   Sharon, I am immensely grateful to you for being at the helm of my  leadership office.   My deputy chief, Don Stewart--``Stew'' as we like to call him--always  knows exactly what to say or not to say, as the case may be. He has  been a critical member of the team in charting the way forward and in  helping convey our efforts to the American people.   Stew, thank you for your discerning advice and, yes, for your good  humor as well.   My policy director, Hazen Marshall, has steered our policy objectives  forward, balancing numerous legislative items and making it look  effortless along the way.   So thanks, Hazen, for your sound counsel and for driving the train  forward on so many different issues.   To my counsel, John Abegg, where do I begin? John has been an  invaluable member of my team, a guiding source of wisdom, and a driving  force in bringing Judge Gorsuch over the finish line. He has put in  countless hours and has never stopped working, even in the most trying  of times.   John, literally, this moment would not have been possible without  you.   I know there are many others whom I wasn't able to name right now,  but I want them to know we recognize their efforts, and we are  immeasurably grateful for the work they do.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
