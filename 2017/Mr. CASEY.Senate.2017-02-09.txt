 Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak about the  nomination of Tom Price to be the next Secretary of Health and Human  Services.   I wish to start this afternoon with a couple of names--just five, and  I will use just first names--five Pennsylvanians whom I will refer to  in my remarks. I am certain I will get to the first two, and I hope to  get to all five. First is Anthony; second is Rowan; third is Rebecca;  and fourth and fifth are Hannah and Madeline, two sisters whose story  inspired me and continues to inspire me today. I will start with  Anthony because I think his circumstance and that of his family are  good reminders of how important the Medicaid program is to families  across the country.   Anthony's mom wrote us a letter. I will read pertinent parts of it to  summarize his circumstance. His mom writes in the opening part of the  letter:         My son, Anthony, was born at 25 weeks and he weighed one       tiny pound. We were overcome with medical bills which       Medicaid thankfully paid for us. Since his birth he has had       multiple health crisis, seizures, sleep disorders just to       name a few.        Most recently, Anthony was diagnosed with Autism spectrum       disorder, Tourette's syndrome, severe obsessive compulsive       disorder, and Dyspraxia.    All of those in the life of one young boy--   She says:         Last spring, we were faced with the decision of putting him       in a residential treatment program. If not for his Medical       Assistance--    The name of the program for Medicaid in Pennsylvania--       this would have never been an option for us.    In other words, they wouldn't be able to get him into a residential  treatment program. Ultimately, Anthony's family chose to get him  intensive outpatient treatment, which Medical Assistance also covered.  Anthony's mom Corey ultimately decided to stay home and care for  Anthony, so she had to leave the job at which she had worked for 20  years. She said:         If we lost coverage, we would not be able to provide the       support he needs. We are sure of that.    Toward the end of the letter, she says:         My son Anthony is currently attending school almost       regularly and functioning the best he has for a very long       time thanks to the services he received from his medical       assistance. It gives me hope and encouragement that he will       someday grow up to be a contributing member of our next       generation.    That is Anthony's story of all of the benefits he and his family have  derived from Medicaid or, as we call it in Pennsylvania, the Medical  Assistance program.   The second Pennsylvanian I will talk about is Rowan. I spoke about  Rowan on the floor just a number of days ago. I am quoting from Rowan's  mom's letter. Pamela wrote:         Rowan was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder in March       of 2015.        He was extremely hyperactive and since he refused to nap,       he was a severe distraction. I cannot stress enough that we       had zero other options for our family. For months, I would       receive calls about Rowan being aggressive to other children.       This broke my heart. No parent wants to hear that their child       is hurting other children.        Late January 2016, I applied for Medicaid [Medical       Assistance]. After Rowan was awarded MA, we were able to       obtain wrap-around services.    Then she talks about a behavioral specialist consultant, a  therapeutic staff support worker, and all the help that came with those  individuals.         Specifically she helped to alleviate his aggression and       combat his over-stimulation. The wrap-around services have       been a Godsend.    Ultimately, Rowan benefited from a social skills program.         This program is a social skills program specifically for       Autistic children ages 3-21. I enrolled Rowan in November.       Rowan has benefited immensely from [this program]. Thankfully       it is covered in full by MA.    Then she concludes, in part:         Our family would be bankrupt or my son would go without       therapies he sincerely needs.        Overall, we are desperately in need of Rowan's Medical       Assistance and would be devastated if we lost these benefits.    So we have two young boys in Pennsylvania. Their stories are told by  their moms, and they are telling us: Don't cut Medicaid. Don't destroy  Medicaid, as some proposals have been not just debated here in  Washington, not just theorized about; these are policies that Members  of Congress have voted in favor of.   But now it is a little different. Now it is not just voting in favor  of so-called block-granting--a very benign term, ``block-granting.'' I  would rather use the word ``destroy,'' but we can debate that. This is  a live issue now because we have people who are still proposing block- granting, and we have a President who--at least one member of his  administration said he would sign such legislation or at least support  it. That gets to the point of my basic disagreement with what  Representative Price has not only supported but led the fight on in the  House of Representatives.   I disagree totally with his budget proposals to block-grant Medicaid  for the reasons that I just outlined--because of Rowan and Anthony and  lots of children in Pennsylvania like them, children with disabilities,  children who happen to come from low-income families, seniors who want  to get into nursing homes. All of those concerns are uppermost when I  consider his nomination.   What I was hoping he would say to me in our meeting in my office--a  very cordial meeting where we debated a little bit--and then after my  questions to him both in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee, and the Finance Committee, the committee from which his  nomination originated--I was hoping he would say: I was for block- granting Medicaid and changing Medicare and making all those proposals  as a House Member, as a leader in the debate about the budget. But I am  going to be in different place now, and I am not going to push those  ideas. I am going to have a different position, and we are not going to  go in the direction of doing that any longer, so I want to separate  from what I was proposing as a Member of the House. I have no  assurances that his advocacy or position on these issues will be any  different.   Now we have the administration embracing the very issues that in the  campaign the candidate said he was against. The Presidential candidate  said that he wouldn't touch Medicare; he wouldn't touch Medicaid. You  know the statements I am referring to.   When we talk about Medicaid and why it is such an important issue in  this confirmation process, what are we talking about? In addition to  Rowan and Anthony and children like that, we are also talking about the  fact that 45 percent of all the births in the United States of America  are paid for by Medicaid. A lot of people don't know that, but that is  the truth. One in five seniors receives Medicare assistance through  Medicaid. That is one of the reasons so many seniors are concerned  about not just what happens to Medicare, but what happens to Medicaid.   Another reason for seniors to be concerned: Two-thirds of nursing  home residents are covered by Medicaid. So when we talk about block- granting, which leads to massive cuts to Medicaid, we had better be  concerned about it because it means nursing home residents are  adversely affected.   Medicaid covers 40 percent of all the children in the country with  health care--40 percent. For poor children, 75 percent get their health  care through Medicaid, and 60 percent of all children with disabilities  are covered by Medicaid--60 percent.   How about if you live in a rural area? Let me give a sense of what  the circumstance is for Pennsylvania. We have 67 counties, 48 of them  are rural, and a lot of people in those communities are covered by  Medicaid. By one recent estimate, more than 278,000 rural  Pennsylvanians are covered by Medicaid. We know that hospitals in rural  areas depend upon Medicaid. In 15 rural Pennsylvania counties,  hospitals were the top employer. Guess what program supports those  programs, keeps the doors open: Medicaid.  [[Page S1004]]    On and on, we could talk about job loss that results from cutting  Medicaid. So if we are serious about helping children with disabilities  and protecting seniors, we should think long and hard before voting for  the block-granting of Medicaid.   One final point just with regard to Pennsylvania Medicaid.   If Medicaid were to be block-granted, as many legislators have  supported and voted for, if that happens and if the Affordable Care Act  were repealed without a replacement, Pennsylvania alone--one State-- would lose $80 billion over 10 years. This is a 38-percent reduction in  funding for Pennsylvania. I am going to fight anyone who tries to take  $80 billion away from Pennsylvania for health care.   I would hope that if Representative Price were confirmed, he would  abandon those reckless, extreme ideas to block-grant Medicaid because  of the consequences for seniors, for children, and for individuals with  disabilities.   I don't have a chance to get too far into Medicare today. If I can, I  will a little later. I will try to come back to some of the stories  people have written to us about the impact of the Affordable Care Act  on their lives.   Let me quickly go through some points about Medicare. We know that in  a State like ours, one of the oldest States in the country, about 2\1/ 2\ million Pennsylvanians rely on Medicare to help them pay for health  care costs. Thank goodness we have Medicare in place. What we would not  want to have happen in Pennsylvania is the enactment--and as I said  before with regard to Medicaid, now this is a live issue. You have  Senators and House Members in both Chambers who have already voted for  budgets that would do the following: change Medicare into a premium  support program or a voucher program, which means basically you give  seniors a fixed amount of money to buy their insurance and then say:  Good luck buying your own insurance, buying your Medicare insurance.   I don't think there are very many people in my home State who think  that is a good idea.   Of course, none of this has been on the table because these budget  votes go by and people vote for the budget, and then it doesn't go any  further, so no one feels the urgency to oppose it. Now we have,  apparently, people in both Houses in agreement with President Trump to  have him sign legislation which would change both Medicare and  Medicaid.   I think these are among the many reasons why I would vote against  Representative Price in his confirmation vote. After a lot of review of  his record, after a lot of review on what his proposals would mean if  they were to become law--and now we are at a point in our history where  these issues are no longer theoretical; they are live issues. These are  matters that could be the subject not just of debate but the subject of  enactment into law.   I will try to return later to go through some other issues with  regard to the nomination.   At this time, I will yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, before I recommence my remarks, I see the  senior Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe. I want to make sure that if  he is prepared to take the floor, I will yield.    Mr. President, let me pick up from where I left off  earlier in my discussion of some of the issues that Representative  Price, the nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services,  advocated for as a Member of the House, as a leader on the Budget  Committee. These are issues I continue to be concerned about with  regard to his nomination.   With regard to Medicare--I left off with a few comments about  Medicare. Here are some of the concerns that have been stressed by  major senior organizations with regard to some of the Medicare  proposals in Washington.   In a letter to President Trump, AARP CEO Jo Ann Jenkins said:         The average senior, with an annual income of under $25,000       and already spending one out of every six dollars on health       care, counts on Social Security for the majority of their       income and on Medicare for access to affordable health       coverage.        Unfortunately, some congressional leaders have discussed       plans to use the health care debate to fundamentally change       the Medicare program and undermine the contract made with       generations of Americans.        Proposals creating a defined contribution premium-support       program; restricting access by raising the age of       eligibility; or allowing hospitals and providers to       arbitrarily charge customers higher prices than Medicare; all       betray the promise made to older Americans who have paid into       Medicare their entire working lives.    She goes on to say:         Indeed, these proposals do little to actually lower the       cost of health care. Rather, they simply shift costs from       Medicare onto individuals--many of whom cannot afford to pay       more for their care.    So says the leader of AARP.   So that is one of the reasons why the proposals that Representative  Price has supported become front-and-center concerns in his nomination.  I will move next to a consideration of Representative Price's record on  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. If you go back to 2009,  before we passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, over  50 million Americans were uninsured in 2009. People with any sort of  medical condition were routinely denied health insurance or they were  charged exorbitant rates because of their health history. Women were  routinely charged more than men for their health insurance. Third, sick  individuals were routinely dropped from their health care coverage  because they had reached arbitrary caps on the amount of care an  insurer would pay for in a given year. Of course, in 2010, the  Affordable Care Act was passed.   Now we can say that 20 million Americans have health care coverage,  and that includes 1 million more Pennsylvanians who have health care  coverage because of that legislation. And 105 million Americans are  protected from discrimination due to preexisting conditions. Over 9  million Americans are receiving tax credits to help them cover health  insurance premiums, and 11 million seniors have saved over $23 billion  from closing the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan doughnut hole.  Pennsylvania hospitals, because of the Affordable Care Act, have saved  over $680 million due to reductions in uncompensated care.   I would add to this that all those Americans, by one estimate as many  as 156 million Americans--there is another estimate that is even higher  than that; but at least 156 million Americans--with employer-sponsored  coverage have a long list of protections against being denied coverage  for a preexisting condition, against annual or lifetime limits, against  discrimination against women because they happen to be women.   All of those protections are in place now for more than 156 million  Americans because of the Affordable Care Act. Yet, despite all of those  gains that  [[Page S1007]]  have been realized in only a few short years, Representative Tom Price  opposes the law.   In fact, he wants to repeal it. Rather than working with us to  improve it, he has proposed a replacement that would strip away many of  those critical protections. Again, they are not only protections for  people who are newly insured but protections that are in place now that  were not there for more than 156 million Americans with employer- sponsored coverage.   So I get letters from constituents concerned about his record or  concerned about the direction that he would take the Department of  Health and Human Services or the direction that the Trump  administration would go. Now apparently, after the election, after  inauguration day, the administration is supporting block-granting of  Medicaid and supporting changing Medicare as we know it.   That is why we get letters from individuals across our State. I  mentioned before that we have 48 rural counties in Pennsylvania. There  are a lot of people--literally, several million people; 3.5 million by  one estimate--living in rural counties in Pennsylvania, in rural  communities.   I have a letter from Rebecca. That was one of the names I outlined at  the beginning of my remarks earlier today. Here is what Rebecca said:   The Affordable Care Act allowed my husband to join me on the dairy  farm where I worked for 8 years and am co-owner of the herd. Over the  past 3 years, we have straightened out our finances and have gotten our  student loan debt under control. Third, we have opened an IRA to plan  for our retirement.   We live in a small trailer. We own one car. We shop at discount  grocery stores and local Mennonite food stands. We have worked hard for  financial stability. Over the past year we have begun discussions about  having a child and starting our own business. Threats to the ACA are  threats to our future, Senator, and to the future of small businesses,  agriculture, and families.   She goes on from there to tell her story.   So that is Rebecca, who has some experience, not just in rural  Pennsylvania but experience as a dairy farmer, trying to start a  family, and trying to start even more of a business career. So that is  another example of what we are hearing from people across Pennsylvania.   I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks Hannah and Madeline.  Hannah and Madeline are the daughters of Stacie Ritter. She is from  Manheim, PA. She is the mom of four children, including Hannah and  Madeline. They happen to be twins. I met them way back, I guess, in  2009. At the time Hannah and Madeline were diagnosed with a rare and  dangerous type of leukemia when they were just 4 years old.   Stacie and her husband went bankrupt trying to pay their daughters'  medical bills. She wrote to me at that time--just around 2009--saying  that, without health care reform ``my girls will be unable to afford  care, that is if they are eligible, for care that is critically  necessary to maintain this chronic condition. Punished and rejected  because they had the misfortune of developing cancer as a child.''   So said Stacie Ritter about her daughters, pleading with me at the  time, as the Senator who would vote on the Affordable Care Act. I just  met with Stacie again. She is very glad that we passed the Affordable  Care Act so that her daughters could have the health care that they  need. Fortunately, this story has a happy ending. Hannah and Madeline  are healthy young women now. They are freshmen at Arcadia University,  and they are doing well. The Affordable Care Act protects them by  ensuring they will have access to affordable coverage, whether on their  parent's plan or on a plan on the individual market.   So when we talk about that legislation, when we talk about Medicaid,  when we talk about Medicare--all of those issues--one of my basic  points is that Representative Price, were he to be Health and Human  Services Secretary Price, has to have an answer for those  Pennsylvanians. He can ignore the questions of Members of Congress, and  sometimes he has done that. We don't have time to get into that today,  but he has done that in the confirmation process.   But he has to have an answer for Stacie Ritter. He has to have an  answer for her daughters Madeline and Hannah. He cannot ignore them and  their health care needs. He has to have an answer for Rebecca, who is  worried about what will happen to her, whether she will still be able  to have a dairy farm, whether she will be able to have a family. He has  to have an answer for Rebecca in Pennsylvania.   He also has to have an answer for the two families whom I cited at  the beginning--for Anthony and Rowan's family, two young boys on the  autism spectrum who need the services of Medicaid.   So this is not theory any longer. This is not some idea that is  floating around Washington. These are real lives that will be destroyed  by some of these proposals. So if you block-grant Medicaid, you are  going to destroy a lot of lives. If you change Medicare as we know it,  and turn it into a voucher program, ripping away the guaranteed benefit  of Medicare, you are going to hurt a lot of people. If you choose to  vote for a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and you have no plan to  replace it--after 7 years of complaining about it, criticizing it, and  finger-pointing, and you don't have a replacement for it--you are going  to hurt a lot of lives.   So this is not some debate that is not connected directly to people's  lives. This is real life for those families. I have real concerns about  them if Representative Price's view of the world or his proposals that  he advocated for vigorously in the House of Representatives were to  become law. Apparently, now his ideas have been embraced totally by the  Trump administration.   Let me finish with this one point about Representative Price. There  are questions that remain surrounding Representative Price's stock  deals. He told both the Finance and HELP Committees that the discounted  shares of Innate Immunotherapeutics that he was able to purchase were  available to every individual who was an investor.   But the Wall Street Journal reported not too long ago the following.  I will just read one line from the story. The headline says:         Rep. Tom Price Got Privileged, Discounted Offer on       Biomedical Stock, Company Says.    Here is what it says in the third paragraph:         In fact, the cabinet nominee was one of fewer than 20 U.S.       investors who were invited last year to buy discounted shares       of the company--an opportunity that, for Mr. Price, arose       from an invitation from a company director and a fellow       Congressman.    So says the Wall Street Journal story of earlier this month. So that  is on the public record, based upon what the Wall Street Journal  reported.   I, at the time, joined other Democrats on the Finance Committee to  try and get this clarified. That request was denied. When we talk about  the constitutional obligations to advise and consent--the Senate  advising and consenting with regard to Cabinet nominations--we are not  talking about a rubberstamp. We are not talking about some kind of  automatic approval. We are talking about scrutiny, review, and getting  answers to questions and having a long debate about someone's  qualifications.   When you don't get clarified issues that have been raised and  validated by news organization like the Wall Street Journal, I think we  have more questions to have answered. It is a constitutional  requirement--advise and consent--that needs to be honored.   For these and many reasons, I remain opposed to the nomination of  Representative Price to be the next Secretary of Health and Human  Services.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  fellows on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, be  granted floor privileges for the remainder of the first session of the  115th Congress: Luis Arzaluz, Sherronda Sheppard, Brenda Ayon Verduzco,  Anne Ordaway, and Aliza Auces.
