 Madam Speaker, I rise today to join our  amazing city of Placentia and the residents that live in it and the  entire community in California's 39th Congressional District as we  celebrate the city's 96th birthday.   ``Placentia'' is derived from the Latin word meaning ``pleasant place  to live,'' and it certainly fulfills its name. Placentia is home to  beautiful neighborhoods, good schools, stately churches, and endless  outdoor recreation.   Our fast-growing community of 45,000 residents is tight-knit,  hardworking, and dedicated to giving back. Some of my fondest memories  include the city's concerts in the park, the annual Love Placentia  event, and the always-lively Tamale Festival.   I am honored to represent Placentia in Congress and will do all I can  to ensure our community continues to thrive.   Happy birthday, Placentia.                            ____________________
