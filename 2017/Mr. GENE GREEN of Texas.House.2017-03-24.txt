 Mr. Speaker, this is outrageous. TrumpCare  will rip health insurance from 24 million Americans, almost as many  people who live in the State of Texas.   TrumpCare is a direct assault on the President's promise to the  American people. It will saddle families across the country with  massive health costs. It will lead to higher premiums, less benefits,  and more people uninsured.   Under this bill, premiums increase 15 to 20 percent in each of the  next 2 years. It will particularly be terrible for the near-elderly  Americans because TrumpCare allows insurance companies to charge them  five times higher than what others would pay for coverage. It destroys  protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. It guts the  essential benefits so consumers won't know what coverage they have.  Plans would not have to cover things like emergency care,  hospitalization, or even prescription drugs.   What do you do when you leave people with that? Junk plans that are  insurance in name only. What is the point of having insurance if it  doesn't cover anything?   For those who aren't one of the 24 million who lose insurance, many  will be left with plans that are more expensive but don't have to cover  things like prescription drugs or mental health and substance abuse.   This bill will make it harder for people to get treatment. It will  destroy the Medicaid program, the bedrock of our social safety net that  insures 74 million Americans, including children, pregnant women, and  one in seven seniors on Medicare.    TrumpCare harms Medicare. It will make the program insolvent 3 years  earlier, directly causes part B premiums to go up $8.7 billion, and  takes away funds that seniors depend on for long-term care. It is  impossible to overstate how terrible TrumpCare will be for the American  people.   This is a dangerous bill. It is opposed by physician groups and  hospital associations.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
