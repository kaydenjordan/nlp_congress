 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table H.R. 3401, with the Senate amendments thereto, and  concur with the Senate amendment. This bipartisan bill passed the  Senate with 84 votes and it could be sent to the President for his  signature today.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. We  have a crisis on our southern border, and H.R. 3401 with the Senate  amendments gets resources to give humanitarian assistance to those  seeking asylum.   It also adds judges and judge teams to hear the claims of asylum.  Many people have to wait up to 3 years to get their hearing. That is  too long. I have twice in the last 2 weeks attempted to offer an  amendment to add judge teams. Both times, the Rules Committee has  failed to include it.   My amendment this week would have included the amount that was in the  Senate bill, but it is now in the bill because we have the Senate bill  sitting at the Speaker's desk.   I urge my colleagues to take up the bill with the Senate amendments  that include judge teams. That is the only way to solve this real  crisis: adjudicate the claims of these people who want asylum, reunite  families, and stop people from being held in detention as long.   Mr. Gonzalez from Texas and I have worked together on this. It is a  bipartisan effort. This is a no-brainer. We need to add judges. The  Senate bill does that.   Madam Speaker, I hope we can take up the Senate bill and make it  happen.
