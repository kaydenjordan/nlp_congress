 Mr. Chair, I extend my appreciation to Chairman  Graves, Ranking Member Larsen, Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Graves,  and Aviation Subcommittee Ranking Member Cohen for their work in  crafting a robust bipartisan bill in committee. I am pleased that my  language supporting airports' efforts to better manage their curb  spaces was included in the bill.   Curb management practices such as remote enforcement using sensors  and cameras can reduce traffic at pickup and drop-off areas and improve  travelers' airport experiences.   Currently, though, curb management is in a regulatory gray area  leading to uncertainty for airports and vendors that are trying to  reduce traffic, unsafe vehicular maneuvers as the flying public arrives  at their terminals, and stress for all involved.  [[Page H3714]]    My provision would provide clarity and flexibility for airports'  landside operations by making clear that there is no Federal regulation  preventing airports from managing their curbs. This language would not  impact any State or local restrictions, nor would it require airports  to do anything at all. It simply creates legal clarity.   In addition to helping large and medium-size airports improve safety,  passenger experience, and queuing times in increasingly crowded and  multi-modal drop-off and pickup areas, cutting-edge curbside management  can serve as a demonstration project to adjacent cities and towns that  are wrestling with how to unlock better curbside use for delivery,  micromobility, rideshare, parking, and outdoor dining and recreation.   Again, I thank the chairman and ranking member for their work  including this provision.
