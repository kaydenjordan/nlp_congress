 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of the George Floyd  Justice in Policing Act. The measures in this bill are long overdue and  are a step forward in ensuring people, especially Black folks in our  country, do not experience racist police violence.   We can't stop here, though, Mr. Speaker. I think about Aiyana  Stanley-Jones, a young girl in Detroit who would be graduating from  high school this year if she had not been murdered by police when they  raided her home, the wrong home, while she slept in 2010.   We can't stop here. We must continue to push policies that will tear  down structural racism, reimagine public safety, and divest from  policing so we can invest more in education, healthcare, mental health,  jobs, transportation, things that keep us safe and our communities  thriving.   Aiyana should be here. George should be here. Breonna Taylor should  be here. They all should be here.   Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker, and I continue to work toward justice  for all of us.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   In January of this year, I stood here to speak against this  administration's continued attack on our students. Five months later,  Secretary DeVos, with the support of this administration, continues to  work on behalf of predatory for-profit institutions rather than the  students they lied to that they scammed.   Instead of ensuring that students who were cheated out of their  future by this these fraudulent institutions receive debt relief,  Secretary DeVos is fighting to ensure that these institutions are never  held accountable.   Both Democratic and Republican Members alike agreed that if you were  defrauded by one of these colleges, then your Federal student loan  should be forgiven. We must stop this administration's relentless  efforts to protect the pockets of predatory corporations at the expense  of our students. I am proud to support this veto override.
