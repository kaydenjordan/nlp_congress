 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6824) to authorize the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure  Security Agency of the Department of Homeland Security to hold an  annual cybersecurity competition relating to offensive and defensive  cybersecurity disciplines, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6824         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, before I begin debate on today's legislation, I will  take a moment to acknowledge the tragic, bloody events of this weekend  in Milwaukee, Buffalo, and Orange County, California. The loss of life  and extent of injury to innocent people, as we all know, are  staggering.   These incidents are all under investigation but, from a homeland  security perspective, I will zero in, in particular, on the events in  New York where we have, I think, a fairly good picture of what  motivated a man to gun down innocent people, an event that has happened  too many times in recent history in our country.   This young man clearly was motivated by an idea, a hateful idea and a  racist idea, and one that is sadly familiar to us. It is the same idea  that motivated another man to gun down African Americans in Charleston,  South Carolina. It is the same idea that motivated yet another man to  gun down Hispanic Americans in El Paso, Texas. It is the same idea that  motivated another man to gun down Jewish Americans in Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania.   It is an idea that spreads on the internet. But it doesn't just  spread organically. Social media companies write algorithms  deliberately designed to connect people who are susceptible to this  hateful idea to others who may be propagating it. It is an idea that  sadly is sometimes amplified and legitimized by political leaders and  media personalities in our country.   We have a domestic terrorism problem in America. We all understand  that on the Homeland Security Committee. If this problem was coming  from outside the United States, it would be easy for us to come  together to deal with it.   Imagine if after the September 11 attacks there were cable news hosts  who night after night propagated ideas straight from al-Qaida's  propaganda materials. We wouldn't tolerate it. Nobody would for one  moment think that was acceptable in the United States of America. But  because it is a domestic problem rooted in our own society, it is  harder. We have to find a way to come together, nonetheless.   I think there are two kinds of leaders in America today, not  Democrat, Republican, liberal, or conservative. There are leaders who,  when they see a fire burning, they reach for a bucket of water to put  it out. And there are leaders who, when they see a fire burning, reach  for a can of gasoline to make that fire burn even more. We desperately  need leaders in this country, of both political parties, who will try  to calm things down and who will tamp down these horrible, hateful  ideas, whether they are coming from the left or the right, wherever  they are coming from, because these ideas are leading to people being  gunned down in our country. It is unacceptable, and it has to stop.   Mr. Speaker, let's turn to the legislation before us today.   Mr. Speaker, as a nation, we are fortunate to have so many dedicated  public servants who work for our Federal Government and help keep us  safe. Unfortunately, they frequently go without the recognition they  deserve for their hard work. The President's Cup Cybersecurity  Competition Act authorizes an innovative prize competition where cyber  talent within the ranks of Federal departments and agencies is honored.   Today, it is critical to our homeland and national security that the  Federal Government attract, develop, and retain dedicated and talented  employees to carry out cybersecurity and cyber defense activities. It  is not lost on me that, by choosing to work for the government rather  than the private sector, these in-demand professionals often forgo more  lucrative career opportunities.   H.R. 6824 would authorize the cyber competition that CISA hosts and  ensure that financial awards can be provided to the winning individuals  and teams in recognition of their achievement. In the short period of  time that the President's Cup has been around, it has become a much- sought-after prize among talented Federal cyber practitioners, many of  whom are civilians or active military. By permanently authorizing this  competition, Congress can ensure that it remains a vital part of our  strategy to identify, retain, and reward the best cybersecurity talent  in the Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud Representative Luria for her leadership in  authoring this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, the President's Cup Cybersecurity Competition has been  an important part of our strategy to support a strong Federal  cybersecurity workforce in recent years. Unfortunately, without  congressional authorization, it lacks the stability it needs. So thanks  to this legislation, authored by my committee colleague, Representative  Luria, we have the opportunity to authorize and preserve a key  retention tool in the Federal toolbox to ensure that talented Federal  cyber professionals get the recognition they deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6824, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 2520) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide  for engagements with State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2520         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``State and Local Government       Cybersecurity Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO THE HOMELAND SECURITY ACT OF 2002.         Subtitle A of title XXII of the Homeland Security Act of       2002 (6 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) is amended--        (1) in section 2201 (6 U.S.C. 651), by adding at the end       the following:        ``(7) SLTT entity.--The term `SLTT entity' means a domestic       government entity that is a State government, local       government, Tribal government, territorial government, or any       subdivision thereof.''; and        (2) in section 2209 (6 U.S.C. 659)--        (A) in subsection (c)(6), by inserting ``operational and''       before ``timely'';        (B) in subsection (d)(1)(E), by inserting ``, including an       entity that collaborates with election officials,'' after       ``governments''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following:        ``(p) Coordination on Cybersecurity for SLTT Entities.--        ``(1) Coordination.--The Center shall, upon request and to       the extent practicable, and in coordination as appropriate       with Federal and non-Federal entities, such as the Multi-      State Information Sharing and Analysis Center--        ``(A) conduct exercises with SLTT entities;        ``(B) provide operational and technical cybersecurity       training to SLTT entities to address cybersecurity risks or       incidents, with or without reimbursement, related to--        ``(i) cyber threat indicators;        ``(ii) defensive measures;        ``(iii) cybersecurity risks;        ``(iv) vulnerabilities; and        ``(v) incident response and management;        ``(C) in order to increase situational awareness and help       prevent incidents, assist SLTT entities in sharing, in real       time, with the Federal Government as well as among SLTT       entities, actionable--        ``(i) cyber threat indicators;        ``(ii) defensive measures;        ``(iii) information about cybersecurity risks; and        ``(iv) information about incidents;        ``(D) provide SLTT entities notifications containing       specific incident and malware information that may affect       them or their residents;        ``(E) provide to, and periodically update, SLTT entities       via an easily accessible platform and other means--        ``(i) information about tools;        ``(ii) information about products;        ``(iii) resources;        ``(iv) policies;        ``(v) guidelines;        ``(vi) controls; and        ``(vii) other cybersecurity standards and best practices       and procedures related to information security, including, as       appropriate, information produced by other Federal agencies;        ``(F) work with senior SLTT entity officials, including       chief information officers and senior election officials and       through national associations, to coordinate the effective       implementation by SLTT entities of tools, products,       resources, policies, guidelines, controls, and procedures       related to information security to secure the information       systems, including election systems, of SLTT entities;        ``(G) provide operational and technical assistance to SLTT       entities to implement tools, products, resources, policies,       guidelines, controls, and procedures on information security;        ``(H) assist SLTT entities in developing policies and       procedures for coordinating vulnerability disclosures       consistent with international and national standards in the       information technology industry; and        ``(I) promote cybersecurity education and awareness through       engagements with Federal agencies and non-Federal entities.        ``(q) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this subsection, and every 2 years thereafter,       the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Homeland       Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the       Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives a report on the services and capabilities       that the Agency directly and indirectly provides to SLTT       entities.''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, in recent months the world has watched in horror as  Russia launched its unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine.  Russia's actions have, once again, reminded us of the potential for  cyberattacks on critical infrastructure here in the United States.   With State and local governments operating large amounts of critical  infrastructure, including essential public services like schools,  emergency response agencies, and water utilities, it is essential that  State and local governments have strong cybersecurity practices.   In March, in response to the current threat landscape, President  Biden sent a letter to the Nation's Governors urging them to take  actions to enhance their cyber defenses. The Federal Government must  continue to expand our partnerships with States as they carry out this  important national security work.   Congress has already taken some critical steps in this effort this  Congress, thanks to the leadership of my colleagues on the Homeland  Security Committee. Last year, the House passed Congresswoman Yvette  Clarke's State and Local Cybersecurity Improvement Act which created a  new grant program to assist State, local, Tribal, and territorial  Governments with strengthening their cybersecurity. This legislation  was signed by President Biden in the fall as part of the bipartisan  infrastructure law and will provide $1 billion in much-needed help over  the next 4 years.   Additionally, last year, Congress passed the K-12 Cybersecurity Act  introduced by Senator Peters and Congressman Langevin. That bill  directs the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to study  the cyber risks posed to K-12 educational institutions and provide them  with additional resources to better defend themselves.   Right now, I am proud to be working on a bipartisan basis with  Senators Peters and Cornyn, and my Homeland Security Committee  colleague Representative Garbarino, on the Satellite Cybersecurity Act,  urgently needed legislation to better protect critical infrastructure  used at the municipal, State, and Federal level that relies on  commercial satellite data to work properly.   Passing S. 2520 will build on these efforts by further strengthening  the relationship between DHS and State and local Governments as they  work to defend our country against cyberattacks. More specifically, it  would permit DHS to provide State and local Governments with access to  cybersecurity resources and encourage collaboration in using these  resources, including joint cybersecurity exercises.                                time  1430    Additionally, the bill will strengthen the relationship between DHS  and the Multi State Information Sharing and Analysis Center to help  State and local governments receive the most updated information  regarding potential threats and gain access to greater technical  assistance.   I thank Senators Peters and Portman for their leadership in  introducing this bill, I urge my colleagues to support the legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we rely on State and local governments for some of our  most basic and necessary public services. We have seen many communities  across the country experience disruptions in those vital services due  to ransomware attacks originating from Russia.   In this current threat environment, with a heightened risk of even  more dangerous cyberattacks, S. 2520 would enhance DHS's collaboration  with State and local governments in addressing this pressing national  security threat.   By passing this bill and sending it to the President, we will  continue our ongoing efforts to expand critical Federal cybersecurity  assistance to State and local governments.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 2520, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6873) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  establish the Office for Bombing Prevention to address terrorist  explosive threats, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6873         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Explosives research and development.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, between January 4 and February 16 of this year, there  were over 50 bomb threats that disproportionately targeted historically  Black colleges and universities, Black churches, mosques, and  synagogues across our country.   These racially and ethnically targeted bomb threats have continued  through the spring. They have sowed fear, disrupted academic  instruction, and interfered with the ability of Americans to worship  safely.   They have also brought into focus the diversity of the current  homeland security threat picture and reminded us that conventional  threats, like  [[Page H4981]]  bombings, deserve sustained attention, even as efforts to counter mass  shootings and cyber threats have to be intensified.   I introduced H.R. 6873, the Bombing Prevention Act of 2022, for the  first time to authorize the Office for Bombing Prevention.   For the past 15 years, the Office for Bombing Prevention has been  responsible for coordinating DHS' efforts at preventing, protecting  against, mitigating the effects of, and responding to improvised  explosive devices here domestically, and helping our partners and  allies around the world do the same.   The Office for Bombing Prevention is squarely focused on protecting  critical infrastructure, working with private sector partners, and  supporting our Federal, State, local, Tribal, and territorial entities  to mitigate explosive effects on critical infrastructure.   To that end, it regularly engages with stakeholders, including  educational stakeholders, about accessing the office's training and  tools, such as its counter-IED capability.   H.R. 6873 would bring needed permanence and predictability to the  operations of this office and position it to build capacity to meet  growing demands for its services.   Importantly, my bill directs the office to develop a strategy that  aligns its operations with the threat environment and stakeholder  needs; improves the sharing of information about explosive threats; and  enhances awareness of the office's capabilities to those around the  country who are most at risk.   The bill also directs the Secretary of the DHS to provide to public-  and private-sector entities technical assistance services related to  countering these explosive threats.   Finally, to keep the office accountable, H.R. 6873 requires an annual  report to Congress.   This bipartisan legislation, which I was pleased to introduce with my  colleague from Arkansas (Mr. Crawford), will better position the Office  for Bombing Prevention to provide counter-explosives resources to  stakeholders as the threat environment changes, making communities  across America more secure and helping to ensure that in this country,  no person should have to work, study, or worship while living in fear  of a terrorist bombing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in my home State of New Jersey, there have been more  than 25 bomb scares since 2020, threatening public schools,  universities, community centers, and religious institutions.   Just last fall in my district, the Roxbury Township school system  received a bomb threat that led to panic and K9 sweeps on school  property during teaching hours, and nearby Hopewell Valley Central High  School encountered an explosive threat that forced the school to  evacuate and shut down early for the day.   In addition, 7 years ago this September, over a 2-day period,  communities in Seaside Park and Elizabeth, New Jersey, as well as the  Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan were rocked by three bombings that  wounded 31 people.   Subsequent analysis done by the Office for Bombing Prevention at DHS  determined that each of the devices planted by the assailant was  completely different from the others.   Two of the bombs were pipe bombs, two were homemade pressure cooker  bombs, some used modified Christmas tree lights and cellphones, and one  of the pressure cooker bombs used two different chemicals that alone  are not dangerous but ignite when combined.                                time  1445    The office concluded that while each of the bombs was different, all  included elements detailed in several issues of al-Qaida's Inspire  magazine.   The invaluable analysis carried out by the office in the wake of the  September 2016 New Jersey-area attacks was shared with first responders  and homeland security stakeholders all across the country, underscoring  the expertise of the Office for Bombing Prevention and the important  role it plays in equipping our communities with the best information  available to keep the public safe.   Today, the office provides critical support to help defend  communities across America from the threats posed by explosives, but we  need to empower it to do more. The Bombing Prevention Act does just  that. It has been endorsed by the Anti-Defamation League and by the  Jewish Federations of North America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6873, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6825) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to enhance  the funding and administration of the Nonprofit Security Grant Program  of the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6825         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6825, the Nonprofit  Security Grant Program Improvement Act.   More than 20 years after the September 11 attacks, the terrorism  threat landscape has grown significantly more complex, and houses of  worship and other nonprofits have become targets for domestic and  foreign terrorists.   Earlier this year, four Americans were held at gunpoint by a  terrorist at a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas. During the Colleyville  attack, Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker used security training to help  bring the standoff to an end without injury to his congregants.   The training that proved so crucial that Sabbath was funded by the  Department of Homeland Security's Nonprofit Security Grant Program. The  NSGP, as it has come to be known, is a competitive grant program that  provides funding to nonprofit organizations, such as religious  institutions, at high risk of a terrorist attack to help bolster their  security.   Grant funding is primarily used to pay for active shooter training,  fencing, barriers, and surveillance cameras.   In recent years, demand for the program has grown exponentially,  given the heightened threat environment that we face. Over the past 3  years, to meet this demand, Congress has increased funding almost  threefold to $250 million in fiscal year 2022.   Even with significant new resources, FEMA reported that, in fiscal  year 2021, there was a $200 million gap between applications and  funding. To provide FEMA with more resources to help bolster the  security of more at-risk nonprofits, H.R. 6825 authorizes $500 million  in grant funding for fiscal years 2023 to 2028.   This bipartisan bill, which was introduced by the leaders of the  Committee on Homeland Security, Chairman Bennie Thompson and Ranking  Member   John Katko, also includes a range of enhancements to the  program's operations.   H.R. 6825 would establish a dedicated program office to carry out  education, outreach, and engagement to provide technical assistance and  support. Among other things, it includes technical changes to eliminate  or prevent administrative or operational obstacles that may impact  access by eligible applicants; sets baseline requirements for States  that administer the program; and requires audits to prevent waste,  fraud, and abuse.   The legislation, which was developed in close coordination with FEMA,  was unanimously supported by the committee in March.   Before I conclude, I would like to address an article that appeared  in the Jewish Link, a prominent news outlet for the Jewish community in  New Jersey and New York, in which questions were raised about the grant  guidance for the program for the current fiscal year.   On behalf of Chairman Thompson, let me express my appreciation to  Representatives Pascrell and Gottheimer, in particular, for alerting  the committee to these concerns and the chairman's commitment to engage  FEMA about the questions that were raised.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), chairman of the Homeland  Security Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, back home in New Jersey, I make a point of checking in  on faith communities as often as I can. We gather together, we talk  about the issues of the day, we talk about how their members can help  the community at large. And in every one of these conversations, I am  sad to say, the issue of security comes up. We talk about this grant  program and how it can help them protect themselves.   It saddens me because I know that bulletproof glass is not the  solution to hatred. Security guards and security cameras are not the  solution to the violence that is plaguing our society. Security at the  point of the religious institution is not the solution, it is the last  resort. And yet, it is something that we have to do. Until we defeat  the hatred, until we deal with how it spreads through our society, we  have to harden our institutions so people can worship and gather  peacefully in safety.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here with my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle in support of a bill that addresses this need, H.R. 6825,  the Nonprofit Security Grant Program Improvement Act. It is a timely  measure that is responsive to the current threat picture.   Instances of anti-Semitic crime, for example, hit an all-time high in  2021 in America. My home State of New Jersey and the neighboring State  of New York, accounted for nearly 30 percent of the reported total.   The bill is endorsed by The Jewish Federations of North America, the  Anti-Defamation League, the Sikh Coalition, the Secure Community  Network, the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, and The  National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.   Just today, ahead of consideration of the bill, The Jewish  Federations of North America reached out to say: ``The Nonprofit  Security Grant Program is critically important to the safety and  security of faith communities and others who are at risk. The Jewish  Federations would like to thank Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member  Katko for advancing an  [[Page H4985]]  authorization bill that will strengthen the Nonprofit Security Grant  Program and increase much-needed funding for at-risk institutions.''   Mr. Speaker, for all these reasons, while it is not enough, I do  strongly believe that enactment of H.R. 6825 will position this program  to be effective in the future. It will enable us to provide these  essential grants to every faith institution that needs them.   None of us want to communicate to folks in our district that we were  able to help this synagogue, this mosque, this church, but the one  across the street, the one in a different neighborhood, we are sorry,  we can't help you because we ran out of money. That is absolutely  unacceptable, and we are going to solve this program.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6825, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6871) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide  for certain acquisition authorities for the Under Secretary of  Management of the Department of Homeland Security, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 6871         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R. 6871, the DHS  Acquisition Reform Act. The Committee on Homeland Security has examined  for several years the Department of Homeland Security's challenges in  managing its acquisition programs.   The Department uses its acquisition system to carry out its critical  missions, such as screening travelers, cybersecurity, border security,  and disaster response.   In 2016, the Government Accountability Office reported that one-third  of the DHS major acquisition programs it reviewed experienced cost  overruns and schedule delays, increasing costs by $1.7 billion. And  just last year, GAO reported that 10 of the Department's 24 programs  that it reviewed had failed to meet their cost or schedule targets  during fiscal year 2020.   To address DHS' acquisition challenges, H.R. 6871 would centralize  oversight of the Department's portfolios of acquisition programs to  guard against waste. The bill designates the Under Secretary for  Management as the Department's chief acquisition officer and authorizes  related oversight responsibilities for other key officials.   Under this act, the chief acquisition officer is charged with  advising the Secretary of Homeland Security regarding acquisition  activities that incorporate widely accepted program management best  practices and standards.   H.R. 6871 establishes an Office of Test and Evaluation to provide  oversight of test and evaluation activities for major acquisition  programs to ensure that those programs meet operational requirements.  Additionally, the bill establishes a Program Accountability and Risk  Management Office to identify problems with cost, schedule, or  performance that may need to be addressed to prevent cost overruns,  schedule delays, or performance issues.   The increased oversight provided in the DHS Acquisition Reform Act  will help the Department to manage its major acquisitions more  effectively.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6871 will help ensure that DHS acquisition programs  remain on budget and on schedule while meeting performance  requirements.   In committee, this measure, introduced by my colleague from Kansas,  Mr. LaTurner, received strong bipartisan support.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6871, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6868) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide  for financial assistance to fund certain cybersecurity and  infrastructure security education and training programs and  [[Page H4989]]  initiatives, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6868         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cybersecurity Grants for       Schools Act of 2022''.       SEC. 2. STRENGTHENING CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION SUPPORT.         (a) In General.--Section 2220 of the Homeland Security Act       of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 665f) is amended by adding at the end the       following new subsection:        ``(e) Grants and Cooperative Agreements.--The Director may       award financial assistance in the form of grants or       cooperative agreements to States, local governments,       institutions of higher education (as such term is defined in       section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.       1001)), nonprofit organizations, and other non-Federal       entities as determined appropriate by the Director for the       purpose of funding cybersecurity and infrastructure security       education and training programs and initiatives to--        ``(1) carry out the purposes of CETAP; and        ``(2) enhance CETAP to address the national shortfall of       cybersecurity professionals.''.        (b) Briefings.--Paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of section       2220 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 665f) is       amended--        (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (C) and (D) as       subparagraphs (D) and (E) respectively; and        (2) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following new       subparagraph:        ``(C) information on any grants or cooperative agreements       made pursuant to subsection (e), including how any such       grants or cooperative agreements are being used to enhance       cybersecurity education for underserved populations or       communities;''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, whenever you talk to experts working in cybersecurity,  one of the first priorities they emphasize is how important it is to  address the shortage of trained cybersecurity professionals. We can  invest in the latest technology, but if we don't have the talent to  implement cybersecurity practices, we will be left vulnerable.   There are many programs in the Federal Government designed to help  address this problem, but one particularly essential one is the  Cybersecurity Education and Training Assistance Program, or CETAP.  Operated by DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency,  CETAP supports K-12 cybersecurity education across the country.   H.R. 6868 will strengthen this existing program by giving CISA the  authority to provide grants to State and local governments, colleges  and universities, and nonprofit organizations to carry out the program  and help address the shortage of cybersecurity professionals in the  United States.   The bill also includes an important amendment from Representative  Jackson Lee to ensure that CISA reports to Congress on how these grants  are supporting the cybersecurity education of women and  underrepresented communities.                                time  1515    As we address our cyber workforce challenges, we must make sure that  no groups are excluded from that effort.   I thank the sponsors of H.R. 6868, Representatives Garbarino and  Titus, for their work on this bill. I urge my colleagues to support  this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, expanding access to cybersecurity education in our K-12  schools will develop the next generation of cybersecurity professionals  who have the knowledge needed to protect us in today's connected world.   CETAP has shown great success in addressing this challenge, and this  bill will help us build on that progress.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6868, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5658) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to  submit a report on the cybersecurity roles and responsibilities of the  Federal Government, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5658         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Roles and       Responsibilities in Cyber Space Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The Department of Homeland Security, through the       Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, is the lead       Federal coordinator for securing critical infrastructure       across all 16 sectors, in coordination with designated Sector       Risk Management Agencies.        (2) Cyber incidents require technical resources and are       only sometimes sector specific.        (3) The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is       the central agency that can quickly analyze and coordinate       mitigations when a malicious cyber campaign spans multiple       sectors.        (4) Section 2209 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002       authorizes the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security       Agency as the Federal civilian interface for multi-      directional and cross-sector sharing of information related       to cyber threat indicators with and between the government       and the private sector.        (5) Section 2209 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002       authorizes the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security       Agency to facilitate cross-sector coordination to address       cybersecurity risks  [[Page H4990]]       and incidents, including cybersecurity risks and incidents       that may be related or could have consequential impacts       across multiple sectors.        (6) Presidential Policy Directive-41 directs the Department       of Homeland Security, via the national cybersecurity and       communications integration center, to be the lead Federal       agency for asset response during a significant cyber       incident.        (7) The functions of the national cybersecurity and       communications integration center are carried about by the       Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency's       Cybersecurity Division.        (8) Presidential Policy Directive-21 directs the Department       of Homeland Security to lead the coordination of critical       infrastructure protection among the Sector Risk Management       Agencies.        (9) Section 9002 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry       National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021       codified the duties of Sector Risk Management Agencies for       critical infrastructure sectors, laying out the roles and       responsibilities they have in coordinating with the       Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to secure       the nation's critical infrastructure.        (10) Enhancing the security and resilience of our critical       infrastructure is a priority for Congress and for the Nation.        (11) The Department of Homeland Security maintains and       continues to build partnerships across all infrastructure       sectors to enhance control systems cybersecurity.        (12) Section 1731 of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry       National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021       directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a       report on the potential for better coordination of Federal       cybersecurity efforts at an integrated cybersecurity center       within the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.       SEC. 3. REPORT ON CYBERSECURITY ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF                     THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY.         (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland       Security, in coordination with the Director of the       Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency of the       Department of Homeland Security, shall submit to the       Committee on Homeland Security of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report on the roles and       responsibilities of the Department and its components       relating to cyber incident response.        (b) Contents.--The report required under subsection (a)       shall include the following:        (1) A review of how the cyber incident response plans under       section 2210(c) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6       U.S.C. 660(c)) are utilized in the Federal Government's       response to a cyber incident.        (2) An explanation of the roles and responsibilities of the       Department of Homeland Security and its components with       responsibility for, or in support of, the Federal       Government's response to a cyber incident, including primary       responsibility for working with impacted private sector       entities.        (3) An explanation of which and how authorities of the       Department and its components are utilized in the Federal       Government's response to a cyber incident.        (4) Recommendations to provide further clarity for roles       and responsibilities of the Department and its components       relating to cyber incident response.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, given the magnitude and complexity of the current  cybersecurity threat landscape, coordination among DHS components to  address growing and evolving risks in cybersecurity is critical. It is  important that DHS components coordinate in a manner that reflects how  their respective expertise can fit into the broader DHS cybersecurity  strategy.   While the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has the  most notable role in cybersecurity at DHS, other components also have  considerable cyber expertise.   For example, the Secret Service has a critical role in investigating  cybercrimes, and the Transportation Security Administration and the  Coast Guard provide cybersecurity support for the transportation  sector.   As DHS develops its cybersecurity strategy and incident response  planning, it must consider how best to use each of these components and  must carefully define roles and responsibilities so that components  understand their duties during a cyber incident.   To that end, H.R. 5658 directs DHS to provide a report to Congress  that explains the roles and responsibilities of its components in cyber  incident response. The report is to include information on how DHS'  authorities and CISA's incident response plans are utilized in the  Federal Government's overall cyber incident response efforts.   This report will help ensure that DHS is developing a coordinated  effort to provide Congress critical information regarding the  authorities needed to facilitate effective cyber incident response.   I thank Representative Bacon for collaborating with the Homeland  Security Committee on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in recent years, we have seen several cyber incidents  that have demonstrated the importance of effective incident response  planning.   With cyber incidents occurring across many sectors, DHS plays a  unique role as the lead Federal coordinator for securing critical  infrastructure. Passing this bill will help ensure that DHS and its  components have the properly defined roles and responsibilities  necessary to carry out this mission effectively.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5658. I am sure we all look  forward to spending quality time together as we do roll call votes on  all of these noncontroversial, bipartisan bills this week, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
