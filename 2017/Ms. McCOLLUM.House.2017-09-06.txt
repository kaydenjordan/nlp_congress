 Mr. Chair, I would like to just take a brief second and  thank the full committee chair and the full committee ranking member  for their support as we move forward in this progress, and a special  thank you to all the great staff on both sides of the aisle, the  Democratic and Republican staff.   But my very special thanks to Chairman Calvert, and once again, for  his staff and our staff, for their work in an open and collaborative  approach. This committee has a challenging portfolio of issues, and I  commend the chairman's efforts to find solutions in yet another  difficult budget year.   Unfortunately, the fiscal year 2018 Interior, Environment, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee allocation is $824 million less than last  year's enacted level.                                time  1800    This devastating cut to the allocation shortchanges the protection of  our Nation's natural and cultural resources and has real consequences  for American families and communities.   Adequate funding for the Interior, Environment division is critical  at a time when the Trump administration is attacking the science behind  climate change and rolling back regulations that protect the water we  drink and the air we breathe.   We are at a defining moment in history. Our lack of action to combat  climate change now will impact the world we pass on to our children and  grandchildren. We can no longer afford to disregard the overwhelming  scientific evidence that the planet is warming, sea levels are rising,  and glaciers are melting.   We have all seen the destruction inflicted by Hurricane Harvey. As  the waters recede, the Environmental Protection Agency is playing a key  role in keeping Americans safe. Once again, we are reminded of the  importance of agencies like the EPA both during times of crisis and on  a daily basis.   Unfortunately, EPA receives the most significant programmatic cuts to  this division. Slashing the Environmental Protection Agency by $534  million will severely impact the Agency's ability to protect human  health and safety and ensure clean air and clean water for all  Americans.   The Agency's budget is already $2.2 billion below FY10 levels. It is  irresponsible to cut the EPA even further.   The bill also cuts programs critical to managing public lands and  reduces funding necessary for endangered species listing protection.  The American people expect us to be good stewards of our public lands  and wildlife, but this bill falls short on that commitment.   Despite the bill's shortcomings in environmental protection and  resource conservation, I want to express how proud I am of this  subcommittee's nonpartisan approach to addressing issues facing our  Native American brothers and sisters.   I am pleased that the bill recommends an increase of $108 million  over the fiscal year 2017 enacted level for programs critical to Indian  Country. The health, education, and safety of tribal communities is a  Federal responsibility that our subcommittee takes very seriously. That  is one bright spot in this bill.   Unfortunately, this bill falls far short in too many other areas,  both as a result of our low allocation and as a result of wildfire  suppression costs that are burning a hole in this bill. Since the start  of this year, more than 1.1 million acres have burned. As a result, the  U.S. Forest Service does not have adequate funding in the current  fiscal year to combat these disasters. They will need to borrow funds  from nonfire accounts, making it harder for the Service to conduct  preparedness activities to reduce the severity of wildfires. That is  why every member of the Interior Subcommittee is a cosponsor of  Chairman Simpson's Wildfire Disaster Funding Act.   I am very disappointed that the majority's leadership missed an  opportunity to include those commonsense reforms in this legislation.  That is why I have called for emergency funding for wildfire  suppression activities in the next disaster supplemental.   Finally, in addition to the irresponsible cuts to the EPA and natural  resource programs, I must express my concern and disappointment with  the partisan riders in this bill that pander to special interests at  the expense of the public good. These riders jeopardize protection and  recovery for vulnerable species, restrict protection of our oceans,  undermine clean water and clean air safeguards, and even prevent the  development of renewable energy.   Mr. Chairman, this bill is not sufficient to meet the needs of the  American people. I know that we can do better than this. Congress needs  a bipartisan budget agreement that increases nondefense discretionary  spending levels.   Despite my current opposition, I want to be clear that I will  continue to work with Chairman Calvert through this year's  appropriations process to produce a responsible bill that both parties  can support.    Mr. Chairman, thank you for your work on this bill  providing funding to critical programs. I appreciate the opportunity to  speak about the importance of the Community Services Block Grant. This  program funds community action agencies that address poverty and assist  seniors and other vulnerable populations in becoming self-sufficient. I  have seen, in my district, the valuable services these groups provide  helping people find jobs.     I thank the chairman, my friend, for his response and  commitment to robustly funding the Community Services Block Grant. I  know this program, as I said, helps people across the Nation and brings  great value to the communities it serves.
