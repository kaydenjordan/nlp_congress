 Mr. Speaker, it has been the honor of my life to  serve in this distinguished body on behalf of the people of southwest  Washington.   As I look around this Chamber, I am flooded with memories, thinking  about everything that has happened in this room, both good and bad, in  the 12 years since I first took my oath.   I can remember driving my 1990s vintage Ford Explorer across the  country, with my husband of 3 months, in late December 2010 to get here  in time for swearing in. I was ready to do my very best for my home  region and Congress.   Some things haven't changed. I still have that Ford Explorer; my  husband is every bit the rock now that he was then; and I have never  compromised  [[Page H9694]]  what I came here to do, which is to serve my region and defend the  Constitution.   Some things have changed. We have added a minivan to our fleet to  transport our three beautiful children, and I have gotten a chance to  work with some amazing people.   I will share a few observations but, first, some thanks.   I thank my colleagues. In this body, I have gotten to work with some  of the most accomplished, smartest people in the world, and I treasure  your friendship.   My husband, Dan, deserves the lion's share of my gratitude. The  sacrifices that he has made, his wisdom and his love for me and our  three children--Abigail, who is 9; Ethan, who is 6; and Isana, who is  3--have been an immeasurable blessing to our family.   I had all three of my kids during my congressional tenure, if that  gives you a little glimpse into the amazing man that my husband is. My  parents and Dan's parents have done more than I can possibly recount to  support us.   To southwest Washington, thank you for entrusting me six times with  this awesome responsibility. To my team, many of whom have been with me  all 12 years--Afton, Casey, Pam, Jordan, and the rest--with your help,  we did things that nobody else could have done.   When I was first elected, healthcare reform was our Nation's  challenge. But if you know me, you know that ``no'' or ``never'' are  like a starter's gun to me. We took the challenge on, and in 12 years:  We helped launch the first of its kind Maternity Care Caucus; we  successfully championed the ACE Kids Act, which broke the barrier for  low-income and high-needs kids; we helped drive maternal mortality  review committees; we helped grandfather association health plans for  Washington residents; and we also worked our tails off for every single  corner of our region.   We found out that veterans had to drive for hours to get a blood draw  or a flu shot, so we pushed, pulled, and prodded the VA until we got a  regular mobile clinic out to serve those military heroes.   For those who make their living fishing in our rivers, few  achievements have given me more joy than passing landmark salmon  preservation legislation. I still get stopped in the grocery store over  that one.   I took to this floor to successfully block some ideas and projects  that were just plain bad for our region. Sometimes the region demands  that you stand up and say stop, even if the momentum is going against  you.   On that note, as I depart, I would like to offer just a little bit of  unsolicited advice to my friends here in this Chamber.   One way or another, every single one of us, or you, are going to  leave office, as I am preparing to do now. When that happens, so many  people are going to ask you what you are most proud of.   You are going to think back with pride about all the times that you  helped someone that you represent out of a really tough situation, or  you will be proud that you stood strong for what you thought was right,  or you will be proud of the laws that you passed to help make lives  better for Americans.   But let me tell you what you won't think of: That time you tweeted  something that got 10,000 likes; or that time that you thought of a  really mean, clever thing to say about the other party or the other  team; or those times you told part of the truth or maybe not all the  truth and hoped that no one was going to ask you what you really meant.   The people who elect us put their faith in us to represent them, and  we owe them the truth. At times, especially in the heat of the moment,  the truth is somewhat the last thing that people want to hear,  especially if it doesn't fit their narrative, but that doesn't make it  any less true.   We don't do Americans any favors if we deceive them or if we stand by  quietly as they deceive themselves.   Hard-core partisans on both sides will tell you that their party is  blameless and that the other party is the only one that engages in  deception. But the truth is, there are people in both parties who have  made an industry of it.   I have faith in the American people to eventually put a stop to this,  but we here in this body also have a responsibility to truth. After  all, it is the only thing that truly sets us free.                            ____________________
