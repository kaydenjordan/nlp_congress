 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise also in support of H.J. Res. 123, which obviously  would extend funding for the Federal Government for the next 2 weeks.   We have had a highly condensed schedule this year, but the  Appropriations Committee has made tremendous progress in an open and  very deliberative process as we have moved forward over the last  several months.   As an example, the Subcommittee on Agricultural Appropriations, which  I have the privilege to chair, received input from over 350 individual  Members, and we produced our bill in less than 2 months.   Just a few months ago, as most of my colleagues here in the House  know, the House took up and we passed all 12 appropriation bills. The  chairman and the leadership delivered on the promise that they would do  so.   Now we are coming to the end of the year; there are final  negotiations to be done. I and my colleagues agree that a CR is not the  best option; however, I would ask my colleagues to support this  resolution to ensure that we have basic services that continue for our  constituents until we have the final time to complete our work.
