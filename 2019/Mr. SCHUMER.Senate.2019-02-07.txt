 Madam President, I don't know if the Judiciary Committee  voted yet, but if they haven't, they will vote shortly on the  nomination of William Barr.   I knew Mr. Barr when he was Attorney General and when he was general  counsel to Verizon--that is a New York company where I dealt with him-- and I have always respected his public service and his intelligence.  But when his authorship of an unsolicited memo to the Justice  Department criticizing the special counsel's investigation was  uncovered, I came to the conclusion that he is the wrong person to  serve as Attorney General at this challenging moment for our country.  The memo alone, I felt, was disqualifying--maybe not under any  President but certainly under this President, who is utterly  [[Page S1106]]  contemptuous of the rule of law. But I wanted to give Mr. Barr a chance  to change my mind, so I met with him a few weeks ago. Our conversation  focused on three issues.   The first was an issue that had been discussed at his Judiciary  hearing where I didn't think his answer was very satisfactory, so I  asked him again, very directly, whether he would recuse himself if  ethics officials at the Justice Department said he should. Regrettably,  he would not commit to do this. Instead, he said he would make his own  decision.   The second issue I brought up was the need for the special counsel's  report on Russian influence in the 2016 election to be made public.  Whatever conclusions Mueller comes to, we as a Congress and the  American people have an obligation to see what kind of foreign  influence there is in our elections. It seems pretty clear to me that  in this case, the report should be made public--the full report, except  things redacted for security purposes.   I asked Nominee Barr whether he would release the full Mueller  report, with redactions only if intelligence agencies said that was  necessary to avoid compromising sources. He said he is for  transparency. That is not good enough. We are all for transparency in  the abstract. The question is, Are you for transparency in probably the  most important act you will take as Attorney General when it comes to  transparency? To merely say you are for transparency doesn't say much.  What was needed was an unequivocal and public commitment to release the  full report. Again, he would not give me that assurance.   Finally, I asked Mr. Barr about interference in the special counsel's  investigation. He referred to the special counsel regulations and said  at the hearing and I think in other places publicly that he wanted to  finish the investigation. That is not good enough. Finishing the  investigation while interfering and limiting it as it goes forward  would be a travesty--certainly with this President, who has treated the  Justice Department as if it is his own personal fiefdom. At times,  President Trump seems to feel there are two goals to the Justice  Department and those alone--to punish his enemies and help him. That is  not the rule of law. That is not the greatness of the United States.   With this President, we need an Attorney General who can assure the  Senate and the public that he will stand up to a President who believes  the Justice Department exists simply to do the President's personal  bidding and protect the President's personal interests above those of  the country. The President wants a Roy Cohn to be his Attorney General,  but this is a moment that calls for an Elliot Richardson.   As Senator Coons said in the Judiciary Committee today, Mr. Barr's  case for his own confirmation seems to boil down to one thought: Just  trust me. Mr. Barr doesn't seem to recognize that this isn't adequate  for an Attorney General in the Trump administration. The moment calls  for stronger, more explicit assurances. And that is independent of what  each of us thinks of the personal characteristics of Mr. Barr. This  President has no regard for personal characteristics. This President  never listens to an argument that he thinks is against his self- interest, even if it is in accord with American tradition or American  law. So to simply say ``just trust me'' is not close to good enough  probably under any President but certainly under this one.   I believe that in the coming months, our next Attorney General will  be faced with one or more real constitutional crises. The Attorney  General will be tested. If Mr. Barr is confirmed, I hope he will be  equal to those challenges, but unfortunately and very regrettably, he  was not willing to provide the Senate with sufficient assurances to  give us confidence that he is prepared to meet the challenge. And the  idea that he shouldn't say it now because it would jeopardize his  nomination? Well, if Trump would withdraw the nomination when he says  it now, Trump will certainly fire him if he tries to do it later, so  that argument doesn't hold any water.   For all those reasons--the fact that he won't recuse himself even if  the ethics officials at the Department of Justice say he should; the  fact that he won't give an unequivocal commitment to make the full  report available to the Congress and the public, with the appropriate  redactions for intelligence only; and the fact that he won't commit to  not interfere in the investigation, not to limit the investigation or  not approve subpoenas--all three of those make it crystal clear that  Mr. Barr should not be approved for Attorney General.                                    S. 47    Madam President, on one other matter, the legislation on the floor is  the largest bipartisan package of public lands bills in over a decade.   I have always been a supporter of protecting our Nation's public  lands and our beautiful and pristine natural resources. Every summer,  my family and I used to go hiking in our national parks. They are some  of the most joyous moments I have had. So I have always supported our  natural resources and protecting them on public lands. They make our  communities more resilient as well.   I strongly support the bill that Chairman Murkowski and Ranking  Member Manchin have put together. I want to thank the previous ranking  member, Senator Cantwell, for her great work on this as well.   The bill includes a permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water  Conservation Fund, which is the Nation's premier conservation program.  It is responsible for projects in every State nationwide, and every one  of New York's 62 counties has benefited.   The bill takes great strides in protecting our natural resources and  public lands, including designating over a million acres of new  wilderness, adding over 2,000 miles to the National Trails System, and  increasing the size of our national parks.   I know from my travels across New York that this is not only a  benefit for the environment, but it is also a boon for our economy. It  boosts ecotourism, boosts the hospitality and restaurant industry in  those communities, creates jobs, and enables countless tourists, such  as myself when we visited the West, to experience the beauty of our  Nation.   Additionally, this bill will help with projects in my home State of  New York. A few important examples include designating Jamestown's  National Comedy Center as the National Comedy Center of the United  States. Jamestown is a beautiful city, home of Lucille Ball. It allows  the Department of the Interior to grant an easement to New York City so  that the Staten Island seawall can be built. Staten Island was hit with  a de facto tsunami during Superstorm Sandy that led to massive property  damage and the tragic loss of many lives. I visited the next day, and  it was awful. Better protecting Staten Island from the next disaster is  essential. This would help move the ball forward.   Let me again thank Senators Murkowski, Cantwell, and Manchin and  their staffs for the great work. I look forward to voting yes, and I  hope it gets a very strong vote here in the Senate. I hope none of our  colleagues will move to delay it.   I yield the floor.
