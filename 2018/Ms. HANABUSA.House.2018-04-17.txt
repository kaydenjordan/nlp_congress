 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleague,  Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, to call attention to the damage done by  severe rain and flooding on the island of Kauai and in East Oahu.   It was an unexpected spring storm and, according to the National  Weather Service, the town of Hanalei received more than 27 inches of  rain over the weekend. Hanalei is home to my very good friends, the  Haraguchis.   Thankfully, Mr. Speaker, there are no reports of injuries, and for  that we are lucky and grateful. However, the images of mudslides,  mangled roadways, and severely damaged homes is heartbreaking. It is  encouraging to watch neighbors helping neighbors and strangers coming  together to share food, electricity, and water.   Kauai suffered a direct hit from a hurricane and is home to the  wettest place on planet Earth. Yet, their mayor, Bernard Carvalho, who  was born and raised on the island, declared the disaster ``the worst.''   On Oahu, during a 24-hour rainfall from 4 p.m. Friday to 4 p.m.  Saturday, more rain fell in Niu Valley in one day than in all of April  2017. Flooding closed a major highway, filled homes with waist-deep  water, and washed debris out to sea.   FEMA is working with State and county officials and is prepared to  initiate Federal assistance the moment the Governor asks for it.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that all our colleagues stand with us and to have  prayers for the people of Hawaii.                            ____________________
