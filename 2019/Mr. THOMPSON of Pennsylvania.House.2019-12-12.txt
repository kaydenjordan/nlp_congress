 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life and legacy of former Pennsylvania State Senator J. Doyle Corman,  who passed away peacefully on Sunday, December 8, at the age of 87.  Doyle leaves behind his wife, Becky, with whom he raised five children.  He was the proud grandfather of 13 grandchildren and 9 great  grandchildren.   A Bellefonte native, Doyle faithfully served the people of Centre  County for more than 20 years as State Senator, and 10 years prior to  that as county commissioner. He was a man of principle, deeply  committed to service and the betterment of his community. He left his  mark on Harrisburg by championing critical transportation legislation,  helping to make Pennsylvania a safer, more connected Commonwealth.   I can attribute Doyle's mentorship to where I am today, as he  convinced me, in 2002, to follow in his footsteps to run for Centre  County Republican Party chairman. Through the outpouring support from  fellow Pennsylvanians, it is clear Doyle will be sorely missed but his  legacy not soon forgotten.   I offer my prayers and deepest condolences to Becky and the entire  Corman family.                            ____________________
