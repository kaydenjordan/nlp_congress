 Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Brannon Monument Company of Dubuque, IA, as the Senate Small Business  of the Week.   Brannon Monument Company was founded by Henry Kies in 1926 as Kies  Monument in Dubuque, IA. In 1961, Vince and Mary Lou Brannon bought  Kies Monument and shortly thereafter changed the name to Brannon  Monument Company. In 1991, Vince and Mary Lou's son Michael Brannon  started working at the company. Michael purchased the family business  from his parents in 1993 with his wife Stasia and moved the company in  1996 to a larger location. Brannon Monument Company  [[Page S5358]]  moved again in 2021 to a new location and now includes Novak and  Brannon Monuments in Marion, IA, and Manchester Monument Company in  Manchester, IA. Vince Brannon passed away in 2004, leaving behind a  legacy of hard work, service, and dedication to the Dubuque community.   Brannon Monument Company has been instrumental in building memorials  to honor our Nation's veterans. They were a key partner in the  construction of the Dubuque Veterans Memorial Plaza, which honors  Dubuque veterans who fought in major military conflicts. On July 4,  2019, the Buchanan County Veterans Memorial opened with members of the  Brannon family in attendance for the dedication. Brannon Monument  Company has been involved in building veteran memorials in Central City  and Kolona, IA, as well as Platteville, WI.   In addition to providing memorials, Brannon Monument Company is also  actively involved in the Dubuque community. Michael and Stasia Brannon  are famous in the Dubuque community for their yearly Halloween  decorations that were covered by the local newspaper. Michael is a  member of the Monument Builders of North America, where he served as  president from 1999 until 2000. He has also been a member and served as  the president of the Monument Builders of Iowa. Brannon Monument  Company has been involved with local philanthropic efforts in the  Dubuque community, including Rotary International, Mercy Service Club,  Alzheimer's Association, Oldorf Hospice House, and the Boys and Girls  Club. In 2023, Brannon Monument Company celebrated its 97th business  anniversary.   Brannon Monument Company's commitment to providing high-quality  memorials in northeast Iowa is clear. I want to congratulate Michael  and Stasia Brannon, Mary Lou Brannon, and the entire team at Brannon  Monument Company for their dedication to the Dubuque community. I look  forward to seeing their continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
