 Mr. Speaker, as a law enforcement officer for over 23  years, I have had to make the devastating visit to unsuspecting family  members to tell them that their loved one has died because a driver was  driving under the influence. We can all sit here and pretend that  marijuana is a harmless drug, but it is not. It clouds your judgment  and inhibits your reaction time.   The unfortunate reality is if we take steps to legalize marijuana, we  will, without question, increase the number of people who will drive  under the influence of marijuana on our roads. As we know all too well,  there are many angel families in this country who have lost their sons  and daughters to people who are unlawfully in this country and drove  under the influence.   My amendment would have ensured the MORE Act does not prohibit the  deportation of illegal immigrants who are convicted of driving under  the influence of marijuana. Unfortunately, Democrats blocked my  commonsense and potentially lifesaving amendment.   Mr. Speaker, shouldn't we, at a minimum, ensure this legislation is  not weaponized and used as a tool to get criminals who are in this  country illegally out of trouble and out of deportation proceedings?   It seems to me that the safety of the American people continues to be  a low priority for this Democrat majority.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule.
