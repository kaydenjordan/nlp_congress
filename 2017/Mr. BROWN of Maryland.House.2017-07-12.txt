 Mr. Chairman, first, let me start by thanking  Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith not only for their  leadership but the bipartisan collaborative approach to the work of the  committee.   Certainly as a new member of the 115th Congress, I find that very  refreshing. From what I have seen, it is no surprise that 50-plus years  in a row we have successfully passed the NDAA.   Mr. Chairman, the United States faces serious security threats:  aggression from North Korea and Russia, long and costly campaigns in  Afghanistan and Iraq, and new battlefields in cyberspace and in outer  space.   After years of sequestration, there is consensus certainly in the  House Armed Services Committee that Congress must address readiness  shortfalls and modernization challenges facing our military. So in the  NDAA, we made greater investments in training and equipping the forces  and prioritized projects that extend our technological and warfighting  edge.   But increasing defense authorizations and appropriations, absent a  clear national security strategy, will not make our country safer. We  need a smart, strategic approach to national security that provides  clear goals and objectives and that incorporates an all-of-government  approach. That means not only increasing defense spending, but also  ensuring funding for the State Department and USAID and reversing  proposed cuts to nondefense programs that make the world more stable  and secure.   We owe it to our servicemen and -women to provide them with both the  resources to accomplish their mission abroad and to pursue the American  Dream when they return home, and that is good schools, family- supporting jobs, and safe neighborhoods. We cannot do one at the  expense of the other. The long-term success of our country depends on  that.
