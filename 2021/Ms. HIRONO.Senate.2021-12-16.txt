 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the foundation of American democracy is  built upon the sacred right to vote, and there is no doubt that right  is under attack today.   This year alone, 550 voter suppression bills have been introduced in  State legislatures across the country. In Texas, it is now illegal to  compensate workers who help voters who don't speak English and for  election officials to encourage eligible voters to apply to vote by  mail.   In Fulton County, GA, a county that historically votes Democratic,  the number of ballot boxes has been reduced from 38 to 8. That is one  ballot box for every 100,000 voters.   And in Florida, ballot dropoff boxes can only be utilized during  early voting hours, and boxes must be located at either a county's  elections office or early voting sites.   Before President Trump, Republicans at least tried to pretend their  laws weren't blatantly discriminatory, but now they aren't even  attempting to hide the fact that they are purposefully trying to make  it darn near impossible for Black people and other people of color,  elderly individuals, students, working families, and people with  disabilities to vote.   The fact that Republicans continue to claim that these voter  suppression tactics are necessary to protect election integrity would  be laughable if it weren't so deeply dangerous to our democracy. We all  know that countless investigations have uncovered absolutely no  evidence of systemic or widespread voter fraud. We all know that the  2020 election was the most secure election in our country's history.  And we certainly all know this is not about voter fraud. It is about  advancing a political agenda by denying large swaths of Americans their  fundamental right to vote.   If this isn't un-American, I don't know what is, which is why voter  suppression is the most urgent crisis facing our country today and  which is why it is the single most pressing issue the Senate must  address.   Yes, we need to pass Build Back Better, and we need to fight against  attacks on a woman's right to make decisions about her own body,  attacks on the LGBTQ community, attacks on unions, and much more  because battles for rights that we thought we had won don't stay won.  But we won't succeed in preserving these hard-won rights if we don't  protect the right to vote.   To quote my friend and colleague Senator Warnock, ``Voting rights are  preservative of all other rights.''   We are nearing the 1-year anniversary of the attack on the U.S.  Capitol. This violent insurrection and mob violence was the direct  result of blatant lies told by the former President and his supporters  about systemic fraud and a stolen election.   We are still learning the consequences of what happened that day, but  we know for certain this act of domestic terrorism was an attack on  free and fair elections in this country. Yet Republicans continue to  spread the same lies about election fraud and continue to push through  legislation at the State level to silence Americans across the country.   Congress must take action to restore the integrity of our voting  system and make sure every American's voice is heard and counted. And  we have tried. We have tried four times to stop these unconstitutional,  State-level laws from undermining our elections.   We have tried to pass commonsense reforms that would, for example,  allow all eligible voters to vote by mail; make election day a Federal  holiday so all working families can vote; and establish Federal  criminal penalties for deceiving voters with false and misleading  information about voting.   And most importantly, we have tried to pass the John Lewis Voting  Rights Advancement Act, which would give the Department of Justice the  tools to keep these blatant voter suppression laws from being enacted  in the first place.   Only one Republican joined us in voting for this bill--the same bill  that was being touted as bipartisan.   It is crystal clear by now that Republicans have absolutely no  interest in protecting the right to vote. For Republicans, voter  suppression and gerrymandering is their path to victory   Democrats cannot sit back and allow a political party to maintain  power by denying Americans their right to vote.   I want to quote Senator Warnock again. He said:         [A]s we cast that vote to begin addressing the debt       ceiling, this same Chamber is allowing the ceiling of our       democracy to crash in around us.    We figured out a way to save our economy; we can surely figure out a  way to save our democracy.   Filibuster reform is the path Democrats need to take to fight back  against the Republicans' all-out voter suppression assault on our  democracy. I call on my Democratic colleagues to act.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to reiterate my strong  support for Dilawar Syed to serve as Deputy Administrator of the U.S.  Small Business Administration.   For those who are unfamiliar with Mr. Syed, he is a highly qualified  and widely-supported nominee for Deputy Administrator, who has the  backing of numerous business groups and organizations. In many ways, he  is the very picture of the American Dream, a businessowner,  entrepreneur, and job creator who was born in Pakistan and educated in  the United States. Mr. Syed also has firsthand experience dealing with  challenges small businesses have faced during this pandemic.   As Deputy Administrator, he would largely be responsible for running  the day-to-day operations at SBA. He has repeatedly made himself  available to discuss any concerns Republicans may still have related to  his background and qualifications, things that actually matter in his  ability to do his job. However, for reasons completely unrelated to his  background and qualifications, Republicans on the Small Business  Committee have continued to block his nomination, for months.   Earlier this summer, they disputed the results of a committee meeting  we held to advance the nominee based on a technicality, even though Mr.  Syed was approved during that meeting by voice vote. Since then, they  have taken a different approach, deciding to boycott committee meetings  on five separate occasions, denying a quorum to consider the nominee.  We are now at the point where Senate Republicans, even on this normally  very bipartisan committee, will not even show up to provide fair  consideration for this nominee. Not one Republican will show up.   Over the course of the process, Republicans have changed their  reasons for blocking the nominee. First, they were concerned about SBA  loans his company received during the pandemic, even though these loans  were lawfully obtained and fully repaid before he was even nominated to  be Deputy Administrator.   Then, they insinuated he was somehow anti-Jewish and anti-Israel,  despite broad support he has received from within these communities.   Now, they are concerned about lawful SBA loans to Planned Parenthood  health centers. Just to be crystal clear, these health centers lawfully  received loans through bipartisan COVID legislation that was signed by  President Trump. It is unacceptable to unfairly and unlawfully target  organizations for political reasons. And it is even worse to then stall  a qualified nominee because of this.   When it comes down to it, Mr. Syed would be an asset to SBA and the  businesses they serve. He deserves fair consideration in the U.S.  Senate.   If Republicans actually cared about helping the small businesses  struggling during the pandemic, they would stop blocking nominees to  fill positions that are critical to helping them.   Republicans should do their job and let us consider his nomination.  Every day they continue this obstruction, they are doing a disservice  to businesses in our country, which cannot afford uncertainty at this  time.   Enough is enough.                            ____________________
