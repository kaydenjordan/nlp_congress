 Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  recognize the remarkable life of Dr. David Wherry.   Born in Pawnee City, NE, he was the son of the former Nebraska  Senator Kenneth S. Wherry, who served as the minority leader here in  the U.S. Senate.   Dr. Wherry attended Doane College in Crete, NE, before enrolling at  the U.S. Naval Academy.   He then chose to go into the medical profession.   Little did he know the major impact he would have in this field.   After graduating from George Washington University with his medical  degree and completing his surgical training, he was commissioned as a  Medical Corps officer in the U.S. Air Force.   He then moved overseas for his residency, taking a position as a  surgical doctor at the 7559th USAF Hospital in Burtonwood, United  Kingdom.   He spent more than 2 years there before returning to the United  States to become a teacher at George Washington University and later  also at Georgetown University.   After years of teaching, Dr. Wherry returned to Active Duty during  Operation Desert Storm and retired in 1993 as a colonel.   Following his years of service to our country, he returned to  teaching and academic research.   Dr. Wherry became renowned in the medical world as a leading  innovator in minimally invasive surgery, such as laparoscopic  cholecystectomy on the gallbladder.   In his research in this area, he published over 50 manuscripts, 3  book chapters, and produced 2 films.   Additionally, he helped found laparoscopic cholecystectomy courses  for servicemembers and trained thousands of military surgeons.   I want to note that Dr. Wherry was one of the first doctors in the  United States to perform colonoscopies, making him a leading expert in  this procedure that is performed on so many Americans and is vital in  helping to detect and catch diseases like colon cancer.   International work was important to him, and he was successful in  helping bring humanitarian aid to hospitals in the Philippines.   He also collaborated with the Uniformed Services University of the  Health Sciences, USUHS, and with the University of the Philippines/ Philippine General Hospital in bringing surgical residents to do  scientific research at USUHS as well as arranged exchanges between  medical students for training purposes.   He wanted to share and expand on his work by collaborating with  others, so he helped found the Society of American Gastrointestinal  Endoscopic Surgeons.   He was a member of the Societe Internationale de Chirurgie and  International Biliary Association.   On top of all of these efforts, he continued to be a senior surgical  consultant to the medical division of the U.S. Department of State.   His work and dedication to improving surgeries around the world and  for our military men and women has been recognized by the State  Department and the Department of Defense.   Both agencies presented him with their Meritorious Honor Award.   In addition to his place as a leader in the medical world, he was  also a dedicated husband and father.  [[Page S1892]]    His wife, Azucena ``Ceny'' Wherry, was an RN whom he married in 1975.   His son, Kenneth D. Wherry, followed in his father's footsteps and  joined the military to serve his country, retiring as a lieutenant  colonel.   Dr. David Wherry represents the best of Nebraska.   He was a hard worker who was not afraid to put in long hours.   Because of his dedication to studying and advancing medicine, he  changed the world for the better.   I join all Nebraskans in honoring Dr. Wherry's life and recognizing  his faithful service to our Nation and his incredible contributions to  medicine.                            ____________________
