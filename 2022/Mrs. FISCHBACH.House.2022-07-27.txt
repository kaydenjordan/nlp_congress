 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Representative from  California and my colleague on the Rules Committee for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today, we are here to discuss the rule providing for consideration of  H.R. 4040, the Advancing Telehealth Beyond COVID-19 Act, and H.R. 263,  the Big Cat Public Safety Act.   First, H.R. 4040 will extend several Medicare telehealth  flexibilities that were initially utilized during the pandemic.   Telehealth has allowed many Americans to receive needed healthcare  across the Nation. While my Republican colleagues and I appreciate the  extension of these important programs, we believe that permanently  authorizing them is the better option.   Once again, the Democrats have decided to skip the committee process  and refuse Republican input or look at any possible improvements to the  bill. I know that many Members will be supporting this bill, but I  still must mention this missed opportunity to strengthen healthcare and  telehealth, especially for rural Minnesota and rural America.   Second, H.R. 263, the Big Cat Public Safety Act, would make it  illegal for any person to trade, breed, or possess any prohibited  wildlife species, specifically exotic big cat species like lions,  tigers, snow leopards, et cetera. The bill would impose civil and  criminal penalties for violators and grant the Federal Government the  authority to order forfeiture of big cats held in private captivity.  Many of the provisions of this legislation already exist under the USDA  regulatory scheme.   More than anything, Mr. Speaker, I am wholeheartedly disappointed in  how my colleagues are managing the remaining time left in this  Congress. The absence of any sense of urgency to fix the real problems  facing this country is incredibly frustrating.   This country is at the doorstep of a recession, but instead of  addressing it, the U.S. House of Representatives is spending time on  the regulation of big cats. My constituents are calling my office  because their families are struggling to pay for basic needs like food  and gas. They are calling because they want us to secure national  borders and address the fentanyl epidemic. They are calling because  they want to know what Congress is doing about rampant crime in cities  across the country. These are the issues facing our constituents. These  are the issues they are calling about because they are the issues  affecting their everyday lives and the ones we should be focusing on.   It is because of the irresponsible policies by Democrats that we have  such a big hole to dig ourselves out of, and now they want to ignore  these problems altogether and take up our precious time left in  Congress to consider legislation built off reality TV.  [[Page H7179]]    Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule, I ask Members to do the same, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I  will offer an amendment to the rule to immediately consider H.R. 8488,  a bill to prohibit the Secretary of Energy from sending petroleum  products from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR,  is an important national security tool and safety net for this country.  The United States has already been improperly depleting the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve under this administration since it is refusing to  increase domestic production during an energy crisis.   We most certainly should not be selling our emergency supply to an  adversary like China.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Duncan) to speak further on the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from South Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind my colleague from  the Rules Committee that, as I mentioned before, many of the  Republicans plan on supporting the telehealth bill, although I think we  missed the opportunity to have Republican input and have an improved  bill. But we are able to do more than one thing.   My colleague mentioned that this is very partisan. Gas and oil prices  are a serious, serious issue for our constituents. As I mentioned  before, it is about their getting to work, it is about their getting to  school, and it is about their getting to church. They need us to  address the cost of oil and gas.   The Democrats have really just simply tried to distract from this  issue and tried to distract us with all kinds of other things and not  really talk about the issues facing our constituents.                                time  1045    And like I said earlier, we certainly do have Republican support for  the telehealth bill. As a matter of fact, I believe that there are  Republican sponsors of that bill.   But I think that what is happening now is the Democrats are truly  trying to distract from the issues that are really facing our  constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I just have to say that the calls for working together ring hollow to  me because working together should be happening in markup. Working  together should be happening in committee meetings. But the Democrats  have repeatedly and consistently chosen to skip the committee process  and bring things directly to the Rules Committee and directly to the  floor. And so when they call for working together, I think that that  starts at the committee process.   And as for bringing solutions to the floor, the Westerman-McMorris  Rodgers bill that would address the energy costs has been brought  repeatedly as a PQ to the floor. The Democrats had the opportunity to  take a look at that and to vote on it.   With a more exact answer, I yield 1 minute to my colleague from South  Carolina (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would just like to mention that finding middle ground  actually starts with allowing the minority input into bills, whether  that be in committee or offering amendments on the floor. But that is  where finding middle ground and that is where finding bipartisan  solutions starts.   I would also like to remind my colleague from the Rules Committee  that this PQ would not stop consideration of the bills in the rule. It  would simply allow consideration of the amendment that was proposed.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I have to just mention again, because I am confused, and I want it  stated very clearly what I have said repeatedly. There are many  Republicans who will be supporting the telehealth bill.   Mr. Speaker, there are many Republicans that will be supporting the  telehealth bill. That is not where I am concerned that we are not  addressing constituents' issues with.   Where I am concerned about our constituents is the price of gas and  the inflation that they are facing, and that we need to be addressing  those issues; and that is why we offered the PQ that we did. And that  is why we have offered repeated solutions to the cost of gas and the  inflation facing our constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I do continue to be disappointed in my colleagues. It is  possible that they are really this out of touch.   The typical family is now spending almost $500 per month. Across the  country, people are making changes like skipping meals, changing  driving patterns, and even delaying retirement to adjust their lives to  cope with the accelerating inflation; inflation caused by out-of- control government spending and regulation.   Cities across the country are experiencing record crime waves. We  have a serious immigration crisis leading to the deaths of countless  people at our southern border and in our hometowns because of the  fentanyl drug crisis crossing along with them.   I know that, like mine, your offices are getting daily calls about  all of these. Why are we spending time on anything that does not work  directly to solve those devastating problems in our country?   Maybe it is because Democrats want to distract us from the fact that  their policies got us here, rather than fix them. We could be  discussing genuine efforts to stop crime or increase domestic energy  production or alleviate pressure points to the supply chain.   But, for the sake of the Green New Deal and rampant government  spending, Americans are going to have to suffer through inaction on  real issues facing Americans by this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule, and I ask Members to do the same.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
