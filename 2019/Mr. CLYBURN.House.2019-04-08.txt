 Mr. Speaker, it is with mixed emotions that I stand in  the well here this evening with my colleagues from South Carolina. We  are here because our State and our Nation has lost a giant of a man,  one whom I call a one-of-a-kind statesman, Ernest ``Fritz'' Hollings.   A native of Charleston, South Carolina, he graduated from The Citadel  in 1947, and the very next year, 1948, he was elected to the South  Carolina Legislature. There, he served until being elected Lieutenant  Governor in 1954.   I am pointing out some years here because I want to make a statement  about the man Fritz Hollings.   He was elected Governor in 1958.   Now, in 1947, some interesting things were taking place in South  Carolina at the time Ernest Hollings graduated college; and, in 1948,  when he was elected to the legislature, a very significant court  decision was handed down.   The court case was Elmore v. Rice, the 1948 court case that opened up  the South Carolina Democratic primary to people other than Whites. This  was the atmosphere within which Fritz Hollings was first elected.   And, of course, in 1954, when he was elected Lieutenant Governor, I  need not tell anybody what Court decision came down that year. That was  the year that the Supreme Court ruled that school desegregation had to  take place. That was the atmosphere.   So, 4 years later, Fritz Hollings gets elected Governor. I was a  student on the campus of South Carolina State when he was elected, and  in 1960 is when I first met Fritz Hollings.   He was Governor, and I was organizing sit-ins in Orangeburg, South  Carolina, and he had invited us to the State house. He gave me a great  lesson that day in politics, so much so, that what we talked about in  his office on that day I still have not told anybody.   Well, fast-forward. Fritz Hollings, Governor of a State with  tremendous challenges. So what did he do? Did he just meander through  time, as so many did in those days? No.  [[Page H3122]]    Fritz knew what the challenges were, and he put forth trailblazing  legislation to create the South Carolina Technical Education System.  That was a big deal in those days. In fact, it became a national model.   But he didn't stop there. He blazed another trail, creating the South  Carolina Educational Television Corporation. That was really a big  deal, and it was viewed as trailblazing innovation, like no other State  had made up until that time.   But that was not his last test. In 1962, just before he was to finish  his term as Governor, the courts ruled that Clemson University had to  accept another Charlestonian, Harvey Gantt, as a student. Of course,  there was much resistance.   Fritz spoke to the legislature and said to them on that day: We have  run out of courts, and we are going to be a nation of laws. And he  called upon all South Carolinians to set aside the acrimony and accept  the fact that it was a new day in South Carolina and the Nation.   And, of course, Harvey Gantt peacefully integrated Clemson  University. All of that was because Fritz demonstrated the kind of  leadership that we would expect any public servant to give.   Fritz and I became fast friends after I came here in 1992. Of course,  we interacted quite a bit down in Charleston. Of course, he got elected  to the United States Senate in 1966. We interacted quite a bit.   Fritz had a tremendous wit, and I remember when I first came up here,  1993, there was a reception held because I had become, with his help,  the first African American to represent my State in the Congress in 95  years. So there were somewhat interesting kinds of interactions taking  place.   We go to this reception, Fritz Hollings along with then-Senator Strom  Thurmond, and I was being presented to the group. One of them made a  joke out of the fact that I had met my wife in jail when Fritz was  Governor.   I guess I brought it upon myself because I reminded him of our first  meeting and the fact that we were not exactly on the same page in those  days.   So, when I yielded the mike to him, he told the group about my  meeting my wife in jail when she brought a hamburger and shared a  hamburger with me, and he said to the crowd: ``And he has been eating  out of her hand ever since.'' It brought a great chuckle in the crowd,  and I was reminded never to get smart in front of Fritz Hollings again.   Well, we have lost Fritz. But just before he really began to fail in  health, Fritz called me and said he wanted me to do something for him.  He said he wanted me to put in a piece of legislation to remove his  name from the Judicial Center in Charleston.   I asked him: Why do you want me to do that?   He said, because Judge J. Waties Waring was the judge who made that  decision in 1948 to open up the Democratic primary to people of color,  he thought that J. Waties Waring, because of that decision and others-- equalizing teacher pay between Black and White teachers, writing a  dissenting opinion in Briggs v. Elliott that became the foundation for  the 1954 United States Supreme Court decision--he said to me: J. Waties  Waring is the one who is deserving of having his name on that  courthouse. That is the courthouse where the Briggs case was decided.                                time  2000    And I said to him: Now, maybe this would pass in the House, but what  would happen over in the Senate?   And he told me that he had already talked to Senator Graham, and he  wanted this done. I told him I would get back to him because it is not  something that I wanted to do.   Well, I called Senator Graham. He told me that Senator Hollings had  called him. But I still would not do it. I called Senator Hollings back  and I asked him, in a second conversation, was I going to be able to  depend upon him to hold when the bill was introduced because I  anticipated some reactions that would be unfavorable, and in his  Gullah-throated way, he assured me that he would stand firm.   I then called the Congressional Research Service and I asked them:  Has anything like this been done before? Has anyone in the history of  this great country ever asked that his or her name be removed from a  Federal building in order to accommodate someone else?   They came back to me several weeks later and said, no, that had never  been done before.   We put forth the legislation. It passed the House and the Senate, and  I joined with Senator Hollings and others at the ceremony removing his  name from the Judicial Center in Charleston, South Carolina. Today, the  name of J. Waties Waring is on that building.   Fritz Hollings, a one-of-a-kind statesman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Wilson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Horry County,  South Carolina (Mr. Rice).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Cunningham).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Morelle).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to close this tribute tonight  by acknowledging that this is the 50th year since Fritz Hollings'  hunger tour.   A lot of people may remember, in 1969, Ernest Hollings embarked upon  a tour--or several tours of South Carolina. The first one was on  Charleston's East Side, and it was my great honor to lead him, along  with Sister Mary Anthony, on that tour so that he could see some of the  anxiety, some of the wanting that was present in his hometown.   He went from there to other places throughout the State, most  especially, Beaufort, Jasper County. Many people may remember, he,  after a tour with a Dr. Gatch in Beaufort County, Fritz wrote a book  called ``The Case Against Hunger.'' That book was eye-opening to a lot  of people.   In fact, he made the case for significant expansion of community  health centers throughout the South, and he made the case for what we  now call the WIC program: Women, Infants, and Children. It was that  book and that tour; and 2 years later, I took a tour with his classmate  from The Citadel, John Carl West, who was my mentor in government.   When West became Governor, he then took a tour. He wanted to retrace  some of Fritz's steps and redouble the efforts to eradicate poverty.   Poverty is still with us. Ill health is still with us. Hunger among  children is still with us.   I am going to be moving, at several points this year, to memorialize  Fritz by calling upon my colleagues to redouble our efforts for  children, for women, for infants, for the poor.                                time  2015    I would hope that as we think about Fritz, we will think about that  passage of scripture found in Matthew 25 where we are told that it is  incumbent upon us to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and do right  for those who are less fortunate.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
