 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.  [[Page S1029]]     Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak on the  nomination of Congressman Price to be the Secretary of Health and Human  Services. But before I do, I must speak to the decision that the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit just decided in the case of the  State of Washington and the State of Minnesota v. the President and the  Department of Homeland Security.   I am pleased to see that the courts of the United States are still  part of the separate coequal branch of government that the Founders  dictated when they ultimately created an ingenious document, the  Constitution of the United States, which served the Nation well for so  long, even though it seems the President may need a review of history  and an understanding of the Constitution as it relates to the separate  coequal branches of government, because he seems to be willing to try  to disparage the judiciary in an effort to try to either effect their  decisionmaking or to call into question the legality of their decisions  or the righteousness of their decisions.   I am glad to see that that has not affected our judicial system. I  just want to read some elements of the court's decision, which I think  are pretty extraordinary. Of course, this is far from a final decision  on the merits, but it was on a motion for a stay of the order of the  district court that said, basically, that the Muslim ban could not be  continued to be enforced.   The court said--and I am quoting--in a unanimous opinion which speaks  very powerfully to their decision:         We therefore conclude that the States--    Meaning the State that brought forth--Washington, as well as the  State of Minnesota--       that the States have alleged harms to their proprietary       interests traceable to the Executive Order. The necessary       connection can be drawn in at most two very logical steps:       (1) the Executive Order prevents nationals of seven countries       from entering Washington and Minnesota; (2) as a result, some       of these people will not enter state universities, some of       them will not join those universities as faculty, some will       be prevented from performing research, and some will not be       permitted to return if they leave.        We therefore hold that the States have standing.    That was one of the critical legal bars.   Secondly, they opined on the reviewability of the Executive order.  This is, I think, extraordinarily important. The Court went on to say-- I am paraphrasing at this point: Yes, the courts owe substantial  deference to the immigration and national security policy  determinations of the political branches--legislative and executive.  But it went further to say:         Instead, the Government has taken the position--    This is on behalf of the executive branch--       that the President's decisions about immigration policy,       particularly when motivated by national security concerns,       are unreviewable--    Unreviewable--       even if those actions potentially contravene constitutional       rights and protections. The Government indeed asserts that it       violates separation of powers for the judiciary to entertain       a constitutional challenge to executive actions such as this       one.    I did not really capture that the government had made that argument.  But that is an extraordinary argument. The court went on to say:         There is no precedent to support this claimed       unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental       structure of our constitutional democracy. Within our system,       it is the role of the judiciary to interpret the law, a duty       that will sometimes require the ``[r]esolution of litigation       challenging the constitutional authority of one of the three       branches.'' We are called upon to perform that duty in this       case.    Further they say: ``Although our jurisprudence has long counseled  deference to the political branches on matters of immigration and  national security, neither the Supreme Court nor our court has ever  held that courts lack the authority to review executive action in those  arenas for compliance with the Constitution.''   That is an extraordinary set of statements that the government made,  saying that the President's actions are unreviewable in this regard.   They further go on to say: ``Nonetheless, `courts are not powerless  to review the political branches' actions' with respect to matters of  national security.''   It would indeed be ironic if, in the name of national defense, we  would sanction the subversion of one of those liberties which make the  defense of the Nation worthwhile.   Well, I fully agreed with the circuit court's determination in that  regard.   It goes on to say: ``In short, although courts owe considerable  deference to the President's policy determinations with respect to  immigration and national security, it is beyond question that the  Federal judiciary retains the authority to adjudicate constitutional  challenges to executive action.''   Well, all I can say is, thank God. Thank God that the courts of the  United States feel that they are not controlled by the executive branch  in pursuing the decisions that are made. This is a great day for  democracy in our country and for the preservation of the separation of  powers. This is a great day, I think, from my own perspective, that a  ban that does not help the United States but harms us and is against  every fiber of our being and the nature of the history of our Nation,  which was founded by those fleeing religious persecution--ultimately,  today, we restore that sense of our history, and we restore who we are  as a nation both at home and across the world.   But today's decisions in this regard are also important as we  consider the nomination of Congressman Price, so I want to rise today,  along with so many of my colleagues, to voice my strong opposition to  the confirmation of Congressman Price to be the Secretary of Health and  Human Services.   I am deeply concerned about his views on what is the core mission of  Health and Human Services, not only his career-long opposition to the  very existence of Medicaid and Medicare but his wavering fidelity in  science and his regressive views of women's health care and the social  safety net.   The Secretary of Health and Human Services is one of the few Cabinet  positions that affect virtually every single man, woman, and child in  America. It affects the health care of 56 million seniors on Medicare,  of 74 million low-income individuals and children on Medicaid, and of  12 million Americans who have enrolled in the Affordable Care Act  coverage. But more than that, the Department of Health and Human  Services is home to the world's leading institutions of research at the  National Institutes of Health, of advancing public health and  epidemiology at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, known  worldwide, of working to ensure that we have access to the most  advanced, most effective, and safest medications at the Food and Drug  Administration, and many other critical departments and agencies that  we as Americans rely on.   Many of our Republican colleagues have pointed out that Congressman  Price's history as an orthopedic surgeon is enough evidence that he is  someone who should be in charge of the Department of Health and Human  Services. I can't speak to his credentials and qualifications in the  operating room, but I do have a constitutional obligation to speak  about his credentials and qualifications to be the Secretary of Health  and Human Services. So I can say without hesitation that his career in  Congress and his positions on key issues of policy have proven to me  that he is not the right person for the job.   Throughout his time as a congressman--most recently as the chairman  of the House Budget Committee and during his confirmation process  through the Senate Finance Committee, on which I am privileged to  serve--it has become abundantly clear that Congressman Price views  patients, including seniors on Medicare and even those with private  employer coverage, as nothing more than a source of revenue or a budget  line item. The characteristics that had defined Congressman Price's  career run contrary--contrary--to the fundamental mission of the  Department of Health and Human Services, and it should be a cause for  concern across the aisle and across the country.   Despite the alternative reality portrayed during his confirmation  hearings in both the Finance Committee and the Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee, Congressman Price's vision for our  Nation's health  [[Page S1030]]  care system has been laid bare for the public to see for years. All one  has to do is look at the legislation he has introduced and the radical  budget proposals he, along with Speaker Ryan, has been pushing through  the House of Representatives. Let's look at some of them.   Let's start by taking a look at his plan for Medicare, which is, by  all intents and purposes, a plan to fundamentally end Medicare as we  know it, end Medicare as we know it. Despite Congressman Price's  seeming denial of this fact, when I asked him about it directly during  his confirmation hearing, there is absolutely no other way to  characterize his plan: It ends Medicare as we know it.   Currently and for more than 50 years, Medicare has provided a  guarantee--a guarantee; that word is critical--to seniors that they  will have coverage, access to care, and the ability to rest assured  that their health care needs will be taken care of. It is a system into  which they paid their entire working lives and a compact that has been  made with the Federal Government that we will uphold our end of the  deal and ensure that they have quality coverage to stay healthy.   The Affordable Care Act, despite the years-long gnashing of teeth and  fake tears shed by some of my Republican colleagues, has improved upon  this deal and made Medicare stronger. It has extended the life of the  Medicare trust fund by more than a decade. It has saved seniors $27  billion on prescription drugs and last year alone provided more than 40  million seniors access to no-cost preventive services--no-cost  preventive services. In my home State of New Jersey last year, seniors  on Medicare saved more than $263 million on prescription drugs, and  nearly 1 million seniors were able to receive free preventive services.   Additionally, thanks to the law's health care delivery system  reforms, we are seeing far fewer hospital-acquired conditions and  greater coordination of care that has resulted in a healthier  population and a more efficient health care delivery system. That  reality stands in stark contrast to Tom Price's vision of what he  thinks Medicare should be and in stark contrast with the vast majority  of seniors who want to protect the program for their loved ones and for  themselves.   Unfortunately, President Trump, who himself spent an entire campaign  promising that he is ``not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid,''  nominated a leading member of this radical anti-Medicare movement to  impose devastating cuts to the program, force seniors to pay higher  costs, and lower the quality of care throughout the health care system.   Congressman Price's destructive legislative history on Medicare does  not lie. It is there. It is in the record. It is there for anybody who  wants to see it. It tells a stark truth about his desire to increase  the eligibility age, about ending the guarantee--the guarantee of  coverage.   You know, that is why we call it an entitlement. If you meet the  criteria under the law, you are entitled to those health care services;  you are guaranteed those health care services. But his whole  legislative history is about ending the guarantee of coverage we  currently have and replacing it with the possibility of coverage. The  difference between a guarantee and a possibility is a far, far too  significant gulf to be able to overcome--but only if you can afford the  difference between Congressman Price's coupon and the actual cost of  care under his vision. The Congressional Budget Office has shown that  this will unquestionably increase costs for seniors.   His dark view of Medicare, that--to quote Congressman Price-- ``nothing has a greater negative impact on . . . health care than the  Federal Government's intrusion . . . through Medicare''--that is an  extraordinary statement. I am going to quote it again. ``Nothing has a  greater negative impact on . . . health care than the Federal  Government's intrusion''--intrusion, mind you--``through Medicare.''  That is understandably causing a lot of concern back home in New  Jersey. Many people have been calling and writing me to express their  thoughts.   Dr. William Thar of Summit, NJ, himself a retired physician of more  than 50 years, wrote in that Price's ``willingness to privatize  Medicare indicates a lack of concern for Americans who need health care  coverage.''   I also heard from Cara Davis of Glen Ridge, NJ, who wrote in on  behalf of her uncle, who has end-stage renal disease and requires  dialysis, saying, ``If [Price] and the Trump administration  successfully move Medicare to a voucher program''--again, that is  different from a guarantee--``I fear that my uncle will not be able to  afford the necessary coverage for his dialysis treatments.''   For me, the battle to protect Medicare is more than a political  battle; it is more than a theoretical battle; it is a deeply personal  battle to protect a program that allows seniors to live with dignity  during the twilight of their lives.   My personal connection to the value of the Medicare Program stems not  from my experience but that of my late mother, Evangelina. For 18 long,  difficult years, my mother suffered from Alzheimer's disease. During  those years, we watched as this strong, courageous woman drifted  further and further away from us. After her diagnosis, I, like so many  families across our Nation, hoped for the best, but we expected the  worst. And while there were times early on when she seemed just fine,  those times turned into lost moments, and those lost moments eventually  lasted forever.   At this point, I had to wonder if all the moments of her life--her  struggle to flee her homeland and seek freedom in the United States, of  my youth and all of the time spent together--were still in there, still  with her somehow, or whether those memories were lost forever.   As her illness progressed, she lost her cognitive abilities, and  eventually we had to admit to ourselves that our mother was no longer  with us, until, mercifully, the Good Lord took her, and the long  goodbye came to an end.   Throughout this experience, throughout her struggle of fighting back  against the progress of Alzheimer's, our family knew that Medicare  would be there to provide her with access to the health care she  needed. I learned that Medicare wasn't just there for her; it was there  for the rest of us, too, providing her with access to care, while  granting us the ability to focus on making the most of the limited time  we had together.   Medicare was there to meet the challenges of her illness as well as  the intergenerational challenges that arise when caring for a parent in  the twilight of their lives while simultaneously working to put your  own children through college. I lived it, I saw it, and I understand  it. My mother would not have lived with the dignity that she deserved  in the twilight of her life after working a lifetime and paying for  Medicare, but for Medicare as a guarantee.   I know all too well that an underfunded voucher would undermine  Medicare's ability to live up to the responsibility that we have to  care for one another and to provide that same dignity to seniors as  they and their families prepare to say good-bye for the last time.   That is why I couldn't agree with Dr. Thar or Ms. Davis more, and I  share their concerns about what Congressman Price has in mind, despite  the repeated pledges from President Trump to the contrary for the  future of Medicare.   My concerns about Congressman Price don't stop with his desires to  end Medicare, because those desires also extend to end Medicaid, as we  know it, as well. His desires to end Medicaid are really a two-front  war. The first is to repeal the highly successful expansion of Medicaid  provided for under the Affordable Care Act, which has extended  lifesaving care and coverage to over 200,000 New Jerseyans, many of  whom are covered for the first time.   Nationwide, the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion is one of  the most successful aspects of health reform. Currently, 32 States and  the District of Columbia have taken advantage of Medicaid expansion,  making coverage available to 11 million people, because they recognize  the value in providing people with coverage, with access to preventive  care, with the ability to manage chronic conditions--all of which lead  to a healthier, more productive population.   The second is to eviscerate funding from Medicaid by taking away the  current funding structure and replacing it  [[Page S1031]]  with a block grant or some other form of arbitrary underfunding that  they mask as allowing for ``state flexibility.''   We have seen this picture before. Take away an obligation, an  entitlement, move it to a block grant, underfund it, and ultimately  slay that opportunity for people to have a guarantee.   We all know what is meant when Congressman Price talks about State  flexibility. He means the flexibility to slash enrollment and deny  people access to coverage. He means forcing States to choose between  cutting payments to doctors for treating low-income Medicaid patients  or cutting other vital State services like education and  infrastructure. He means unraveling Medicaid benefits so that for those  few still able to enroll, they won't have adequate coverage for most of  the health care issues they need treated. It means simply putting his  radical ideological opposition of the Federal Government being involved  in health care ahead of the lives of millions of men, women, children,  and seniors and the disabled across the Nation. That is truly  remarkable for a man who took the oath to ``first do no harm.''   As with his views on Medicare, his desire to end Medicaid expansion  has caused a lot of people from New Jersey to write me about their  concerns. I would ask Congressman Price and other like-minded  Republicans to consider carefully the stress and potentially  devastating impacts these policies have on real people--real people  like Jolie Bonnette from Brick, NJ, who wrote to me about how she was  able to finally gain access to health coverage, thanks to Medicaid  expansion. She wrote: ``Without this care and my Medicaid medication  coverage, I would have died, because I would have no access to doctors  or medications.''   Jill Stasium from Jersey City wrote in saying that thanks to  Medicaid, ``[I] have been receiving top quality health care for the  first time in my life.''   I ask my colleagues how the mantra of State flexibility, which is  just another way of ensuring funding for Medicaid is slashed and access  to life-enhancing treatment is denied, is going to impact Ms. Bonnette  and Ms. Stasium. I ask how they can justify taking away their  coverage--coverage that has provided, for the first time in their  lives, not only the peace of mind of having health insurance, but also  it is the first time they have had regular access to the doctors and  medication necessary to live.   How do we justify that? We can't do it on the basis of State  flexibility and surely not on the basis of a 6-year-long political  vendetta against the Affordable Care Act. Yet somehow, with this  nominee and this Republican Congress, this is something that we are all  going to have to justify to every single one of our constituents.   Unfortunately, the list of destructive policies supported by Tom  Price doesn't end with his desires to end Medicare as we know it and to  dismantle Medicaid. This is also not surprising given the Republican  agenda for the last 7 years to repeal the Affordable Care Act, throw  millions of Americans off their health insurance, and return us to the  dark ages where insurance companies have free rein to deny coverage for  preexisting conditions, cancel coverage after a devastating diagnosis,  limit what benefits are covered, and discriminate against women. That  is what the marketplace was before the Affordable Care Act.   Now, this is not new. The Republicans have been trying to repeal  health care reform and deny millions of Americans health care coverage  since before the law was even passed. It has sadly become dogma for  Republicans--dogma to repeal ObamaCare, which they voted to do 60-some  odd times. But now, after 7 long years, the chickens have come home to  roost.   They now have the ability to live up to their dream of repealing the  law, but are starting to realize what the implications are--starting to  realize that real people will face real life-and-death situations that  result from Republicans putting partisan ideology ahead of the well- being of their constituents, starting to realize that on-the-ground  implications of the Affordable Care Act mean real people receiving real  treatment for real health conditions.   One of these people is David Konopacki from South River, NJ. David is  a diabetic who, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, no longer has to  choose between paying for college and paying for the medication he  needs. David put it so succinctly: ``The Affordable Care Act is  literally the difference between life and death for so many.''   The same holds true for Mrs. Lori Wilson from Morristown, NJ. Her  son, like David, has diabetes and has had diabetes since birth. As she  writes, her son ``is just one citizen among millions whose life,  literally, depends on access'' to care, and under the Price Republican  plan, that access is denied.   I mentioned that repealing the Affordable Care Act means reinstating  the ability of insurance companies to deny coverage for preexisting  conditions. As diabetics, these folks would find it impossible-- certainly, financially impossible--to find coverage that would allow  them to get their medications and see their physicians. That is what is  shocking about Tom Price. Despite knowing full well that the ban on  preexisting conditions is one of the most widely supported and  critically important aspects of the Affordable Care Act, he considers  it to be a ``terrible idea.''   Let me say that again. Tom Price's views on health care are so  radical that he thinks insuring people with preexisting health  conditions--like diabetes from birth--and guaranteed access to coverage  is a ``terrible idea.'' That is an extremely callous way to put  ideology above people's lives.   Let me close on this. I have spoken about the many reasons I am  opposed to Congressman Price's nomination to run the Department of  Health and Human Services, including his long-held opposition to  Medicare. But above all else, one of the reasons I am opposing  Congressman Price is because of the seeming lack of fidelity to the one  thing that runs at the heart of health care and the heart of the Health  and Human Services Department, which is science.   For years Congressman Price has been a member of a group called the  Association of American Physicians and Surgeons. This is a group of so- called doctors who push dangerous conspiracy theories and widely  debunked claims that have serious implications for the public health.  The prime example of this is their assertion, despite all evidence to  the contrary, that vaccines aren't safe and that they cause autism.  Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, this week I received  a letter signed by 350 organizations, including several from New Jersey  and several representing the autism community, restating the fact that  ``vaccines are the safest and most cost-effective way of preventing  disease, disability, and death'' but unfortunately, because of  widespread misinformation, the United States ``still witnesses  outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases,'' including the biggest  outbreak of whooping cough since 1955, and the fact that we have  upwards of 50,000 deaths a year from complications of vaccine- preventable influenza.   While Tom Price, personally and as a physician, might understand  these basic facts, what worries me most is that the President of the  United States does not, posting on Twitter for years that vaccines are  dangerous and appointing anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists to critical  posts in the White House and possibly to key positions within the  Department of Health and Human Services.   When I asked Congressman Price directly about his fidelity to science  and his willingness to stand up to the President about adhering to  science as the guiding principle at the Department of Health and Human  Services, his answers were far less than satisfactory, and he left me  with the impression that he is unwilling to counter the President when  he touts untrue claims about health care and ensure that personnel  within HHS are stewards of sound science and not ideology.   For the Department that oversees the Centers for Disease Control,  which is the global beacon of health care that must be focused on  science, that is simply incredible.   I rise today to give my voice in opposition to Nominee Tom Price as  the next Secretary of Health and Human Services, and I rise to be the  voice of Dr. William Thar, Cara Davis, Jolie Bonnette, Jill Stasium,  David Konopacki, Lori Wilson and the over 6,000 New Jerseyans who have  called  [[Page S1032]]  and emailed me to vote in opposition to Tom Price's nomination. I will  do that when it comes time for a vote.   With that, I yield the floor.
