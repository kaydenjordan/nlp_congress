 Mr. President, briefly on another matter, we are just a  couple of months away from the 2-year anniversary of the passage of the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Because of this legislation, families across the  country are benefiting from lower income tax rates and are able to keep  more of what they earn. We have also helped families by doubling the  standard deduction for children, expanding the child tax credit, and  simplifying the Tax Code, which is something I think we can all agree  needs to be done. For the millions of Texans who were filled with dread  simply about filing their taxes, it was a welcomed relief.   The journey to pass the legislation wasn't easy, of course, and there  was no shortage--there never are--of naysayers. Many of our Senate  Democratic colleagues claimed this legislation only benefited the rich,  the evidence to the contrary notwithstanding. We know that is false  because of what the facts tell us.   Let me go back for a second and explain why this congressional  resolution of disapproval we will be voting on at about 3 o'clock is so  ironic and so mistaken.   Prior to tax reform, without limit, taxpayers could itemize their  deductions for State and local taxes. They got to deduct that from  their Federal income taxes, which meant, in essence, in those high-tax  jurisdictions--the cities and the States that had high local and State  taxes--taxpayers from around the country were subsidizing those  taxpayers in those high-tax jurisdictions.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act attempted to deal with this unfairness by  capping this deduction, better known now as the SALT deduction--the  State and local tax deduction--at $10,000 for everybody across the  country. Everybody was treated the same. Everybody was put on a level  playing field. In other words, tax reform stopped the endless subsidy  that taxpayers who were living in my State gave to fiscal decisions  that were made by other States and local governments. There is no  reason we should ask a taxpayer who is living in Austin to subsidize  the financial decisions, the fiscal decisions, made in Albany, in  Sacramento, or in any other State capitol.   Before the cap, the wealthiest Americans were disproportionately  reaping the benefit of this no-limit deduction. That is why the cap was  included in tax reform--in order to support the middle class, not the  top 1 percent. In the process, we prevented the richest people in the  country from gaming the Tax Code.   This chart, which was produced by the Senate Committee on Finance,  courtesy of Chairman Grassley, talks about who benefits from the SALT  cap repeal. This is what we will be voting on indirectly this  afternoon.   Here, 52 percent of the benefit goes to taxpayers with incomes of  over $1 million. Our Democratic friends like to say they are the party  of the working man and woman, but clearly they are working on behalf of  the 52 percent of taxpayers who have incomes of over $1 million in  their seeking to repeal this regulation that basically prevents a tax  dodge. There are 24 percent of taxpayers with incomes between $200,000  and $1 million who will be affected and 6 percent of taxpayers who will  be affected who earn under $200,000. You can see that the majority of  the benefit that our Democratic colleagues seek to confer is on the  wealthiest people in the country.   I don't have any ax to grind with people who have been successful and  who have made a lot of money. They pay their taxes, contribute their  philanthropy, and help in innumerable ways. This is simply a way to try  to make sure our taxpayers in Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming don't  subsidize the high tax rates in New York, Los Angeles, or other places  that have high State and local taxes. In good conscience, we cannot let  that happen.   The fact is, since tax reform passed, a number of States have crafted  a workaround--I call it a tax dodge--to circumvent this $10,000 limit.  In June, the Treasury issued a regulation to stop them--this is the tax  dodge--and required States to adhere to the limit that Congress passed  into law and that the President signed.   The financial consequences of what the Democratic Members of the  Senate are trying to do here are enormous. The Joint Committee on  Taxation estimates that doing away with the subsidy cap would cost  about $700 billion over the next 7 years, or $100 billion a year, and  almost 95 percent of the benefit would go to the people who make more  than $200,000. Even according to the liberal Tax Policy Center, one- third of the uncapped SALT deduction went to the top 1 percent.   If I have heard Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren or any of the  Democrats who are running for President rail on and on about the top 1  percent and income inequality once, I have heard it a thousand times.  Yet here they seek to undo a cap that treats every taxpayer the same  and essentially require taxpayers who are in low-tax States to  subsidize those who are in high-tax States and localities. And 52  percent of them make over $1 million a year. A millionaire would  receive a tax cut of nearly $60,000--higher than the household incomes  of many people who live in my State.   That is what we will be voting on. That is what the Democratic leader  from New York--a high-tax State and city--seeks to do for his  constituents, but it is to the detriment of hard-working families in my  State and in many States around the country.   After continually hammering the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it is actually  duplicitous to argue that it somehow benefits the wealthy when there  was just the most modest of cuts in the highest marginal rate. The  benefit flowed to everybody in every tax bracket, but most of it went  to the middle class. Yet, after hammering this side of the aisle for  its somehow benefiting the wealthy to the detriment of the middle  class, the Democrats are now working to help their richest constituents  get back to the days of unlimited deductions.   This is unfair. It is regressive. It benefits the people who need the  help the least, and it hurts the people who need our attention and help  the most. Asking Texans and all Americans to somehow foot the bill for  $700 billion so that  [[Page S6067]]  the folks who live in these high-tax cities and States can get a  $60,000 tax cut is something I am simply unwilling to participate in. I  urge all of my colleagues to vote against this resolution of  disapproval.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, 2 months ago, Texans were mourning the  loss of 22 of our people killed in a senseless attack in El Paso, TX.  Little did we know that we were just days away from another violent  attack, this time in Midland and Odessa, which took seven lives.   Visiting these communities in the wake of these tragedies is tough-- something I have, unfortunately, had experience with following the 2017  shooting in Sutherland Springs and, again, in 2018 in Santa Fe High  School. There are no words to bring comfort to the families and the  friends and the community members who were shaken to their very core by  these sudden and unwarranted acts of violence.   But as I visited with the families and offered my condolences  following each of these attacks, there was one common refrain, one  common request: Please do something. Now, if I knew of a way to  introduce and pass legislation that could stop these types of criminal  acts from occurring, I guarantee we could pass it with 100 percent of  the Senate and 435 Members of the House, and the President would sign  it. But that, unfortunately, is not the human condition. Unfortunately,  there is no quick fix, no simple answer. Instead, we are left to look  at the factors that led to these attacks and to try to do something to  prevent the sequence of events from playing out again in the future.   Following the shooting in Sutherland Springs, we quickly learned some  disturbing facts about the shooter and how he obtained his weapons. He  had a history of violence and a criminal conviction that should have  prevented him from ever purchasing a firearm. But this information was  never uploaded into the background check system run by the FBI. As a  result, the shooter was able to purchase four firearms, three of which  were used in the attack. He shouldn't have been able to do that.   Every time something like this happens, it is only natural to say:  What if? What if those convictions had been uploaded? What if he wasn't  able to purchase those firearms? Could we have stopped this terrible  loss of life?   My goal then, as it is now, is to do everything I can to make sure  those questions don't have to be asked again.   Ten days after the Sutherland Springs shooting, I introduced a piece  of legislation called Fix NICS--Fix the National Instant Criminal  Background Check System--to fill the gaps in our background check  system and ensure that government agencies submit relevant evidence. We  worked hard on it over a long period of time, and it passed with more  than 70 Senate bipartisan cosponsors.   What is the result of the Fix NICS bill we passed in the wake of  Sutherland Springs? We now know that the Federal Government has  increased its record submissions to the background check system by 400  percent--a 400-percent increase in the background check system. That  means if somebody is dishonorably discharged from the military, if  somebody has been convicted of domestic violence, violated a protective  order, or convicted of any felony, the background check system is much  more likely to have that derogatory information in it, and the seller  will not sell that firearm. Because of this legislation, our Federal  background databases are becoming stronger and better by the day and  preventing more criminals from getting their hands on deadly weapons  that are already prohibited by existing law.   But it is time once again to revisit the way we might reduce the loss  of life, the way we might be able to reduce these mass violence  episodes from occurring in our country in the future. Today, I am  introducing the Restoring, Enhancing, Strengthening, and Promoting Our  Nation's Safety Efforts--or the RESPONSE Act, as we call it. Just as  Fix NICS did, this bill addresses specific problems to try to prevent  attacks and make our communities safer.   First, this legislation takes aim at unlicensed firearms dealers who  are breaking the existing law. Shortly after the Midland-Odessa  shooting, we learned that the shooter failed a background check when he  attempted to  [[Page S6095]]  buy a gun from a licensed dealer. He then managed to circumvent the  process by purchasing his weapon from somebody who appears to have been  in the business of manufacturing and selling guns but who is not a  registered firearms dealer. By not registering as a dealer, the seller  was able to skirt the legal requirement and sell a weapon to the  shooter without conducting the necessary background check.   So to prevent unlicensed dealers from continuing to break the law,  the RESPONSE Act creates a nationwide task force to investigate and  prosecute those individuals. The task force will focus on those who are  illegally selling firearms, as well as those attempting to buy firearms  who provide false statements as part of the background check.   While preventing unlicensed dealers from selling weapons without  appropriate background checks is an important way to reduce violence,  it is only one factor. I think we have to admit there isn't one single  solution. It is multifactorial. There are multiple things we can and  should do.   The second major piece of this legislation improves the quality and  availability of mental health care. I asked the Odessa police chief  following the shooting in Midland-Odessa: What is it you think we might  have been able to do? He said: Well, we need better access to mental  health diagnoses and treatment.   We clearly need to do more to identify and support struggling  individuals who could pose a danger to themselves and to others. We  know for a fact that the majority of gun deaths are suicides, self- inflicted. While mental illness is not the prevailing cause of mass  violence, enhanced mental health resources, I believe, are critical to  saving lives. The RESPONSE Act includes a range of measures, such as  expanding mental health crisis intervention teams, improving  coordination between mental health providers and law enforcement, and  bolstering the mental health workforce.   Importantly, this bill expands something called assisted outpatient  treatment programs, or AOTs. This is something we passed as part of the  21st Century Cures Act, my Mental Health and Safe Communities Act to  help focus on, as a priority, pilot projects of these assisted  outpatient treatment programs. Here we seek to expand them further  based on the proven success. AOTs, or assisted outpatient treatment,  provide families of individuals with mental illness an opportunity to  get treatment for their loved one in their community rather than in an  institution. Making mental health resources more accessible will serve  our most vulnerable friends and neighbors in countless ways and, I  believe, make our communities safer.   Third, the RESPONSE Act seeks to increase the safety of our students.  I have heard from countless parents--no doubt, the Presiding Officer  has too--that parents literally are in fear of sending their children  to school, not knowing whether they may be victimized by one of these  senseless attacks, especially in the aftermath of Santa Fe and Parkland  High School. Parents are rightfully concerned about sending their kids  to school, and they should not have to live with that.   The RESPONSE Act includes provisions to help identify students whose  behavior indicates a threat of violence and then provide the student  with the appropriate services they may need not to be a danger to  themselves or others. By promoting best practices within our schools,  as well as internet safety policies, we can help protect both students  and school faculty and provide parents with a little peace of mind.   Finally, because so often these shooters advertise on social media or  cry out for attention to law enforcement or other people ahead of time,  this legislation includes provisions to ensure law enforcement can  receive timely information about potential threats made online. Online  providers and platforms have the ability to share information with law  enforcement today during emergencies. And in the fight against child  abuse, the RESPONSE Act would expand the scope of information they can  share to include information about potential acts of mass violence or  self-harm or hate crimes or acts of domestic terrorism.   The RESPONSE Act has been endorsed already by a number of law  enforcement and mental health organizations, including the National  Council for Behavioral Health, National Alliance on Mental Illness, the  National District Attorneys Association, Fraternal Order of Police, and  a number of others.   I am glad to say it also has received support already--even though we  are only introducing it today--from a number of our colleagues here:  Senators McSally, Tillis, Ernst, Capito, and Senator Tim Scott. I hope  we can work together to build a big bipartisan list of cosponsors as  other Senators have the opportunity to review this legislation--again,  using the Fix NICS bill as a model of how we can build consensus and  get something done that will save lives.   There is no quick fix, as I said, but there are commonsense measures  we can take to reduce mass violence and protect the American people. As  Texans continue to grieve in the aftermath of these attacks, I am  committed to upholding my promise that I made to their families and  friends to do something--to do what we can to prevent more communities  from facing this sort of heartbreak.                            ____________________     Mr. President, 2 months ago, Texans were mourning the  loss of 22 of our people killed in a senseless attack in El Paso, TX.
