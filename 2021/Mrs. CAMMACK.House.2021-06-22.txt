 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Hyde  amendment, which is the longest pro-life precedent in American history.  This amendment prevents our taxpayer dollars from ending the lives of  society's most vulnerable, the unborn.   Madam Speaker, for over 40 years, Congress, both Republican and  Democrat administrations, have supported the Hyde amendment to prohibit  publicly funded abortions. That tradition seems to have ended with this  current administration.   Protecting life is not and should not be a partisan issue. The  President and congressional Democrats need to listen to the American  people, who overwhelmingly support life and continue to uphold this  important protection.   We as a country believe in life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness, which is why we must defend that vital first tenet of life  and support the Hyde amendment.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18 and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.
