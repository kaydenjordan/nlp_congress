 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow will be the culmination of a very  predictable series of events.   There were never 67 votes to convict the President. There was never  any bipartisan support for impeachment. This contrived process was  never going to be successful, and everybody knew it.   When House Democrats, first in a hurry in December to get the  articles through, and then after a month's delay sent the articles over  to the Senate, they claimed their case was compelling and overwhelming,  yet their case had zero actual evidence and was made only of opinion or  speculation or third-hand comments.   Then the Democrat impeachment managers asked for more witnesses in  order to prove their case that they had rushed through the House. Pure  hypocrisy. The same has surrounded this entire so-called process.   From quid pro quo to extortion to bribery, they have continuously  grasped for straws--the same straws they try to ban in California, by  the way--that would make their narrative more compelling.   Here we are, over 4 months since this inquiry was announced, yet they  found not a way to convince Americans that the President has committed  an actual crime.   Once the Senate votes to acquit the President, we must get back to  work and do actual things.                            ____________________
