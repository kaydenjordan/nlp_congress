 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Arizona for  yielding.  [[Page H1605]]    I want to stipulate, Madam Speaker, that I have seen the gentleman  from Massachusetts, the leader of our committee, do some things on that  committee that no one else has tried to do.   I was in this institution for a decade as a chief of staff, now a  decade as a Member of Congress, and he has done some amazing things  that I believe will serve this institution and serve the committee, not  just this Congress, but next Congress and for decades to come. And I  applaud him and his very capable team for pushing those initiatives  forward.   But, today, Madam Speaker, we are talking about the exact opposite  side of that coin, things that are done in the name of expediency today  that may well do damage to this institution, not just this Congress and  next Congress, but for decades to come. Habits happen in this  institution, Madam Speaker. Habits happen.   My friend from Massachusetts used to work for a great leader in this  institution, Mr. Joe Moakley. In fact, his picture hangs on the wall as  a former chairman of the Rules Committee.   I used to work for a great Member of this institution as well, Madam  Speaker, Mr. John Linder, out of the great State of Georgia. He also  served on the Rules Committee.   As we come down to the floor today, for my friends of the majority to  defend for the second time in 6 weeks taking away the minority's right  to have any input on the process whatsoever, I thought I would go back  20 years from today, back to the year 2000, when the gentleman from  Massachusetts' former boss and my former boss sat in these very same  chairs.   At that time, Madam Speaker, Republicans were in the majority. I will  go back to October 3 of 2000 when Mr. Linder took to the floor and  said:         And the rule provides a motion to recommit, as is the right       of the minority.    Republicans were in control, complete control, of this institution.  They could jam anything through that they wanted to jam through. But it  was the right of the minority to have at least a final voice and a  final opportunity to amend the bill.   October 12, a week later, Mr. Linder and Mr. Moakley were on the  floor again. Mr. Linder says:         And, finally, the rule provides for one motion to recommit,       as is the right of the minority.    Again, Madam Speaker, October 19 of that same year, just a week after  that, Mr. Linder and Mr. Moakley on the floor again:         The rule provides a motion to recommit, as is the right of       the minority.    We will go a week after that, Madam Speaker. Same two gentlemen on  the floor again, same Republican majority in charge. Mr. Linder, on the  floor:         Resolution . . . as is the right of the minority.    A week after that, Madam Speaker:         Motion to recommit, with or without instructions, as is the       right of the minority.    I will go on and on and on. Because 20 years ago, it was not a  question of whether or not the minority would have a single voice.  Remember, Madam Speaker, these bills that the gentleman from  Massachusetts is talking about, these immigration bills, went through  committee, no Republican amendments were adopted; went to the Rules  Committee, no Republican amendments were made in order. There has been  absolutely no minority input of any kind on these bills he is talking  about. There is so much more in this underlying bill. But 20 years ago,  the habit was we would recognize that the minority has a right.   In fact, I don't even need to go back 20 years, Madam Speaker. I  serve on the Select Committee on Modernization. That is a bipartisan  committee here in the House that is designed to look at the current  rules and organization of the House and talk about how it is that we  can do better.   I don't have to go back 20 years, Madam Speaker. I can go back to  last year, March 13, 2019, a press release from the Speaker of the  House, Nancy Pelosi, on the remarks that she made in front of that  joint select committee looking at modernizing the institution. And she  said: Some people have talked about changing the motion to recommit,  this or that. But she said:         I am a big respecter of the rights of the minority in the       Congress of the United States, and I believe as Speaker of       the whole House that initiatives you put forth must come from       the whole House.    We are looking at how to make the motion to recommit better, Madam  Speaker. I will take us back to a prescription drugs bill just a few  short weeks ago, where the minority traded away its right to a motion  to recommit in favor of a complete substitute.   Let's debate the issues instead of the motion to recommit. The motion  to recommit that passed last week, Madam Speaker, said let's not allow  violent convicted criminals to serve as TSA agents.   This is what the majority is protecting America from: amendments from  the minority that would protect TSA employees from working side by side  with violent convicted felons. This isn't an adversarial idea, Madam  Speaker. This is an idea that we all agreed on, which is why it passed  with great bipartisan support.   You never know when the bad habits you get into are going to stick.   I will take you back to a time when my friend, Mr. McGovern, and my  ranking member, Mr. Cole, were on the floor just few short years ago,  and my friend from Massachusetts said this. He said:         Mr. Speaker, I have nothing but the highest respect for my       colleague from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), and I know he wants this       House to run better. But the fact of the matter is I feel bad       that he has to defend this lousy, restrictive,       indefensible process. That is our job on the Rules       Committee sometimes.    And I want to say to my friend from Massachusetts, as he said to our  friend from Oklahoma: I have nothing but the highest respect for my  colleague from Massachusetts, and I know that he wants this House to  run better. But the fact of the matter is I feel bad that he has to  defend this lousy, restrictive, indefensible process.    Madam Speaker, will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, I don't think of it as interrupting. I  apologize to Chairman McGovern. I think of it as elucidating.   What my friend has said is absolutely right. This process has been  used before, just not for this purpose, which is why Politico ran----
