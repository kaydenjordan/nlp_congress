 Mr. President, today I would have cast my vote  in favor of Scott Brown to represent the United States as Ambassador to  New Zealand and Samoa. New Zealand has been a treaty ally of the United  States since the signing of the Australia-New Zealand--United States  Treaty in 1951. As a crucial partner and ally, the United States and  New Zealand share core values of democracy, human rights, and liberty,  and I believe it is imperative for the United States to maintain strong  allegiance to our longstanding friends throughout the world.                            ____________________
