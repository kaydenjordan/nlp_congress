 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate three of my  constituents--Susan Ackerman and William McGinnis of the University of  California, San Diego, and Jeremy Jackson of Scripps Institution of  Oceanography--for their election to the National Academy of Sciences.   At UCSD, Susan works to enrich the field of neurology through her  dedication to in-depth research of molecular pathways. William is a  leader in cell and developmental biology, studying the genetic systems  that control development and regeneration of tissues in animals.   Susan joins a record number of women who make up 40 percent of the  newly elected class, the most ever elected in any one year, to date.  This is another milestone for representation of women in science.   Jeremy is a renown ecologist, paleobiologist, and conservationist at  the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, where he researches human  impacts on the environment and the evolution of coral reefs.   San Diego's research institutes are vital to scientific discoveries,  and each member helps fuel San Diego's innovation economy through their  work. Susan, William, and Jeremy join 111 other National Academy of  Sciences members from San Diego's research institutes.   This year, the National Academy of Sciences celebrates 156 years of  furthering science in America. The Academy has helped inform  engineering and health policy, and Susan, William, and Jeremy will add  the expertise of San Diego's scientific community as the Academy  fulfills its mission.   Since Congress chartered the Academy in 1863, it has been at the  forefront of what makes America the most innovative place in the world.   I thank Susan Ackerman, William McGinnis, and Jeremy Jackson for  representing San Diego in the Academy and for their fine work.                Commending Judy Ki on Her Community Leadership     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Judy Ki, a Chinese  American in my district who has been a force for change in San Diego.   Judy is originally from Hong Kong and taught middl school science in  the San Diego Unified School District for 30 years. She has a  bachelor's degree in psychology, a master's of science in computer  technology, and five teaching credentials.    During her teaching career, she received a certificate from then-Vice  President Al Gore, acknowledging her for her work in environmental  education. Judy was also recognized as a distinguished educator by  Who's Who Among America's Teachers in both 2002 and 2003, thanks to  nominations from her students.   Since retiring from teaching, she has been very involved in the Poway  community and continues to serve as a volunteer and mentor, especially  within the Asian and Pacific Islander community.   I thank Judy for her dedicated years as an educator and for her  commendable leadership in providing a voice for the San Diego AAPI  community.       Congratulating Scripps Spelling Bee Participant Elliott Husseman     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Elliott Husseman,  winner of the 50th annual San Diego Union-Tribune Countywide Spelling  Bee and a participant in the 92nd Scripps National Spelling Bee.   As an active student at Inspire Charter Schools, Elliott is an  inspiration to his peers and the Poway community. Inspire Charter  Schools teach students to be independent, critical thinkers and  responsible San Diego citizens.   Elliott upheld the pillars of Inspire admirably, showing integrity  and confidence under pressure. He demonstrated tenacity and  levelheadedness beyond his years while competing in a record-breaking  field of 562 spelling bee contestants.   Since 1925, the Scripps National Spelling Bee has cultivated a  passion for learning among young Americans, reaching 11 million  students each year. It offers a platform for students like Elliott to  engage with like-minded students and represent their communities in an  encouraging environment that fosters sportsmanship and respect.                                time  1015    The valuable experience of competing allows these young students to  build  [[Page H5081]]  confidence and showcase their academic abilities, skills that are key  to their future success.   Elliot's achievements in the Scripps National Spelling Bee represent  the future of San Diego and the 52nd District. Please join me in  congratulating Elliot here at home and on the national stage.                            ____________________
