 Mr. President, I want to take a moment to honor the more  than 125,000 hard-working men and women who work in America's rice  industry. September is National Rice Month, and it is also the start of  our domestic rice harvest. This year, roughly 23 billion pounds of rice  will be grown on 3 million acres of farmland. 85 percent of the rice  eaten in America comes from just 6 States: Arkansas, California,  Mississippi, Missouri, Texas, and my home State of Louisiana.   Rice isn't just delicious in jambalaya or seafood gumbo; it is an  indispensable part of Louisiana's economy. The 4,500 members of the  Louisiana rice industry generate more than $700 million in economic  benefits for the State. These small businesses not only put food on the  table of America's families, but they also employ tens of thousands of  workers. Altogether, America's rice crop has a $34 billion impact on  our national economy.   Rice farmers are also careful stewards of our Nation's precious  natural resources. Over the past 20 years, rice farmers have been able  to increase their yields by as much as 50 percent. They have achieved  this while using less land, less water, and less energy. American rice  shines as a bright example of sustainable agriculture and the benefits  of effective agricultural research.   America was born on a farm. The importance of farming to the U.S.  economy cannot be overstated; agriculture provides jobs for nearly 1 in  7 Americans. While rice is a valuable export, I am pleased to say that  nearly all of our domestic rice crop is consumed right here. For these  and many other reasons, I am proud to celebrate National Rice Month and  the world's most popular grain. I also want to extend my heartfelt  support and gratitude to all American rice farmers, particularly those  in the great State of Louisiana. Keep up the good work.
