 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership in  continuing to fight for small business.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3170, the Small Business  Development Center Cyber Training Act of 2017. Cybersecurity has become  an increasing issue for small businesses, as many small firms have less  time than larger firms to develop cybersecurity defense strategies,  fewer staff to monitor systems, and less access to capital to purchase  computer security hardware and software.   As more businesses embrace online tools, such as social media, mobile  services, and cloud data storage, the need for stronger information  security and cybersecurity systems has grown. Small business  development centers provide important resources and business assistance  programs for entrepreneurs and small-business owners.   In Kansas, small business development centers have aided hundreds of  businesses across the State, many of which I visited across the  district. H.R. 3170 acknowledges the importance of cybersecurity, as  well as the broad reach of SBDCs, and instructs the small-business  administrator to establish a cybersecurity program for SBDC employees.   Adding this training to the SBDC toolkit will allow SBDC employees to  assist businessowners with cyber planning and strategy and is critical  in ensuring that small businesses and entrepreneurs are able to  securely compete in today's digital marketplace. I encourage my  colleagues to support this legislation.
