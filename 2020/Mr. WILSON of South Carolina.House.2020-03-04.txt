 Madam Speaker, this week, we welcomed  the American Israel Public Affairs Committee to Washington for the  annual AIPAC Policy Conference.   This conference, with over 18,000 attending, is the largest gathering  of America's pro-Israel community. AIPAC President Betsy Berns Korn is  a very effective leader.   Monday, I had the opportunity to have attended the AIPAC Leadership  Reception hosted by Howard and Elayne Levkowitz with Adam Schiff.   Yesterday, I met with AIPAC members, led by David Kulbersh and his  wife, Jane, of Columbia. They continued the tradition of the late David  Baker of Columbia advising my predecessor, Chairman Floyd Spence.   Americans appreciate Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a world  statesman, for his cooperation with Jared Kushner for peace. I will  always cherish leading the congressional delegation for the opening of  the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem with Ambassador David Friedman as  President Donald Trump fulfilled ``Promises Made, Promises Kept.''   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Our prayers for Jeannie Burkett.                            ____________________
