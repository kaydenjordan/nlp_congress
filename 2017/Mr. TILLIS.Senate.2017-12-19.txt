 Mr. President, when we pursue tax reform, invariably  those impacted will voice concerns along the way. I know this from  experience, having done tax reform in North Carolina.   Everyone was for tax reform until it came to protecting their  individualized interests. However, reform was not about protecting tax  benefits for the rich or the like, as some of my colleagues have  suggested--understandably, for political purposes.   Tax reform is what we can do as a Congress to help spur economic  growth. Without growth, we cannot solve our Nation's problems. Having  an uncompetitive tax code hampers the ability of the middle class to  grow and prosper.   Through this process, we have fought to ensure that there are  appropriate transition rules and protections for various strategic  sectors in our economy, and I am proud of the work that both Chambers  of Congress have done through the conference process.   When we debated the Senate's tax reform package on the floor, some of  my colleagues offered amendments on discrete issues, and I believe  that, for many of these issues, we attempted to embrace, as a body, a  process that defines problems and works to solve them.   I also believe that the conference committee did a good job working  with JCT and the Finance Committee to address issues, without  jeopardizing the underlying tax reform measure.   For other issues that were not able to be addressed in theconference  report, I believe that legislating is an exercise of continued and  systematic work. That means we need to come back next year in a  reconciliation process and continue to improve upon this legislation.   As an example of some of the work that we must still do, I do not  believe that we should penalize companies for voluntary repatriation  and believe that there should be targeted transition rules in place to  consider those who have a history of voluntary repatriation and are not  simply doing so late in the year as tax reform became a realistic  possibility. That said, I understand that some things are not always  achievable, and it is tough to treat some companies differently than  others when everyone is making sacrifices.   Another area that I think needs to be worked on in future iterations  of tax reform are tailored transition rules for different strategic  sectors like the energy sector, manufacturing sector, and other  industries that have foreign tax credits stranded overseas.  Additionally, as we evaluate how the tax treatment for passthrough  entities unfolds, we need to ensure that we are appropriately  regulating and taxing capital deployers so that we are fully realizing  their potential contributions to economic growth.   In its totality, I was happy to see that there was common ground  found on issues such as: how JCT scores and evaluates insurance  reserves; how the limitations on business interest deductibility  affects different sectors, particularly those that rely heavily on debt  to operate; ensuring that there is continued parity for pass through  entities in the new territorial system by preserving appropriate export  incentives in the Tax Code; and many others that are so important to  State and local economies.   When I did tax reform in North Carolina as the speaker of the North  Carolina State House, I received many of the same criticisms that I  have received as we have gone through this current reform process. Our  hard work paid off in North Carolina, and I believe that it will pay  off for America--as a global competitor and for all Americans.   Thank you. I look forward to supporting this conference report, and I  look forward to working with my colleagues in the future as we continue  our collective pursuit to make America the most competitive it can be  and as we continue to help America achieve its economic potential.    Madam President, I congratulate Andrew Murray on his  investiture as the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North  Carolina.   Andrew graduated magna cum laude from the University of North  Carolina at Charlotte with a bachelor of science in political science  and received his juris doctor from the University of North Carolina  School of Law.   Throughout his career, Andrew has dedicated himself to public service  and leadership. Andrew enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard in 1980 and  retired in 2015, serving his country faithfully for 35 years. During  his service, he earned a number of decorations, including the Coast  Guard Meritorious Service Medal, three Coast Guard Commendation Medals,  the Coast Guard Achievement Medal, and the Coast Guard 9/11 Service  Medal.   Andrew began his legal career at the Mecklenburg County District  Attorney's Office as an assistant district attorney. Later, he worked  in private practice before being elected to serve as the district  attorney of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina's largest prosecutorial  district. During his tenure as district attorney, he led the office  with the utmost distinction and is highly respected for his leadership.   I am proud that Andrew is willing to continue serving western North  Carolina in a new role as U.S. Attorney. Western North Carolina is  lucky to have such an experienced prosecutor and effective leader to  command this important office. He is a dedicated public servant whose  extensive prosecutorial experience and relationships with law  enforcement will bolster the mission of the Department of Justice and  promote public safety.   Senator Burr and I proudly recommended Andrew to President Trump, and  I know that he will lead the U.S. Attorney's Office with honor.                            ____________________
