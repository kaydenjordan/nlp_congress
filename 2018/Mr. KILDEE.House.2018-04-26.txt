 Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. DeFazio both for yielding, but  especially for his leadership on this issue.   As the ranking member said, this is something that comes up every  year. Thankfully, Democrats and Republicans have stood together to  protect this important worker protection.   Let's just be clear about this. This is about the desire to engage in  this race to the bottom to pay working families less money.   The truth of the matter is coming from a community, a community like  Flint, Saginaw, Bay City, where we have seen significant and continuing  loss of earned income by working people, where we have a chance to say  to the American people that when it is your tax dollars being spent, we  are not going to use them to undermine the ability of a family to have  a decent wage.   People work hard at these jobs, they have trained long for these  jobs, going through apprenticeships or other skilled training, and the  idea that we would reverse a decades-long commitment to the American  worker that when it comes to federally funded projects, we are going to  ensure that if you work hard, play by the rules, you get a decent wage,  I support that, and we all should.
