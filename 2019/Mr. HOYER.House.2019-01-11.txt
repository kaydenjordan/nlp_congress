 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I think  this is my first time in a long time of having a magic 1 minute, so I  have some things to say.   I was on the Appropriations Committee for 23 years. I came here in  1981. Between 1981 and 1995, we had 10 shutdowns. Those 10 shutdowns  averaged 1.9 days a shutdown. The longest one was 3 days. They were  because of differences, not because of a strategy.   In 1995, Newt Gingrich adopted shutting down government as a  strategy, as a taking hostage not only of Federal employees, but taking  hostage of the American Government and taking hostage of everyone who  is served on a daily basis by the Federal Government. The reason I know  it is a strategy is because it has happened a number of times.   The next one, long-term, was in 2013, when Ted Cruz, a United States  Senator, came over here and talked to a number of Members and said:  Unless the President will repeal the Affordable Care Act, we are not  going to fund the government. In other words, unless the President  didn't take healthcare away from Americans, the Republicans would take  government services away from Americans and hold hostage the Government  of the United States.   And now, just a few years later, ladies and gentlemen, the  Republicans have again taken hostage not only 800,000 people who work  for the Federal Government, expecting them to work for no pay to  protect our borders, to protect our seas, to protect our food, and so  they have taken hostage the Government of the United States one more  time.   So we have a crisis, but the crisis is not at the border. There is a  challenge at the border, and we need to make our border secure. We are  for that.                                time  1000    The proposal the President made in a campaign speech which got a lot  of roars all the times he gave it was: We need a wall, a big wall, a  wall along the whole border, a wall that the Mexican Government will  pay for. It was total campaign rhetoric and demagoguery. It was not a  policy.   And I agree with my friend from Idaho. Mr. Simpson is the former  speaker of the Idaho House. The far right in his party ran a candidate  against him a few elections ago and they got beaten badly. Thank  heavens for that; thanks to the judgment of voters in Idaho.   I agree with my friend,  Tom Cole, in part. But if he were here-- unfortunately, he has left the floor--but I would say to  Tom Cole: Mr.  Cole, as you ended the Congress with your side in charge, you rejected  a bill from the United States Senate, passed with unanimous consent,  that would have opened up all of government.   And you rejected that bill because the President told you to put $5.6  billion in the bill, which you knew--and I am sorry,  Tom Cole is not  on the floor because he says, you know, this bill is not going to  pass--which you knew would not pass the United States Senate, but you  sent it anyway. Why? Because the President of the United States told  you to do so.   Let me remind all of us that we are a coequal branch of government.  We are the Article I branch of government. We are the policymakers of  government, not to sit as stooges and be told  [[Page H492]]  by the President of the United States: If you don't do what I want,  what I tell you to do, I won't sign the bill.   Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday night, the President went on television and  tried to argue that the American people should continue to endure a  painful government shutdown until Democrats give in on funding for a  border wall that has bipartisan opposition. Democrats and Republicans  alike--not all--oppose this $5.7 billion waste of money on a physical  wall along the border.   Representative Will Hurd--now, who is Will Hurd? He is a Republican  Member of the Congress of the United States. He is a Member of the  Congress of the United States from Texas. He represents a district  which has more border than any other district in America. What does he  say?         Building a wall is the most expensive and least effective       way to secure the border.    But the President of the United States says: You don't do that, I am  not playing. And because he is not playing, none of you are playing.   I say to my Republican friends: How sad. You were not elected by your  constituents to do what Donald Trump tells you to do. You were elected  by your constituents to do what is best for them and their country.   Senator Lindsey Graham, a friend of the President, a Republican, and  a Senator from South Carolina said this:         The border wall is probably not a smart investment.    But the President has told Lindsey Graham: You are not for my wall, I  am not for your bill, and I won't sign it. And I am going to shut down  government.   One person is responsible for shutting down government. Donald Trump.  Most of the people he shut down and is not paying, they don't have a  dad they can go to and say: Give me some money, dad. Maybe he doesn't  know that experience.   Opposing a new barrier, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick  Mulvaney--listen to me, my Republican friends--said in 2015:         You go under. You go around. You go through. What they need       is more manpower, more technology, and more willingness to       enforce the law as it exists today.    He said that in 2015. Not a wall. More manpower, more technology,  more willingness. That is essentially what Will Hurd said.   Senator Ron Johnson, one of the most conservative Senators in the  United States Senate said he always thought that the President's wall  was a ``metaphor.''   Now, if it is a metaphor for security, we are in, because we  Democrats want a border that is secure; that does not allow people who  are not authorized to come into the United States. We want to be sure  that the people, the criminals that bring drugs into the United States  are caught and prevented from doing so, and that people who traffic in  human lives are caught and stopped. We are for that.   When the President was at the border he said that Democrats don't  care about crime. They don't care about human trafficking. That is  baloney. It is a lie. It is unworthy of a President of the United  States to make such an assertion.   Senator John Cornyn of Texas said:         I don't think we are just going to be able to solve border       security with a physical barrier, because people can come       under, around it, and through it.    That is why so many Republicans said the wall is not the answer.  Ranking Member Michael McCaul--now he is the ranking member of the  Foreign Affairs Committee, I tell my Republican friends, Mr. Speaker-- but he was chairman of the Homeland Security Committee when he said  this:         A 30-foot concrete wall is a very expensive proposition and       there are a lot of other things we can be doing technology-      wise to make it a smarter border that is more effective and       more cost efficient.    So don't accuse the Democrats because they are against the wall of  being against border security. Your Republican leaders don't believe  that, so they ought to stop saying it.   They are among the Republicans and Democrats who believe we need a  smarter, more comprehensive strategy to improve border security; not  just building a physical wall with taxpayer money.   President Trump said over, and over, and over, and over, and over  again that Mexico was going to pay for this wall. God knows how any  American voters believed that. Now, of course, not surprisingly, he  admits that is not going to happen.   So let's discuss border security, which is important to Democrats and  Republicans alike. Let's sit down and figure out how best to do it.  That is a debate on policy.   But, by the way, my Republican colleagues did not bring the homeland  security and the border security issue to the floor until December 20,  11\2/3\ months after they took control--or they were in control,  because it was the last of the session. So they waited 11 months and 20  days to bring this critical issue to the floor. My, my, my.   Now they shut down the government if we don't do it their way. This  is a debate on policy, not politics. That is why I quoted so many  Republicans. There is no reason to maintain a dangerous and costly  government shutdown while that debate occurs.   Let's end this shutdown right now and turn to the real discussion  about border security without holding hostage America's workers, their  families, and the people they serve, all of our constituents. Let's  have a vote in the Senate which I believe would reopen government.   Leader McConnell has a responsibility to do so. Leader McConnell has  a responsibility to the Senate and to his oath of office to the  Constitution and to the country. He swore no oath to President Trump.  None of us swear an oath to the President of the United States. We  swear an oath to the Constitution, to preserve and protect and serve  our people.   On August 24, 2014, Senator McConnell said this: ``I am the guy that  gets us out of shutdowns. ``Shutdowns,'' he said--this is Senator  McConnell--``is a failed policy.''   That is what Mr. Simpson said. That is what Mr. Cole, I know,  believes. I have talked to him about it. I hope every Member here  believes that. So my plea is to stop pursuing it as a strategy.   Remember, 10 shutdowns averaged 1.9 days. Your shutdowns, 21 days, 16  days, and now we are going to have the longest shutdown in history,  because you have taken captive the Government of the United States. How  sad that it is us who are the enemy of the Government of the United  States.   Senator McConnell, I hope, will bring bills to the floor to open up  the government as he did in December when he sent a bill here and you  would not take it up, my Republican friends, when you were in charge.  You were the leaders. You rejected that bill that would have funded  government, kept government open, kept serving the American people.  But, no, you took a hostage, and the government is shut down.   The Democratic-led Congress is doing its part. The first day we came  here, we passed a bill that was exactly like the Senate's bill. So one  could assume that the bill they had passed, when they got it back,  would, in fact, pass. And the homeland security we did for a short time  so we could continue negotiations in a positive way without having  hostages being taken.   Last week, we passed a package of funding bills for fiscal year 2019,  a continuing resolution for the Department of Homeland Security, in  order to reopen government and end the Trump shutdown. The Trump  shutdown. The Trump shutdown.   If Trump said to Senator McConnell: Yes, I will sign the bill; the  bills would be passed by the United States Senate. No one disputes  that.   If Trump said to the House Members here, Mr. Speaker, that he would  sign, they would pass the bill. Trump articulated at the White House  that he would not open government until we agreed to do what he wanted  to do. That is not democracy. That is despotism.   Because Leader McConnell was refusing to bring up our package of  appropriation bills, the very same bills written by the Republican  Senate, as has so often been said--and I would prefer that they were  bipartisan bills--we are now sending him each of the bills  individually.   On Wednesday, we passed a bill that would, among other things, reopen  the IRS so taxpayers can get their refunds. They paid in more than they  owed and they ought to get it back and they  [[Page H493]]  ought to get it back in a timely fashion. But the folks who process the  refunds are not being allowed to come to work.   Yesterday, we passed the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and  Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act which will  continue nutrition assistance for those facing hunger, and reopen  programs helping farmers in rural America. Many of you represent rural  farmers, and they are relying on payments from the Department of  Agriculture to sustain them, and they are not getting them.   Yesterday, we also passed the Transportation, Housing and Urban  Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act to restore safety  to air travel and keep low-income Americans from losing rental housing  assistance. I don't think there is any Republican that wants to see  people out on the street because they couldn't make their rent because  they didn't get their payment from the Federal Government.   Today, we are bringing this Department of the Interior, Environment,  and Related Agencies Appropriations bill to the floor to reopen  America's National Parks and restore services to Native Americans and  Tribal communities.   I want to thank the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum) for the  leadership that she has shown and the work that she has pursued to  bring this bill to the floor. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to vote on the merits of this bill, and I hope that many  Republicans will join us.   If Members are for reopening government, vote ``yes.'' If you vote  ``no,'' you are for continuing this Trump shutdown.   I hope Leader McConnell listens to his Senators. Senator Susan  Collins said this on the House-passed bills last Thursday.         It would be great to have them signed into law because       there is not great controversy over them and at least we       would be getting those workers back to work.                                time  1015    Senator Cory Gardner, Republican from Colorado, added: ``We should  continue to do our jobs and get the government open.''   I agree, Mr. Speaker.   Hopefully, when we vote today, we will have in mind the 800,000  people who are not getting paid, half of whom are working. Hopefully,  we will have in mind all those who are looking for a tax return, all  those who are looking for a supplemental nutrition payment so they can  put food on their tables, all those who are looking to make sure they  can settle on their house because FHA is operating, and all those who  need a visa extension or something of that nature.   Hopefully, we will be thinking of them, not just the small-bore  politics of: If you don't do what I say, I won't play.   Vote for this bill. Send it to the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I say to Senator McConnell to put it on the floor, pass  it, and send it to President Trump.    Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Oversight and  Reform Committee, Mr. Cummings, and I also thank Mr. Hurd, who, if he  [[Page H501]]  was in the leadership, this shutdown would not be happening, and if he  were in the leadership, this bill would not be required. I thank him  for bringing it to the floor with Mr. Cummings. I also thank him for  his leadership in trying to get this government open.   Madam Speaker, the 800,000 Federal employees affected by this  shutdown deserve to know that they will be paid once it ends.   I was with a veteran at a veterans organization last night who told  me the highest incident of veteran suicide is brought about by  financial instability, fear of being unable to pay their bills, fear of  being unable to support their families, fear of being unable to pay  their mortgage. That is what this bill is about, to give confidence and  stability to those who work for us, who work for the American people.  That is why this bill is coming to the floor.   I congratulate Senators Warner and Kaine from Virginia, and Senators  Cardin and Van Hollen from Maryland, for shepherding this legislation  through the United States Senate.   Normally, I would be proud to bring this bill to the floor, but none  of us should be proud that this bill is necessary. No one should have  to go without a paycheck just because the President thinks he can bully  Congress into giving him what he wants, taking them hostage in return  for a ransom of agreeing with him.   The American people and the hardworking Federal employees who serve  them should not be held hostage until they give their hard-earned tax  dollars to pay for an expensive and ineffective border wall for which  the President promised Mexico would pay.   So here we are, Madam Speaker, 21 days into what is now the longest  shutdown in our history, with 800,000 Americans missing their paychecks  today because of Donald Trump. How shameful, how sad.   I hope all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me  in supporting this bill, and I thank both parties for bringing this  bill forward. It was a bipartisan bill in the Senate, and I am sure it  will be a bipartisan bill here, because it is not whether you agree  with the shutdown, it is whether you agree to being fair to our Federal  employees. It is about whether you recognize and value the service and  contribution of our Federal workers.   I am proud, Madam Speaker, to represent 62,000 Federal employees. I  am proud to represent them, and I am proud of the work they do. They  deserve better, frankly, than what they have gotten from the Congress  over the last 8 years of the Republican majority.   I made the point a little earlier today that this is a strategy,  shutting down government. The government was shut down 10 times between  1981, when I came here, and 1995, an average shutdown of 1.9 days  because you couldn't reach agreement--it was going back and forth, but  the government was open--but not a strategy to hold hostage for many,  many days and weeks our Federal employees until the other side did what  you told them was absolutely essential for them to do or you were going  to hold hostages.   They deserve better than this shutdown, as do the millions of  Americans impacted by the lack of services provided by these Federal  employees.   This bill would provide a permanent solution to this problem, not  only providing for backpay during this shutdown, but guaranteeing that  Federal employees will get paid if any future shutdowns occur.   I might also observe, although it is not in this bill, it will be our  intention, and I look forward to working with Mr. Hurd on this, that  there are State, county, and municipal employees also impacted who rely  on the flow of Federal funds to pay their salaries that we will  address, hopefully, in the future. I look forward to working with Mr.  Cummings and Mr. Hurd toward that end.   Meanwhile, Democrats will keep working. We will keep working to end  the current shutdown. And I call once more on Leader McConnell and  President Trump to do their part and reopen the people's government.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. We have  reversed positions, of course. For a number of years now I have had the  privilege of having a colloquy with Mr. McCarthy who was then the  majority leader. So Mr. Scalise has now undertaken my role, a role  probably he didn't welcome, but I know that he will do well as minority  whip.   As majority leader I am still here doing the colloquy, and I am proud  to be doing it with Mr. Scalise who is an outstanding Member. I  congratulate him on his position and look forward to working with him  through the years toward trying to create agreement, consensus, and  action by the Congress on behalf of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning-hour  debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business with votes postponed until  6:30 p.m.   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning- hour debate and noon for legislative business.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business  with last votes no later than 3 p.m.   We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The  complete list of suspensions, as is the natural order, will be  announced at the close of business today.   In addition, Mr. Speaker, we will consider H.R. 268 which is the  Disaster Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2019. Chairwoman Lowey  released this legislation last week. It will provide relief and  recovery assistance for Americans affected by recent hurricanes--some  of which were historic in their power and devastation--wildfires,  typhoons, and other natural disasters.   Mr. Speaker, we will also consider additional legislation related to  fiscal year 2019 appropriations.   We are on day 21 of the shutdown. The House Democrats will continue  to work so that it comes to an end as soon as possible.   Members will also be advised that additional legislative items are  possible. I might add to that, it is possible we will deal with one,  two, or three of the appropriation bills that haven't been passed, but  it is also quite possible that, hopefully, we will deal with the  balance of the appropriation bills which have not been enacted. We will  have to see what transpires over the next 24, 48, 72, or 96 hours.  Hopefully, we will be able to move forward to get our Federal employees  back to work.    I thank the gentleman for his observations.   Of course, as the gentleman knows, we have and continue to be and are  today even more so concerned about the fact that the President of the  United States has taken hostage the Government of the United States and  shut it down. As a result, what we have asked for before we get into  serious negotiations is to let us open up the government; for, after  all, when we have border security being our focus, nobody that is  protecting the borders for the United States of America is getting  paid. The morale is low; the apprehension is high; and we believe very  strongly that the first step we ought to take is open up government.   Then, as the gentleman well knows, we have articulated on numerous  occasions--and I hope the gentleman believes we are honest. And when  the gentleman reviews the record of when we were in charge of the House  and the Senate, we made very substantial investments in border  security, as I think probably the gentleman knows.   Furthermore, we have been ready to support and offered the bills that  the Republicans have passed. And, in fact, I think the minority leader  in the Senate said that he would accept the number that the President  suggested, and  [[Page H506]]  we made some counteroffers. They were rejected.   In fact, Senator McConnell believed he had an agreement with the  President on keeping the government open. He sent us a bill to do just  that in the waning days of December, and as the minority whip well  knows, that bill was not taken up on the floor of this House.   In fact, a bill which had been pending for 11\1/2\ months in  committee first came to the floor with 10 days left in the year. That  bill included a number far above the number that the President  originally asked for and far above any number that had been discussed.  Although it passed the House, the House knew then, very well, that it  did not have the votes in the Senate to pass, and it did not pass. As a  result, the government shut down.   And we continue to be in a place, as we said at the White House, to  negotiate on border security to secure our borders, to protect our  people from those who would come across our borders to commit crimes,  protect against drugs being imported, protect against the trafficking  of human beings. We all share that view: Republicans and Democrats. The  issue is how we most effectively accomplish that objective.   Pending that, the government, as we took power--and it was our  responsibility--what we have done over the last 2 weeks is to pass,  essentially, your bills. I don't know how we can be much more  bipartisan than that than to pass your bills.    Mr. President, the Government of the United States  partially has been shut down. That is the issue here. We can have the  debate that the gentleman just discussed--not a word about opening up  the people's government, not a word about 800,000 people who are not  getting their salaries, not a word of the financial instability that he  is subjecting 800,000 people to, ``he'' being the President of the  United States. They are being held hostage for the ransom of doing what  they believe is the right thing to do on border security.   However, Mr. Hurd says--a Republican who has more border mileage on  [[Page H507]]  the border than any other congressional district in America--what the  President wants to do is not the right thing.   Senator Ron Johnson says a similar quote. Lindsey Graham said he  thought it was a bad investment. Now, he didn't say it yesterday or the  day before. He said it about a year ago.    The government is shut down. There is no excuse for that.  But the President wants his way, and he has taken 800,000 people  hostage, and the ransom he demands is his wall.                                time  1245    Nancy Pelosi has nothing to do with shutting down this government. We  have passed bill after bill over the last 2 weeks to open up this  government.   If the minority whip thinks it is good for border security not to pay  people who are protecting the border, he and I differ.   Let me tell you what Mick Mulvaney said. Now, he wasn't there last  night, and I talked to Senator Graham last night. He made the statement  that I just reflected to you.   Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said, in 2015--I understand it is  not when he is working for the President, who is paying his salary-- ``To just say build the darn fence and have that be the end of an  immigration discussion is absurd and almost childish for someone  running for President to take that simplistic of a view.''   He said that on WRHI on 8/25/15. Look it up.   The government is shut down. If the minority whip will look at the  record, we funded more money for border security in 2009 than was  funded in the next 7 years under Republican control.   They didn't bring their bill, Mr. Speaker, to the floor until 11\1/2\  months had passed. But now border security has to be done right this  second or we are going to close down government, keep it shut, and keep  hostage 800,000 people and millions and millions and millions of  Americans who rely on the services of government.   A, we are for border security. We do not want people coming into this  country who are not authorized to come into this country.   B, we care about crime. We care about drugs. We care about investing  money to stop drugs coming into the country and to treat those who are  afflicted with drugs.   The record reflects that, Mr. Speaker. But the record also reflects  that the Republicans have, over and over and over again, used the  shutting down of government, the taking hostage of the people's  government, to get their way.   Newt Gingrich did it first for a long period of time in 1995 and  1996, 21 days. We are going to surpass that this time. He did it  because President Clinton said: I am not going to allow you to cut  education spending for the people of United States as deeply as you  want to cut it.   Then Senator Cruz came over here and talked to the so-called Freedom  Caucus and said: Unless Obama agrees to repeal the Affordable Care Act,  we are going to shut down government.   And they shut down government. Very frankly, when we tried to open it  up, the minority whip didn't vote to open it up. So maybe he doesn't  care about opening up government, paying people who are working for the  people of the United States. I don't know.   Then, just recently, a few weeks ago, when they came to the end of  the fiscal year, they had not done their job. The Republicans are in  charge of the Senate; they were in charge of the House; and they have  the Presidency of the United States.   So we did a CR, and we voted for it because we didn't want to shut  down government. Then we came to the December date to which that CR  ran, and, lo and behold, the majority leader of the United States  Senate sent us over a bill. It was not our bill; it was a bill from the  Republican majority leader. It came here under unanimous consent. Their  Republican-led Senate sent it here, and, lo and behold, the leadership  in the House would not take up that bill.   Why? The President, who had told Senator McConnell he would sign it,  changed his mind. Whether it was Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, Rush  Limbaugh, I don't know who the principal adviser in that decision was,  but one person communicated: I won't sign that bill.   So the Republican leadership decided: We won't put that bill on the  floor.   They put a bill on the floor--they said over and over and over again:  This week, we put bills on the floor that wouldn't pass the Senate.   They put a bill that they knew would not pass the United States  Senate on the floor, sent it over there. It didn't pass, and government  has been shut down.   The gentleman continues to want to talk about, can we negotiate? We  can negotiate. The President walked out. He walked out because Nancy  Pelosi, when asked, ``Thirty days from now, will you support the  wall?'' said, ``No.''   The President had a tantrum, and he walked out. He said: Well, this  is a waste of my time.   This is not a process where the President tells us to do things. As I  recall, Mr. Speaker, the Constitution of the United States, Article I,  says we are the policymakers; we are the ones who pass the laws; we are  the ones who say what the executive department carries out as policy.   So we ought to pass these bills. Then, yes, we ought to deal,  honestly and openly and together, to make sure the borders are secure.   The gentleman said the immigration system does not work; it is  broken. He is absolutely right. The Senate, 5 or 6 years ago, passed a  bill, in a bipartisan way, with over 62 votes, 14 Republicans, and sent  it to the House under Republican leadership 6 years ago. They have  never brought that bill to the floor. We have pleaded with them to  bring that bill to the floor to fix the immigration system. It has  never come, Mr. Speaker, to the floor of this House.   But what we should never do, we should never take hostage the  government of the United States, the employees who toil every day on  behalf of the policies that we adopt and on behalf of the American  people. We should never take them hostage and say: If you don't do what  I say to do, we are going to keep them in an unpaid status, working if  they are critical employees and locked out if they are not.   Mr. Speaker, it is very, very unfortunate that we find ourselves in  this position. I would urge that the Republican  [[Page H508]]  whip, who is my friend and whom I respect, talk to the President of the  United States and say: Let's open up the government. Mr. Hoyer has told  me we will sit down and have a rational, reasonable fact-based, expert- based discussion on how, in fact, we accomplish the objective we all  say we want to accomplish, and that is to make our borders secure.    We are prepared to do that, open this government.    Will the gentleman yield?    Does the gentleman remember how long that lasted?    Oh, no. I think there was an election, and he did raise  that question. As I recall, that is why I am the majority leader and  you are the minority whip.    We could go on and on, Mr. Speaker. The fact of the matter  is the Senate sent us a bill to keep the government open. They passed  it unanimously, under Republican leadership. The President said he  would sign it. He changed his mind, and this House folded. And the  Republicans who were in charge at the time wouldn't even put the Senate  bill on the floor.   We are not prepared to be bludgeoned by taking hostage 800,000 people  who work for the Federal Government and who are not now being paid,  some of whom are working.                                time  1300    And, ironically, they are working to protect the border and to make  sure our planes are flying, to make sure people who fly on planes are  not in danger.   We want the President of the United States to open up this  government. We want the Republicans to help us open up this government.  We just passed four bills that are the Senate bills. Senator McConnell  is not going to take ``yes'' for an answer because the President tells  him: I am not going to sign those bills.  [[Page H509]]    Let me tell you something, Mr. Speaker. I have been a Member of this  body for some period of time, and I served with George Bush. He was  President of the United States, and we had a Democratic House, and we  didn't have a shutdown. He signed appropriations bills. We worked  together. We respected one another.   I would hope, Mr. Speaker, in closing, that the whip would, in fact,  help us open up the government, and then we are prepared to sit down-- he knows me--and talk about how we make our borders secure and protect  our people and, yes, give humanitarian services to those who are  seeking asylum, running from violence and mayhem and murder. We are  prepared to do that. We want to do that.   I would hope the whip, I would hope Senator McConnell, who was quoted  just a few years ago as saying, ``shutdown is a failed policy''-- shutdowns ought not to occur. Adults who are responsible ought not to  allow that to happen, realizing full well that in order to preclude  that from happening, compromise is absolutely essential on both sides.   President Trump is the President of the United States. We have to  work with him to compromise, to come to agreement. But there are an  awful lot of Republicans--I quoted Will Hurd; I quoted Ron Johnson; I  quoted some other Republicans--an awful lot of Republicans who think  the President has the wrong idea. And, frankly, as Mr. Mulvaney said  during the course of the campaign, it wasn't a very realistic idea.   But, that aside, it is time for us to open up the government, and  then we will have an extensive discussion, as we must, as we should, in  the best interests of the American people, to keep our borders secure  and keep them safe.    How many Republicans were in the House at that point in  time?    You had 240-plus.    That bill passed, did it not?    Was that bill brought up in the House?    The gentleman has a different concept of negotiating than  I do. If somebody takes somebody that I care about hostage and says now  I want to negotiate with you, it is not a negotiation. That is a  demand. That is a ``if you don't do it, I am going to harm people.''   When you said the President of the United States said: This is the  last time I am going to open up government, I am going to sign an  almost overwhelmingly supported piece of legislation by Republicans and  Democrats--George Bush never did that. I don't ever remember Ronald  Reagan doing that or George H.W. Bush doing that or Bill Clinton doing  that. They did it when it was a close vote, but not when it was  overwhelming that we ought to open up the government.   As long as hostages are held by your opponent, you are not  negotiating. You are subject to being demanded, ``Do what I say.'' That  is not the democratic process, and it is harming, literally, millions,  tens of millions of people in the process in order to get his way. I  have not seen that before.   The other two shutdowns were legislative shutdowns. There is no doubt  this is an executive shutdown, and you just said it: I will never sign  something like this again unless it gives me what I want.   Frankly, that is what we saw in the negotiations over the 3 days we  were there. The last day, of course, was about a 10-minute day because  the President stomped out.   Mr. Scalise, all I can tell you is I share your view of the  objective, but because we don't agree with the same ways and means to  accomplish that objective, shutting down government ought not to be the  alternative. The alternative ought to be to keep talking and getting to  a place where I think you and I both want to get, where these borders  are secure, where people are not being transported across it for human  trafficking purposes, where murderers don't come across the border.   But there is a surge right now across our border, and that surge is  of mostly  [[Page H510]]  mothers and children seeking asylum, coming to ports of entry--not  across any fences or borders, coming to ports of entry. The border  guards are telling us they are turning themselves in. They want to,  because they are seeking refuge from a country that has purported to be  a country of refuge, that raises a statue in New York Harbor to send  that message. But we need to make them known to us when they come into  the country. We agree on that.   So, rather than all this rhetoric back and forth, Mr. Speaker, it is  a simple proposition. Senator McConnell has said, unless the President  says he will sign on opening up the government, he won't put it on the  floor. That is the only person who is stopping you, because we have  sent bills.   Mr. Cole of your side said: I don't like the bills because they are  only Senate bills. We don't like them either, but we like, less,  government being shut down. We like, less, 800,000 people being put at  risk. We like, less, the anxiety that we are causing our Federal  employees in terms of the financial stability of their homes and their  ability to put food on their tables and pay their mortgage and pay  their rent.   Surely--surely--we ought to be able to come to agreement that that is  not what we ought to inflict to get our way. I hope we open up our  government.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, January 14, 2019, when it  shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for  legislative business.
