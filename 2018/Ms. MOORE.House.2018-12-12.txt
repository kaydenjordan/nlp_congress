 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for  yielding, and I commend my colleagues of the farm bill conference  committee in both the House and the Senate for strengthening the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and rejecting harmful cuts  and onerous hurdles that would have made efforts of struggling families  working to escape poverty more difficult.   This conference agreement very specifically protects SNAP's  categorical eligibility. What a victory we have won by not throwing  235,000 children, including 23,000 in my home State of Wisconsin, off  school lunch, as the House bill proposed.                                time  1245    It rejected language to impose a lifetime ban on SNAP assistance for  individuals reentering the community from incarceration. It rejected  harsh work requirements and extremely limited time restrictions  proposed in the House bill, which would have left millions of Americans  hungry and vulnerable.   And as a true compromise, Mr. Speaker, nobody got everything they  wanted. For example, we still must work to strengthen access for  seniors and people with disabilities who face difficulties  participating in SNAP. That is a fight that we are going to continue to  fight in the next Congress.   But for the meantime, let's not have the perfect be the enemy of the  good, and let's celebrate that we won't be taking food off the table  for millions this holiday season.    Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 434.
