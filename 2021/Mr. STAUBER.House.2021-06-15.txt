 Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of my  bipartisan legislation that improves the safety of air travel. I would  also like to thank my colleague, Mr. DeSaulnier, for his support and  leadership on this piece of legislation.   In 2020, the United States was home to 7 of the top 10 busiest  airports in the world. This means that, as Americans, we have no room  for error when it comes to aviation safety.   Although aviation is the safest form of travel, we must always strive  to do better. This is why we must address the notice to airmen, or  NOTAM, system. NOTAMs are critical, as they relay safety information to  pilots that allow them to understand the possible hazards and  conditions of airports and runways before actually getting to the  destination.    The current system simply is not working as well as it should. NOTAMs  are often buried in lengthy reports, conflating important safety  information with more common alerts. These inefficiencies have the  potential to create life-threatening situations, as described earlier.   My legislation addresses these issues and creates a task force at the  FAA with important input from safety experts and industry professionals  to address what changes need to be made to NOTAMs to make air travel  even safer than it already is.   Americans are more comfortable and excited to travel than they have  been in over a year. Let's ensure that we support this sentiment and  bolster the safety in our skies.   I was proud to work with my colleagues to get this reported out of  the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee unanimously, both last  Congress and this one.   The House also passed this legislation with strong bipartisan support  during the 116th Congress, and I urge the same support this Congress of  the Notice to Airmen Improvement Act.
