 Madam Speaker, extreme MAGA Republicans have  manufactured a crisis and are now extorting the American people with a  terrible choice. Either they inflict cruel cuts that hurt everyday  families, or they are forcing or trying to force a devastating default  on our debt.   They are gambling with working people's livelihoods and the global  economy, driving us to the brink of economic catastrophe.   It is all because they would rather have working people bear the  burden of these terrible cuts instead of making billionaires and big  corporations pay their fair share in taxes.   Madam Speaker, make no mistake. Our constituents are watching,  especially those in Speaker McCarthy's district, where 75,000 people  would lose Social Security payments; 285,000 people's healthcare  benefits would be at risk; and the retirement savings of 89,000 people  would be in jeopardy, not to mention the number of veterans who would  lose their healthcare in Speaker McCarthy's district.   Madam Speaker, from day one, Democrats have been the most responsible  and the loudest voices in defending working families from Republicans'  extreme behavior. We will continue to call out these games and hostage  taking. We must pay our bills.                            ____________________
