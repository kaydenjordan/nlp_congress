 Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, it has been said many times before, but it  bears repeating today more than ever, on World Refugee Day--ours is a  country built by immigrants. We have a proud tradition of welcoming  foreigners to our shores.   The first European settlers in North America--those who founded our  original Thirteen Colonies--were fleeing religious oppression and  persecution. Over the following decades, America became, in the words  of Thomas Paine, ``the asylum for the persecuted.'' We welcomed Irish  Catholics fleeing starvation and British rule, Germans fleeing  political turmoil, Eastern European Jews fleeing the pogroms, and  countless others. Over the generations, America welcomed Europeans  displaced by war, and later, millions of refugees seeking political  asylum from Communism during the Cold War.   In 1980, we passed landmark legislation--the Refugee Act--which  provided a permanent and systemized procedure for admitting refugees.  This law established the concept of a Presidential determination on  refuge admissions, by which the President can set the number of  refugees that the United States may admit in a given year. For the past  40 years, both Democratic and Republican administrations demonstrated a  commitment to robust resettlement. Prior to the Trump administration,  the average annual refugee admissions cap was 95,000 refugees.  Administration officials of both parties took seriously the  Presidential determination and worked to maintain a resettlement rate  on par with it.   At nearly every juncture in history since its founding, America has  been called upon to be a leader in welcoming the persecuted. More often  than not, we have answered that call and today, it sounds to us louder  than ever. With more than 24 million refugees around the globe, America  must step into our historic leadership role, not away from it.   Now is the time to increase the refugee admissions ceiling, not cut  it. Now is the time to build up our resettlement infrastructure, not  decimate it. Now is the time to open our door, not close it. But the  Trump administration betrayed the foundational values of this Nation by  slashing our annual refugee admissions ceiling to a dismal 30,000  refugees. This was an unprecedented low, both in number and humanity.  That is why I introduced the GRACE Act. This bill prohibits any U.S.  President from setting an admission ceiling below 95,000 refugees each  year and requires administration officials to treat that figure as a  goal.   We must not be silent. We must continue to meet the global crisis of  displaced persons head on, and like our forefathers, we must extend a  hand to those fleeing persecution around the word. Thank you.                            ____________________
