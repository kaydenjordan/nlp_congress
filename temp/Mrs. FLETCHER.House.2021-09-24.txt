 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Women's Health  Protection Act. As an original cosponsor of the bill, I thank  Representative Chu for her leadership on this important bill.   As a woman from Texas, I thank this body for responding with urgency  to my beloved home State's cruel law, depriving Texans of their  constitutional rights, by bringing this bill to the floor today.   In this moment, it is a Texas law, a law quickly being copied across  the country, that has brought us here. But let us remember that it was  also Texas that brought us the framework for this bill that we will  pass today to protect the health, privacy, dignity, and freedom of  women and families across this country in the case of Roe v. Wade. It  was a 26-year-old Texas woman named Sarah Weddington who took that case  all the way to the Supreme Court.   Texas women have fought and will continue to fight for the rights  that we protect here today. I am proud to be one of them and to vote in  favor of this bill.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from NARAL Pro-Choice  America.                   Statement of NARAL Pro-Choice America      The Women's Health Protection Act (H.R. 3755)--september 24, 2021         Thank you for the opportunity to submit a statement to the       U.S. House of Representatives on this critical legislation.       NARAL Pro-Choice America (NARAL) is a national advocacy       organization, dedicated to protecting and advancing       reproductive freedom, including access to abortion,       contraception, paid leave, and protection from pregnancy       discrimination, as a fundamental right and value. Through       education, organizing, and influencing public policy, NARAL       and our 2.5 million members from every state and       congressional district in the country work to guarantee every       individual the freedom to make personal decisions about their       lives, bodies, and futures, free from political interference.       For this reason, we are submitting this statement to thank       leadership for holding this vote and to call on Congress to       pass the Women's Health Protection Act in order to safeguard       the federal right to abortion against bans and medically       unnecessary restrictions.        The legal right to abortion faces its greatest threat in       decades. Despite overwhelming public support, 8 in 10       Americans, for the legal right to abortion, we're in the       midst of an all-out assault on reproductive freedom with Roe       v. Wade hanging in the balance. The need to enshrine the       legal right to abortion in federal statute is more urgent       than ever. The fact that the U.S. Supreme Court will soon       hear Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, a direct       challenge to Roe v. Wade, and that it declined to block       Texas's extreme abortion ban, allowing Roe to be rendered       meaningless in the state, represent ominous signs for the       future of abortion rights in this country.        Earlier this month, the Supreme Court failed to intervene       and subsequently rejected an emergency request to block Texas       Senate Bill 8 (SB 8), a blatantly unconstitutional ban on       abortion. This law bans abortion at approximately six weeks       before many people even know they are pregnant. It also       grants private citizens the power to sue abortion providers       and anyone else who helps someone access abortion care; this       includes clergy members or counselors, abortion funds that       assist someone in paying for abortion care, and even someone       who drives a patient to their appointment, like family       members, friends, and rideshare drivers. An individual who       successfully sues someone for assisting a pregnant person       seeking abortion care would receive a financial reward of       $10,000. The Supreme Court's decision to allow SB 8 to go       into effect essentially gave Texas the green light to render       Roe v. Wade meaningless in the state and empowered anti-      choice lawmakers to use this law as a blueprint to roll back       reproductive freedom in their own states.        The pending Supreme Court case is set against a backdrop of       increasingly cruel and draconian restrictions and bans as       anti-choice politicians escalate their quest to end legal       abortion.        Even as Roe stands, though it has long not been a reality       for many, the further evisceration of abortion access is       ramping up. In addition to Texas's ban, state lawmakers       seeking to advance their agenda of power and control have       passed hundreds of state-level attacks on abortion access       over the last decade that have made care extremely difficult,       if not impossible, to access for many people across the       country. Systematic attacks on reproductive freedom and       abortion access, including bans on abortion coverage,       intentionally push access out of reach and have rendered       meaningless the protections and rights afforded by Roe v.       Wade for many people across the country.        The unprecedented threat to the right to abortion       underscores the urgent need for Congress to pass the Women's       Health Protection Act. Every day without congressional action       to protect abortion rights and expand abortion access means       that more and more people are denied the right to abortion       and ability to access the care that they need--and we know       that this disproportionately affects women, Black, Indigenous       and People of Color (BIPOC), people working to make ends       meet, immigrants, young people, people with disabilities,       LGBTQ+ individuals, and those living in rural and other       medically underserved areas. Attacks on abortion rights and       access are rooted in racism, white supremacy, and other forms       of discrimination. Ending these barriers and ensuring equal       access to abortion care is central to the pursuit of       reproductive freedom and racial and economic justice.        The looming threat to the future of legal abortion across       the country is the result of a decades-long far-right       strategy to advance a radical and out-of-touch ideological       agenda. In the late 1970s, radical conservatives weaponized       the formerly non-political, back-burner issue of abortion       rights as political cover for their efforts to maintain white       patriarchal control amidst diminishing support for racist       policies like school segregation, which had previously been       the backbone of their movement. In the years immediately       preceding and following Roe v. Wade, Evangelical Christians,       who now form the backbone of the GOP, were overwhelmingly       indifferent on the issue of abortion. But through the       carefully crafted messages of Paul Weyrich, Jerry Falwell,       and other architects of the Radical Right, abortion became       the political tool of choice for a movement determined to       maintain control in a changing world, and the trojan horse       for a far-reaching array of ideologies meant to thwart social       progress.        In the intervening years, opposition to abortion has become       a litmus test in far-right circles for a host of political       and judicial positions. In order to advance their agenda--one       that has always stood in direct opposition to the values of       the majority of Americans--they developed and implemented a       strategy for capturing and maintaining minority rule. This       strategy included pushing regressive boilerplate legislation       chipping away at access to abortion through state       legislatures and Congress, as well as stacking the federal       judiciary with anti-choice ideologues.        Anti-choice activists have spent decades building their       influence over the federal judiciary through well-funded,       secretive networks like the Federalist Society. Conservative       activists have never been shy about the fact that their       takeover of the federal judiciary is part of a broad strategy       to quell the majority and cement minority rule, but the       election of Donald Trump took this tactic to new heights. In       May 2016, Trump pledged to only nominate anti-choice judges,       a promise he doubled down on in 2020. And with the help of       Mitch McConnell, Trump installed anti-choice federal judges       with lifetime appointments at a breakneck pace. More than a       quarter of currently active federal judges are now Trump       appointees, including Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch,       Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett--tipping the balance       of the Court to a supermajority unmistakably hostile to       reproductive freedom. We have already seen this majority use       the so-called ``shadow docket'' to undermine the right to       abortion and abortion access. There is no denying that the       threat to Roe v. Wade is real.        Anti-choice lawmakers, emboldened by the anti-choice       supermajority on the Court, have accelerated their push to       pass blatantly unconstitutional bans and restrictions on       abortion--introducing, advancing, or passing over 330 bills       attacking abortion access this year alone, some going as far       as criminalizing pregnant people and doctors who provide       abortion care. Now, more than ever, the anti-choice movement       is advancing its extremist agenda in plain sight. Already       this year, at least eight states have enacted laws that       criminalize doctors for providing abortion care. When       abortion care is criminalized, lives are on the line. Ending       legal abortion would roll back the clock for our rights, but       it would not eliminate abortion. It would only isolate and       endanger people trying to make the best decisions for their       lives and their futures.        The interrogation and punishment of people who are pregnant       is not far-fetched--it is already happening. People across       the country are already being charged or prosecuted for       pregnancy outcomes including pregnancy loss, self-managing       abortion care, or even the suspicion of it. Criminalizing       people for having an abortion, experiencing a miscarriage or       stillbirth, or any other pregnancy outcome only exacerbates       racial inequities and is just one of the many ways that       Black, Indigenous, and other people of color have been       criminalized.        NARAL Pro-Choice America strongly supports the Women's       Health Protection Act, which was re-introduced this year by       Representatives Judy Chu (D-CA), Lois Frankel (D-FL), Ayanna       Pressley (D-MA), and Veronica Escobar (D-TX), and Senators       Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI). Roe v.       Wade and access to abortion care are on the line like never       before and this moment requires urgent action from Congress.       All people--no matter who they are or where they live--should       have the  [[Page H5150]]       freedom to make their own decisions about whether to start or       grow a family, free from political interference. Enacting the       Women's Health Protect Act is a critical step toward creating       a world where every body is free to make the best decisions       for themselves, their families, and their lives.
