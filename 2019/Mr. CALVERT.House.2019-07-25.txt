 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Bipartisan Budget  Deal of 2019. Like many of my colleagues, there are parts of the deal I  object to and parts I strongly support.   As ranking member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I would  have preferred a higher top line for defense than $738 billion.  However, we will always choose certainty and on-time appropriations  rather than another destructive CR.   Right now, our military is at an inflection point. As our military  readiness returns to appropriate operational levels, we must continue  to push forward on modernization efforts that will continue America's  superiority on land, sea, air, and space into the next century.    Just as former Secretary Mattis woke Americans up to the dire  circumstances of our readiness levels, Americans are now beginning to  understand that our military superiority can no longer be assumed  against near-peer adversaries such as Russia and China.   Whether it is hypersonics, low-yield nuclear weapons, artificial  intelligence, or the militarization of space, the gap has closed.   The 2-year budget deal before us today provides the certainty for our  military to do what they do best, prepare to win the next war in the  hopes that our military might will deter any would-be competitor from  ever starting that war.   I know many of my conservative friends are concerned about more  deficit spending and adding to our $22 trillion debt. I share that  concern, but we need to look at the full budget picture. Mandatory  spending, if you include interest on the debt, now consumes 72 percent  of the Federal budget.   National defense actually accounts for 15.6 percent of the budget.  That leaves only about 12 percent left in the pie. We cannot balance  our budget on the back of 12 percent nondefense discretionary spending.  The math does not work.   In fact, since 2010, because of the BCA, accounting for inflation, we  have reduced nondefense discretionary spending by 4.65 percent, and we  have reduced defense discretionary by 17.2 percent.   To my friends on the left, we cannot continue to ignore realities of  mandatory spending and simply spend more on the discretionary side with  no regard to the future. And the solutions need not be drastic.   Slowing the rate of growth and making commonsense reforms for future  generations would relieve the pressure and allow us to finally have a  plan to pay down the debt.   The bill before us is not perfect. That is the nature of compromise.  But my ``yes'' vote is in support of the brave men and women who wear  the uniform. It is our duty to support them and their missions.   However, I do not vote blind to our budget reality, which, if left  unchecked, will consume our entire budget.   I urge my colleagues to support the bill, end the failed experiment  of the BCA, and commit to true budget reform that will address our  mounting debt.                                time  1430
