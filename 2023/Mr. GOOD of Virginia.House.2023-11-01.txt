 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my friend  from Utah's resolution that denounces terrorism and anti-Semitism at  universities across this country.   The world watched in horror on October 7 when Hamas launched their  unprovoked and brutal terrorist attack on Israel causing the greatest  single-day of loss of Jewish life since the Holocaust.   I joined the overwhelming majority of Americans in immediately  expressing unwavering support for Israel, but, sadly, we have also seen  an outbreak of support for the perpetrators of terror, Hamas and  Hezbollah, on our college campuses.   What are we teaching college students on these campuses, and what  kind of professors are doing this teaching?   In my own district, the Students for Justice in Palestine at the  University of Virginia issued a statement that the violence against  Israel makes them hopeful for the future of Palestine, implying that  Israel was somehow deserving of the atrocities committed against them.   Free speech is protected in this country, but it cannot be used to  support terrorist actions.   To the University of Virginia's credit, the president issued a  statement clearly condemning Hamas. Nevertheless many other university  administrators were not as definitive in their responses.   This resolution challenges college administrators to condemn anti- Semitism and focus on education rather than liberal indoctrination.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to sponsor this resolution, and I urge my  colleagues to support this resolution.
