 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 447, the  National Apprenticeship Act of 2021.   We are still in the midst of our country's worst economic crisis in  decades, and to better serve the American people, we must invest in a  workforce, invest in the American Dream.   Registered apprenticeships prepare people for the jobs of the 21st  century. They make our cities, our States, and our country stronger and  far more competitive.   By supporting registered apprenticeship programs, we can ensure that  my great State of Georgia remains the best State in the country in  which to live and do business.   For decades, the Registered Apprenticeship Program has proven to be  an entryway for many into the middle class, and the National  Apprenticeship Act would inject much-needed funding to support a  successful workforce program at a time when our Nation truly needs it  the most.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
