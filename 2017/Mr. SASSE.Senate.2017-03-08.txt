 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:30 p.m.  today, all remaining time on H.J. Res. 58 be yielded back.    Mr. President, I rise to restate my support for H.J. Res.  58, a resolution to overturn the Obama administration Department of  Education's rule regulating future teacher preparation programs from  Washington, DC.   This teacher preparation mandate actually assumes that Washington  bureaucrats are competent to micromanage teacher training programs  across America. There are 27,000 such programs, by the way, and this  micromanagement is absurd. We all agree that education matters, that  teachers matter, that teacher training programs matter, and that kids  are the future of our country, but I ask my colleagues to acknowledge  the expertise and to respect the reforms already begun at the district  and State levels and to reverse this misguided Federal regulation of  teacher preparation programs.   I would like to close by reading several quotations from those who  would have been affected by this regulation had it gone into effect.   This first quotation comes from the American Federation of Teachers.  Their public statement on the final rule, on October 12, 2016, reads as  follows:         It is, quite simply, ludicrous to propose evaluating       teacher preparation programs based on the performance of the       students taught by those program's graduates. Frankly, the       only conceivable reason the department would release       regulations so out of sync with the Every Student Succeeds       Act and President Obama's own call to reduce high-stakes       testing is they are simply checking off their bucket list of       outstanding issues before the end of their term.        The final regulations could harm students who benefit the       most from consistent, high-quality standards for teacher       preparation programs. The regulations will create enormous       difficulty for teacher prep programs and place an unnecessary       burden on institutions and states, which are also in the       process of implementing ESSA.    My second quotation comes from the comments of the provost and the  chair of the Department of Education at Creighton University in Omaha,  NE, dated February 2, 2015, of the comment period:         As stated earlier, the regulations represent a significant       financial burden to institutions, local school systems, and       states. In the state of Nebraska, there are over 500       individual teacher preparation ``programs'' subject to the       complexities of these regulations.    Again, these regulations are 700 pages.         Even as a system is developed, issues regarding privacy,       low numbers, and student demographics would impact results       unfairly and result in decisions unlikely to improve teacher       preparation programs and student learning at PK-12 schools       [in Nebraska].    My third and final quotation comes from the Association of  Independent Colleges and Universities of Nebraska, and they wrote the  Department of Education about this rule as follows:         [T]he budgetary impact of this regulation is significantly       understated, if not laughable. No financial support for       states, school systems, or institutions of higher education       to implement the requirements is proposed. The regulations       create new requirements for colleges, schools, and states to       track and report on candidates and teachers for many years.       Those systems are not in place. The cost estimates make       inaccurate assumptions that colleges and states already have       the systems in place for collecting, analyzing, reporting,       and utilizing data (federally-mandated data which may or may       not be valid or reliable for the purposes for which it is       intended to be used). It also provides a timeline that is       unworkable for most states and institutions.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following statements  and letters be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     [From www.aft.org, Oct. 12, 2016]        AFT's Weingarten on Teacher Preparation Programs Regulations         Washington--Statement from American Federation of Teachers       President Randi Weingarten on the Department of Education's       final regulations for teacher preparation programs.        ``It is, quite simply, ludicrous to propose evaluating       teacher preparation programs based on the performance of the       students taught by a program's graduates. Frankly, the only       conceivable reason the department would release regulations       so out of sync with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) and       President Obama's own call to reduce high-stakes testing is       that they are simply checking off their bucket list of       outstanding issues before the end of their term.        ``The final regulations could harm students who would       benefit the most from consistent, high-quality standards for       teacher preparation programs. The regulations will create       enormous difficulty for teacher prep programs and place an       unnecessary burden on institutions and states, which are also       in the process of implementing ESSA.        ``Instead of designing a system to support and improve       teacher prep programs, the regulations build on the now-      rejected high-stakes testing system established under NCLB       and greatly expanded under this administration's Race to the       Top and waiver programs. It's stunning that the department       would evaluate teaching colleges based on the academic       performance of the students of their graduates when ESSA--      enacted by large bipartisan majorities in both the House and       Senate last December--prohibited the department from       requiring school districts to do that kind of teacher       evaluation.        ``Teacher prep programs need to help ensure that teachers       are ready to engage their students in powerful learning and       creating an environment that is conducive to learning. These       regulations will not help achieve that goal. These       regulations do not address ways to help the current status of       the teaching profession: the shortages, the lack of diversity       or the high turnover.        ``While the department has made minor tweaks, the flawed       framework remains the same. The regulations will punish       teacher prep programs whose graduates go on to teach in our       highest-needs schools, most often those with high       concentrations of students who live in poverty and English       language learners--the exact opposite strategy of what we       need. As we brought up in January 2015--in our comments to       the department's proposal--if programs are rated as the       department proposes, teacher prep schools will have incentive       to steer graduates away from assignments in our toughest       schools, and that will only make matters worse.        ``If we want to get it right, we should look to countries       like Finland, where prospective teachers receive extensive       training in their subject matter and teaching strategies       combined with clinical training. Finland has no alternative       prep programs. Programs are highly selective and free of       cost; their graduates go on to work in supportive,       professional environments with strong unions, fair pay and       benefits, and without high-stakes testing.''                                   ____                                              Office of the Provost,                                             Creighton University                                        Omaha, NE, February 2, 2015.      Re Docket ID ED-2014-OPE-0057.       Hon. Arne Duncan,      Secretary, U.S. Department of Education,      Washington, DC.        Dear Secretary Duncan: We would like to introduce       ourselves. Our names are Edward  [[Page S1665]]       O'Connor, Provost, and Debra L. Ponec, Professor and Chair in       the Education Department at Creighton University, which is       located in Omaha, Nebraska. We are responding to the U.S.       Department of Education's proposed regulations for teacher       preparation programs released in the Notice of Proposed Rule       Making (NPRM) on December 3, 2014.        Like other teacher preparation programs in institutions of       higher education throughout the nation, the Education       Department at Creighton University embraces accountability       for our work. The faculty are eager to learn more about the       effectiveness of our graduates and seek continual program       improvement to ensure their profession-readiness in the       classroom. Our preparation programs currently employ       accountability mechanisms such as these:        National and state accreditation        Praxis II testing        Survey data from graduates and employers        Feedback from PK-12 school partners and Advisory Boards        Continuous Review of Programs        The institution's teacher preparation programs also undergo       continual reform influenced by the effective practice,       feedback from our K-12 partners, local and national workforce       demands, new requirements from our legislature and state, new       professional standards for preparation, and funding to       support new initiatives. The Education Department at       Creighton University has developed partnerships with public       and private schools where instruction and clinical practice       are on-site; integrated ``best practices'' into evidence-      based teacher preparation; placed students in high need,       diverse settings for clinical practice throughout the       program; and provided data on the impact of our programs on       our website. Our programs have a documented high placement       and retention rate for our graduates. Our teacher preparation       program actively supports accountability mechanisms that are       fair, transparent, valid, reliable, feasible, and useful for       program improvement. The proposed regulations initiated by       the U. S. Department of Education do not meet these criteria.        Overall, if these proposed regulations were adopted, they       would draw energy, funding, and attention away from       innovative reforms, proven accountability initiatives, and       overall program improvement currently under way in teacher       preparation programs across the country. Some of the specific       areas of concern are as follows:        The specific requirements outlined in the proposal usurp       the rights of the state and higher education institutions to       determine what indicators identify proficiency of teacher       education graduates and their preparation programs. This       unfunded mandate represents a significant financial burden to       institutions, local school systems, and states. The costs of       implementing these regulations have been woefully       underestimated with the understanding that no federal funding       would be available to move the proposed regulations forward.       The proposed regulations require data systems to track and       report on teacher education candidate effectiveness for       multiple years. Many states do not possess the technology       capacity to develop highly sophisticated data collection       systems which will collect, analyze, report, and utilize this       data in a meaningful manner.        The proposed regulations have generally not been tested for       validity and reliability, and attaching high-stakes       consequences at this point is of significant concern. For       example, using PK-12 student academic achievement and growth       to evaluate teacher performance is questioned by leading       research organizations and education scholars as having       questionable validity and reliability for making teacher       effectiveness decisions. Utilizing this approach of       evaluating teacher performance to his/her teacher preparation       institution is an even weaker link given the largely unknown       impacts such as implications of time and place of employment       and teacher preparation influence. The lack of a       scientifically acceptable basis for using student achievement       as a rating for program performance, even if the cost and       burden were low, makes this indicator unreasonable. In       addition, evidence that ACT/SAT/GPA scores are a reliable       indicator of teacher effectiveness is equally questionable.       Capstone assessments, which are being implemented in very       limited ways are still inconclusive in their outcomes as       measuring teacher quality.        As stated earlier, the regulations represent a significant       financial burden to institutions, local school systems, and       states. In the state of Nebraska, there are over 500       individual teacher preparation `programs' subject to the       complexities of these regulations. Even as a system is       developed issues regarding privacy, low numbers, and student       demographics would impact results unfairly and result in       decisions unlikely to improve teacher preparation programs       and student learning at PK-12 schools.        The regulations focus on placement, retention, and       performance with PK-12 students has significant potential to       become a disincentive to encourage candidates to seek       placements in areas of high-need. This ideal conflicts with       our mission statement and preparation which seeks to lead       students to work with the underrepresented, disenfranchised,       and poor. Our teacher preparation candidates are well-      prepared, however, the potential of a teacher preparation       program being rated on test scores of high-needs students       will cause any institution pause. With lack of control of the       experience of the teachers once employed and no assurance of       resources to provide the supports for candidates in high-need       schools, it is unreasonable to compare these candidates with       candidates in non high-need situations.        The proposed timeline is unreasonable and unrealistic.       Those states piloting connecting teacher effectiveness to       student achievement are still under development and are       experiencing many ethical and legal challenges as they seek       to implement the requirements. Attaching outcomes to national       accreditation is also problematic in that the new CAEP       accreditation standards are not fully implemented and       accreditation processes using the new standards will not       officially be required until the Fall of 2016. The timeline       presented in the proposed regulations would include piloting       additional reporting requirements for the 2016-17 academic       year which is unrealistic to meet significantly increased       reporting elements, creation of new data systems, delivery of       in-service and technical assistance systems for institutions       and schools, and lack of new resources with which to       accomplish the unfunded mandates.        The proposed regulations do not consider or support the       philosophy that quality education requires a systemic       approach. Factors such as student demographics, preschool       learning opportunities, poverty and other social factors are       not controlled by PK-12 schools or teacher preparation       experiences. Other quality indicators such as equitable       funding, strong curriculum standards, focus on providing       opportunity--access--success for all students, and quality       assessment which all contribute to PK-12 student learning are       not controlled by teacher preparation programs. Therefore       equating PK-12 student performance to the quality of a       teacher preparation program is unfair and unreasonable.       However, dedication to strong commitments and collaborative       partnerships by educator preparation programs and school       systems impact the development of exemplary educators for the       future.

Re Comments Regarding Proposed Regulations, 34 CFR Parts 612           and 686; Teacher Preparation Issues.       Sophia McArdle,      U.S. Department of Education,      Washington, DC.        Dear Ms. McArdle: I am writing as the representative of the       private, non-profit, regionally accredited colleges and       universities in Nebraska with teacher education programs.       While we laud the US Department of Education in its efforts       to improve the quality of K-12 and higher education in the       United States, we believe there are portions of the proposed       regulation that are troubling to our institutions.        First, Nebraska is a state that prides itself on local       control in education matters. Despite the rhetoric about       allowing states to use their own measures of student growth,       this proposed regulation mandates states that do not already       use value-added measures of student learning in their teacher       assessments to do so. It provides for federally-mandated       state indicators of quality for teacher preparation program       assessments. This is a significant expansion of the federal       role in its oversight of the states' responsibility for the       education of its young people, and is inappropriate.        Second, the budgetary impact of this regulation is       significantly understated, if not laughable. No financial       support for states, school systems, or institutions of higher       education to implement the requirements is proposed. The       regulations create requirements for colleges, schools, and       states to track and report on candidates and teachers for       many years. Those systems are not in place. The cost       estimates make inaccurate assumptions that colleges and       states already have the systems in place for collecting,       analyzing, reporting, and utilizing data (federally-mandated       data which may or may not be valid or reliable for the       purposes for which it is intended to be used). It also       provides a timeline that is unworkable for most states and       institutions.        The January 2, 2015 letter from the American Council of       Education and twenty-three other association signatories to       the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs points out       the significant understatement of OMB's estimate of the costs       of implementing the proposed regulation by states and IHE's.       Most of the teacher preparation programs that I represent are       very small, and the impact on them will be disproportionately       large from a cost standpoint. The Department cannot talk       about tuition containment from one side of its mouth and take       actions that will exacerbate tuition hikes out of the other       side.        Third, while teacher preparation is one factor in secondary       student performance, it is not the only factor. Demographics,       family income, school facilities, parental support, and other       non-preparation issues have impacts on student performance.       This proposed  [[Page S1666]]       regulation may have unintended consequences that the USDOE       should consider. Why would an IHE place a first-year student       in a ``troubled'' school district or building, where he or       she might be less likely to continue in a teaching career,       when a ``safer'' placement would make that continuance more       likely? Ergo, a higher rating for the IHE, the students in       the program would not be at risk to lose Title IV funds or       Teach Grants, and other positives for the college. On the       other hand, a school district or building might lose the       services of an outstanding first-year teacher which it really       needs.        Finally, attributing financial aid-eligibility on       institutional ratings based on research that may or may not       be valid is irresponsible and bad public policy. It will       hinder enrollment to students who could become outstanding       teachers, but may have to overcome hurdles in order to do so.       This regulation will give IHE's less incentive to enroll       those types of students.        For these reasons, we believe the proposed regulations       should be reconsidered and a new negotiated rulemaking       convened, with proposed regulations that take into account       the myriad of comments received by the USDOE from states,       institutions of higher education, and associations relating       to these proposed regulations. Thank you for your       consideration.
