 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). Is the gentleman opposed  to the bill?    I am opposed in its current form.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Mr. Kihuen moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1259 to the       Committee on Veterans' Affairs with instructions to report       the same back to the House forthwith, with the following       amendments:        Page 8, line 19, insert ``or an individual who makes a       whistleblower disclosure to the central whistleblower office,       including anonymous whistleblower disclosures made through a       toll-free telephone number or Internet website'' after       ``Special Counsel''.        Add at the end the following new section:       SEC. 10. TREATMENT OF VETERANS, MEMBERS OF UNIFORMED                     SERVICES, AND WHISTLEBLOWERS.         The amendments made by sections 3 and 9 of this Act shall       not apply to any individual who is--        (1) preference eligible under section 2108(3) of title 5,       United States Code;        (2) a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has       performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to       perform service in a uniformed service (as such term is       defined in section 4303(16) of title 38, United States Code);       or        (3) seeking corrective action (or on behalf of whom       corrective action is sought) from the Office of Special       Counsel based on an alleged prohibited personnel practice       described in section 2302(b) of title 5, United States Code.    Mr. ROE of Tennessee (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask  unanimous consent to suspend with the reading.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Tennessee?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Nevada is recognized for  5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill,  which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,  the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, as a nation, we have the moral responsibility for  providing for the men and women who have served our country. One of my  highest priorities in Congress is ensuring that our veterans receive  the care and benefit they have earned.   It has been almost 3 years since a whistleblower shocked the Nation  by disclosing 1,400 veterans languish without care at the Phoenix VA.  Since then, many others have come forward to report excessive wait  times, substandard care, and dirty facilities in VA hospitals all  across the country.  [[Page H2134]]    The issues we have seen at different VA hospitals have been  completely disgraceful. However, what is even more shocking is that  many of these whistleblowers have reported some sort of retaliation  from hospital directors or the VA's Office of Inspector General, even  though Federal law specifically prohibits harassment or retaliation of  Federal employees who bring wrongdoing to light.   The recent reports about VA employees facing retaliation is  disheartening and it is unacceptable. We need to protect these  employees who are trying to ensure that the VA is transparent and  accountable to all of our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, my amendment is very simple and commonsense. It merely  builds upon existing language in the bill seeking to protect  whistleblowers.   Under the bill, a whistleblower can still be fired during the  expedited procedure with limited recourse. This amendment would close  that loophole.   This amendment would also cover those who come forward to a central  whistleblower office instead of just a special counsel.   And, as my colleagues have noted numerous times on the floor today,  one-third of our VA employees are veterans. This amendment also works  to protect them from unjust firings without due process.   We should never tolerate fraud, waste, or abuse on our Federal  agencies. This is especially true when it comes to caring for our  Nation's veterans. The brave men and women who have put their lives on  the line should be provided with the best quality of care, and it is  imperative that the whistleblowers who have stood up to protect our  veterans should be fully protected from retaliation.   We should provide whistleblowers with the confidence to step up and  help make a change. Helping improve our veterans' health care is  dependent in part on the encouragement and protection of whistleblowers  within the VA.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I say this. No one in this body wants to  vote on a bill that may give potential whistleblowers doubt about  coming forward. Let's give them the assurance they deserve by voting  for this motion to recommit, which will strengthen the whistleblower  protection language in the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule  XX, this 5-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5- minute votes on passage of the bill, if ordered, and passage of H.R.  1181.
