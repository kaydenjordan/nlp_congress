 Mr. Speaker, when Democrats were in the majority, we passed  a bipartisan law to rebuild our roads, bridges, and highways. We passed  a bipartisan law to make sure that our schools remained open. We passed  a bipartisan law to bring manufacturing back to the United States, and  we passed a bipartisan law to help our Nation's veterans. Unemployment  is now at the lowest rate in over 50 years.   Republicans gained control of the majority last month. What is one of  the first things that they did? They held a hearing on Twitter.   Let me repeat that again. House Republicans used the awesome power of  the Federal Government, the committee staff resources, and the time and  attention of their Members to hold a congressional hearing about  Twitter.                            ____________________
