 Mr. Speaker, let's make this clear. The Un-American Health  Care Act doesn't just repeal advances with ObamaCare, it takes us  backward to a point worse off than we were before the Affordable Care  Act.   It guts Medicaid, and will fail to meet existing needs, hurting  vulnerable children, pregnant women, people with disabilities, and  seniors needing long-term care, hurting them all.   It abandons Planned Parenthood services. Women with nowhere else to  turn will lose access to critical services like pelvic exams and pap  tests.   I am here today speaking on behalf of single mom Sherry, cancer  survivor Marty, star student Kelty, and little Gracie and her devoted  grandmother Donna.   We are all one voice saying we cannot afford to make the American  healthcare system even worse than it was before ObamaCare. That is the  path the un-American Health Care Act will carve. My friends, let's not  go down that path. Vote ``no.''                            ____________________
