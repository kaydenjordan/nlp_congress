 Madam Speaker, as chair of the  Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, I rise to reject white  nationalism and white supremacy. These philosophies divide us, teach  fear, and lead to violence. They are to blame for the worst of American  history, from slavery and Jim Crow to the fatal shooting of Sikhs at an  Oak Creek gurdwara and Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue.   White nationalism led to the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act,  forcing Chinese immigrants like my grandfather to be condemned to life  as a second-class citizen. But today, his granddaughter stands here as  the first Chinese American woman in Congress.   I am not alone. This is the most diverse and representative Congress  in our history.   The message is clear: diversity has a place in Congress, prejudice  does not.   But white nationalism is finding a home in politics once again  through racist rhetoric and xenophobic misinformation aimed at  immigrants and others. Any attempt by politicians at any level to  encourage fear of those who look different must be rejected.    Madam Speaker, I urge support for this resolution.
