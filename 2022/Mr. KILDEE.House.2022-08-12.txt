 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Inflation Reduction  Act to help fight inflation and lower costs for the Michigan families  and seniors that I represent.   With this bill, we will be able to lower healthcare costs for  Michigan families and seniors. This bill will allow Medicare to  negotiate the cost of prescription drugs, including capping the cost of  insulin for seniors at $35 a month.   With this bill, we will create good-paying jobs to combat the climate  crisis. This bill will invest in domestic clean energy production and  manufacturing facilities to lower costs. It will support making solar  panels at companies like Hemlock Semiconductor and electric vehicles in  Michigan, not in China.   With this bill, which is fully paid for, we will ensure the biggest  corporations and the wealthiest individuals pay their fair share of  taxes. Right now, 55 of the Nation's biggest corporations pay zero in  Federal taxes while making billions in profits. A Flint nurse, a  Saginaw farmer, or a Bay City teacher should not pay more in taxes than  the largest, wealthiest, most profitable corporations.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation.
