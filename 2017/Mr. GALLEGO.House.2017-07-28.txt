 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak in favor of the Global War on  Terrorism War Memorial Act. This act will initiate the process for  constructing a memorial to the brave men and women of the Armed Forces  who have fought and, too often, died for this country in the wake of  the September 11 attacks.   As a veteran of the Iraq war, I am extremely proud to be on the floor  today as we memorialize the bravest and best of Americans: the ones who  volunteered to put themselves in harm's way and did not come back.   I want to commend my fellow Marines, Mr. Moulton and Mr. Gallagher,  for sponsoring this act. As you know, Mr. Speaker, it takes a lot for  an enlisted marine like me to speak very highly of any officer, let  alone Marine Corps officers, but there are always exceptions.   Mr. Speaker, as we consider this legislation, I hope every Member of  this body will take a quiet moment today to think about the courageous  men and women we have lost over the past 16 years. When I cast my vote  today, I know I will be thinking about my close friends, including  Corporal Andre Williams and Lance Corporal Christopher Lyons, who died  12 years ago today in Cykla, Iraq.   This memorial will honor thousands of our countrymen who have been  killed and wounded in Iraq and around the world. It will memorialize  the service of those who have survived the battle only to fall victim  to the mental and emotional demons of post-traumatic stress. And it  will represent a token of thanks to the family and friends who have  served by supporting their loved ones in uniform.  [[Page H6545]]                                     time  1130    For as long as this memorial stands, it will continue the proud  tradition of America honoring its sons and daughters who have given  their last full measure of devotion.   I look forward to commencing design and to the day when the memorial  passes from an idea on a piece of paper to a landmark on the National  Mall.   I thank Congressman Moulton and Congressman Gallagher for their  remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Gallagher), the author of this  measure, one of the many thousands of Americans who stepped forward to  answer their country's call.   Mr. Gallagher. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership  on this issue, for working with us, and I ask that he please extend our  thanks to every member of the Natural Resources Committee for its  effort in getting this bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank the gentleman from Arizona for his words  and for his service. It is my honor to call him my fellow marine. As an  officer, I did my best just not to get in the way of my enlisted  marines, who were doing the real work. Maybe we can bring some of that  same ethos here to Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bill that honors  our post-9/11 veterans and secures their rightful place in our Nation's  Capital.   Earlier this summer, I had the honor of welcoming a group of American  heroes who journeyed from northeast Wisconsin to Washington, D.C.,  aboard the Old Glory Honor Flight. That is one of the truly incredible  things we get to do as Members of Congress.   Just to watch generation after generation of veterans representing  every major conflict since World War II visiting the very memorials  that honor their sacrifice, their service, their commitment, their  courage in those conflicts was one of the most remarkable experiences  of my life.   Just as these veterans visited their respective memorials, so, too,  should the brave men and women who have served and continue to serve in  the ongoing war on terrorism have a memorial one day to honor their  courage, their sacrifice, their commitment. But as the chairman laid  out, current law does not allow for the creation for a memorial for the  war on terror.   The 1986 Commemorative Works Act requires that monuments in honor of  a ``. . . limited military engagement or a unit of an armed force may  not be authorized . . . until at least 10 years after the officially  designated end of such war or conflict.''   But as we know, this is a conflict unlike many others that have  preceded it. This war will have no clear end date, no V Day or V-J Day.  Threats continue to rise, so the longest ongoing conflict in our  Nation's history continues. After 15 years, after over 6,800 American  lives lost, there is still no end in sight.   So this memorial is for the men and women who have died fighting,  those who continue to fight, those who are still joining the fight  against terrorism.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to take a second to recognize the dedicated  members of the Global War on Terrorism Memorial Foundation, many of  whom are with us here today, especially Andrew Brennan, George  Chewning, Chad Longell, and Matt Gannon. They have been tireless in  their commitment to getting this done. Today we are taking an important  step forward, but we still need to get it across the finish line, so I  want to recognize their efforts.   I just want to say, Mr. Speaker, like most, I struggle with how to  truly honor the men and women whose sacrifices far exceed my own. I was  lucky. I had great marines that kept me safe, and we all came home  safe. But my hope is that this memorial will serve as not only a way to  honor those who paid the ultimate sacrifices, but also as a call to  action for us, the living.   I believe that those we will pay tribute to through this memorial  didn't risk everything just so we would sit back and praise them for  keeping us safe. I would submit to you that the fallen don't want our  praise. They want our participation in this incredible experiment in  self-government.   If we are going to continue passing the torch of democracy from one  generation to the next, then we need to build this memorial so that  future generations never forget their duty to do the same, so that  future generations never forget the cost of liberty.   Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to support this legislation to  memorialize the service of the brave men and women who have fought in  the global war on terrorism.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak in favor of the Global War on  Terrorism War Memorial Act.

Again, I thank Congressman Gallagher, Congressman Moulton, and all of  the veterans who have sponsored this bill in remembrance of our  brothers and sisters from the global war on terrorism.   I would like to speak a couple more minutes just because I rarely  have the opportunity to speak about the guys that I served with. It was  a group called Lima 325 out of Ohio. It was one of the best groups of  men who I probably have ever met. We were nice young men from New  Mexico that were suddenly added to these country boys and city boys  from Ohio and sent to the middle of nowhere, Iraq. And from there, we  saw a lot of combat. We lost a lot of friends.   In section 60, many of us veterans have this tradition where we go  and we put our quarters on the headstones of the men we served with.  And I, unfortunately, have to put down a lot of quarters.   But one of the things that I will always remember is that this unit,  Lima 325, really brought people from all walks of life in America. You  had African Americans, you had country boys from Ohio, you had Navajo  from the Navajo Nation and other parts of our Tribal Nations, you had  Latinos.   We even taught some of the Ohio boys how to cook since they don't  really have good taste. We introduced them to the idea of green chili,  which I have heard has now taken off in Oliver, Ohio. And we lived  together for 7 months, going from house to house, from hole to hole.  And even today, though many of us cannot see each other, we still live  with each other in our spirits and in our souls.  [[Page H6547]]    These types of memorials matter. For many of us, this generation is  not the generation that served together on a base. Many of us actually  served from different parts of the world. We dropped our jobs and what  we were doing, our school sometimes, to join in, leave our families,  leave the comfort and safety of the United States to go and defend what  we believed was important to this country and to honor our commitment.   Sometimes it is these types of memorials that are the only thing that  actually bring us together. I recently was lucky enough to have my 10- year reunion with the guys from Lima Company, and that is the first  time I had seen many men that I had lived with for so long. It was a  very inspiring as well as moving, and really consoling thing for me.   I believe that having a memorial of this nature would be extremely  important for many men and women to be able to see, to be able to come  and maybe not necessarily physically meet with their partners, with  their comrades, but to at least be able to spiritually have a place to  meet with their comrades, with the people that they served with in  arms.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   With this vote, we will begin proceeding on this memorial and begin a  process of planning a great work to honor the bravery, sacrifice, and  patriotism to those who have defended Western civilization from the  medieval barbarism that has reappeared in our time.   But even more importantly, we begin work on a tangible promise for  future generations, a promise animated by the heroic deeds of these  veterans, the promise of a coming age of liberty and justice, of peace  and tolerance that will surely come. I ask for adoption of this  measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 873.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first of all, my experience with the  Affordable Care Act actually comes from the State legislature, where,  in a bipartisan manner, the Republican governor joined with the  minority Democrats and a handful of Republicans in the Senate State  House to pass Medicaid expansion.   Why did we do that?   If you looked at what was happening in Arizona, it was some of the  Trump areas, as I like to call them, these rural districts where the  rural hospitals, which are not only the medically necessary  infrastructure of the area but also the economic drivers, the only  high-wage employers in the area, they were about to shut down.   There was so much uncompensated cost, because people were using the  emergency room as their primary care doctor, that these hospitals were  starting to have to charge more and insurance companies were starting  to refuse to pay more for their premiums, that they needed to respond  to that.   In the end, what we started hearing from these hospitals is that we  are going to have to shut down the emergency room, and if you have an  emergency, we are going to have to helicopter you either to Tucson or  Phoenix.   Now, for many of you guys who are not Southwesterners like us in the  Southwest, we have a lot of territory and a lot of land. For you to  just drive to Phoenix for emergency care would be pretty insane, let  alone the expense of helicoptering into Phoenix was even more so than  that.   Because we had the goal of actually increasing and improving our  healthcare outcomes, we worked again in a bipartisan manner with  Governor Brewer, with Republicans and Democrats to pass one of the most  comprehensive Medicaid expansion bills in the country that has actually  turned around, lowered costs, created better healthcare outcomes, and  has now insured more than 400,000 poor Arizonans that did not have it  before, including people in the disability community, as well as  children.                                time  1315    To counteract what we saw today, if it wasn't really for the bravery  of Senator Murkowski, Senator Collins, and Senator McCain, as well as  all of the Senate Democrats, what we would have seen would have been a  bill that would not only have just rolled back the millions of people  who are now covered with health insurance, but it would also have been  detrimental to the people who currently have even private health  insurance.   Premiums were going to go up for everybody. The estimated amount of  people just on the so-called skinny bill that were going to lose health  insurance would be 16 million people, and on the House bill it was  going to be 23 million people, in addition to the essential gutting of  Medicaid, all for giving a tax cut to the top 1 percent.   Now, this is bad policy, but it is worse policy when you don't have  an open process to it, when you seek it through the middle of the  night, hoping that the American public is just going to accept what  comes out.   There is a reason why TrumpCare was polling less than Congress, and  trust me, it is very difficult to poll less than Congress. At this  point, it is just our families that like us.   Mr. TED LIEU of California. I like you.    I like you, too, Ted. You are a good man.   But the fact that we the American public knew so little, just knew  enough, and said this bill is bad and were able to come out and put  pressure on our Senators and our Members of Congress with public  hearings and townhalls was key to stopping this.   Lastly, before I move back to Ted, if you are so proud of this bill,  if you are the Senate Republicans and you are so proud of this bill, if  you are Donald Trump and you are so proud of this bill, even our House  colleagues, why didn't you have consistent townhalls? Why didn't you go  out there and explain to people what you were planning to do and why  this is better for America?   Instead, they tried to hide it. They tried to move it as fast as  possible, and then tried to schedule a vote in the middle of the night.  If you have to vote for something in the middle of the night, it means  you are not very confident and you are not very proud of that bill.   So what is the solution now? Nobody in the Democratic Caucus thinks  the Affordable Care Act--or ObamaCare, as some people call it--is the  be-all and end-all. We don't think it is perfect. We certainly think  that there is a great bipartisan approach we can take to make it  better. And what I mean by ``better'' is more coverage, lower premiums,  and better healthcare outcomes.   When I use those words, those were almost exactly, word for word,  what Donald Trump said he wanted to see happen when he was going to  replace the Affordable Care Act.   But, point by point, whether it was the bill that came through the  House or the bill that came through the Senate, none of those would  have even fit Donald Trump's mandate. Which is why, at the end of the  day, that bill was radioactive. Nobody liked it, and they had to hide  it.   So what we should do is follow the advice of Senator McCain in  Arizona, follow the example of Senators Murkowski and Collins and all  of the Senate Democrats: get back to regular order and work out an  actual fix to the Affordable Care Act and get Americans more coverage,  lower premiums, and better healthcare outcomes.   I say that also as someone who is on an ObamaCare plan. I am not  exempt from it, and neither is Mr. Lieu. We are in it just as much as  everyone else is, and we want to see it fixed.   Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, Representative Gallego and I  both served on Active Duty in the United States military. Before we  could do that, we had to take an oath to the Constitution. That is the  same oath that Members of Congress take, and it is also an oath that  members of the executive branch take.   Under the Constitution, Congress passes the laws. ObamaCare is the  law of the land. Under the Constitution, the President has a duty to  enforce those laws.   Today, the President tweeted that he wants ObamaCare to implode. Not  only is that mean, mean, mean, it is also a dereliction of duty. The  job of the President is to help Americans, not hurt millions of  Americans out of spite.   Let me give you an example of what it was like before ObamaCare.   I was at a restaurant and a waitress came up to me. She knew I was a  legislator. I was in the State legislature at the time, and she wanted  help. Her daughter had just turned 18, and, in California, where I am  from, you cannot get government health insurance if you don't have any  minor children. So  [[Page H6563]]  she lost her government health insurance.   She was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. She tried to get  private insurance. None of them would cover her. And I realized that  she is now going to slowly die because she could not get health  insurance coverage.   She could not go into an emergency room and get treatment because her  breast cancer had not progressed to that point. But one day she is  going to get to that point. She will go to an emergency room; she will  get treated for a few days; and then she will die. And I thought, in a  country as great as America, that should never be happening.   Now that the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land, you cannot  be discriminated against because of your preexisting conditions. There  are some incredibly amazing elements of this law. That is why the  Republicans could not repeal it. Because the American people, after  looking at it for 7 years, the majority said, you know, this is a  pretty good deal. Is it the best deal? No. We could definitely make it  better.   Mr. Speaker, Representative Gallego and I are offering to the  Republicans and Speaker Ryan to engage in bipartisanship. The one thing  we are asking the Speaker to do is to not enable the President to  sabotage the Affordable Care Act. Not only is that wrong, but it would  be enabling his dereliction of duty, and it will cause millions of  Americans to suffer greatly just out of spite.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego).    Mr. Speaker, if you want to hear some ideas--and I think  it is important that instead of just us knocking what was introduced,  we could also give some ideas--certainly, for me, and I think I am also  speaking for Ted Lieu, we would prefer to have Medicare for all, so  people have a stable insurance, a system that we know works, a system  that actually brings down costs. But if we can't do that, there are  many things we can do in the meantime.   Why not drop the age of Medicare eligibility to 55? If you do that,  you are going to also decrease premiums for people who are not on  Medicare, people who are just buying private health insurance. You  could be on Medicare at 55 and still be working.   What about for those counties that don't have private insurers on the  subsidized market? They should be able to buy into the Federal health  insurance plans of all of the workers who live in those districts, or  buy into the plans that Ted and I have. Why can't we let them do that?   Why not cover every U.S. citizen up until the age of 18 under  Medicaid to relieve the parents of that burden?   We can also start looking at community health centers, reinforcing  those to make sure that we are taking the poorest of the poor who  actually cost the most when it comes to healthcare costs and, instead  of forcing them into a hospital or into a primary care situation, they  could get consistent care without putting a burden on the overall  medical system.   There are tons of ideas that we could be working on with our  colleagues that will, again, fulfill President Trump's goal of lower  costs, lower premiums, and better healthcare outcomes. So this doesn't  have to be a static situation. This doesn't have to be an either/or.   President Trump is making it sound like, because we did not pass his  idea of reform, we must collapse the whole system. That is unnecessary,  that is irresponsible, and that is not how adult people that legislate  act.   You can fix this. We can fix this so more people can have healthcare  coverage, more people can have that security that they are going to  always have health insurance so they can go and start a business and  know they are going to have health insurance, know that they can send  their kid to college and they are still going to have health insurance,  know that they can retire knowing that they have been healthy the whole  time and they are going to have a good, dignified retirement because we  had made sure that we established a good healthcare system from the  time they were born until the time they retire.   This is possible. This is possible.   Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, the House of  Representatives is going to go on recess in August. Now is the time for  millions of people across America to contact their Member, ask them to  hold townhalls, ask them to explain their vote on the awful TrumpCare  legislation that passed the House, and ask them to now work with  Democrats and work on a bipartisan basis to improve ObamaCare. Now is  the time for millions of Americans to speak up. They have the entire  month of August to contact their Member of Congress, and I urge them to  do so.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego).    Mr. Speaker, lastly, I will close with this. If you were  one of those Members of Congress, if you are a Republican Senator or a  Republican Member of Congress who voted to gut the Affordable Care Act,  there is time. There is a way to come back from that really bad  decision. You can turn around and start working for the betterment of  this country by trying to fix the Affordable Care Act.   The American public will look kindly upon those legislators who are  here to work in a bipartisan manner to, again, lower costs, lower  premiums, and provide more coverage and better healthcare outcomes.  There is time to do this. But there is not time for more opportunities  to gut this, for more time to kick people off Medicaid, or for more  time to create some kind of situation that is only go to raise  premiums.   If we allow Trump to actually, in his words, make the whole thing  fail, it is not ObamaCare that fails, it is not the Affordable Care Act  that fails--it is the American people that fail. He is playing a game  with the lives of the American people.   What he is going to do is he is going to cause millions of people to  either lose their insurance because insurance companies are going to  have to start shedding people, or premiums are going to end up going up  because, if he creates instability in the market, these insurance  companies are going to try to recoup their costs somehow, and it is  going to discourage younger individuals from actually coming on and  buying into the ObamaCare insurance pool, which, again, will raise  premiums. This is unnecessary.   Mr. Speaker, for those Members of Congress and those Senators who  want to work with us, the first step is to encourage and stop the  President from sabotaging the Affordable Care Act and to work  diligently in a bipartisan manner to fix the Affordable Care Act and  cover more people.   Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.                            ____________________
