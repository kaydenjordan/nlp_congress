 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Chazito's Latin Cuisine, a restaurant in Pooler, Georgia, for being  featured on Guy Fieri's hit show ``Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.''   The owner of the restaurant, Chaz Ortiz, came to Savannah over 10  years ago and has been bringing Puerto Rican culture and flavor to our  district ever since.   Chaz's restaurant, which takes traditional family recipes and puts a  twist on them, has been a crowd favorite at local venues like the  Doggie Carnival Festival in Forsyth Park for years.   In 2016, the restaurant grew from a fleet of two food trucks to a  fully functioning brick-and-mortar store, demonstrating the success of  small businesses in Savannah and the growth hard work and patience  brings.   Chazito's honor marks the second time a restaurant from coastal  Georgia has been featured on Guy Fieri's show. The first was on Tybee  Island.   Madam Speaker, I am extremely proud of Chaz, his entire staff, and  the business he and his family have grown.                            ____________________
