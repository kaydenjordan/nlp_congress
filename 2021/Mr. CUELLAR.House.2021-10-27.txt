 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Jackson Lee  for her leadership in this effort to make sure that we protect not only  other diplomats, but our agents that work overseas. I also want to  thank Mr.   Michael McCaul, one of my co-leads on this, Mr. Bill  Pascrell, Mr. Filemon Vela, and other Members, all bipartisan, that  support this.   On the Senate side, the lead sponsors were Senator John Cornyn and  also Senator Chris Coons, and a whole bunch of other folks. I certainly  want to say thank you so much.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is important because this is a  bipartisan bill, and it ensures that individuals who harm or attempt to  harm U.S. Federal officers or employees serving abroad can be brought  to justice and prosecuted in the United States.   Furthermore, this bill will improve the safety and the security of  not only the agents but any diplomat or any Federal employee that works  outside the U.S. or overseas by ensuring that crimes that are committed  against Americans serving abroad can be prosecuted by United States  courts.                                time  1300    As the chairwoman mentioned a few minutes ago, it was very  unfortunate what happened, and it is a change on the--we want to make  sure that the intent of the law that has been there will be followed,  and that basically just means that that section 1114 of the United  States Code would say that it also covers foreign jurisdiction. So,  therefore, we ask that we support this legislation because as it was  mentioned, on February 15, 2011, ICE Special Agent Jaime Zapata and  also his colleague, Victor Avila, were ambushed by members of the  Mexican drug cartels in San Luis Potosi, Mexico.   Unfortunately, as it has been mentioned, Special Agent Zapata died  because of his injuries. ICE Special Agent Jaime Zapata's murderer  cannot be brought to justice because of that loophole in the current  law, and this bipartisan legislation will close that loophole and  ensure that the safety of all Federal employees serving our Nation  abroad will be protected.   There must be severe consequences brought to bear against any  individual who harms any of the Federal employees who are serving  abroad. We need to know that the heroism of Special Agent Zapata and  also Special Agent Avila, by holding those people who committed  violence, are held accountable.   Furthermore, this issue and this bill is also important to me because  Special Agent Zapata was assigned to the Homeland Security  Investigations Office located in my hometown, Laredo, Texas, while he  served on the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Unit as well as the  Border Enforcement Security Task Force known as BEST.   So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation.
