 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life and memory of  Robert Denzel Jones, Jr., a resident of Texas' Seventh Congressional  District, where he served his neighbors and our community as a United  States letter carrier.   His commitment to going above and beyond earned him the nickname  ``Super Postman'' as his radiant smile and diligent work impacted  people he met on the job.   Tragically, he was killed in a hit-and-run accident while he was  working to make sure the U.S. mail was delivered.   The work that Robert and letter carriers like him do in our community  is critically important, whether it is connecting loved ones with  letters or delivering essential packages.   He was not only an outstanding letter carrier, he was an exceptional  father to his daughter, Rylee Love Jones; a loving partner to J'La  Anderson; and a beloved son to his proud parents, Robert and Felicia  Jones.   That is how he will be remembered, as he should be: a father, a son,  a partner, a super postman, and a beloved member of our community.  [[Page H5933]]    May his memory be a blessing and may his service be an example to us  all.                            ____________________
