 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 80.    Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple in that it would  improve the transparency of the process around the development of the  plan required in the underlying bill.   Like other regulatory processes where public input is required, my  amendment would require the Secretary to provide for an opportunity for  at least a 90-day public comment period on the plan.   If Congress is going to open up more Federal land for oil and gas  production, we must hear from the communities and stakeholders that  would be affected by most of these projects. This amendment simply  gives an opportunity for the public to offer their views and knowledge  for the Secretary to consider in the formation of any plan.   Oil and gas drilling can be a terribly destructive process for the  environment and the communities around these drilling sites. The  individuals and families who must live near drilling sites are forced  to experience the harsh day-to-day realities of air and water quality  impacts, which can lead to increased risks of developing asthma,  respiratory disease, cancer, and other harmful side effects.   If the Secretary is going to recommend a plan to expand more  drilling, then we should hear from experts,  [[Page H417]]  stakeholders, and others who have a vested interest and allow them to  participate openly and honestly in the process.   This is a simple, good-governance amendment. We are elected to  Congress by the people, and it is the people who are affected who  deserve a say in what happens in their communities.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 81.    Mr. Chair, my amendment would require the Secretary to  consider the current number of inactive but approved Federal oil and  gas leases and permits to drill in the development of any proposed  plan. My amendment is vital to fully capturing the scope of unused oil  and gas leases and permits to drill on Federal lands that companies are  choosing not to utilize.   There are currently over 9,000 approved permits to drill on Federal  land, yet my Republican colleagues want to open up even more Federal  lands and approve additional permits to drill. The underlying bill is  merely a politically motivated effort to undermine this  administration's ability to tap into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  while opening up more Federal lands to exploitation by private-sector  interests.   Before the Secretary can draft any plan that proposes expanded  drilling on Federal lands, I believe it is important that it consider  all information relevant to such a plan, and that includes how many  leases and permits are already approved but left inactive.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 82.    Mr. Chair, the United States is at the forefront of clean  energy development and clean energy deployment globally. Not only are  we developing countless private renewable energy projects across the  country, but we have hundreds more wind, solar, and geothermal projects  on Federal lands, with many more on the way.   If we are to remain a global leader in renewable energy deployment,  then we should ensure any new oil and gas drilling does not impede the  rapid deployment of renewable energy projects that are so critical to  our energy independence and security.   Before we consider approving even more land for outdated and highly  polluting forms of energy, we must continue on our march into the  future and invest in renewable energy projects, not just on Federal  lands but in every community that stands to benefit from these  projects.   My amendment would require the Secretary to not only certify that  increased oil and gas drilling on Federal lands will not negatively  impact renewable energy project development but also prohibit the  inclusion of any recommendations to expand such drilling in this plan  if it would do so.   Yes, we must make gas affordable at the pump, but the President of  the United States has already helped lower prices for the American  people by drawing down the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. In fact, the  underlying legislation would create additional barriers to keeping gas  prices low.   The answer is not more drilling. The answer is to invest in renewable  energy and to make these new technologies more affordable for everyday  Americans.   If we want to keep the United States from falling second to China in  the deployment of renewable energy projects, then we should be taking  every reasonable step to continue their deployment. My amendment would  do just that by ensuring the plan required in the underlying bill  mitigates any impacts to renewable energy projects on Federal lands.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.                                Point of Order     Mr. Chair, I respectfully reject the point of order  against my amendment. Adding limitations to the scope of the existing  plan required in paragraph 1 falls squarely within the jurisdiction of  the base text and the legislative intent of the bill.
