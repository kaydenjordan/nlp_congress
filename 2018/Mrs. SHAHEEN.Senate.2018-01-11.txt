 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 10 minutes.    Mr. President, let me applaud my colleague from West  Virginia, Senator Capito, for her work in addressing the opioid  epidemic. It is something that I know, in a bipartisan way, we care  about in this Chamber, and it is one place in which I think we could  come to some agreement about increasing resources as we come to an  agreement on the budget for the upcoming year. So I thank the Senator  for her comments.
