 Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the  desk that is due for a second reading.    Mr. President, in order to place the bill on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further  proceeding.    So, Mr. President, tomorrow, the U.S. Senate will vote  to protect one of the most fundamental freedoms that women have in this  country: the freedom to choose whether or not to have an abortion. Few  decisions are more personal and few decisions are more private than  decisions women make regarding their own pregnancies. Few should be  more out of bounds to elected politicians and to the whims of  government. But, sadly, few rights are in as much peril right now as  the fundamental right to choose.   If this abominable decision becomes law, women will lose their  freedom in so many ways--a giant step backward in the United States,  where expanding freedom has always been our goal and our aspiration.   Tomorrow's vote will be one of the most important votes we take in  this Chamber in decades because, for the first time in 50 years, a  conservative majority--an extreme conservative majority--on the Supreme  Court is on the brink of declaring that women do not have a right to an  abortion, they do not have the right to control their own bodies, and  they do not have the right to healthcare in the ways that they believe  they need.   If that happens, tens of millions of women will see their freedoms  contract in the blink of an eye. Our children will grow up in a world  where they have fewer rights than their parents and grandparents had.  America will take a painful and damaging step backward.   The American people will be watching the Senate closely tomorrow, and  they will not forget how their elected Senators voted. I ask my  colleagues to think carefully about their vote, to grapple with the  impact of a world without Roe because all of us will have to answer for  this vote for the rest of our time in public office.   Now, it is worth saying over and over again: Last week's draft  decision didn't come out of nowhere; it didn't materialize in a vacuum.  On the contrary, it is precisely the outcome that extreme Republicans  have been working toward for years. Leader McConnell himself has  admitted that this was their plan  [[Page S2386]]  all along. They have worked for years to confirm radical judges,  plucked right out of the Federalist Society playbook, with the express  goal to ``pick away at Roe v. Wade.'' That is their quote.   The radicals on the hard right have passed wave after wave of  draconian restrictions at the State level, making abortion nearly  impossible to access. One of those laws is about to be upheld by the  Supreme Court of the United States.   These radicals have taken what were once outlandish ideas, like  prison time for women and doctors and abortion bans without exception  for rape and incest, and brought them to the forefront. Ideas that were  radical and out of hand they are now talking about freely. Should Roe  ultimately be overturned, many of us fear it would be just the start.   Over the weekend, Leader McConnell acknowledged where this is  ultimately going. Without Roe, proposals for a nationwide ban on  abortions are now possible if Republicans retake the Senate. That is  what Leader McConnell said this weekend. That is right--a national ban  on abortion. Not very long ago, the idea seemed to belong on the  extreme of the extremes. Now the Republican leader himself acknowledges  this is on the table--just a glaring indication of how radicalized the  Republican Party has become in recent decades as the MAGA wing has all  but completed its cancerous takeover.   All the times that Republicans disguised their hostility to Roe as a  matter of ``States' rights'' have been exposed for what they are:  hypocrisy, a smokescreen hiding the real objective. It is one of the  oldest, most sinister arguments Republicans have used for decades. For  MAGA Republicans, this has never been about States' rights; it has  always been about getting rid of abortion altogether.   The hypocrisies run deeper still. It is worth noting that the very  same party that spent years opposing healthcare by saying that ``the  American people want healthcare decisions left up to families and  doctors''--that is what they said as they opposed ACA year after year.  They said, again, the American people want healthcare decisions left up  to their families and doctors when it came to ACA. They are now the  very same radicals who are telling Americans: No, it is not up to your  family and your doctor; it is your body, our choice--the radical  right's choice, the choice of five men on the Supreme Court who are  extreme.   Now, many on the other side can't even bring themselves to own the  horrors they have unleashed. They are trying to convince people they  are not extreme, but the truth is that the MAGA wing of the Republican  Party is running the show, and their actions prove how extreme they  are.   Senate Republicans have spent a full week trying to change the  subject to anything but Roe because they know how toxic this issue has  become for them. The Republican leader tried to say, in vain, that the  real story of the draft decision was not the end of Roe but the source  of the leaked draft? Tell that to 100 million Americans who will lose  their most personal of rights. I am sure they don't care as much about  the leaked draft as about how they can control their own bodies.   The chair of the Republican campaign arm, Senator Scott, released  laughable talking points saying Republicans, of course, don't want to  imprison doctors, even though his allies, his fellow MAGA Republicans,  are pushing for exactly that at the State level. It would all be  farcical if it wasn't so bone-chilling and the consequences were not so  serious.   Senate Republicans can try to run from their role in securing Roe's  extinction, but sooner or later, the truth wins out. Without the  actions they have taken for years, reproductive rights wouldn't be  staring straight into a doomsday scenario.   So, tomorrow, the vote to protect abortion rights will shine like a  floodlight on every Member of this Chamber. Republicans who pretended  disingenuously as if this moment couldn't possibly happen will have to  answer to the women of America whose rights are about to be turned back  by decades.   Tomorrow, there will be no more hiding; there will be no more  distracting, no more obfuscating where every Member in this Chamber  stands. Senate Republicans will face a choice: Either vote to protect  the rights of women to exercise freedom over their own bodies or stand  with the Supreme Court as 50 years of women's rights are reduced to  rubble before our very eyes. The vote tomorrow will tell.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on Ukraine, later today, the House is  set to vote on nearly $40 billion in emergency aid to help Ukraine as  the Ukrainians continue to fight back quite successfully against  Russian aggression. This is a large package, but the need is great, and  time is of the essence. After the House passes the legislation, it is  my intention for the Senate to act on it as soon as we can. The  President has called on both Chambers of Congress to act quickly on the  Ukrainian aid package, so act quickly we must.   The Ukrainian Ambassador will be visiting us at our caucus lunch this  afternoon to discuss the upcoming package, and she will let us know how  important it is to quickly approve it. Quickly approving this emergency  funding is essential to helping the people of Ukraine in their fight  against the vicious Putin. It will mean more funding to provide  Javelins, Stingers, Howitzers, Switchblade unmanned aerial munitions,  and other critical equipment. And it will mean more food, supplies, and  shelter for the millions of Ukrainian refugees who are in the midst of  the largest refugee crisis since the Second World War.    We have a moral obligation to stand with our friends in Ukraine. The  fight they are in is a struggle between democracy and authoritarianism  itself, and we dare not relent or delay swift action to help our  friends in need.   And make no mistake, the Senate will move swiftly to get an emergency  funding package passed and sent to the President's desk.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to the motion to  reconsider the vote by which cloture was not agreed to on Executive  Calendar No. 844, the nomination of Lisa DeNell Cook.    Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote by which  cloture was not invoked on Calendar No. 844.
