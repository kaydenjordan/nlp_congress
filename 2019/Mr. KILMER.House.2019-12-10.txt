 Madam Chair, I thank my friend from Hawaii for yielding  time.   Madam Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 729, the Coastal  and Great Lakes Communities Enhancement Act, a package of 10 bipartisan  bills that will make significant strides to address the critical  challenges our coastal communities face as a direct result of climate  change and sea level rise.    Madam Chair, this is Taholah, the lower village of the Quinault  Indian Nation. This photo doesn't show someone canoeing on a river or  on a lake. It shows someone canoeing through the streets of their  village after seawater flooded the area during a storm.   Far too often and far too many times, we have seen more severe storms  and rising sea levels threaten communities like this. In my region, we  have seen it in La Push, where the Quileute Tribal School is in the  crosshairs of a rising ocean.   We have seen coastal challenges threaten public safety, public  access, and cultural landmarks for these Tribes and others, including  the Hoh and Makah Tribes. These communities are seeing the impact of  climate change right now.   Breached seawalls, persistent flooding, mold damage, tsunami threats,  and coastal erosion put homes at risk. They put schools serving Tribal  youth at risk and community centers serving elders at risk, not to  mention important cultural sites that date back generations.   Unfortunately, these threats from changing landscapes and weather  events can't be adequately addressed by Tribal governments alone  because they don't have the resources. While the Federal Government has  resources to help coastal communities, there is no ability under  current law to make direct applications for this funding.   Madam Chair, I grew up on the Olympic Peninsula. I have seen,  firsthand, challenges faced by coastal communities; and, today, in the  face of these threats, with this bill, we say that we are not going to  tell these communities that they are on their own, because today's  proposal includes my bill, the Tribal Coastal Resiliency Act, which  aims to uphold Tribal sovereignty by modernizing NOAA's Coastal Zone  Management grant program to allow Tribal governments to directly  compete for these grants instead of requiring them to petition States  to prioritize these projects.                                time  1445     This is about helping communities that face more severe  storms and increased flooding in my region and around the country. This  is about the Federal Government upholding its trust responsibility.  This is about making a difference for coastal communities.   Madam Chair, let's pass this bill and help our communities.
