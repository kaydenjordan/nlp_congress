 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure to  fund the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2018.   Today marks the 122nd day that our military has gone without funding  for FY 2018. Like the rest of the Federal Government, it has been  forced to operate under a CR for the past 4 months. Secretary of  Defense James Mattis explained the impacts of operating under a CR,  particularly those related to readiness and maintenance. They include a  scaled-back training exercise across the services, the delayed  introduction of 11 ships by the United States Navy, the postponement of  all noncritical maintenance work orders by the Army, the curtailment of  hiring and recruitment, rising acquisition costs from severed  contracts, and renegotiated terms due to the CR.   A CR means no new starts, and impacts to current readiness and future  plans are disastrous. This must stop. Today's passage of this bill  marks, as was pointed out, the third time we have passed the FY 2018  Defense Appropriations bill in some form. Let's hope the third time is  the charm.   I commend Chairman Frelinghuysen and Chairwoman Granger on their  tireless persistence and relentless determination on behalf of the U.S.  servicemembers. The bill provides robust funding for shipbuilding,  aviation, combat vehicles, and more. It invests in our greatest assets,  the men and women who wear the uniform, through increased funds for  training, equipment, and the best healthcare.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I implore the Senate to  act.
