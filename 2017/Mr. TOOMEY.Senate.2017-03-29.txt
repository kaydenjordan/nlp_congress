 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support of  the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch as Associate Justice of the U.S.  Supreme Court.   There has been a lot of debate about Judge Gorsuch and his candidacy  for the Supreme Court. Let me first review some of the things that  really have not been debated. One is the intellect and the education  and the knowledge of this man. It is really extraordinary.   Judge Gorsuch attended Columbia University as an undergrad, Harvard  Law School, and he went on to Oxford for postgraduate work.   Nobody disputes the intellect, the education, and the knowledge that  this man brings to this job. Nobody disputes his experience and  qualifications, either. How could they? He has spent 10 years on the  Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, the second highest level of courts in  our American system. There is no question that Neil Gorsuch has the  experience and the qualifications.   Character and temperament are extremely important--actually,  essential--characteristics for a judge or a Justice. I have heard  nobody criticize the character or temperament of Judge Gorsuch,  whatsoever. In fact, he has only gotten glowing praise about both his  integrity, his character, his temperament, and the way he treats people  in his courtroom and throughout his life.   There is also no disputing that he has enjoyed very broad bipartisan  support in the past and significantly to this day. First of all, there  was not a single Senator who opposed his confirmation to the Tenth  Circuit when he was nominated and confirmed.   President Barack Obama's Acting Solicitor General, a Democrat, has  endorsed Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. A bipartisan group of  attorneys, former colleagues from his law firm, classmates of his, and  many people across the political spectrum from both parties who know  this man personally have strongly endorsed his candidacy.   So as to these very important criteria--his intellect, his education,  his knowledge, his experience, his temperament, his character-- everything about this man is really quite extraordinary, and that is  not even disputed. That is almost universally acknowledged.   So what is the attack? What is the criticism that we hear about Judge  Gorsuch? Well, one is this notion that somehow he is outside the  mainstream. We have heard this from some of our colleagues who intend  not to support Judge Gorsuch.   One of the things about being a circuit court judge is that it is  actually quite easy to evaluate whether or not a circuit court judge is  outside the mainstream because, as it happens, appellate court or  circuit court judges don't rule alone. They rule in groups. It is  usually a group of three when they are hearing a case as a subset of  the full court, or it is the entire court. Either way, they are ruling  with other judges.   So you can evaluate, for instance, how often they are by themselves,  how often they are the sole minority dissenting view, because that  might be an indication of someone who is outside the mainstream.   It is interesting. In the over 2,700 cases that Neil Gorsuch has  decided on, in 99 percent of those cases, he was in the majority. In 97  percent of the cases, it was unanimous. How could that possibly be  outside of the mainstream? That is not a valid argument at all.   As to the people who are trying to manufacture some opposition to  Judge Gorsuch, what they are doing is they are cherry-picking a handful  of the over 2,700 cases in which he has participated in, and they try  to find a handful in which Judge Gorsuch did not rule in favor of  litigants that our Democratic colleagues believe are politically  sympathetic. That is what their argument has come down to.   The Democratic minority leader has been down on the floor for a  speech, and I will quote from his speech. He said: ``I saw a judge who  repeatedly decided with insurance companies that  [[Page S2087]]  wanted to deny disability benefits to employees.''   The Democratic leader goes on to say: ``I saw a judge who, in  unemployment discrimination, sided with employers the great majority of  the time.''   Here is another quote: ``Time and time again, his rulings favor the  already powerful over ordinary Americans.''   The Democratic leader went on to marvel: ``Judge Gorsuch ruled  against a teacher.'' ``Judge Gorsuch ruled against a truck driver.''   Now, even if you set aside the fact that the facts in these cases  have been wildly distorted in the retelling that I have heard, and if  you set aside the fact that even in those very cases in which Judge  Gorsuch has ruled, often he has ruled with the Democratic judges who  enjoy the support of our Democratic colleagues, and even if you ignore  the fact that in many of these cases he was bound by precedent--he had  no choice--you could also ignore all the many other cases in which  Judge Gorsuch ruled in favor of workers and unions and people who  allege sexual harassment, environmentalists, immigrants, and other  sympathetic litigants. The minority leader put all that aside. I think  we have to ask a fundamental question: What is missing in this critique  of Judge Gorsuch's decisions? What I find striking is that what is  missing is any reference to the law. I don't hear them mention the law.  I have not heard any of our Democratic colleagues, who intend to oppose  Judge Gorsuch, say that he ignored the law or that he violated the law  or that he misapplied the law or that he misunderstood the law. I don't  hear anything of the sort.   Now, why do you suppose that is? I think I know why that is. I think  because to many of the people who are threatening to oppose Neil  Gorsuch, the law isn't what really matters the most. What really  matters the most is that politically favored special interests or  someone that they think the public will be sympathetic to has to win  regardless of the law. They want a policy outcome and one that would  benefit their perceived preferred litigants, rather than the law.   Here is what I think. I really think there are two unpardonable  offenses in the minds of our friends and colleagues who are opposing  Neil Gorsuch's nomination. The first is that Judge Gorsuch believes in  the rule of law. I know he does. It is very, very clear. To some  degree, there is a fundamental debate going on here between those who  support his candidacy and those who oppose it, and it is fundamentally  about the role of judges in the U.S. constitutional system.   One view, the view that I have--and I believe the one that Judge  Gorsuch shares--is that the law totally matters. What the law says  matters, and that includes the Constitution. The words matter. And not  only that, but it is up to the American people to change laws or to  change the Constitution, if the American people see fit. It is up to  judges to impartially apply the law and the Constitution, as it is  written, and that is an important thing here. Both of these are  important.   Under our view of the world, a judge is supposed to see everyone the  same regardless of race, sex, wealth, political affiliation, or other  characteristics. A judge is obligated to neutrally apply the law.  Whether you are a man or a woman, young or old, rich or poor, Black or  White, that is not supposed to matter to a judge. There is a reason our  symbol of justice, Lady Justice, is depicted wearing a blindfold--it is  because as a judge you are not supposed to decide based on these  characteristics of a person; you are supposed to decide based on what  the law says. This is fundamental to an independent judiciary, to a  nation that lives by the rule of law.   But the other view, the critics' view--they constantly go back not to  the law or the application of the law but to how sympathetic the  litigants are. That is what matters most to them. That is an implicit  rejection of the notion that everyone is equal before the law. Instead,  in that world view, some are more equal than others and the law means  whatever a judge thinks it should mean, and that is based significantly  on whom the litigants are.   The same applies to the Constitution, in their world view, that of  those who are opposing Judge Gorsuch. The Constitution can't really  mean exactly what it says--that can be very inconvenient--and so what  the Supreme Court is supposed to be, in the minds of our friends who  are opposing Judge Gorsuch, the Supreme Court is really a permanently  sitting constitutional convention. Make up the Constitution as it goes  along. Decide what it means today as opposed to what it meant yesterday  or what it might mean tomorrow. The judges are supposed to be acutely  sensitive to the race, wealth, political affiliation of the people who  come before them, and those criteria matter a great deal.   In fact, you have to ask yourself, if that is the way you view the  world, why even bother having a trial? Why not have a checklist and see  whether the litigants come down on the politically sympathetic side of  the ledger, and once you know that, you can decide? Why bother with the  hassles or a trial or a case?   I would suggest that this approach to the law--the law that depends  on the race, ethnicity, or any other criteria of the litigants--such a  law is not a law at all. That is how a banana republic imposes the law;  that is not how America views the law.   So my view, as I stated earlier, that the law means exactly what it  says and nothing other than what it says--and that also applies to the  Constitution--that is a view which is often described as originalism.  The opponents' view, especially with respect to the Constitution--they  believe the Constitution is a living document, meaning changes over  time, in their view. I would suggest that this is the fundamental  choice between the rule of law in the former case and the rule by  judges in the latter case.   Justice Scalia once said: ``Every tin horn dictator in the world  today, every president for life, has a Bill of Rights.'' The Bill of  Rights only protects us if it is enforced and if it is enforced  consistently and equally for everyone who is involved. How much  protection does our Bill of Rights provide if, as Chief Justice Hughes  stated in 1907, ``the Constitution is what the judges say it is''?  Well, as Justice Scalia observed, once the original meaning of the  Constitution can be set aside and judges can rewrite it, then they can  rewrite and limit individual liberty or any other of the rights that  are so fundamental to the nature of our country.   Let me give an example that makes this very specific. There is a case  that came before the Supreme Court not very long ago called the Kelo  decision. The Fifth Amendment states very clearly that the government  cannot take private property unless it is ``for public use.'' That is  what it says in the Constitution. Look it up. Well, in the Kelo case,  five Supreme Court Justices decided that public use can mean private  use. The word ``public'' can mean ``private.'' Specifically in this  case, what they said was that the government can come along and take an  individual's home and give it to a private company--in this case, to  use as a parking lot for a private venture. This is blatantly  unconstitutional. It is very, very clear. Yet that is what happened  when five Justices decided they could just rewrite the Constitution as  they prefer it.   Here is the thing about this: Even if you believe it is a good idea  to be able to take someone's house and give it to another private  developer because he has a better use for it than the homeowner, if you  think that is a good idea--I don't happen to think that is a good idea,  but you might. If you do, we have a mechanism for making that policy  permissible. You change the Constitution. You amend the Constitution.  You can strike that word or insert another clause. There are any number  of ways you can change that.   But here is what is so important: Under our constitutional system,  the only people who get to change the Constitution are the American  people. They do it through their elected representatives in the  Congress and in the State legislatures, but they are the sovereigns. It  is the American people who get to make these decisions, who determine  policy, not five unelected guys wearing black robes, because when they  get to make that policy, they are not accountable to anyone. They can't  be fired. The Presiding Officer and I can be fired. If we are not  [[Page S2088]]  doing the job our constituents want us to do, we will be fired. That is  how we are held accountable. Our constituents can replace us with  people who will reflect the policies they want. That is why we are the  policymakers under our constitutional system.   I believe Neil Gorsuch completely understands this. It is one of the  reasons our friends on the other side of the aisle can't bring  themselves to support him.   I think there were two unpardonable sins that Neil Gorsuch has  committed. I just mentioned the first. I think the second one was that  he was nominated by Donald Trump. We have folks in this Chamber who  don't seem to be able to accept that they lost an election, and they  are reflexively opposing whatever it is President Trump wants, and  apparently they intend for that opposition to continue indefinitely.    In a public interview, the minority leader was quoted as saying: ``It  is hard for me to imagine a nominee that Donald Trump would choose that  would get Republican support that we could support.''   He was asked a follow-up question: ``So will you do your best to hold  the seat open?''   The Democratic minority leader replied: ``Absolutely.''   Hold the seat open for 4 years or maybe 8 years? This is outrageous,  and it is unprecedented.   If the minority leader were to get his way, for the first time in the  history of the Republic, we would have a Supreme Court nominee defeated  by a partisan filibuster. Let me stress this. This has never happened  before in the history of the country. How many times have we nominated  and confirmed Supreme Court Justices? Never once have we had a partisan  filibuster used to block the consideration of a nominee. We have had  people withdraw. We have had people who were voted down.   The case of Abe Fortas was an unusual case where there was a  bipartisan filibuster because there was a perception of ethics  problems, and he, in fact, had to resign as an Associate Justice. The  bipartisan filibuster was used when there was an attempt by President  Johnson to elevate him to Chief Justice. That is not the precedent.  There is no precedent.   Take the case of Clarence Thomas. In my lifetime, I am pretty sure  Clarence Thomas was the most controversial nominee we have ever had. It  was a brutal, very difficult, very contentious, really ugly process-- the hearings, the nomination process, the confirmation process. In the  end, Clarence Thomas was confirmed with 52 votes. Any Senator in the  body could have insisted on a 60-vote threshold if it was there, but  nobody did. No Senator did because the custom has been that Supreme  Court Justices get confirmed if they have a majority of support. So  what the minority leader wants to do is completely departing from that  and establishing a new threshold.   The minority leader made an argument that is absolutely laughable. He  suggested that because President Obama's nominees got 60 votes, well,  then President Trump's should. What is laughable about that is the  reason President Obama's nominees got 60 votes is because Republicans  gave them those votes. I was running for the Senate at the time that  Sonia Sotomayor was nominated, and I pointed out that there was a lot I  disagreed about with her. I am sure I will not be happy with many of  her decisions. But here we are in the President's new term--relatively  early--and this is a qualified, capable person. I am not going to  obstruct. I voted to confirm her, and a number of Republicans did join  the Democrats, and President Obama got Justice Sotomayor and Justice  Kagan confirmed to the bench.   The minority leader has suggested that there is this tradition of 60  votes. Well, you don't have to take my word for it; the Washington Post  Fact Checker--not exactly the mouthpiece of the Republican Party--did  their fact-checking analysis, and they said it was absolutely false.  They gave him three Pinocchios.   It is also one of the many ironies of this that the very same  Democrats who insist that we should allow them to permanently block any  Supreme Court nominee because they won't provide the votes to get to 60  are the ones who actually did break the Senate tradition and establish  a 50-vote threshold when they wanted to pack the DC Circuit Court of  Appeals back in 2013. Now they suggest that if we use the same tactic  they used--although we are doing it for a different reason--that this  would be an abomination, that the Democrats would never do this. Well,  actually, they did in 2013. But as for the circumstances we face now,  there is no mystery about what they would have done because they told  us just 12 days before the election.   Our Senator Tim Kaine, the Democratic nominee for Vice President, was  asked: ``What happens if,'' as everyone expected at the time, ``Hillary  Clinton becomes President and the Democrats take control of the Senate,  if Republicans were to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee? What would  you do?''   I will quote Senator Kaine. He said: ``We will change the Senate  rules to uphold the law, that the court will be nine members.''   Here is the truth: If the election had gone differently, if Hillary  Clinton had won and if Democrats were in control of the Senate, then  Republicans would have probably provided the votes for a competent,  capable, qualified Supreme Court nominee, just as Republicans did for  Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. That is what history has shown.  Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues at this point seem unwilling-- or at least some of them are--to provide the same bipartisan  cooperation to a new President attempting to fill a vacancy that  Republicans provided to President Obama.   Let me conclude with this: The case for confirming Judge Gorsuch was  summed up pretty well by the editorial board of the Chicago Tribune-- again, not exactly the RNC's mouthpiece--in endorsing Neil Gorsuch.  They said:         Here is a judge who knows the law and knows the role of the       judiciary: He isn't on the bench to make law, he's there to       interpret it faithfully, because the separation of powers       among the branches of government serves our democracy.       Sometimes the result benefits liberal positions, sometimes       conservative. . . . Some of Gorsuch's critics think judges       should be creative and expansive depending on the political       climate--to treat laws differently on a cold night than a       warm one. Those critics suggest that they fear Gorsuch won't       follow the law, but the opposite is more true: They fear he       will. Gorsuch should be confirmed.    If our Democratic colleagues aren't willing to confirm Neil Gorsuch  to the Supreme Court, then there is no one they are going to vote to  confirm to the Supreme Court. And we cannot allow a Democratic minority  to block an up-or-down vote and deny filling a vacancy on the Supreme  Court for 4 or 8 years. We simply can't allow that to happen, and I  trust that we won't.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
