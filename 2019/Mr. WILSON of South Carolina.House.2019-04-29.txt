 Mr. Speaker, on Easter Sunday, at least  253 innocents were brutally murdered in Sri Lanka as a result of  coordinated attacks targeting hotels and Christian churches. There were  four American fatalities.   The tragic Easter Sunday bombings are one of the worst terrorist  attacks since September 11, 2001. At least seven suicide bombers hit  multiple targets, including St. Anthony's Shrine, within a short period  of time of each other.   The attack was clearly planned in advance, as at least nine sites  were targeted. ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attacks, and a  safe house of ISIS was raided by authorities on Friday.   The American people stand steadfast beside the people of Sri Lanka in  [[Page H3288]]  mourning and solidarity. We send our heartfelt condolences to the  families of the victims, and we vow to never let the people of Sri  Lanka or any country stand alone before the scourge of terrorism.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
