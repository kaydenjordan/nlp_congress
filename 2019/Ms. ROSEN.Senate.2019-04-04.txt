 Mr. President, it is my distinct honor to recognize  Samuel S. Lionel, who is celebrating his 100th birthday. Considered the  ``Dean'' of the Nevada Bar, Sam's defense of Nevada values stands as a  strong reminder of the tremendous work he has done for our State.   For decades, Sam has represented one of the largest law firms in  Nevada, fighting for critically important issues such as our thriving  tourism industry and defending Nevada's unique western heritage. The  dedication he has placed into his practice has strengthened our State's  economy and helped shape the Las Vegas Valley that we know and love  today. In fact, it was Sam who played a key role in the conception and  development of many of the hotels and casinos on the Las Vegas Strip,  setting the stage for Nevada's unprecedented growth and its booming  entertainment scene.   Sam is known for his philanthropic heart. He remains particularly  active in Jewish philanthropy, and we share a long history of working  together in our synagogue, Congregation Ner Tamid. Sam has also been a  central benefactor of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, endowing the  namesake Samuel S. Lionel Professor of Intellectual Property Law  position at the William S. Boyd School of Law in 2016. I know firsthand  the wonderful leader Sam is, and his philanthropic work has  distinguished him in the Jewish and legal communities not only in  Nevada but also throughout the United States. Sam's name is and will  always remain synonymous with his professional and philanthropic  dedication to the Silver State.   Happy birthday to Sam, a loving husband, father, grandfather, great- grandfather, servant leader, and loyal friend.                            ____________________
