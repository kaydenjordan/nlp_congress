 2000.    Madam President, I want to thank my friend and colleague  from both the House and the Senate, Senator Chuck Schumer, the  Democratic leader, for his kind words. He has been such a valuable ally  in this battle.   As leader on the Senate side, Chuck, I just can't thank you enough.    Time and again, we did things here that were difficult  politically--difficult politically--to fight for the young people.   I just want to thank all of the Senators on both sides of the aisle  who were a part of moving this issue forward. They did it at great  political risk.   I can remember, as sure as I am standing here, watching one of my  Democratic Senate colleagues walk down and vote for the Dream Act,  return to her desk in the corner, put her head down and sobbed,  realizing that she had probably cost her own reelection with that vote.  Over and over again, people stood up for these young people.   This morning, minutes ago, the Supreme Court brought a smile and a  sigh of relief to more than 700,000 young people in the United States  of America. This morning, the Supreme Court ruled that the September  2017 rescission of the DACA Program by the Trump administration was to  be stricken as arbitrary and capricious.   So what does it mean? It means, for these 700,000 DACA-protected  individuals, that they can continue to live, to  [[Page S3077]]  work, and to study in America without fear of deportation for the  moment.   DACA, of course, is a program created by President Obama in 2012. It  was a program that was, frankly, our answer to the failure to enact the  DREAM Act as the law of the land. The President used his Executive  authority to create the DACA Program, and here is what it said, just  basically mirroring the standards of the DREAM Act, which I introduced  20 years ago: If you were brought to America as a child, if you have  lived in this country, gone to school, don't have a serious problem  with the law, you should have a chance to live here without fear of  deportation. The DREAM Act said you should have a chance to become a  citizen of the United States, which is, of course, our ultimate goal.   But the DACA Program opened up eligibility, and almost 800,000 came  forward and applied. They had to pay a filing fee of $500 or $600, go  through a criminal background check, but for many of these young  people, it was a turning point in their lives. At that point, finally-- finally--there was a chance they could stay in the country they called  home, the United States of America.   They seized that opportunity and did remarkable things. They enlisted  in our military. They went to schools and colleges to pursue an  education. They took up jobs as teachers. They finished medical school.  They did things that were unimaginable for DACA.   Of course, when the administration changed and a new President came  in, there was a real question as to whether he would continue the DACA  Program.   The very first time I ever spoke to President Donald Trump was the  day of his inauguration, within an hour or two after he was sworn, at a  luncheon. What I said to him then--my first words were these: Mr.  President, I hope you are going to help those young people, those  Dreamers, those protected by DACA.   He looked at me, and he said: Senator, don't worry. We will take care  of those kids.   Well, sadly, that didn't happen.   In September of 2017, there was a decision made by this  administration to eliminate the DACA Program, and at that point, were  it not for a court challenge and a protective order by the court, those  young people might have been subject to deportation. But many, myself  included, believed that the process used by President Trump was flawed,  and, if challenged, it would fall in court. It took from September 2017  until today, just minutes ago, when the Supreme Court ruled that the  administration's approach to eliminating DACA was wrong and would be  stricken.   I want to say for a moment who these young people are, because many  people don't know them. They don't wear badges or uniforms to claim  that they are DACA-protected, but this is who they are. Of the 700,000,  200,000 of them are essential employees. You may see them every day in  many, many callings across America as we face this national health  emergency.   Over 40,000 of them are healthcare workers. So if you are a patient  at a clinic or a hospital today fighting COVID-19 and your doctor or  nurse just walked in the room with a big smile, it is because the  Supreme Court said to that healthcare worker or to that healthcare  hero: You can stay in America. We need you.   Of course, that could change. I want to raise this issue because it  is an important one. The Trump administration can decide that they are  going to reinitiate this effort to rescind DACA and try to do it right  this time by the Supreme Court standards. That would be a terrible  tragedy if he made that decision, not just for those 700,000 but for  their families as well.   The front page story on the Chicago Tribune this morning was about  just such a family, both husband and wife protected by DACA, working in  America, trying to buy a little home in Aurora, IL. She works in a  cancer clinic. He has a job as well. They have two beautiful little  kids. They are both DACA-protected. Because of the Supreme Court  decision, they have another day in America. They have a sigh of relief  this morning, but what about next week? What will the Trump  administration do to them next week? I am calling on the President and  those around him, begging him to give these DACA protectees the rest of  this year until next year at least before anything is considered. Let's  protect them now through the election, and let the next President,  whoever he may be, make a decision.   I hope before that happens we will do our part in the U.S. Senate,  the second part of what we can and should be doing, calling on the  President not to rescind DACA again, not to put these young people and  their families through this all over again but, secondly, that we do  our job in the Senate.   I listened to Senator McConnell earlier, talking about bipartisanship  and talking about our legislative accomplishments. He is correct that  the lands bill we passed yesterday was historic. I am glad we did it.  The coronavirus relief bill we passed is historic. I am certainly glad  we did it on a bipartisan basis, and I sincerely hope, when it comes to  Justice in Policing, we can do the same--a bipartisan effort to enact  good law.   Let me add to the list, which unfortunately doesn't include a lot of  legislation, something that is now critically important. The House of  Representatives, months ago, passed the Dream and Promise Act, which  would take care of the DACA issue once and for all. We could enact that  law and say to these young people: Now you have your chance to stay and  earn your path to citizenship in America. That is what we ought to be  saying.   Everyone knows that our immigration laws are a mess. They are hard to  explain and impossible to defend. We have a chance to do something  about them on a bipartisan basis, and I am calling on Senator McConnell  and all the leaders on either side of the aisle: Let's join together  and do that. Let's have a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Let's bring this bill to the floor of the Senate this year so that once  and for all we can deal with the problem we have been looking at for 20  years and approaching in so many different ways.   In the meantime, for today--at least for this week and, I hope, for  long beyond that--we will be celebrating a Supreme Court decision that  gives a new lease on life to 700,000 young people who have one goal in  mind: to be part of America's future. They were educated in our  schools. They stood in those classrooms and pledged allegiance to the  same flag we pledge allegiance to. They have their children. They have  their families. They have their hopes and a future, and they are making  a good living with life in the America. Thanks to the Supreme Court,  they have some more time, but now it is up to the President and up to  us to solve this problem once and for all, to do the right thing for  them and for the future of America.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, we are in the midst of one of the greatest  public health crises in our Nation's history. Over 2 million Americans  have been infected by the COVID-19 virus. Over 115,000 Americans have  died. Sadly, infections are still trending upward in many States. And  what is the response of the Republican majority in the U.S. Senate to  this public health crisis? This week, the majority leader, Senator  McConnell has scheduled a vote on his family friend and former intern,  Justin Walker, to be a judge on the DC Circuit, the second highest  court in the land.  [[Page S3093]]    Colleagues, let's be honest. You cannot say with a straight face that  Justin Walker, a 38-year-old with no practical courtroom experience and  a few months' time on the district court bench, is the best person for  the job of DC Circuit judge. He is not, and we know it. So why is he  getting this nomination? I believe there are two main reasons: because  Justin Walker is a protege of Senator McConnell and because he is an  outspoken critic of the Affordable Care Act.   Justin Walker has made clear that he is willing to toe the Republican  party line of hostility to Obamacare. Before he was confirmed as a  district judge last October in a party-line vote, he called the NFIB  case that upheld the ACA's constitutionality an ``indefensible  decision.'' And in March, while he was a sitting judge, he cracked  jokes about his opposition to the ACA at his ceremonial investiture.   These comments apparently put him on the fast-track for a promotion  to the DC Circuit. I find it astonishing that Senate Republicans have  rubberstamped so many nominees who have written articles or spoken  publicly about their hostility to the ACA, nominees like John Bush,  Steven Grasz, James Ho, David Porter, Neomi Rao, Mark Norris, Michael  Truncale, and Sarah Pitlyk, not to mention Chad Readler, who filed the  brief for the Trump Justice Department in the Texas v. U.S. case that  called for striking down the entire ACA, including its protections for  Americans with preexisting conditions. Chad Readler was nominated to  the 6th Circuit within a day of filing that brief.   It is a pattern. And right after the vote on Justin Walker, Senator  McConnell wants to vote on yet another nominee with a record of  outspoken hostility to the ACA; 5th Circuit nominee Cory Wilson of  Mississippi has repeatedly spoken, written, and tweeted criticisms of  the ACA. In one of Wilson's newspaper columns, he wrote ``for the sake  of the Constitution, I hope the Court strikes down the law.'' In  another column, he described the ACA as ``big, intrusive government''  and as ``perverse'' and ``illegitimate.'' And he has tweeted negatively  about the ACA more than 30 times.   Justin Walker's and Cory Wilson's public statements clearly show that  they have already made up their minds about the Affordable Care Act's  merits and its constitutionality. And yet, they have been unwilling to  recuse themselves from ACA cases that might come before them if they  are confirmed. This is important because the ACA has been under  constant attack in the Federal courts. The Republican Party, from  President Trump on down, has been obsessed with trying to get the ACA  struck down as unconstitutional. There is a case pending before the  Supreme Court right now where Republican officeholders and the Trump  administration are trying to strike down the entire ACA. That would  strip away health insurance and preexisting condition protections for  millions of Americans. Even in the middle of a pandemic, the Republican  Party is not stopping its attack on the Affordable Care Act.   They failed to overturn the ACA in Congress, of course. But clearly,  Republicans are determined to attack it through the courts, no matter  how many Americans might lose their coverage and protections. Make no  mistake, the nominations of Justin Walker and Cory Wilson are part of  the Republican assault on the Affordable Care Act. And the American  people are watching.   I oppose these nominees.    I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr.  Manchin), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Markey), the Senator from  Washington (Mrs. Murray), the Senator from Nevada (Ms. Rosen), the  Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Arizona (Ms.  Sinema) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4002         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
