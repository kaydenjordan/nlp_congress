 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order at  any time on April 27, 2023, to consider H. Con.

Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 327 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 327         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 2811) to       provide for a responsible increase to the debt ceiling, and       for other purposes. All points of order against consideration       of the bill are waived. The amendment printed in the report       of the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution shall       be considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read.

Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 39) disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of       Commerce relating to ``Procedures Covering Suspension of       Liquidation, Duties and Estimated Duties in Accord With       Presidential Proclamation 10414''. All points of order       against consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The       joint resolution shall be considered as read. All points of       order against provisions in the joint resolution are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       joint resolution and on any amendment thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for purposes of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to my good friend, the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished ranking member of the  Rules Committee, pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, during consideration of this resolution, all time is  yielded for the purposes of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on House Resolution 327.    Mr. Speaker, last night, the Rules Committee met and met  and met and reported out a rule providing for the consideration of H.R.  2811, the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023, and H.J. Res. 39, a joint  resolution of disapproval that ends President Biden's rule protecting  Chinese solar manufacturers that are illegally violating U.S. trade  law.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2811 under a closed rule.  It provides 2 hours of general debate and one motion to recommit. The  rule also provides for consideration of H.J. Res. 39 under a closed  rule with 1 hour of general debate and one motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, the United States Government hit our  statutory debt limit of $31.3 trillion. That is an astonishing number.  It is over 120 percent of our annual gross domestic product.   This level of spending is simply unsustainable, and the American  people know it. Three out of every four Americans support taking action  on the national debt. They know that if we do nothing and keep moving  forward as we have been doing, the result will be leaving a huge burden  for our children and grandchildren; a pile of debt, a weak economy, and  a broken currency.   You would think, given all that, the staggering reality, that  President Biden and congressional Democrats would acknowledge the need  to do something to address this problem. You would think they would be  open to doing what we have done many, many times in the past: to couple  needed fiscal reforms with an agreement to lift the debt ceiling. You  would even think that President Biden, who himself personally  negotiated several debt ceiling increases over the years, would be  willing to sit down with us and talk.   Instead, we have heard none of this. No, we will not negotiate with  you. No, we will not talk about the Federal budget. No, we won't look  at commonsense reforms. No. No. No.   Instead, President Biden and congressional Democrats insist it is  their way or the highway. There will be no reforms, no changes to  Federal spending, not even clawing back the unspent pandemic relief  funds that are no longer necessary.   With the passage of the Limit, Save, Grow Act, the House will stand  with the American people who desperately want us to fix our national  debt problem. That fix starts here in today's bill.   Mr. Speaker, our second item for today, H.J. Res. 39, is a joint  resolution of disapproval of a Biden administration rule that would  suspend import duties on solar panels made with components from the  People's Republic of China.   Mr. Speaker, Communist China does not play by the same rules as the  rest of the world. Chinese leadership will do whatever it takes to  advance the Chinese Communist Party's interest to the detriment of the  American economy.   China has been unfairly subsidizing the production of solar cells and  modules and dumping them on the U.S. market at below cost. It should  come as no surprise that China is also attempting to get around the  existing import duties by routing their subsidized solar components  through four countries: Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.   Instead of holding them accountable for their actions, President  Biden suspended the penalties for 2 years, presumably to appease  climate activists who have no interest in America's job creators and  manufacturers. If the House does not act, China's bad behavior will go  unchallenged, and American solar manufacturers will continue to get a  raw deal.   Mr. Speaker, we must stand up to Communist China. We must call out  their inappropriate behavior on the global stage. When it is called  for, we must protect American manufacturers against unfair competition.  H.J. Res. 39 will accomplish all of these goals and will do so in a  bipartisan manner.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this rule  and the underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H1961]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I have great respect for my friend, Mr. McGovern, but, of course,  most of the things he mentioned simply aren't in the bill.   What really happened last night is that we have been trying to get  you guys to negotiate for weeks and for months. We are going to raise  the debt ceiling, something we said we were going to do and do in the  legislation, and here is our opening offer.   Where is yours? We don't have one. We don't have one from the  President. We have a Democratic Senate that can't produce one. So, we  are going to put the ball over and see what you guys are actually going  to do with it.   I remind my friends on the other side of the aisle that the work  requirements we are including in this legislation are, in fact, less  strict than the ones that then-Senator Biden supported in the 1990s. We  should be helping people attain self-sufficiency as opposed to having  them simply depend on the Federal Government.   That doesn't seem like a radical idea. That seems like common sense  to me, and I think most Americans anyplace in the country would support  it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy), who is my very good friend and a member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Langworthy), who is a distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  a couple of points.   Mr. Speaker, my friend is concerned about the Social Security Act. We  have a bill on that, a bill very similar to what President Biden  himself voted for when he was in the United States Senate, both the  creation of a commission and its final results. I invite my friend to  look at it. Perhaps he would join it, and it would be inherently  bipartisan.   My friend made the point that inflation is a global phenomenon. I  agree. It absolutely is.   Mr. Speaker, if you screw up the greatest economy in the world, then  it has global consequences. That is exactly what my friends did.   Don't take my word for it. They were warned by Larry Summers, the  Secretary of the Treasury for Bill Clinton, a distinguished economist.  They were warned by Steve Rattner, who managed the auto industry under  President Obama. They were warned by Jason Furman, who was the Chairman  of the Council of Economic Advisers to President Biden.   If my friends pass something as large as the American Rescue Plan,  then we are going to have inflation within a year. We did.   If my friends would listen to their own economists, then we could  have avoided this, and we might not have had to take the drastic action  we are today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Van Orden).                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself quickly such time as I may  consume just to correct my friend. I did not blame all inflation on  President Biden. He had a lot of help. He had a Democratic House and a  Democratic Senate that worked with him to get there, so he certainly  didn't do it on his own.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McClintock), my very good friend, and a distinguished member of the  Budget Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, in response to my friend's statement, we are certainly  not trying to extort anything from anyone. Quite frankly, it is my  Democratic friends who are trying to extract something from us that  they can't get for themselves. If you believe a clean debt ceiling is  the way to go, pass one in a Democratic Senate. You can't do it. The  reality is there has to be a negotiation here. What we have said is:  Hey, we are in good faith extending the debt ceiling; we are doing it  in this bill. We have a lot of Members who have never voted to do that,  who are actually doing it.   Here is our opening position in the negotiation. What is yours? We  haven't heard that. It is just simply, well, give us what we want and  pass the President's budget. If they genuinely want to talk, we are  giving them the opportunity to actually do that.   I remind my friend, we look forward to discussion, but the first step  is to raise the debt ceiling. That is what we are going to do here,  then we will see what the Democrats do in the United States Senate in  response. Then we can all go to conference and talk this thing out and  hopefully come to a bipartisan solution.   The hysterics and theatrics might make good print. That is not the  reality of the process here. We are operating within the spirit of the  process. We hope our friends do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I think if you happen to be listening to the debate,  you might get confused. It is as if we are going to impose our will on  somebody.   The reality is the Democrats control the United States Senate. The  Democratic President of the United States has a veto that he can  sustain in either Chamber.   What we are saying is let's sit down and talk things through, and  here is our opening position. That is all that is going on here.   We are not in a position here to do what my friends did last time,  and that is both what they regret losing and fear might someday come to  pass.   The last time my friends didn't have to negotiate 2 years ago, what  did they do? An explosion of spending that generated the worst  inflation in modern American history; the worst inflation in over 40  years.   Looking around this Chamber, I think I am probably the only one here  old enough to remember it.   The reality is they took a crisis that was ending and used it to  justify $1.9 trillion worth of spending that many of their own  economists warned them would lead to inflation. They jammed it through  without a single vote.   The next year, they called something an Inflation Reduction Act that  we all know was a climate bill. They crammed through another $500  billion worth of spending.   That doesn't even include plussing up the regular discretionary  accounts of the United States. My friends own the inflation that has  impoverished every single American.  [[Page H1969]]    Every American family is worse off, not better off, given the  economic stewardship of this administration and, frankly, the  Democratic Congress.   We look forward to the debate. We look forward to something my  friends aren't used to doing, that is actually negotiating, and that is  what we are talking about.   We are going to extend the debt limit, just as we said we would. Here  is our negotiation. Here are our ideas where we can save money. Do you  have any ideas where we can save money?   Let's talk about that because you can't get what you want. You can't  pass through a Democratic Senate a clean debt bill.   If you can't do it there, you are certainly not going to do it here,  so let's begin the discussion sooner rather than later.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My friend and I have had a very long day and have spent a lot of time  together.   Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I begin by thanking my friend for engaging, as he always does, in a  spirited debate. We don't agree on a lot of things, but I admire my  friend's passion and appreciate his partnership on the Rules Committee,  both when I was in the minority and now that I am fortunate enough to  be in the majority.   We do look at the world a little bit differently. My friend worries  about a $2 trillion tax cut which, by the way, was stretched out over  10 years, much of which paid itself back in economic growth, but  forgets about a single bill that spent $1.9 trillion last year that  they managed to do.   Look at the results. When the President walked in pre-COVID, the  economy had the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, growing.   Even after going through that, the Biden administration walks into a  V-shaped recovery and a 1.4 percent inflation rate.   In less than 2 years, they managed to flatten that out and give us  the highest inflation rate in over 40 years.    How did that happen? That happened by unrestrained Democratic  spending, out-of-control budget proposals by the President, a  Democratic Senate, and a Democratic House that wouldn't say ``no.''   Well, those days are behind us. I understand the agony of my friends,  that they actually have to sit down now and talk with the Republicans  and come to agreement.   Now, we have come forward with a proposal that we think makes a lot  of sense. My friend is worried about us driving up the debt.   Why are we passing an extension of the debt ceiling? That is exactly  what this legislation does. We are saying we just want to talk. Here is  our opening proposal.   We don't expect you will take everything or agree with everything. We  know you control the United States Senate. We know the President of the  United States has a veto, but you are going to talk with us, and you  are not going to get a clean debt ceiling.   We are not going to give you what you can't get yourself in a  Democratic United States Senate. We are going to have a real discussion  about what we need to do as a country.  [[Page H1977]]    Now, my friend says we have different values. In some ways, we do. We  have a common commitment to the institution. We have a common belief in  democracy. I think we believe in civil discourse, even when we  disagree.   We have many things beyond that that we agree on, but we do differ in  some ways. We believe we ought to live within our means, and that is a  good thing to try and do.   We think the American people ought to be able to keep more of their  own money to spend on their own family and their own investments.   We are willing to put some ideas forward how to do it. We think out- of-control spending is going to make life worse.   The cruelest tax of all is inflation. My friends are worried about  the poorest of the poor. I know that is sincere.   I also know the inflation that this Democratic House and Senate of 2  years ago and the administration inflicted on the American public is a  curse to the poorest of the poor.   Let's sit down, find some common ground. We have done it before. We  act as if it is extraordinary to actually debate around debt ceiling  spending restraints.   That is the way it is normally done, particularly in divided  government. That is what the American people have given us. I suspect  they want us to work together.   We have done our part of the bargain. We will finish that out today.  We will extend the debt ceiling, as we promised we would do.   We will put forward a series of suggestions and proposals. We think  they are good. Our friends won't agree with them all, but at the end of  the day, they are going to have to come to the table.   If they can't pass a clean debt ceiling--or if you can pass a clean  debt ceiling in the Senate, go ahead and do it and come to the table  with that, but I don't think you will be able to.   We are going to sit down and find some ways to begin to restrain this  out-of-control spending, and we are going to do it because there is a  Republican majority in the House that demands that we do it; that we  begin to live responsibly; that we not inflict inflation on the  American people; that we prioritize our spending in some reasonable and  rational way.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:    An Amendment to H. Res. 327 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. I urge  the passage of the rule and the underlying legislation, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained during the vote on  H.R. 1353. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall  No. 197.                             PERSONAL EXPLANATION
