 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Georgia for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the  Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.   We have a responsibility to defend the most vulnerable in our Nation,  and that is exactly what this legislation does: it protects unborn  children from abortion at 5 months.   It is truly disheartening that I have to beg many of my colleagues to  support a bill like this when it is scientifically proven that unborn  babies feel pain after 5 months. Premature infants in the NICU are  protected from pain. Children in the womb should be protected from pain  also.   I will always fight for the right to life, and I believe we have a  responsibility to defend all innocent lives. In fact, this is close to  home. I have four children: one son and three daughters. I have had to  see both my wife and each one of my daughters experience difficult  pregnancies and make difficult choices. I can't imagine life without my  four children and my 12 beautiful grandchildren.   Every child should be given a chance at life. New life is created by  God, and we must give a voice to these precious babies who cannot speak  for themselves. Our Nation can and must protect the most vulnerable  among us.
