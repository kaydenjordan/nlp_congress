 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be  recognized, notwithstanding the order for a pro forma session today.    Mr. President, it has now been 4 days since the  Paycheck Protection Program ran out of money. Republicans have been  trying to secure more funding for this critical program for a week and  a half now. At this hour, our Democratic colleagues are still  prolonging their discussions with the administration, so the Senate  regretfully will not be able to pass more funding for Americans'  paychecks today.   However, since this is so urgent, I have asked that the Senate meet  again tomorrow in a new session that was not previously scheduled, and  the Democratic leader has agreed to my request.   Colleagues, it is past time--past time--to get this done for the  country.   Mr. President, if I may, the Senator desires to speak for a few  minutes.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn to then convene for a  pro  [[Page S2176]]  forma session only, with no business being conducted, on Tuesday, April  21, at 4 p.m.; finally, I ask that when the Senate adjourns on Tuesday,  April 21, it next convene on Thursday, April 23, under the order of  April 16.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 2:04 and 25 seconds p.m.,  adjourned until Tuesday, April 21, 2020, at 4 p.m.
