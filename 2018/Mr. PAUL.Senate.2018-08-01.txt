 Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of Israel. They  remain one of our staunchest allies, and we must support them. However,  the Israelis have called for a curtailment of U.S. aid for more than 20  years in order to ensure their own military and economic independence.   In 2013, Naftali Bennet, who was then serving as Israel's Minister of  Economics and as the leader of the Home Party said, ``Today, U.S.  military aid is roughly 1 percent of Israel's economy. I think,  generally, we need to free ourselves from it. We have to do it  responsibly . . . but our situation today is very different from what  it was 20 and 30 years ago.''   Additionally, on July 10, 1996, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin  Netanyahu said before a Joint Session of Congress, ``I believe we can  now say that Israel has reached childhood's end, that it has matured  enough to begin approaching a state of self-reliance . . . . We are  going to achieve economic independence [from the United States].''
