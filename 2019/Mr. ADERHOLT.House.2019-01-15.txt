 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for the time.   Madam Speaker, I think we all agree that the American people expect  this legislative body to deliver solutions to the difficult challenges  that face our Nation each and every day.   As a longtime member of the Appropriations Committee, I have worked  with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle over the years to try to  reach agreements when we were trying to fund the Federal Government.  What we have to do is try to find common ground.   The matter of how we fully fund the Federal Government for the  remainder of FY19, of course, remains unsolved basically for one  reason: My colleagues on the other side of the aisle won't negotiate.  They have rejected requests to negotiate a deal. They need to come to  the table with a counteroffer. Instead, they continue to kick the can  down the road and continue to play politics with this issue.   Our colleagues reject the solutions requested by the professional  personnel who actually protect the border. By digging in a position  which is political and not policy, ultimately, they are responsible for  the shutdown of the government agencies.   However, this short-term CR, known as a continuing resolution, does  not solve the problem. The Democratic leadership has said 100 percent  no. This bill hits, basically, the snooze button for a few more weeks.  I think it is time that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  wake up and negotiate and come back to the table to find a real  solution.
