 Madam Speaker, I rise today to encourage all of my  colleagues to complete our work and finalize the fiscal year 2023  appropriations measures.   We have a constitutional obligation to fund government operations,  and I also would highlight the vital importance of community-funded  projects included in these measures.   Notably, for the incredible law enforcement personnel in the First  Congressional District of Indiana, I am grateful for the inclusion of  specific funds for the Porter County Sheriff's Office, the Whiting  Police Department, and the Gary Police Department. These  [[Page H8706]]  critical funds will be used for equipment upgrades, including license  plate readers and in-car cameras, which will improve the ability of our  police officers to protect our communities and increase public safety.   I urge my colleagues to focus on the completing of this necessary  work to support our first responders and the economic vitality of our  Nation.                            ____________________
