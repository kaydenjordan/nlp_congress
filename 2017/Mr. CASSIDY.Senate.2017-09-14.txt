 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blunt). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                                  Healthcare     Mr. President, the Presiding Officer has been presiding  on many occasions when I have risen to speak about the need to repeal  and replace ObamaCare, and although we did not succeed in our last  effort in the beginning of August, I, personally, along with Senators  Graham, Johnson and Heller, am making one more try, and folks ask why.   The simple answer I can give is, there is a fellow back home by the  name of Moon Griffon. He is a conservative talk show host who speaks  with passion about the Affordable Care Act. Why does he speak with  passion? Moon Griffon is very open. He has a special needs child, and  he has to buy insurance. His premium per year is over $40,000--$40,000,  with a $5,000 deductible and an additional deductible for his  pharmaceutical costs. He has to pay $50,000 a year for insurance,  deductible, and pharmaceutical deductible. The mortgage payment for a  $500,000 home is what he puts up because he has to buy insurance. He  has a child with special needs.   Now, there are many Moon Griffons across our Nation. Someone said,  kind of as a wag, but I think there is a ring of truth to it, that  ObamaCare, the individual exchange, only works if you don't because if  you do work and you don't qualify for a subsidy, then you cannot afford  it.   By the way, I think there is bipartisan agreement on this. Senator  Bernie Sanders is now putting forward what we would call BernieCare, a  single-payer proposal. He would not be putting that forward if he  thought the  [[Page S5734]]  status quo is working. He is putting it forward because he realizes it  is not. He has 16 cosponsors, if you will. Cosponsors are a testament  to the fact that the status quo is not working. Well, I can tell you,  since Medicare is going bankrupt in 17 years, the seniors who are on it  will have their benefits threatened by adding another 150 million more  Americans to the program. Those who have employer-sponsored insurance,  I don't think they will want to give up their employer-sponsored  insurance and trust in BernieCare.   So our last hope, we think, is relieving folks from the burdens of  the Affordable Care Act in a way that preserves President Trump's goals  of caring for all, taking care of those with preexisting conditions,  covering all, lowering premiums, and eliminating mandates.   We have the basis of an approach. This past week, the HELP Committee  has been having hearings, as well as the Finance Committee. Both  Democratic and Republican Governors, insurance commissioners,  stakeholders of other sorts, Medicaid directors, and all, whether  Democratic or Republican, Governor or Medicaid director or insurance  Commissioner, have said that if we give the States the flexibility to  come up with their own solutions, they will find solutions that work  better for their State than the Affordable Care Act--and it makes total  sense. Clearly, Alaska is different than Rhode Island. Louisiana is  different than Missouri. If we can come up with solutions specific for  each State, as opposed to a one-size-fits-all that comes out of  Washington, DC, these Governors, Medicaid directors, and insurance  commissioners of both parties think we can do a better job.   We have a model of this. The Children's Health Insurance Program,  also known as the CHIP program, has been very successful. It works on a  block grant that comes down to States. States pull down the dollars.  They can roll over money for 2 years, and they provide a policy for the  children in their State. There are certain criteria and safeguards  regarding what that policy must look like.   In fact, Senator Ron Wyden, last night, finished up his remarks  praising the CHIP program, that it was reauthorized and what a victory  for the health of children because this is a program that will work.  There is a little irony there, as Senator Wyden had just finished  criticizing the Graham-Cassidy-Heller amendment, which is patterned  after the CHIP program. The irony, of course, is that he says our  amendment will not work, and then he goes on to praise the program  through which the money will flow and after which it is patterned.   What we do through the program is take the dollars going to States  currently through the Affordable Care Act, and we pool them together  and deliver them to States in a block grant, very similar and, indeed,  through the CHIP program. Along that way, we equalize how much each  American receives toward her care, irrespective of where she lives.   Why do I say that? Right now, 37 percent of the revenue from the  Affordable Care Act goes to Americans in four States--37 percent of the  revenue goes to those who live within four States. That is frankly not  fair. I have nothing against those four States, but I don't see why a  lower income American in Mississippi should receive so much less than a  lower income American in Massachusetts or why someone in Arizona should  be treated differently than someone in New York. I think we should  equalize that treatment. Americans think that is fair. We do that with  Medicare and Social Security and other popular programs. It is  something we should do, as well, as we attempt to provide insurance for  all to achieve President Trump's goals.   One example of this, by the way--Pennsylvania has twice the  population of Massachusetts. Both of those States expanded Medicaid.  Massachusetts gets 58 percent more money than does Pennsylvania. Again,  Pennsylvania has twice the population of Massachusetts, but  Massachusetts gets 58 percent more money. Both Northeastern States have  cities with a high cost of living, but somehow Massachusetts does that  much better.   Our goal, though, is through this grant that goes through the CHIP  program--which Senators like Senator Wyden have praised, and rightfully  so, as being an effective program for improving health, with safeguards  needed to make sure the money is used wisely and that all States and  all residents within those States will receive about the same amount of  money toward their healthcare. This would be, if you will, not a  Democratic plan, not a Republican plan but an American plan, in which  Senators vote to trust the people in their State over a Washington  bureaucrat.   We have critics who don't understand our bill. It is a partisan bill,  we are told.   No. If you look at the residents of the States who do better under  our plan, it includes States represented by Democratic Senators.  Virginia does far better because they will get the dollars they  currently do not--as do Floridians, represented by a Democratic  Senator; Missouri does, represented by the Presiding Officer now but  also by a Democratic Senator; and others that are represented by  Democratic Senators, but the lower income Americans in those States  actually have resources they currently do not have. Indeed, I implore  those Senators not to vote a party line but rather to vote for those  lower income Americans in their States so they can have the resources  needed for their better health.   I will conclude by saying one more time: We have one more chance. On  the Democratic and Republican sides, we recognize that the Affordable  Care Act is unsustainable. On the Republican side, we want to give  power back to the patients, back to the States, fulfilling the wish of  those Democratic and Republican Governors, insurance commissioners, and  Medicaid directors to give them the flexibility to do what they wish to  do.   The Democratic vision, BernieCare, if you will, of which he has 16  cosponsors, is to consolidate every decision in Washington, DC. As for  me, I will vote with the States, I will vote with the people, and I  will vote with the wisdom of the average American as opposed to the  benign ``we know better than you'' attitude of Washington, DC.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.
