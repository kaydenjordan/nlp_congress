 Madam President, today I rise to recognize the  Palace Theater in Waterbury, CT as it celebrates 100 years of artistic  achievement and advocacy.   The Palace Theater originally opened on January 28, 1922. With the  culmination of a $1 million investment in decor by Sylvester Z. Poli  and the remarkable architectural work of Thomas Lamb, the theater soon  became a hub for cultural activity in Waterbury before the onset of  World War II.   The ornate building started as a movie and vaudeville house. Over the  past century, the Palace has hosted a wide breadth of performances and  productions, from silent films to rock concerts and everything in  between. In 1983, the U.S. Department of the Interior honored the  Palace Theater by listing it on the National Register of Historic  Places.   In 1987, the theater closed for 18 years. However, a 3-year, $30  million restoration, renovation, and expansion project impressively  reshaped the Palace. When it reopened, the theater was a state-of-the- art, 90,000-square-foot arena. Now a vast complex, the Palace is known  as Greater Waterbury's Center for the Performing Arts.   In its current state, the Palace hosts educational programming,  Broadway tours, and a variety of family entertainment. The theater's  team is committed to serving the greater Waterbury community by  establishing not just a magnificent artistic site but also a highly  regarded educational and cultural center.   The Palace Theater is recognized as one of the premier arts  facilities in New England, and I have had the privilege of visiting on  a number of occasions to speak with the staff there. I am continuously  impressed by the Palace's record of achievement and the tireless  dedication of everyone involved to furthering arts education and  advocacy for countless Connecticut residents and visitors.   I applaud the theater on its extraordinary history of accomplishment,  and I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating the Palace  Theater on 100 years of excellence.                            ____________________
