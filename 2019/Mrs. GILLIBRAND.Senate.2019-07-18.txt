 Mr. President, I reserve the right to object.   I am grateful that we now have this agreement on timing so that we  can get to the floor next week and have an up-or-down vote on the 9/11  first responders bill and the healthcare they desperately need.   I just want to go to the merits of Senator Lee's amendment because I  think there is a misunderstanding. I understand that there is a concern  about 72 years and that my colleague believes it is a recipe for  trouble, but the truth is, the timing is limited for this bill because  these men and women aren't going to survive. So many of them are  already sick and dying, and all they care about is just being able to  provide for their families.   There is nothing about this bill that is trying to play politics with  the lives of men. There is going to be no fraud. There is going to be  no disuse. This is literally all that is necessary for families to  survive during these horrible times when their loved ones are dying.   I will not support my colleague's amendment because it will cap the  bill needlessly, and it will mean that if there are survivors who still  need healthcare, they will have to come back and walk these halls  again. The gravest concern I have is that we dare ask these brave men  and women to do this all over again. To watch someone come to the  Capitol with an oxygen tank, in a wheelchair, unable to breathe or talk  properly because of their cancer and their illness, is something I  cannot accept.   I am grateful that we now have a time agreement for Wednesday, and I  am grateful that we now have a chance to get an up-or-down vote and to  get this done.   I yield the floor.
