 Mr. Speaker, this is Fatemeh. She is not a terrorist.  She is a 4-month-old baby girl who is in immediate need of open heart  surgery. Her parents desperately want the best care for her, so they  planned to bring her from their home in Iran to Portland, Oregon, to  one of the best hospitals for pediatric heart surgery. That is where  Fatemeh's uncle and grandparents all live. They are U.S. citizens.   Then President Trump hastily issued the executive order, and the  family's plans were brought to a halt. The order is supposed to expire  in 90 days, but Fatemeh's family does not know if she can wait that  long.   Now, I don't know what the President had in mind when he signed that  order, but it probably wasn't baby Fatemeh. Keeping 4-month-old babies  out of our country does not make us safer. It puts her life in danger  and it diminishes the United States in the eyes of the world.   My office has reached out to Fatemeh's family in Oregon to be of  assistance, but it is heartbreaking and disgraceful that this even  happened. I hope the courts invalidate this unconstitutional executive  order soon, and I hope it is in time for baby Fatemeh.                            ____________________
