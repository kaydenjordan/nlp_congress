 Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay special  tribute to the remarkable life and legacy of Ms. Sarah Keys Evans. Her  courage left an unforgettable mark on our Nation's history.   On August 1, 1952, 3 years before Rosa Parks, Ms. Keys, who was a  private in the Women's Army Corps, refused to give up her seat on a bus  in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina, leading to the landmark case of  Sarah Keys v. Carolina Coach Company.   Her stand against discrimination helped ignite the civil rights  movement.   This past November, at the age of 94, Ms. Sarah Keys Evans passed,  leaving us reflecting on her enduring impact on humanity.   Let us honor Ms. Sarah Keys Evans by continuously striving for a  nation where opportunity for all flourishes.                            ____________________
