 Madame President, Senator Cassidy and I are reintroducing  a simple bill that can have a big impact: the Know Your Social Security  Act. The bill clarifies the law about Congressional intent so that  every worker over 25 receives a paper Social Security statement in the  mail each year, unless the worker has accessed their statement online  or declined to receive the statement in the mail.   The story is well known in Social Security circles, but it bears  repeating: the origin story of the Social Security statement all  started with the ``powerful'' Committee on Finance. Senator Daniel  Patrick Moynihan spelled out the reasoning: ``All of us pay into Social  Security but rarely, until we become beneficiaries, do we ever hear  from Social Security . . . in every paycheck, we see money withheld for  Social Security, but we hear nary a word from the Social Security  Administration. Let us take this simple step [ sending statements] to  reassure Americans that Social Security will be there for them.''   After enactment and once fully phased in, every worker aged 25 and  [[Page S4778]]  older received an annual statement from Social Security starting in the  year 2000. After a few years, Social Security's website allowed workers  to access their statement online. At the time, that was a nice  feature--and did not impact the mailing of statements. Later--to fund  more pressing needs--SSA viewed the online option as ``providing'' the  worker with a statement and fulfilling the requirements of the law. SSA  stopped mailing the statements in 2011 to everyone over 25. Currently,  only individuals over the age of 60 who are not receiving benefits  receive statements automatically through the mail.   Paper statements delivered through the mail are desirable because no  action is necessary by the worker and the statement is a yearly  reminder to the worker to think about the future. Research has shown  that workers provided with statements are significantly more likely to  save, more certain about their retirement income, and have higher  satisfaction with their finances relative to those who are not provided  with any type of financial planning materials. Providing Social  Security statement through the mail is a simple policy that could help  many workers, hopefully leading to better decisions about their  financial future.   Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee Chairman John Larson and  Ways and Means Committee Member Vern Buchanan are reintroducing the  companion bill in the House of Representatives. The bill is endorsed by  AARP, Alliance for Retired Americans, Envelope Manufacturers  Association (EMA), Justice in Aging, NAACP, National Committee to  Preserve Social Security and Medicare, Paralyzed Veterans of America,  Social Security Works, Strengthen Social Security Coalition, The Arc of  the United States, and The Senior Citizens League. I hope our  colleagues in the Senate will join us and cosponsor the Know Your  Social Security Act. Together, we can work towards better retirement  outcomes for all workers.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE:   S. 2207. A bill to temporarily increase the availability of temporary  nonimmigrant nonagricultural workers for the purposes of restoring  American forests, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the  Judiciary.
