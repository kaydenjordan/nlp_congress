 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of clean water and  in opposition to H.R. 1.   I proudly represent New York's Hudson Valley, the birthplace of the  modern environmental movement.   In 1962, community members fought back against a massive, dirty power  plant on Storm King Mountain, overlooking my alma mater at West Point,  that would have pumped toxic chemicals into our Hudson River.   Ultimately, that fight led to the passage of the National  Environmental Policy Act, landmark legislation that to this day  protects and preserves access to clean water, air, and soil.   Tragically, my community has a long and well-documented history of  big corporations dumping toxic pollutants, particularly PFAS, in our  waterways. While there are many reasons I oppose this bill, I rise  today to speak on this aspect, in particular.   You would think that keeping toxic chemicals out of our water and  away from our kids would be a priority for everyone in this body.    Sadly, after reading this bill, that is clearly not the case. Rather  than working to help families dealing with water poisoned by these  forever chemicals, my colleagues are trying to pass legislation that  will actually increase the prevalence of these toxins.   Every single day in my district, we have kids in Newburgh and seniors  in Middletown who cannot access clean water. Asthma rates across my  district greatly outpace the national average because of these very  pollutants. The Hudson River, which provides drinking water for over  100,000 of my constituents, is still overrun with PCBs and PFAS. To  introduce a bill that allows more PFAS and other contaminants into our  water without any consideration of safety is an insult to my community  and to the American people.   I will vote against this bill.
