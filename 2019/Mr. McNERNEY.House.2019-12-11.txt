 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and  for bringing this bill forward. I rise in support of H.R. 3, the Elijah  E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   We are here today to debate an issue that shouldn't need any  discussion from Members of this body. We have all heard from  constituents back home forced to choose between critical medications  and basic needs because prescription drugs are just too expensive.   Just this week, one of my constituents, Marta, shared her story with  me. Marta suffers from an autoimmune disease that causes her own body  to attack her muscles, and without medication, she struggles to see.  Even the slightest movement feels like a colossal feat, including her  breathing.   The prescription drug she needs in order to walk or even just to  breathe was once available for free, but the medication she is now  taking costs an outrageous $375,000 a year. Who can afford that?   While Marta's insurance covers some of the cost, it is a constant  fight for her to get the medication she needs to be able to live her  life.   What good are miracle drugs if people can't afford them?   As Members of Congress, we must do everything in our power to ensure  that people can afford lifesaving and life-changing drugs. Under H.R.  3, the government would be empowered to negotiate directly with the  drug companies to lower prices for the American people.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3 for Marta and the millions of  Americans burdened by skyrocketing prescription drug costs.
