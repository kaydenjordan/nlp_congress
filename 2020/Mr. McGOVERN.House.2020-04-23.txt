 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 938 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 938           Resolved, That House Resolution 935 is hereby adopted.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), the  distinguished ranking member of the Rules Committee, pending which I  yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this  resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, before we get into the resolution before  us, I want to speak to my colleagues about an important issue.   Over the last several weeks, I have heard from Democrats and  Republicans, who have expressed concern that we, as a House, are not  adequately prepared to do our business during a pandemic. They are  right.   Over a month ago, I prepared a report that I sent to everyone in the  House--Democrats and Republicans--about possible ways that we could  operate remotely. I received constructive feedback from both sides of  the aisle, and this week I released text of a proposal that I hoped  could have been voted on today.   The Republican leader had some objections to that proposal, and our  Speaker has agreed to continue the conversation for 2 more weeks. I  have always believed that, whenever possible, any changes to our rules  should be bipartisan, and I still believe that.   However, the status quo, in my opinion, is unacceptable and  dangerous. I am not talking about to Members of Congress; more  importantly, it is dangerous to everyone we come in contact with.   The year is 2020. Technology has advanced and improved considerably  over the last 231 years. And, yes, there are problems with some of the  technology  [[Page H1908]]  that exists out there, but there are low-tech approaches to dealing  with remote participation by our Members, and there are higher-tech  ways to deal with it. And we can work that out. There are smart people  in this Congress who can figure all of this out. But I believe both  sides of the aisle need to have some urgency in addressing this issue,  especially in light of the statements by the head of the CDC and other  medical experts, that things could be very problematic come the fall. I  hope and I pray that that is not the case. But we need to be prepared  so that we can do the people's business.   I also want to publicly acknowledge my ranking member, the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole). We don't see eye-to-eye on this issue yet,  but over our years-long working relationship and friendship, we have  found common ground many, many times. A task force is going to be  convened today that includes myself, Mr. Cole, the chair and ranking  member of the House Administration Committee, Ms. Lofgren, and Mr.  Davis, as well as Democratic Leader Hoyer and Republican Leader  McCarthy to discuss these matters.   I have been saying this for a month, and I am going to say it again  here today: If you are a Member of Congress and you care about this  issue, call me. I want to hear from Members what they think about this  critically important matter.   Now, back to the measure before us.   Madam Speaker, on Wednesday, the Rules Committee met and reported a  rule, House Resolution 938, providing that upon passage of the rule, H.  Res. 935, which establishes a Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus  Crisis as a select investigative subcommittee of the Committee on  Oversight and Reform is hereby adopted.   Madam Speaker, we are here today as Congress continues responding to  the biggest public health and economic emergency this Nation has seen  in 100 years: The coronavirus pandemic.   What started just weeks ago half a world away is having a devastating  impact across our country. No community has been spared:   More than 855,000 cases have been confirmed;   Nearly 48,000 lives lost as of the time we are meeting right now;   And more than 22 million initial unemployment claims filed in the  past month.   Some regions of our country have now lost as many jobs over the last  month as they did during the worst year of the Great Recession.   These statistics are not just numbers on a page, Madam Speaker. These  are our neighbors. They are our family. They are our friends. Their  health is at risk, and their economic reality has changed overnight.  Since the start of this pandemic, Congress has provided more than $2  trillion in emergency relief to get small businesses the financial help  that they need to survive, to help hospitals and healthcare workers on  the front lines, to expand testing, to provide every American access to  an affordable vaccine when it is developed. And I could go on and on  and on.   We need to make sure these resources are going where Congress  intended, that they are helping struggling Americans and small  businesses without any rampant fraud or abuse, and that companies  aren't taking part in price-gouging or profiteering.   That is what this Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus is all  about. This proactive approach is what then-Senator Harry Truman  spearheaded at the dawn of World War II to ensure Federal dollars spent  then saved lives on the battlefield.   Well, today the battle is much different. It is against a worldwide  pandemic currently without a vaccine or preventative treatment. But our  aggressive oversight should be the same. Democratic governors and  Republican governors all over the country are pleading for more tests,  despite the billions we have allocated to provide them.   The Republican governor of Maryland has said the lack of available  testing is the number one stumbling block in America. He is absolutely  right.   The President talks about reopening America, but Madam Speaker, how  about first testing America? Without that, we can't fully track and  contain this virus. We need to make sure that the money we provided for  testing is actually going to testing. We need to make sure that our  hospitals have all the PPE equipment that they need.   In my home city of Worcester in Massachusetts, we recently opened up  a field hospital in our convention center. The day before we opened,  there was considerable anxiety because they had enough PPE maybe to  last for a couple of days. Now working together with the governor and  others, we were able to remedy that situation, but for so many of our  healthcare institutions, for our first responders, trying to find PPE  is like something out of the movie The Hunger Games. States competing  with States, competing with the Federal Government, people receiving  calls--I know somebody who knows somebody in China who might have  lifesaving masks. Can you maybe follow up that lead? That is not the  way this is supposed to work.   In the United States of America, the wealthiest Nation on the face of  the Earth, officials are making cold calls to try to get enough  equipment to survive the next surge of patients. Relying on the  goodwill of people and businesses when they should be able to count on  Federal agencies. Congress provided money for this equipment. We need  to make sure it is going where it is badly needed.   Madam Speaker, as we talk today about what Congress has done, I want  to take a moment to talk about what it has not done, and that is  provide enough for hungry families during this pandemic.   You know, the President and so many of his allies in the Senate  continue to block efforts to increase SNAP benefits for hungry people  trying to put food on the table for their families. The demand for food  banks right now wraps around city blocks in some places. We have seen  it on TV. The lines go for miles. This is a crisis of food insecurity  that we haven't seen in this country since the Great Depression.   Madam Speaker, whatever happened to taking care of the neediest among  us? Maybe the President doesn't have to worry about where his next meal  is going to come from, but millions and millions and millions of  Americans do. They are terrified.   We should be suspending this administration's SNAP cuts. We should be  strengthening nutrition assistance for those impacted by this pandemic.  And we should be showing the American people that ending hunger is not  a partisan issue. But some on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue  have chosen instead to take meals away from families.   Just yesterday the Secretary of Agriculture tried to paper over their  disgraceful record by taking credit for the bill that we passed in a  bipartisan way in Congress. The USDA didn't increase SNAP benefits by  40 percent; the House Democrats led that charge and, thankfully, many  of my Republican colleagues supported that in the Families First bill.   And by the way, while we are at it, USDA was in court trying to kick  millions of people off of SNAP through their disastrous regulatory  scheme.   The only thing this administration has done is to try to push people  off of nutrition assistance. I think it is coldhearted and I think it  is cruel for the Senate majority leader and others to turn their backs  on struggling families. That needs to be fixed, and it has to be fixed  in our next bill. And I hope in this Chamber, we can come together-- Democrats and Republicans--and deal with it.   I know that it is unrelated to the underlying measure here, but  hungry families are being ignored in this country. Sadly, even in the  best of times, poor people oftentimes get ignored by this Chamber. I  worry that in the worst of times, what we are going through right now,  that these people, these individuals, these families become invisible.  We cannot let that happen. I want them to know that this House is  listening to them, and we will continue to fight to strengthen the  programs they rely on.   Now, I don't know what is radical about that. Just as I don't  understand why some on the other side are against a subcommittee that  is designed to make sure that Federal dollars are spent well.                                time  1015    I mean, that is what this is about. That is it.  [[Page H1909]]    This is an extraordinary time. We have sent trillions of dollars into  our communities. They should be going to small businesses and not to  big corporations--our workers, not the wealthy and those already well- off. Our workers are the ones who should be our priority. We need to  make sure that that is what is happening here.   If you believe this administration has done things perfectly, then  you have nothing to fear. But the American people have a lot of  questions and they deserve answers, and they expect us to live up to  our constitutional responsibilities with regard to oversight, and they  deserve to know that their tax dollars are being well spent.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record an article,  entitled, ``Democrats Pushed for Robust Oversight of the $2.2 Trillion  Coronavirus Aid Package. It Hasn't Happened Yet,'' detailing the need  for oversight. The article explains that rapidly approved funds are  being spent quickly with little monitoring or oversight.                        [From TIME, April 17, 2020]  Democrats Pushed for Robust Oversight of the $2.2 Trillion Coronavirus                    Aid Package. It Hasn't Happened Yet                            (By Alana Abramson)         Some of the most heated negotiations between Democrats and       Republicans over last month's $2.2 trillion coronavirus       relief package were over who should watch how that money gets       spent. It is the largest emergency relief fund the U.S.       government has ever approved, and concerns over fraud and       abuse were rife. In particular, Democrats were outraged that       Republicans and the White House wanted to let the Treasury       Department distribute $500 billion to industry and states       without anyone overseeing the process, and vowed to block any       bill without that safeguard in place.        ``There was this idea that they put forth that there would       be a $500 billion slush fund for the Secretary of the       Treasury with no accountability whatsoever. Are you       kidding?'' House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last month after       the bill passed the Senate. ``For all respect in the world       for the Treasury Secretary, that was a complete nonstarter.''        Ultimately, the bill signed into law by President Donald       Trump mandates the massive tranche of aid will be overseen       through three key mechanisms: an inspector general at the       Treasury Department to oversee that $500 billion Treasury       fund, and Congress and executive branch panels, which will       also monitor the Treasury fund and broadly oversee the law's       implementation, respectively.        But more than two weeks later, after hundreds of billions       of dollars have already flown out the door through the       Paycheck Protection Program, the Treasury's Inspector General       post has not yet been confirmed by the Senate and the two       panels are not fully staffed. Congress is preoccupied with       the unprecedented task of managing dueling public health and       economic crises remotely, and Trump, whose administration has       blocked Congressional oversight for years, has already       threatened to scuttle the process. When he signed the bill       into law in March, he said he would not allow the Inspector       General overseeing the executive branch's committee to submit       reports to Congress without his supervision, arguing it was       unconstitutional.        ``It's incredibly problematic . . . those oversight       mechanisms don't do us much good if they aren't       functioning,'' Liz Hempowicz, Director of Public Policy at       the Project on Government Oversight, wrote in an e-mail to       TIME. ``This money is being spent incredibly quickly. The       (Small Business Administration) has already spent the $349       billion dollars allocated to the Paycheck Protection Program.       It's imperative that these oversight mechanisms are fully       functional so we can have confidence that this money won't be       lost to waste, fraud, or abuse.''        The group with the broadest oversight jurisdiction in the       $2.2 trillion CARES Act is the executive branch panel, called       the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. Glenn Fine,       who was acting Inspector General at the Pentagon, was quickly       appointed  [[Page H1910]]       to lead the committee at the end of last month but was       removed by Trump just a week later. The President did not       provide a specific reason, but Fine's ouster was part of a       broader re-shuffling of watchdogs.        Although the committee is composed of nearly two dozen       inspectors general who have been appointed, the top spot       remains vacant. The law mandates that Michael Horowitz, the       Inspector General for the Department of Justice who heads the       Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and       Efficiency, appoint a new head, but he has not yet announced       Fine's replacement. A spokesperson for Horowitz did not       respond to a query about when a new replacement would be       named.        On April 4, Trump announced that he had appointed Brian       Miller to serve as the Inspector General for the Treasury       department. Miller has over 15 years of federal experience;       he spent nine years as the Inspector General for the General       Services Administration, working under former Presidents       George W. Bush and Barack Obama. But since 2018, he has       worked as a Special Assistant to the President and Senior       Associate Counsel in the White House counsel's office. His       tenure there coincided with some of the White House counsel's       most high profile feuds with House Democrats in their       oversight probes, including Trump's impeachment last       December.        Democrats lambasted Miller's appointment, arguing that a       Trump staffer would be unable to exercise the kind of       independence the job requires. ``To nominate a member of the       President's own staff is exactly the wrong type of person to       choose for this position,'' Senate Minority Leader Chuck       Schumer said in a statement after Trump's announcement. Since       confirmations of presidential appointees now only require a       simple majority in the Senate, it's likely that Miller will       be confirmed despite Democrats' objections. But since he       cannot be confirmed by unanimous consent, lawmakers have to       physically be in Washington for that to happen--and they are       not expected to return until May 4th at the earliest.        The final component of the oversight framework, the       Congressional commission, is also incomplete. The bill       mandates that the top four leaders in Congress--Schumer,       Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and House       Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy--each select a member for the       panel. The fifth member will chair the committee and be       jointly selected by Pelosi and McConnell.        Schumer has appointed Bharat Ramamurti, who previously       worked for Elizabeth Warren as an economic adviser, on the       panel. On Friday, McCarthy announced he had selected Rep.       French Hill, McConnell announced he had chosen Pennsylvania       Sen. Pat Toomey, and Pelosi selected Florida Rep. Donna       Shalala. But as of Friday evening, the chair has not been       selected, so the panel can't fully function. Pelosi told       reporters in her weekly press conference on Thursday that she       and McConnell had agreed to submit names to each other for       their joint pick.        There are signs that additional oversight of the massive       relief package not set up expressly in the law is also moving       forward. Pelosi has appointed House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn       to lead the House Select Committee on the coronavirus crisis,       which she says will be a bipartisan committee dedicated to       oversight of all of the funds. And McConnell announced Friday       that Idaho Senator Mike Crapo will lead the Senate's efforts.        In a New York Times op-ed earlier this week, Ramamurti       urged Congress to act swiftly so his specific panel can get       to work. ``Our watching eyes can help ensure that the money       broadly benefits American families,'' he wrote. ``There isn't       time to waste.''     Madam Speaker, I include for the Record an article,  entitled, ``Congressional Oversight of the CARES Act Could Prove  Troublesome,'' detailing the need for oversight. The article says  oversight will help limit fraud and accelerate effective use of  appropriated funds.                      [From Brookings, April 15, 2020]      Congressional Oversight of the CARES Act Could Prove Troublesome                             (By Jackson Gode)         On March 27th, President Trump signed the CARES Act       providing for more than $2 Trillion in federal spending in       response to the COVID-19 crisis. Overseeing the outlay of       relief funding from the bill will be no easy task, given its       size, complexity and the backdrop of the 2020 election.        However, this is not the first time that a major government       rescue package has included oversight measures. The 2008       Emergency Economic Stabilization Act created the office of       the Special Inspector General for the Targeted Asset Relief       Program the powers of which were strengthened by the SIGTARP       Act of 2009. In just over a decade, SIGTARP has recovered $11       Billion in misspent funds and successfully convicted 380       fraudulent actors, leading many to consider it a success.        Members of Congress sought to mimic this success by       including three major mechanisms to oversee spending within       the CARES Act. The Pandemic Response Accountability Committee       will be made up of Inspectors General from, at minimum, nine       federal agencies, and be responsible for oversight of outlays       for the entire bill. A new office within the Department of       the Treasury, the Special Inspector General for Pandemic       Recovery, will oversee the $500 billion Treasury fund for       targeted loans to large businesses. Brian Miller, a White       House lawyer and former GSA Inspector General, has already       been selected for this role. Finally, a Congressional       Oversight Commission will include four members appointed by       party leadership in each chamber and a chairperson agreed to       by the speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader.       The Commission will oversee economic stability efforts by the       Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board.        The CARES Act also includes funding increases for several       preexisting oversight bodies providing more than $140 million       for Inspectors General offices to investigate various aspects       of the bill and $20 million in funds for the Government       Accountability Office.        Even with these mechanisms and funding increases, Congress       will face several unique challenges while conducting       substantive oversight of pandemic relief.        First, the Trump Administration has indicated reluctance to       cooperate with oversight inquiries. Immediately after       President Trump signed the CARES Act, the White House       released a statement outlining his constitutional concerns       with the newly created Pandemic Response Accountability       Committee and Special Inspector General for Pandemic       Recovery.        This is not the first time that Trump has questioned the       legitimacy of oversight efforts. The administration is       currently tied up in several court battles regarding the       executive branch's ability to withhold information from       Congress. On March 16th, nearly a year after the original       request, the Supreme Court postponed oral arguments in a case       regarding the House Ways and Means Committee's efforts to       obtain President Trump's tax returns. The administration has       also withheld information related to White House security       clearances, natural disaster relief efforts, and other areas       of potential misconduct.        Second, both the House and Senate are on recess and it       remains unclear when they will return. Once members come back       to Washington, the number of committee hearings they hold       will likely be lower than normal with social distancing       recommendations remaining in effect.        Hearings are an essential part of Congress's oversight       mandate as they provide lawmakers with a public platform to       question administration officials that many rank-and-file       members do not receive on a day-to-day basis. In place of       hearings, members will have to rely more heavily on written       correspondence. While letters have the potential to be more       effective than hearings at obtaining detailed information,       recipients are only legally required to respond to inquiries       from committee chairs.        The current administration has made a habit of ignoring       written information requests and it remains too soon to tell       whether COVID-19 oversight will be met with similar       resistance. Documents released by the House Oversight and       Reform Committee on the availability of medical supplies from       the federal government's stockpile suggest that the       administration is responding to at least some inquiries.       Partial or private responses however, can make it difficult       for committees to signal a lack of cooperation to the public.        Third, as their efforts to oversee the Trump administration       response ramp up, House Democrats may find themselves       confronting intra-party cooperation challenges. Due to the       political visibility of the pandemic, committee chairs will       likely compete to demonstrate their willingness to hold the       administration accountable. Coordination among Democrats will       be necessary to ensure that panels' efforts are       complementary, rather than competitive.        Conflict between the parties will also create challenges.       The creation of a Select Committee on the Coronavirus       Pandemic already seems to be increasing tensions between       Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Minority Leader Kevin       McCarthy (R-Calif.) who indicated that Republicans will       object to a unanimous consent request creating the panel.       Speaker Pelosi has signaled the profile she expects the       committee's work to have by naming Majority Whip Jim Clyburn       (D-S.C.) as chair. The committee will have subpoena power,       but the House's experience so far this Congress with having       to go to court to try to enforce subpoenas illustrates the       limits of that tool.        Finally, the Trump administration has become famous for       vacancies and ``acting'' officials in the highest positions       of government. By tolerating a large number of acting       positions, the Senate has given up one of its most important       tools for influencing executive branch conduct. On April 3rd,       the President nominated five individuals to Inspector General       positions. However, while the Senate remains on recess, those       roles will continue to be served by officials in an acting       capacity.        Four of the IG offices receiving funding increases from the       CARES Act are currently headed by acting officials. Notably,       Glenn Fine, the Department of Defense Inspector General who       was originally appointed as the Chairman of PRAC, only served       in an acting capacity. On April 7th, President Trump removed       him from the DOD IG role and appointed EPA Inspector General       Sean O'Donnell, making Fine ineligible to be PRAC Chairman.  [[Page H1911]]         Congress will face many challenges protecting against fraud       and helping an economy stalled by the pandemic, which may       require members to find unique solutions for ensuring       effective implementation of the CARES Act. With $2 trillion       of taxpayer money on the line, nothing is more important than       effective oversight.     Madam Speaker, I include for the Record an April 4 ABC  News article, entitled, ``Experts Warn About Big Dollar Fraud in $2.2  Trillion Coronavirus Relief Package.''                       [From ABC News, April 4, 2020]  Experts Warn About Big Dollar Fraud in $2.2 Trillion Coronavirus Relief                                  Package                            (By Benjamin Siegel)         The U.S. government's historic $2.2 trillion coronavirus       aid relief package recently approved by Congress is highly       vulnerable to fraud and abuse, oversight experts and veteran       watchdogs who investigated abuse of the government's       financial system bailout more than a decade ago told ABC       News.        The size of the unprecedented relief package--in the scale       of spending and the number of businesses eligible for funds--      will make it difficult to verify the information from each       applicant, and how they plan to use their money.        With roughly 10 million Americans filing jobless claims       over the last two weeks, and millions of small businesses       seeking government aid to stay afloat, the need for the       government to immediately push out money to Americans and       into the staggering economy could hinder efforts to filter       out efforts from potential fraudsters to seek relief funds.        Tune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET       every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus       with the full ABC News team, including the latest news,       context and analysis.        ``Everybody's acceptance of some or a lot of fraud is going       to have to be high, because it's going to happen,'' said Earl       Devaney, who served as the top watchdog of the Recovery       Accountability and Transparency Board, which tracked the       stimulus spending following the Great Recession in the late       2000s.        Though the legislation mandates multiple oversight bodies,       if even a small percentage of the funds are misused, it could       mean fraud on the scale of potentially millions, if not       billions, before there are any efforts to recoup losses,       according to experts.        They see the $350 billion in funding earmarked for small       businesses in the form of forgivable loans as particularly       susceptible to abuse. Millions of small business owners began       applying to banks for the loans on Friday, though many       applicants and lenders experienced problems with the       program's rollout.        While the Treasury Department has said money will begin       flowing immediately, some institutions, including JP Morgan       Chase, said Thursday they would not be ready to receive       applications by Friday.        Other veteran investigators are concerned that the review       process, which leaves it up to banks to vet potential       borrowers and applicants to attest to their eligibility,       doesn't give authorities enough time to effectively weed out       potential fraud.        ``If you have fewer entities that has a lot of implications       for oversight. It's fewer entities to worry about. But it       also means that the processes for application can be a little       more thoughtful,'' Neil Barofsky, the former special       inspector general of the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief       Program (TARP), told ABC News.        ``In contrast here, the very purpose of these programs is       not to impact a relatively small number of institutions but       to reach as far and wide as possible,'' he said.        The small business loan initiative, known as the Paycheck       Protection Program, will be ``an extraordinarily easy program       to defraud, and it will be defrauded in massive ways,'' he       added.        The $2.2 trillion, 880-page CARES ACT approved by Congress       last week included oversight provisions, modeled after some       of the safeguards implemented to track the financial system       bailout and stimulus money after the Great Recession.        It formed three major groups to lead oversight efforts: A       new special inspector general, who will be nominated by Trump       and confirmed by the Senate, will be responsible for       oversight of the $500 billion fund administered by the       Treasury Department and Secretary Steven Mnuchin.        Trump plans to nominate Brian Miller, a special assistant       to the president and senior associate counsel in the Office       of White House Counsel, to serve as inspector general, the       White House announced Friday night.        A five-member panel appointed by a bipartisan group of       lawmakers will monitor the Treasury Department program and       Federal Reserve's implementation of the stimulus package.        The third group, the Pandemic Response Accountability       Committee, have the broadest mandate, aimed at rooting out       waste and fraud throughout programs in the entire $2.2       trillion relief package.        Led by Glenn Fine, the acting inspector general of the       Department of Defense who was part of the panel's precursor       following the financial crisis, the group will be able to       conduct audits, subpoena individuals and information, and       refer matters to the Justice Department for investigation.        ``Every time there's kind of an emergency surge in spending       like this it's even more important that there's additional       layers of oversight to make sure that everything is on the up       and up,'' Liz Hempowicz, the director of public policy at the       Project on Government Oversight, told ABC News.        House and Senate Democrats, who were particularly worried       about how the $500 billion supervised by Mnuchin will be       awarded, also pushed Republicans to add additional language       into the legislation preventing President Trump, his family,       top government officials and lawmakers from receiving loans       or investments from the Treasury programs.        Already, there are signs that President Trump and Democrats       could tangle over oversight of the massive stimulus programs       as money begins to flow from the federal government to       workers and businesses.        Trump's plans to nominate Miller, a former inspector       general for the General Services Administration, will likely       be met with criticism by Democrats. Inspectors General are       typically independent and apolitical appointees; Miller       played a role in rebuffing investigations into the withheld       military aid to Ukraine that led to Trump's impeachment.        In a signing statement last week, Trump said he wouldn't       allow the inspector general to share information with       Congress without ``presidential supervision,'' objecting to       the provisions of the law that require the watchdog to notify       Congress when they are ``unreasonably'' denied information       about the stimulus program.        Democrats criticized the comments, and on Thursday House       Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the formation of a special       select committee to provide additional oversight of the       recovery funds and the administration's management of the       coronavirus crisis, a move Republicans and the White House       quickly condemned as redundant.        Mnuchin on Thursday said he didn't think the panel was       necessary.        ``Both parties wanted us to have oversight, wanted us to       have transparency. We have full transparency,'' he said at       the daily White House coronavirus briefing.        ``It's witch hunt after witch hunt after witch hunt,''       Trump said of the select committee at the same briefing.        Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,       on Saturday, issued the following statement on the nomination       of Brian Miller to be special inspector general for pandemic       recovery:        ``The special inspector general needs to be independent       above all. Someone who currently works in the White House       counsel's office, serving a president who has tried to       silence other inspector generals and announced his intention       to silence this one, is not independent. It's no wonder       President Trump announced this nomination late on a Friday       evening.''        ``While Mr. Miller has requisite experience for this       position, he must clear a high bar to show the Senate he       would protect the interests of the American people over the       political interests of this administration.''        While it's not uncommon for both parties to snipe over the       use--and potential abuse--of stimulus funds, the level of       partisanship in Washington and the immediate need for the       funds to be delivered to businesses and Americans make this       situation much more difficult than the oversight efforts       following the last recession, Devaney told ABC News.        ``The atmosphere on the Hill, I thought it was acrimonious       when I was there. It's a lot worse today and I suspect that       whoever takes this job is going to be testifying once a       week,'' he said of the eventual special inspector general.        Former Rep. Tom Davis, R-Virginia, who served as chair of       the House Oversight Committee, defended the stimulus package,       given the time constraints put on lawmakers and the Trump       administration.        ``It's unlike anything I've ever seen in the last 50       years,'' he told ABC News. ``Emergency situations call for       emergency measures. You can't sit and write layers and layers       of oversight.''        ``There's always going to be money going to people who       shouldn't have gotten it,'' Davis said. ``The question is,       what were the alternatives?        Lawmakers and coronavirus stimulus watchdogs won't just       have this historic $2.2 trillion coronavirus package to       police. Conversations have already started on Capitol Hill       around a fourth phase of relief funding, including more money       for small businesses.     Madam Speaker, this emergency surge in spending to  confront the coronavirus is unprecedented, but the idea of what we are  establishing is not. As I said, then-Senator Truman proposed it at the  dawn of World War II. It worked then, and it will work now as well.   So if you believe that this administration has nothing to hide, then  nobody should oppose this and let the American people see how their  money is being spent.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House, who has been an  incredible leader during this pandemic.    Madam Speaker, the reason why we are doing this is  because the President is undercutting oversight.   Madam Speaker, I want to insert in the Record ``Trump Ousts Pandemic  Spending Watchdog Known for Independence.''                  [From The New York Times, April 7, 2020]       Trump Ousts Pandemic Spending Watchdog Known for Independence               (By Ben Protess, Steve Eder, and David Enrich)         Washington--President Trump moved on Tuesday to oust the       leader of a new watchdog panel charged with overseeing how       his administration spends trillions of taxpayer dollars in       coronavirus pandemic relief, the latest step in an abruptly       unfolding White House power play against semi-independent       inspectors general across the government.        The official, Glenn A. Fine, has been the acting inspector       general for the Defense Department since before Mr. Trump       took office and was set to become the chairman of a new       Pandemic Response Accountability Committee to police how the       government carries out the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief       bill. But Mr. Trump replaced Mr. Fine in his Pentagon job,       disqualifying him from serving on the new oversight panel.        The move came at a time when the president has been       reasserting authority over the executive branch and signaling       impatience with independent voices within the government that       he considers disloyal. In recent days, he fired an inspector       general who reviewed the whistle-blower complaint that led to       his impeachment, nominated a White House aide to another key       inspector general post, declared that he would ignore certain       oversight provisions in the new relief law and attacked       another inspector general who criticized virus testing       shortages.        Mr. Trump even cheered the firing of the captain of an       aircraft carrier for sending a letter to fellow Navy officers       pleading for help for his virus-stricken crew, castigating       the officer for airing unfavorable information. Only after a       loud backlash over the firing and the acting Navy secretary's       speech calling the captain ``stupid'' did the president       partly reverse himself and say he would look into it. The       acting Navy secretary, who said he had ordered the firing       because he assumed Mr. Trump might have done it himself       otherwise, took the hint and resigned on Tuesday.        The questions of accountability and loyalty within the       government have been persistent themes in the past three       years as Mr. Trump has repeatedly waged war with what he       calls ``the deep state.'' He has rejected the conventional       views that figures like the director of the F.B.I., the       attorney general, intelligence directors, uniformed military       commanders, ethics officers and now inspectors general should       have a degree of autonomy.        At his daily coronavirus briefing, Mr. Trump offered no       particular explanation for sidelining Mr. Fine but       characterized it as part of a larger shuffle of inspectors       general, some of them left over from past administrations,       and cited unspecified ``reports of bias.''        Critics said on Tuesday that it sent a message to       government watchdogs to tread softly. ``I cannot see how any       inspector general will feel in any way safe to do a good       job,'' said Danielle Brian, the executive director of the       Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit group. ``They       are all at the mercy at what the president feels.''        But Mr. Trump's allies said he felt burned by the       investigations of his campaign and associates and therefore       distrusts figures he perceives to be partisan foes within       government, particularly former F.B.I. officials who obtained       warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or       FISA, to investigate a campaign aide's ties to Russia.        ``I've never heard the president express frustrations about       independent oversight,'' said Cliff Sims, a former White       House aide.  [[Page H1914]]       ``But he doesn't think he should be subjected to his       political enemies in supposedly apolitical oversight roles.       This has been deeply ingrained in his psyche since the moment       he learned that FISA had been abused to spy on his       campaign.''        In removing Mr. Fine from his role overseeing pandemic       spending, Mr. Trump targeted a former Justice Department       inspector general who earned a reputation for aggressive       independence in scrutinizing the F.B.I.'s use of surveillance       and other law enforcement powers in the years after the Sept.       11, 2001, attacks.        Replacing Mr. Fine as the Pentagon's acting inspector       general will be Sean O'Donnell, who serves as the inspector       general at the Environmental Protection Agency and will do       double duty for the time being. A group of inspectors general       led by Michael E. Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector       general, will determine who will replace Mr. Fine as chairman       of the new pandemic oversight committee.        Created as part of the coronavirus relief bill, the       committee consists of nine inspectors general from across the       executive branch and will have an $80 million budget to hunt       for waste, fraud, abuse and illegality in the disbursement of       the $2.2 trillion approved by Congress to provide relief to       Americans affected by the pandemic.        In announcing Mr. Fine's short-lived role last week, Mr.       Horowitz had praised him as ``uniquely qualified'' to run       oversight of ``large organizations,'' citing his 11 years as       the top Justice Department watchdog and his four years       serving as the top Pentagon one.        ``The inspector general community recognizes the need for       transparency surrounding, and strong and effective       independent oversight of, the federal government's spending       in response to this public health crisis,'' Mr. Horowitz said       at the time.        Democrats immediately condemned Mr. Fine's sudden ouster as       ``corrupt,'' in the words of Senator Chuck Schumer of New       York, the minority leader. ``President Trump is abusing the       coronavirus pandemic to eliminate honest and independent       public servants because they are willing to speak truth to       power and because he is so clearly afraid of strong       oversight,'' Mr. Schumer said.        Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York and       the chairwoman of the House Oversight and Government Reform       Committee, called Mr. Trump's actions ``a direct insult to       the American taxpayers--of all political stripes--who want to       make sure that their tax dollars are not squandered on       wasteful boondoggles, incompetence or political favors.''        Still, it is not a given that Mr. O'Donnell will toe the       line at the Pentagon. At the E.P.A., he has issued reports       that are critical of Mr. Trump's appointed administrator,       Andrew R. Wheeler, who has sought to limit Mr. O'Donnell's       authority and oversight.        Only last week, after Mr. O'Donnell's office released a       report concluding that the E.P.A. failed to adequately warn       communities living in proximity to certain carcinogenic       chemicals of their health risks, Mr. Wheeler publicly rebuked       the inspector general's report for its ``tone and substance''       and demanded that he rescind it. Mr. O'Donnell refused.        Privately, some people within the government's inspector       general community suggested that the appointment of Mr.       O'Donnell to the Pentagon post would divert his oversight       from the E.P.A., which has continued to move forward with Mr.       Trump's agenda of reducing or eliminating public health and       environmental regulations, even as the coronavirus rages.        Before being appointed as the E.P.A. watchdog, Mr.       O'Donnell clerked for two federal judges and worked since       2005 as a career lawyer at the Justice Department, most       recently in the criminal division working on cases involving       fraud, corruption and national security.        At the Pentagon, Mr. O'Donnell will serve in an acting       capacity pending Senate action on Jason Abend, a Customs and       Border Protection official, who was nominated by Mr. Trump       last week to take on the post permanently. Mr. Fine remains       the No. 2 official at the Pentagon's watchdog office.        Late last month, several hours after Mr. Trump signed the       $2 trillion coronavirus relief and stimulus bill with fanfare       on television, he issued a signing statement challenging a       key safeguard congressional Democrats insisted upon as a       condition of approving $500 billion in corporate bailout       funds: that a special inspector general be empowered to       demand information about how the Treasury Department spends       the money and who would be required to tell Congress if       executive branch officials unreasonably balk.        In his signing statement, Mr. Trump effectively declared       that he could control what information goes to Congress about       any disputes over access to information about how and why the       money is spent. On Friday, he nominated Brian D. Miller, a       White House aide, to serve as the special inspector general       overseeing the corporate relief.        Then late that night, Mr. Trump fired the inspector general       for the intelligence community, Michael K. Atkinson, whose       insistence on telling Congress about the whistle-blower       complaint about Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine prompted       impeachment proceedings last fall.        At the same time, Mr. Trump also announced a slew of other       inspector general nominees, including Mr. Abend as the new       Defense Department inspector general, and three current and       former Justice Department officials to be the new inspectors       general at the C.I.A., the Education Department and the       Tennessee Valley Authority.        Mr. Trump redoubled his attacks on the acting inspector       general for the Department of Health and Human Services,       Christi A. Grimm, in a statement on Twitter on Tuesday, a day       after she released a report about hospitals facing severe       shortages in tests as they battle the pandemic:        Why didn't the I.G., who spent 8 years with the Obama       Administration (Did she Report on the failed H1N1 Swine Flu       debacle where 17,000 people died?), want to talk to the       Admirals, Generals, V.P. & others in charge, before doing her       report. Another Fake Dossier!--Trump Tweet        On Monday, Mr. Trump had suggested that Ms. Grimm's report       was politically biased against him. Ms. Grimm is a career       official who began work at the inspector general office late       in the Clinton administration and stayed there throughout the       Bush and Obama administrations, taking over the role of       acting inspector general in an interim capacity this year.        Mr. Trump's interest in inspectors general has grown more       intense lately. Until his most recent nominations, he had       failed to pick anyone for about one-third of the 37 inspector       general positions that are presidentially appointed,       according to the Project on Government Oversight. Those roles       were temporarily assumed by other officials whose lack of job       security and status typically makes them more cautious than a       permanent appointee, government experts say.     Madam Speaker, I also insert into the Record the  President's signing statement, which is crystal clear that he is trying  to undercut oversight. So we need to do our job here.                           STATEMENTS & RELEASES                         Statement by the President                        (Issued on: March 27, 2020)                                  HEALTHCARE         Today, I have signed into law H.R. 748, the ``Coronavirus       Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act'' or the ``CARES'' Act       (the ``Act''). The Act makes emergency supplemental       appropriations and other changes to law to help the Nation       respond to the coronavirus outbreak. I note, however, that       the Act includes several provisions that raise constitutional       concerns.        Section 15010(c)(3)(B) of Division B of the Act purports to       require the Chairperson of the Council of the Inspectors       General on Integrity and Efficiency to consult with members       of the Congress regarding the selection of the Executive       Director and Deputy Executive Director for the newly formed       Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. The Committee is       an executive branch entity charged with conducting and       coordinating oversight of the Federal Government's response       to the coronavirus outbreak. I anticipate that the       Chairperson will be able to consult with members of the       Congress with respect to these hiring decisions and will       welcome their input. But a requirement to consult with the       Congress regarding executive decision-making, including with       respect to the President's Article II authority to oversee       executive branch operations, violates the separation of       powers by intruding upon the President's power and duty to       supervise the staffing of the executive branch under Article       II, section 1 (vesting the President with the ``executive       Power'') and Article II, section 3 (instructing the President       to ``take Care'' that the laws are faithfully executed).       Accordingly, my Administration will treat this provision as       hortatory but not mandatory.        Section 4018 of Division A of the Act establishes a new       Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery (SIGPR)       within the Department of the Treasury to manage audits and       investigations of loans and investments made by the Secretary       of the Treasury under the Act. Section 4018(e)(4)(B) of the       Act authorizes the SIGPR to request information from other       government agencies and requires the SIGPR to report to the       Congress ``without delay'' any refusal of such a request that       ``in the judgment of the Special Inspector General'' is       unreasonable. I do not understand, and my Administration will       not treat, this provision as permitting the SIGPR to issue       reports to the Congress without the presidential supervision       required by the Take Care Clause, Article II, section 3.        Certain other provisions (such as sections 20001, 21007,       and 21010 of Division B of the Act) purport to condition the       authority of officers to spend or reallocate funds upon       consultation with, or the approval of, one or more       congressional committees. These provisions are impermissible       forms of congressional aggrandizement with respect to the       execution of the laws. The Congress may affect the execution       of the laws only by enacting a new statute in accordance with       the requirements of bicameralism and presentment prescribed       in Article I, section 7. My Administration will make       appropriate efforts to notify the relevant committees before       taking the specified actions and will accord the       recommendations of such committees all appropriate and       serious consideration, but it will not treat spending       decisions as dependent on prior consultation with or the       approval of congressional committees.        Finally, several provisions (such as sections 3511(d)(4)       and 3862 (creating section  [[Page H1915]]       744N(d)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) of       Division A of the Act) purport to require recommendations       regarding legislation to the Congress. Because Article II,       section 3 gives the President the authority to recommend only       ``such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient,''       my Administration will continue the practice of treating       provisions like these as advisory and non-binding.                                                      Donald J. Trump.                                          The White House, March 27, 2020.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the distinguished chair of the  Committee on Oversight and Reform.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Mrs. McBath).    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the Guidance for  Members and Attendees provided to us by the Office of the Attending  Physician.   While face coverings are not mandatory, they are certainly  recommended. The Office of Attending Physician has also advised that  ``a face cover will produce a minimal reduction in sound when using a  microphone. The face covering is likely to be most useful in preventing  viral spread while a person is speaking.''   So people can do whatever they want to do, but I would say, while we  are all trying to show how fearless we are, we should be mindful of the  people surrounding us. So until I am advised otherwise, I am going to  keep my mask on.                     Guidance for Members and Attendees                           House Committee on Rules         In order to accommodate this meeting of the House Committee       on Rules, the following guidelines have been developed in       consultation with the Office of the Attending Physician       (OAP), the Office of the Sergeant at Arms (SAA), and the       Committee on House Administration. The OAP continues to       recommend teleworking for all Congressional offices and that       Members and staff maintain 6-foot social distance spacing as       much as practicable when in the offices or the Capitol.        The OAP, in conjunction with guidance from the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention, recommends that all Members       and attendees should:        1. Avoid congregating in groups upon arrival to the room;        2. Use provided hand sanitizer;        3. Apply a face cover if a face covering is not already       worn (a face cover will be available for those who need       them);        4. Proceed directly to their seat, maintaining proper       distancing; and        5. Remain seated until the conclusion of the meeting, to       the extent possible.        Use of a face covering, while voluntary, is recommended for       this specific proceeding due to occasions when the six-foot       separation distance may be not be possible (Member private       communications with staff, document distribution if needed,       witness or staff movements, etc.).        The OAP has advised that a face cover will produce a       minimal reduction in sound when using a microphone. The face       covering is likely to be most useful in preventing viral       spread while a person is speaking.        Members are encouraged to attend without staff or to limit       themselves to a maximum of one staff person per Member if       necessary. Staff who do accompany their bosses are requested       to sit in the audience and only approach the dais if/when       needed.        Members and attendees should not engage in personal       greetings such as handshakes or embraces.        Members and attendees are asked to respect markings present       on chairs to prevent their use, in accordance with social       distancing guidelines.        Access restrictions to the Capitol Complex remain in place.       Per guidance from the SAA, House Office Buildings remain open       to Members, Congressional staff, and credentialed press.        When the meeting is adjourned, departure from the room       should continue to respect social distancing by avoiding       congregating in groups near the exit doors, hallways, or       elevators. Members and attendees should use waterless hand       cleansing upon exit after removing and disposing of their       face covering.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, when it comes to $2 trillion, I don't  think there can be enough oversight. I think our constituents expect us  to make sure that that money is being spent where it should be spent,  where Congress intended it.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I want to remind my colleagues, one of  our constitutional responsibilities is oversight. We just appropriated  over $2 trillion, and I applaud the Speaker of the House for making  sure that this Congress does its job and does proper oversight.   I don't know about their constituents, but my constituents are  puzzled why some of the money that was designed to go to small  businesses ended up going to these megabusinesses like Shake Shack or  Ruth's Chris Steak House, so they want accountability.   Two trillion dollars, I mean, is that too much to ask? So I applaud  the Speaker of the House for focusing us on making sure that we do our  job, but we do oversight. This select committee is warranted, it is  important, and I think Democrats and Republicans should overwhelmingly  support it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, we are waiting for a couple of other  speakers. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H1918]]    We are still waiting for a couple of additional speakers but let me  just say one thing here again. It is hard to believe what we are  hearing here.   My friends on one hand are telling the American people that we all  care deeply about oversight, we all want to make sure that the money is  being spent properly, but yet they are opposed to this.   It is $2 trillion that we have responded with to try to deal with the  crisis that we are faced with. That is a lot of money. To object to a  select committee to basically make sure that it is being spent properly  as this thing is unfolding, my colleagues have such a difficult time  dealing with that.   Madam Speaker, again, I applaud the Speaker of the House for her  leadership during this pandemic, not only on this, but on a whole range  of other issues. She has taken what my Republican friends in the Senate  and what the White House has proposed and made it better and made it  more responsive to average working people.   That is what this is about: making sure the money gets to the people  who need it, not to the people who don't need it, not to the big  corporations, not to the well-off or the well connected.   So I don't understand all of the hand-wringing over this select  committee. This is an important select committee, just like the one  that then-Senator Truman did to make sure that the moneys that were  appropriated went to help win the war.   We want to win this war too.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Bustos).    Madam Speaker, I am absolutely stunned over the outrage  to sunshine and oversight. Give me a break.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Thompson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).    Madam Speaker, I am happy to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Fudge).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Mr. Cole--and he is my  friend. I appreciate all of his counsel and advice in the Rules  Committee, and I appreciate his respect for this institution.   I want to thank the distinguished Speaker of this House for her  leadership. This is a moment in history that demands strong leadership,  and she has risen to the occasion, and I applaud her and I appreciate  that.   I also want to thank all of those who work on the Hill here: the  Capitol Police, the Sergeant at Arms, the attending physician, the  chief administrative officer, and all of the people who maintain this  incredible building. I want to thank them. They protect us and they do  an unbelievable job.   Madam Speaker, I want to remind people that more than 855,000 cases  of coronavirus have been confirmed. Nearly 48,000 lives have been lost  as of today, more than 22 million initial unemployment claims filed in  the past month. Families will be changed forever. We are in a crisis,  and we should be proud that we have come together repeatedly in a  bipartisan way to move legislation forward to respond to that crisis.   Now, over $2 trillion we have approved to try to help our  constituents, protect them, and help protect small businesses, but that  is just part of our job. Our job is not just to appropriate the money  and just hope it goes to wherever it is supposed to go. We need to do  the oversight. We need to make sure that every single penny that we  have appropriated goes to where it needs to go.   I don't want to be here a year from now looking back and saying: Oh,  look at all of the waste and all of the abuse. Look at all of the well- connected people who benefited, but look at all the people who needed  the funds who didn't.   We need to get this right. That is what this select committee is  about. This should not be controversial.   Again, I am stunned by the resistance to sunshine and transparency.  That is what this is about, and I hope and pray that everything goes  perfectly. But we cannot take that chance. We have to make sure we live  up to our constitutional responsibility.   So I urge my colleagues to vote for this rule so that we can  establish this select committee.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.
