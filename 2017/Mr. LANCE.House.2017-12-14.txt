 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate three State high  school football champions in New Jersey's Seventh Congressional  District: Westfield High School, North Hunterdon High School, and  Somerville High School.   Westfield High School finished its year with its third consecutive  State championship and with its 37-consecutive-game winning streak  intact. The North Hunterdon Lions won their division, and Somerville  High School finished as State football champions with award-winning  Coach Jeff Vanderbeek at the helm.   I congratulate the communities and families supporting our student  athletes. I also congratulate all of the faculty and coaches who devote  themselves to cultivating and nurturing the talent of these athletes.   Each of those public schools, in addition to athletic achievement,  has also been recognized for academic achievement regularly across the  Nation, highlighting that New Jersey's reputation of having among the  best public schools in the Nation continues.                            ____________________
