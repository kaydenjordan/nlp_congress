 Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Green, Congressman  Green, Chairman Green, Judge Green, Pastor Green, public servant Al  Green.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my colleagues' resolution  recognizing Islam as one of the great religions of the world.   I commend my friend, Representative Green, for honoring Islam. This  action helps to honor the millions of Muslims of many different  backgrounds who proudly call America home.   Mr. Speaker, as one of three Muslims currently serving in Congress,  it is my great privilege to speak here today in the people's House  about a special faith. Though we are a minority in this country, we  have participated fully in the story of our Nation since its earliest  days. Even before America's founding and our Declaration of  Independence, this brilliant declaration enshrined freedom of faith and  religion for all of us.   Today, there are Muslims in all parts of the country who are business  owners, who are teachers, construction workers, engineers, lawyers,  judges, elected officials.   The first Muslim in Congress, my friend, comes to mind--Keith  Ellison. We now have sisters Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, and the list  goes on, statewide and locally.                                time  1615    Throughout this COVID-19 pandemic, Mr. Speaker, you would be hard- pressed to find a hospital in this great Nation without a Muslim  healthcare worker on the front lines serving fellow Americans, not just  in urban centers, but in suburbia, in rural parts of our country.   As more and more Muslims call America home, Mr. Speaker, we will  continue working tirelessly, guided by our faith, to ensure our great  country lives up to the principles of equality, compassion, and  opportunity for all. Our faith keeps us motivated every day to advance  these great goals.   Around the world, billions of Muslims are also engaged in this  struggle, also using their faith as a guide. We have seen what has  happened with Uighur Muslims. We are seeing the dispute in Kashmir. We  are seeing conflict dealing with the Israeli-Palestinian question. And,  sadly, we still see Muslims who endure hurtful stereotypes and  discrimination on this journey.   But our faith teaches us to be bold, to be brave, and to always  choose love over hate. We will not be deterred, Mr. Speaker.   I am a proud Muslim. I am a proud American. I am honored to be a  member of a very diverse and growing global community, and I am  thankful to live in a country that enshrines the right to practice this  faith.   We wouldn't have the foundation for American Muslims in this country,  Mr. Speaker, were it not for the contribution of African-American  Muslims. Scholars say 30, 40, maybe even 50 percent of the slaves who  were brought here from West Africa were Muslim.   We see Muslims as first responders. I was one of them. We see Muslims  who were a part of responding to the call to fight against terrorism in  the post-9/11 reality, oftentimes thwarting potential attacks that you  will never hear about in the news. Muslims are on the front lines in  our law enforcement community and in our intelligence services.   Muslims have been critical in this country with establishing Islam  and promoting self-respect, self-determination, creating your own  enterprises and businesses. We hear terms now like ``stay woke.'' I  submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that that terminology came from the  contributions and the foundations laid by African-American Muslims.   It began as a kernel in the inception of this country, and it started  to blossom in the early 1920s and 1930s, during the Great Depression.  During those times, you had variations of Islam that was not Arabized.  Because if it was an Arab presenting Islam, it wouldn't have been  attractive. It certainly wouldn't have been attractive to me.   But the Islam that was presented was created in a way to fight  against the poison and toxicity of white supremacy. Now, you have a  beautiful religion with an interfaith coalition with Christian brothers  and sisters, Jewish brothers and sisters, Sikhs, Hindus, atheists,  Buddhists, all coming together to make America a better place.   Now, some people are comfortable with talking about Islam, and in  their critiques of Islam, they overlook the hypocrisy of their own  faith. You cannot really call yourself a lover of God and show hate for  others of a different faith. You cannot call yourself an elected  official and a representative of the people if you are only committed  to serving and representing one segment of the population. You  certainly can't call yourself a true public servant without recognizing  the contributions that have been made by this wonderful community.  [[Page H4477]]    I salute Representative Green for his bold leadership, for his  visionary leadership, as a proud Christian man in the tradition of  Jesus Christ, knowing that in my Father's house, there are many  mansions.   To stand up and recognize the wonderful religion of Islam, I commend  him, I thank him, because we are America.
