 Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois is  absolutely right. The votes are there to pass these six bills. The  majority leader, in effect, is acting as a buffer for the President. He  is not serving this body because he knows that his own Members would  vote for it and vote to reopen the government. That is because they are  hearing the American people tell them, as they are telling us: Reopen  the government.   That was the message that Senator Schumer delivered. It is simple,  direct, and it is true. The American people want the government  reopened. They know we have disagreements all the time. We disagree  about policy and politics, proposals and legislation, but we don't shut  down the government simply because we disagree. The government  continues to do its work and serve the American people even as we have  disagreements.   Our friends on the other side, the Republican leadership, are  complicit in this shutdown by refusing to permit us to do our duty and  our work, which is to consider and pass legislation that will keep the  government serving the people of the United States. If the President  vetoes those bills, there may well be enough votes here to override  them. That is our job as well.   The reason the American people want us to reopen the government is  that they know the crisis here is one that Donald Trump has made  himself. It is a manufactured crisis involving dedicated public  servants who are missing paychecks, taxpayers denied critical  government services, economic hardship for small businesses, and low- income Americans. It is a crisis that is spreading.   It is not a crisis at the border in security that the President,  supposedly, is witnessing as we speak here. There is a humanitarian  crisis at the border, which is also of Donald Trump's making, but the  broader crisis throughout this country will affect our economy, our  education system, our transportation, and the real security of this  country, which is our ability to help each other.   I have looked at those folks in the face, most recently the day  before yesterday, at Foodshare, our food bank in Connecticut, which  will soon be unable to meet the challenges and needs of the food  insecure in Connecticut because the Commodities Distribution Program  will be crippled. Their cost and transportation and storage will be  overwhelming and unmet. Children and seniors will begin to go hungry  because their reserves will be exhausted by the end of this month.   I have spoken to the Coast Guard members who will be unpaid. Alone  among our military services--unfairly, unfortunately, unacceptably-- they will be unpaid. We know in Connecticut the value of our Coast  Guard as a military branch of our government. We are home, proudly, to  the Coast Guard Academy, with over 2,000 Active-Duty servicemembers,  cadets, and civilian employees who are feeling the direct effect of  this Trump shutdown.   In reality, it is a Trump lockout, not a shutdown. He is locking out  so many dedicated workers of our Federal Government. But the Coast  Guard is continuing to work. It is the only branch of the military that  isn't guaranteed pay during this Trump shutdown because, by a quirk of  history, it is now part of the Department of Homeland Security, not the  Pentagon. These Active-Duty Coast Guard members based in New Haven and  New London and across the country are continuing to protect our  Nation's security, continuing to rescue Americans at sea, continuing to  interdict drugs that threaten our Nation, and they are going unpaid.   That is why a bipartisan group of Senators--and I want to thank  Senators Thune, Cantwell, and others--have introduced legislation to  pay them during this Trump shutdown and any other shutdown going  forward. I call on the Senate leadership to immediately approve this  bill and allow it for a vote. Our military members in the Coast Guard  deserve better, but so do all of the homeowners of this Nation who are  seeking mortgages and must put those efforts on hold, so do the  community development block grant projects that create jobs and  economic growth, and so do law enforcement, essential to our security,  who are going untrained.   Food safety inspections have been suspended. Housing safety  inspections, like the ones at Barbour Garden in Connecticut and Infield  apartments, have stalled.  [[Page S119]]    Breweries, like many in Connecticut--and I am hoping to visit a  number tomorrow--are unable to deliver their products to market and  onto store shelves.   The National Parks have been left unsupervised.   Last week, the Hartford Courant highlighted the story of Bryan  Krampovitis. He is a resident of West Haven and an air traffic  controller at Bradley International Airport. A number of traffic  controllers are here in Washington, DC, and they will be outside this  building later today. He is continuing the work, but he told the  Hartford Courant:         I'm a single father of my daughter, and she relies on me to       be her sole provider. I have a home and mortgage. It's a hard       time to be in. I'm forced to continue to go to work or face       the possibility of losing my job.    If the Federal Government is still closed at the time of his next  scheduled pay, he will receive ``a zero dollar paycheck.''   Like him, so many of these Federal workers are living paycheck to  paycheck, and they will be without that paycheck. The effect, though,  will be on Americans as a whole.    The President continues to divide us with rhetoric that is distorted  and divisive, with misleading, malign mendacity. I am reminded of the  sign I saw on TV: ``Stop truth decay.'' The President should stop truth  decay as he visits the border today. He should recognize that there is  no crisis, insecurity at the border; that it is manufactured by him.  The idea that drugs are imported across the border is correct, but it  is at the ports of entry. The idea that terrorists are coming across  the border is factually absurd. In fact, the 3,700 figure the President  broached has been completely debunked. The idea that the wall will be  effective or practical has been abandoned by members of his own  administration who have recognized that a wall from sea to shining sea  is simply impossible and impractical.   So we are left with a vanity problem--an applause line in the  President's campaign--that has become a wall to progress. It is a wall  to progress only in the President's mind, as everybody in this body  knows there is a path forward to reopen the government. That is what  the American people want--to reopen the government, to adopt the bills  that are necessary for these agencies to go back to work, and to reopen  the Department of Homeland Security as well while we debate those  disagreements we have and do our jobs.   The Congress must do its job and send to the President the bills that  are necessary to reopen the government and save America from this  manufactured, unnecessary, unacceptable crisis that has come to us and  our country from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.   I yield the floor.
