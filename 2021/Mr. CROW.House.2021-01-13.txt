 Madam Speaker, last week, I stood in that gallery to defend  this Chamber against the violent mob called here by Donald Trump. I  have dedicated my life to the defense of our Nation, and Donald Trump  is a risk to all that I love.   Some of my Republican colleagues are afraid of the consequences of an  impeachment vote, but this Congress  [[Page H176]]  sends our young men and women to war every day. I am not asking you to  storm the beaches of Normandy but only show a fraction of the courage  we ask of our troops every day.   Leadership is hard. It is time to impeach.
