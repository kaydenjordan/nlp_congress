 Mr. President, January 22 is celebration of life day,  and I wanted to take that opportunity to recognize women facing  unplanned pregnancies or parenting young children. Women with unplanned  pregnancies sometimes lack access to advice and support. They deserve  the backing of their community and access to information, resources,  and quality care. In Iowa, programs like Ruth Harbor in Des Moines  provide a safe place for young women, giving them counseling, education  support, life-skills training, parenting training, adoption assistance,  and access to health care at no cost. Programs like these are critical.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Friday marks the 47th annual March for  Life. This year's theme is ``Life Empowers: Pro-Life is Pro-Woman.''  This theme recognizes that 2020 is the centennial anniversary of the  19th amendment. The earliest feminists regarded abortion as a terrible  consequence of our society's failure to embrace women's intrinsic  value. These women instinctively embraced the sanctity of innocent  human life, even though they could not have foreseen the advances in  technology that have made it possible for newborn babies to survive at  earlier and earlier stages of fetal development. Two examples of such  miracle babies are Micah Pickering of Iowa, born prematurely at 22  weeks gestation, who is now 7 years old, and Jaden Wesley Morrow, born  at 23 weeks gestation, who died a few weeks after his birth in Des  Moines last year. We today celebrate the lives of these miracle babies,  remember all the others who were lost to abortion, and focus on how  women are empowered by upholding the dignity of life.                            ____________________
