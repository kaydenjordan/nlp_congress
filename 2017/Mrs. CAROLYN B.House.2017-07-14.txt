 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, those who support  the GOP medical bill have forgotten one of the main and first  principles of medical care: Do no harm.   They said repeatedly that they would protect preexisting conditions.  They said that they would protect accessible and affordable healthcare  and premiums. But they must have been crossing their fingers when they  said it because nothing is further from the truth.   Under their latest bill, premiums will soar, particularly for the  elderly. Women would have to, once again, worry about preexisting  conditions, such as pregnancy.   The defunding of Planned Parenthood would hurt many women,  particularly low-income women.   And the cuts to Medicare in the bill would be devastating to millions  of women, seniors, children, and the disabled.   In addition, the diminished subsidies could mean that more people  than the 22 million in the last bill who were removed from healthcare  under the bill will lose their healthcare.   Vote ``no'' on this disastrous bill.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York (for herself,               Ms. Norton, Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico,               Mr. Lowenthal, Mrs. Napolitano, Mr. Cooper, Mr.               Levin, Ms. Schakowsky, Mr. Cardenas, Mr. Khanna, Ms.               Lofgren, and Mr. Connolly):        H.R. 3255.
