 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Linda  Lelia Susan Moroney, known to all of us as Muffie, who died recently in  her home at the age of 77.   Muffie was born here in Washington, D.C. during World War II, but she  was raised in and around Houston, and she was a Texan through and  through. A lawyer by training and an advocate at heart, she fought to  make our community, our country, and our world, a better place.   A mother, a lay leader, and a champion, Muffie worked for equality  for all, dignity for all, and justice for all, especially for women;  and she did so while treating everyone she met with respect, including  those who saw things differently.   Her spirit will live on in her sons, Justin and Robert, in her  grandchildren, and in the work she did, the groups she organized, the  causes she championed, and the things that she did for all of us in  Texas and for all Americans.                            ____________________
