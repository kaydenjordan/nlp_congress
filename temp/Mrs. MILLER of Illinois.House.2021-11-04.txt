 Mr. Speaker, President Biden and the  Democrats want to defund the police, take away your Second Amendment  right to self-defense, and then stand by and watch crime skyrocket in  cities like Chicago.   The new push by the left, intended to diminish your Second Amendment  rights, is to pass so-called red-flag gun confiscation laws.   This is a disguised attempt by Congressional Democrats and some  Republicans to seize lawfully owned firearms and violate the Second  Amendment rights of American citizens.   Congressional Democrats and some Republicans voted to pass the  National Defense Authorization Act, which includes red-flag gun  confiscation provisions.   I urge the Senate to reject red-flag gun confiscation provisions in  the NDAA.   I will always stand up for the Second Amendment rights of my  constituents.   Shootings in Chicago are up 220 percent due to the pro-crime policies  of the left. Businesses and citizens are leaving Illinois at a record  number. Officers are retiring from the Chicago police force at a record  pace.   Our Second Amendment right to defend our home and family has never  been more important. I will always stand up for the Constitution and  for the safety of the people in Illinois.                            ____________________
