 Mr. Speaker, self-driving cars, once a providence of  science fiction, are quickly becoming a reality. Self-driving vehicle  technology has the potential to increase access to transportation in  our rural communities, freedom for those unable to drive today, and  improved safety for thousands of Hoosiers and other citizens across the  country.   Furthermore, development of this innovative technology maintains  America's technological leadership in the world and presents new  economic opportunities for our citizens.   The SELF DRIVE Act creates a regulatory framework to allow for self- driving vehicle technology to continue moving forward while also  ensuring consumers are protected.   I ask my colleagues to join me today and vote in favor of this  bipartisan package.
