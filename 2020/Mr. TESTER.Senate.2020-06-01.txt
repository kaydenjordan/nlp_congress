 Mr. President, I was absent when the Senate voted  on vote No. 103 to confirm Executive Calendar No. 602, John Leonard  Badalamenti, of Florida, to be United States District Judge for the  Middle District of Florida.   On this vote, had I been present, I would have voted yea on the  motion to confirm Mr. Badalamenti.                            ____________________
