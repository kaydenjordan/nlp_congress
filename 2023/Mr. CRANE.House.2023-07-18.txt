 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of my bill today, which would terminate the 2003  national emergency for Iraq. This legislation serves as a much-needed  check on the Biden administration and forces Congress to do its job.   The National Emergencies Act was passed in 1976 and was originally  enacted in response to Presidents FDR and Truman keeping the country in  a perpetual state of emergency as part of their daily governance.   Specifically, section 202 requires Congress to vote on any resolution  terminating each national emergency every 6 months: ``Not later than 6  months after a national emergency is declared, and not later than the  end of each 6-month period thereafter that such emergency continues,  each House of Congress shall meet to consider a vote on a joint  resolution to determine whether that emergency shall be terminated.''   In other words, the bill requires Congress to rein in emergency  declarations. However, despite this requirement, Congress has never  reviewed the national emergency related to Iraq. This is recklessly  endangering our Republic, our system of checks and balances, and due  process, and it undermines we the people.   The extended national emergency declaration related to Iraq provides  the President with broad statutory powers only meant for times of  actual emergency, including the power to draft Americans without  consent into Active Duty.   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the House Foreign Affairs Committee are  tasked with reviewing dozens of extended national emergency  declarations as required by law every 6 months.                                time  1515    It is long past time for Congress to do its job and terminate  outdated declarations.   I have personally been deployed to Iraq three times as a Navy SEAL. I  am not naive.   U.S. military overthrew Saddam Hussein's regime within 3 weeks of  being there, and we killed Saddam Hussein in 2006. We formally declared  the end of the Iraq war an December 15, 2011. We should not leave this  national declaration for Iraq in place as a green light for the Biden  administration to fuel forever wars.   Mr. Speaker, since President Biden has been in office, he is now  participating in a new proxy war with Russia in Ukraine and allowed an  invasion at our southern border. Spending concerns, constitutional  concerns, and concerns regarding the lives of our soldiers are easily  and often overlooked by this administration.   Two-thirds of veterans and majorities of military families and the  public support full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, and a vast  majority of the general public, 80 percent, believe our military  engagement around the world should be reduced or stay about the same  size. Only 6 percent believe we should be more engaged.   The U.S. has many vital national interests--securing our borders,  addressing the crisis of readiness within our military, and achieving  energy security and independence. Becoming further entangled in forever  wars is not one of them.   Just like the Ukraine-Russia war, Americans see no end in sight and  no clear strategy to resolve forever wars. This is a clear dereliction  of duty, and Congress must act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this  resolution, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
