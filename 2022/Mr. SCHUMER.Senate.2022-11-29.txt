 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for millions and millions of Americans,  today is a very good day, an important day, a day that has been a long  time coming: We are voting to pass the Respect for Marriage Act. Later  this afternoon, with a little more bipartisan cooperation, the Senate  will vote to pass the Respect for Marriage Act, putting it on the brink  of reaching the President's desk.   In many ways, the story of America has been a difficult but  inexorable march toward greater equality. Sometimes we have taken steps  forward. Other times, unfortunately, we have taken disturbing steps  backward. But, today, after months of hard work, after many rounds of  bipartisan talks, and after many doubts that we could even reach this  point, we are taking a momentous step forward for greater justice for  LGBTQ Americans.   Let me summarize how today will proceed. Later this afternoon, per an  agreement between both parties, the Senate will hold three rollcall  votes on amendments presented by Senators Lee, Lankford, and Rubio. A  vote on final passage for the Respect for Marriage Act will be held  after that.   Standing here today, with the passage of this legislation, it is  impossible not to think of my family. Today, I am wearing the tie I  wore at my daughter's wedding, one of the happiest moments in my life.  But I also cannot help but recall the harrowing conversation I had with  her and her wife a little more than 2 years ago.   In September of 2020, I was in the middle of a family dinner when we  received the news that Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had passed away. I  remember that awful feeling around the dinner table, and I distinctly  remember the question my daughter and her wife asked: ``Could our right  to marry be undone?''   Millions of Americans in same-sex marriages go about their day with  this terrible question lurking in the back of their minds. It is scary.  It is a scary, but necessary, acknowledgement that, despite all the  progress we have made, the constitutional right to same-sex marriage is  not even a decade old and exists only by the virtue of a very narrow 5- to-4 Supreme Court decision.   And we all know the Court has changed since that decision. As we have  already seen this year, what the Court has decided in the past can be  easily taken away in the future.   So today's vote is deeply personal for many of us in this Chamber. It  is personal for me, of course. It is personal  [[Page S6832]]  to many of my colleagues and their staff and their families. And while  we still have a few more votes to take, today is certainly an occasion  for joy and relief.   But as important as today is, let's remember that nothing about this  process was certain. Remember--remember--it was our original plan to  act on the Respect for Marriage Act in September, shortly after the  House voted to pass this bill over the summer with a surprising 47  Republicans voting for the act. We knew this bill was popular.   We knew it was the right thing to do, but what we did not know is  whether or not we had enough support, 60 votes, to pass this bill  through the Senate. Maybe the votes would materialize if we forced a  vote on the floor, but that was highly unlikely. And for a great number  of us, for so much of America, this bill was too important to risk  failure.   So back in September, when I met with the leaders of this bill in my  office--Senators Sinema and Baldwin and Collins and Tillis and  Portman--they recommended I hold off on a vote because they believed  they could secure enough support for this bill.   Many questioned if it was the right thing to do. Many on my side of  the aisle felt: Put everyone on record right now. And sometimes, they  say, that is the way to go. But at the end of the day, my No. 1  priority is always to get legislation passed through the Senate. So I  made the decision to take the risk and to wait.   Today, we have vindication that the wait was well worth it. Pushing  Respect for Marriage over the finish line required patience and  persistence, and, today, it is paying off.   I want to thank the Senators who brought us this far--Senators Sinema  and Baldwin, as well as Collins and Tillis and Portman--for their  outstanding and relentless work. Their work has been magnificent, and I  am so thankful they stayed the course even when success may have seemed  elusive.   I also want to acknowledge my Republican colleagues who voted in  favor of advancing this legislation. Because of our work together, the  rights of tens of millions of Americans will be strengthened under  Federal law. That is an accomplishment we should all be proud of.   And, of course, I want to thank all of the advocates, volunteers, and  organizers not just for supporting this bill but for everything they  have done over the years to make the United States a fairer, more  accepting nation for LGBTQ Americans.   Finally, let me finish where I started. Two years after my daughter  and her wife questioned if their marriage could be undone, they are now  expecting a baby next spring. I want them to raise their child with all  the love and security that every child deserves, and the bill we are  passing today will ensure their rights won't be trampled upon simply  because they are in a same-sex marriage. After this bill passes, they  will be the very first people I call.   So thank you to my colleagues who spearheaded this bill. Thank you to  my colleagues who have supported this bill. Thank you to the staff and  members who worked day and night to find a path forward. And, maybe  above all, thank you to the American people, the vast majority of whom  have understood that the inexorable march toward equality is what  America is all about.                              Government Funding    Mr. President, on a different subject, the omnibus, earlier this  morning, I joined with congressional leaders in a meeting with  President Biden at the White House in order to discuss the things we  must accomplish before the end of the year. We covered a lot of  different topics, but there is one I want to focus on right now-- passing an omnibus.   Leader McConnell and I have agreed to try and work together to make  sure we get a yearlong funding bill done. We hope it can be done this  year, and we know that each side is going to have to give in order to  send an omnibus to the President's desk as, of course, it needs 60  votes.   Government funding is scheduled to run out on December 16 at  midnight. If we don't take action, the results will be a pointless and  painful government shutdown. The best option, by far, is for both  parties to come to the table and work on a yearlong funding bill, not a  continuing resolution. Lurching from one short-term continuing  resolution to the next is a terrible and chaotic way to keep the  government open, and ultimately it is average Americans who get a raw  deal if the government is forced to function with one hand tied behind  its back.   And maybe worst of all, a CR is terrible news for our troops in  uniform. It will throw their families into great uncertainty and  prevent our security force from conducting crucial operations that will  keep us safe, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. So unless we want  adversaries like the Chinese Communist Party to outmaneuver us  militarily, we must pass an omnibus for the sake of our troops and the  sake of our national security.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Now, Mr. President, for millions of Americans, today is  a very good day, an important day, a day that has been a long time in  coming. The Senate is passing the Respect for Marriage Act.   Today, the long but inexorable march toward greater equality advances  forward. By passing this bill, the Senate is sending a message that  every American needs to hear: No matter who you are or whom you love,  you, too, deserve dignity and equal treatment under the law.   As the Chamber knows, this is personal to me, and the first people I  will call when this bill passes will be my daughter and her wife.   I want to thank my colleagues, joining the others, for making this  legislation possible--and especially the teams of Senators Baldwin and  Sinema and Collins, Tillis, and Portman. To all of you, I say: Bravo, a  job well done. And to all who make the choice to support this bill,  thank you. None of this was inevitable.   At the urging of my colleagues, we took the calculated risk of  holding off on a vote back in September because they believed, with  more time, we could build enough bipartisan support to push this bill  over the finish line. Today, we have vindication that the wait was well  worth it. I thank my colleagues for their work.   Above all, I want to thank the American people, the vast majority of  whom understand deep in their hearts that the inexorable march toward  equality is what America is all about.   I yield the floor.   I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, what a great day. What a great day.                              Order of Procedure    Mr. President, and now, moving forward, as we always try to do in the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive  session and resume consideration of Calendar No. 1133; and that the  cloture motions with respect to Calendar Nos. 1133, 1147, 1148, and  1129 ripen at 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday, November 30; further, that at  11:30 a.m. tomorrow, the Senate vote on motions to invoke cloture on  Executive Calendar Nos. 1133 and 1147; that if cloture is invoked on  the nomination, all postcloture time be considered expired at 2:15 on  Wednesday.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________
