 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    In its current form, absolutely.    Mr. Speaker, this amendment is very simple. It would  prohibit pension plans receiving loans under this bill from engaging in  the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement against Israel.   Understanding this MTR does not take a lot of words.   Mr. Speaker, I hear colleagues who must believe that BDS is a 1-day  event occurring, so that is why it makes it even more important for us  to speak about this MTR.   Now, understanding this MTR takes very few words. Let me be very  blunt about this. Yesterday, as was aptly pointed out, this Chamber  passed a bipartisan resolution--398 in support, 17 opposing--which  opposed any efforts to delegitimize the State of Israel, condemning the  BDS movement as dangerous and anti-Semitic.   Today, let's simply continue that progress, understanding that BDS  equals anti-Semitism. While anti-Semitism may be a political investment  by some, it has no place in managing retirement pensions, and BDS has  no place in this House.   Let us say simply, let us agree, let us plant our bipartisan flag  that anti-Semitism and BDS will have no home here in Congress and no  home in this bill.   It is simple. If you are one of the 398 Members who voted last night  to condemn the BDS movement, then you should support this MTR, stand  with our ally Israel, and continue to combat this anti-Semitic  movement.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
