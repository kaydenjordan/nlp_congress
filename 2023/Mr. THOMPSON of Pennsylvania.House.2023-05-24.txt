 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  an organization near and dear to my heart, Special Olympics.   In April, I attended the Paterno Family Beaver Stadium Run in State  College, Centre County. The 5K run/walk raises money for the  Pennsylvania chapter of the Special Olympics organization.   I fueled up at a pre-race breakfast and kicked off the opening  ceremonies before cheering on the participants and meeting with the  Centre County Special Olympics chapter.   Mr. Speaker, Special Olympics is a global organization that unleashes  the human spirit and human potential through the transformative power  and joy of sport every day around the world.   Through programming in sports, health, education, and community  building, they change the lives of people with intellectual  disabilities.   Special Olympics began in 1962 as a day camp in the back yard of  Eunice and Sargent Shriver with the first international games taking  place in 1968. Today, the movement thrives in more than 172 countries  throughout the world.   Pennsylvania formed their own State chapter in May of 1970 when 135  brave athletes participated in a small track and field competition at  West Chester University.   Today, our State chapter has nearly 13,000 athletes competing across  nine local regions in more than 300 annual competitions in 22 different  Olympic-type sports.   Special Olympics provides year-round sports training and athletic  competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for children and adults  with intellectual disabilities, providing continuing opportunities to  develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy, and  participate in the sharing of gifts, skills, and friendships with their  families, other Special Olympics athletes, and the community.   Mr. Speaker, the Special Olympics program is more than an athletic  competition. The program, when offered in schools known as Unified  Champion Schools, reduces bullying, teasing, and the use of offensive  language to those with intellectual disabilities.   Graduation rates of high schools that implemented USC increased 1.1  percent for students without disabilities and increased 1.4 percent for  students living with disabilities.    The work Special Olympics is doing results in an average of four and  a half more inclusive experiences for each student who participates.   In Pennsylvania alone, there are more than 720 USC partnered schools  in more than 50 counties. In fact, at St. Mary's Area High School in  Elk County, Pennsylvania, PA-15, the Flying Dutchmen unified sports  teams completed an undefeated inaugural season and became the 2023  Interscholastic Unified Bocce PIAA State champs at the Giant Center in  Hershey, Pennsylvania.   The unified program truly changes lives. One of the families  participating summed up the program best in saying, ``Unified sports  really does unify a school, a community, and most of all, gives  families like myself a lot of joy and for a moment to forget about a  diagnosis.''   Special Olympics also focuses on the long-term health of their  athletes. People with intellectual disabilities lack equitable access  to health services and die, on average, 20 years earlier than the  general population in the United States.   Special Olympics creates a healthier world for individuals with  intellectual disabilities through initiatives that reduce health  disparities and instead, works toward equitable access to quality  health service for people living with intellectual disabilities.   To date, Special Olympics Health has provided more than 1 million  health screenings to Special Olympic athletes to identify unmet health  needs, refer them to appropriate care, and allow  [[Page H2552]]  them to succeed on the field and in their communities.   In fact, from 2011-2012, Special Olympics of Pennsylvania conducted  more than 9,000 screenings. For some, these screenings are the first  time they have seen a doctor.   The programs build on the success of the PATH program to further  improve the health status and increase access to community health  resources.   Mr. Speaker, Special Olympics and the Special Olympics Pennsylvania  chapter wouldn't be possible without community volunteers.   The PA chapter has more than 30,000 coaches and volunteers assisting  athletes during all levels of competition.   This program touches countless people in numerous ways, and its  impact reaches far beyond the sphere of sports.   It was a privilege to work with the State College chapter, and I am  proud to share the 2023 Paterno Family Beaver Stadium Run was the most  successful run ever, that day raising more than $448,000 for Special  Olympics of Pennsylvania athletes.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today during  National EMS Week to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Clarion  County 911 and recognize its founder, Jim Cumberland.   Clarion County's 911 was the very first 911 center in Pennsylvania  when it opened in 1973. Founded as the Clarion County Communications  Center, the 911 center was housed in the historic Clarion County Jail,  built in 1875. Jim Cumberland established the center following his  experience as the East Brady Police Chief and the Clarion County  Sheriff. He also served honorably in the Pennsylvania House of  Representatives.   Fifty years later, Clarion County 911 remains one of the most  advanced 911 centers in the State and is one of ten northern tier 911  centers using Next Generation 911.   In April, Mr. Cumberland's contributions were celebrated at an  anniversary event at the new Clarion County complex, which houses  state-of-the-art public safety and emergency management departments.   As a former healthcare worker and firefighter, I understand the  critical importance of the 911 system. For this reason, I congratulate  and thank Jim Cumberland and the Clarion County 911 on this special  50th anniversary.                            ____________________
