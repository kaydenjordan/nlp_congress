 Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this time to  recognize a member of the United States Marine Corps from the 25th  District of Texas, Lance Corporal Alyssa Joy Plunk.   On December 20, 2018, a little over a year into her enlistment, the  U.S. Marine Corps took notice of her impressive level of leadership and  awarded her the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal.   During a training operation, she was tasked with transporting a  number of people and cargo over 700 miles. Her review stated that her  superior proficiency enabled her to negotiate challenging conditions  without any incidents.   She was awarded for the professional achievement she demonstrated  during this operation and for a job well done.   I think it goes without saying that the men and women who make up our  Armed Forces are a unique bunch that embodies everything that is good  about America.   They serve our country selflessly, and for that, I am eternally  grateful.   I appreciate Lance Corporal Plunk's dedication to her country and am  proud of all that she has already achieved in a short amount of time.   I am praying for her safety while she is deployed and look forward to  her return.   God bless the United States Marine Corps.   In God We Trust.                            ____________________
