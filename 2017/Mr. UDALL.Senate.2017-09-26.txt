 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                 Health Care     Thank you, Mr. President, for your recognition.   I rise today with my colleagues from the Senate Committee on Indian  Affairs, Senator Heitkamp and Senator Cortez Masto, to talk about how  the Republicans' latest and most heartless healthcare bill hurts  American Indians and Alaska Natives.   I have just heard some good news that this bill might not be brought  up for a vote this week, but Republicans insist that they will continue  their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and raid the Medicaid  expansion program, which will devastate Indian Country. So this latest  withdrawal is great, but they are saying that it is not going away. So  we have to maintain vigilance on this issue.   We came together before, in July, when Republicans' Better Care  Reconciliation Act threatened to roll back healthcare for Native  communities. With that bill's defeat, we hoped the debate over  legislation that jeopardized healthcare for Native communities was  behind us, and we hoped we could begin to work in earnest in a  bipartisan way to address the real healthcare problems that Americans  face.   Given this new threat, my Indian Affairs Committee colleagues and I  must remind this Chamber, once again, that the Federal Government bears  a solemn trust, treaty responsibility, and obligation to ensure that  Native Americans receive quality healthcare. Each version of the  Republican repeal we have seen so far violates that trust  responsibility by taking healthcare away from hundreds of thousands of  Native Americans and abdicating the Federal Government's Native  healthcare responsibilities. If any of these proposals pass, Native  Americans' health and lives will be in danger. These efforts must be  stopped.   Everyone familiar with Indian Country knows that the Indian Health  Service is severely underfunded. ``Don't get sick after June'' was a  familiar refrain on many reservations, pueblos, and villages. Limited  funding meant medical services were often rationed to only emergency  care or life and limb. IHS patients were not guaranteed access to  comprehensive medical services, specialized services, or preventive  care.   The Affordable Care Act and the Medicaid expansion changed this  equation and changed it dramatically. The ACA alone has increased  third-party billing revenues to IHS more than 25 percent, and Medicaid  funding for IHS has increased nearly 50 percent. Tribal and urban  health facilities have been able to move away from healthcare  rationing.   Medicaid expansion has provided health insurance to an additional  290,000 Native Americans from 492 Tribes--almost 90 percent of all  Tribes. This includes 45,600 Tribal members from my home State of New  Mexico.   Uninsured rates in Indian Country have decreased from 53 percent to  39 percent, and many Tribal communities' uninsured rates are even  lower. At the Santa Domingo Pueblo in New Mexico, 22 percent of Kewa  Pueblo Health Corporation's patients were uninsured in 2013. In 2016,  the uninsured rate was down to 7 percent. At the IHS Sante Fe Service  Unit in New Mexico, 84 percent of our patients now have some sort of  insurance. On the Turtle Mountain Reservation in North Dakota, they  have seen a 14-percent reduction in uninsured Tribal members. At the  Portland Urban Indian Health Center, the rate of uninsured has gone  from 56 percent to 8 percent, solely due to Medicaid expansion. This is  impressive. Let me just say that again. It has gone from 56 percent  uninsured to 8 percent.   Medicaid expansion has helped to make up for this historic  underfunding in IHS services. Third-party billing revenue through  Medicaid is now up to 35 percent of the Kewa Pueblo Health  Corporation's total budget. For the Jicarilla Apache Tribe in New  Mexico, Medicaid makes up more than 75 percent of their third-party  billing revenue. At the Navajo Crownpoint IHS hospital, 50 percent of  their budget comes from Medicaid third-party billing revenue. For  Seattle's urban Indian health clinic, operated by the Seattle Indian  Health Board, Medicaid and Medicare expansion have resulted in a  revenue increase of 146 percent since 2012.   Medicaid expansion has allowed IHS to expand services and build new  facilities. Kewa Pueblo Health Corporation has used some of its third- party billing to offer new specialty-care services, like obstetrics and  podiatry, and to build new clinic space. Santa Fe IHS used its  additional funds to build new examination rooms for Santa Clara Pueblo,  establish a mobile health unit for San Felipe Pueblo, and update  outpatient rooms at the main clinic in Santa Fe. The Seattle urban  Indian clinic uses its additional revenue to expand patient services to  include a pilot opioid addiction program.   In the words of the National Council on Urban Indian Health, Medicaid  expansion has been an ``unqualified success.'' The ACA brought new hope  to Native families and communities.   But this latest Republican plan will undo this success. Thank  goodness it has been withdrawn. In that plan, they claim they will  preserve Medicaid expansion eligibility rules for Tribes. This offers a  false hope.   Like most people on Medicaid, Tribal members go on and off the rolls  as their income fluctuates. Proposals like Graham-Cassidy would require  that they be continuously enrolled in Medicaid expansion and work to  receive benefits. If not, they would be dropped permanently from the  program.   Section 128 of Graham-Cassidy is also being pushed as helpful to  Indian Country. This section expands IHS's Federal reimbursement rate  to non-Native providers, but really it is a veiled attempt to buy  off State leaders concerned about massive cuts to the Medicaid Program.  It will not improve Tribal healthcare facilities. It will undercut the  IHS, and it will undermine the Tribal self-determination by bypassing  Tribal input in the Federal Medicaid reimbursement process.    There are 30,000 Native Americans who now have private individual  health insurance thanks to the ACA. Every Republican plan so far strips  away the ACA's cost-sharing subsidies and tax credits, which help make  private insurance affordable for many of these Tribal members and for  millions of working Americans. The Republican bill does nothing to help  these Native Americans keep their health insurance.   The sponsors can try to dress this bill up, but the glaring reality  is that TrumpCare 2.0 would be terrible for Indian Country. In fact, it  is worse for Tribes than any other proposed repeal plan so far.   It is no surprise that prominent Native organizations--the National  Indian Health Board, the National Congress of American Indians, and the  National Council of Urban Indian Health--oppose Graham-Cassidy and  proposals like it. They join virtually all major patient advocate  organizations and medical organizations in their opposition, including  the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, the  American Lung Association, and the American Medical Association.   Eighty percent of the American people disapprove of the Republicans'  attempts to undermine healthcare. Graham-Cassidy is woefully out of  touch with the American people and, especially, with Indian Country. I  am glad this bill will not receive a vote this week.   Just like tens of millions of our fellow Americans, Tribes, Tribal  organizations, and individual Native Americans all around the country  are worried about what Republicans will do to their healthcare. I have  received a record 15,000 calls, emails, and letters from constituents  about healthcare this year. Almost all of them have been  [[Page S6116]]  opposed to the Republicans' relentless attacks on healthcare, and not a  single Tribe has reached out to my office in support of this bill.   These attacks are happening behind closed doors. There was only one  rushed hearing, and it was yesterday. There is no formal Congressional  Budget Office analysis, and there has been no meaningful consultation  with Tribes. Although many of us have called for that, there has been  no consultation. It is difficult to adequately describe the  recklessness, cruelty, and cynicism in the Republicans' rush to tear  down the ACA.   The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee started a  bipartisan effort to address the real healthcare needs in this country,  but Republicans froze it once Graham-Cassidy was introduced. I am  really hoping now that Chairman Lamar Alexander and Vice Chairman Patty  Murray can get back to the bipartisan work that needs to be done. Other  time-sensitive legislation with broad, bipartisan support--like  reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program and the  Special Diabetes Program for Indians, which need to be enacted before  the end of September--was pushed aside.   Congress needs to change focus. We need to work across the aisle to  meet the needs of the American people, and we need to improve Native  American healthcare. We have come a long way under the Affordable Care  Act and the Medicaid expansion, but we are far from being able to  declare victory. I echo our colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain.  Given the enormous impact of healthcare on the lives of Americans and  our economy, we need to find bipartisan solutions through the regular  order.   Partisan repeal of the ACA is not right for Indian Country or for  America.   Now, Mr. President, I would yield the floor to my colleague from  North Dakota, Senator Heitkamp. I worked for many years as attorney  general with Senator Heitkamp. She was a great champion during those  years for Native Americans and, specifically, for Native American  children. She has been an incredible advocate on the Affordable Care  Act and the good that it has done for Native Americans.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.    Mr. President, let me thank my colleague Senator Heitkamp  for her great advocacy today for Native Americans. I have known her for  a long time. In every public service job she has had--whether it was  the State tax commissioner of North Dakota or the  [[Page S6118]]  attorney general and now U.S. Senator--she has always been a great  advocate for the Tribes. We so much appreciate that. I can tell you,  she is one of the hardest working members of the Senate in the Indian  Affairs Committee. She really brings what you talked about--a great  bipartisan approach to this. We look forward to doing more of that in  the future.   I also wish to say to the Presiding Officer that he has shown  bipartisanship on opioids, and we have an epidemic. So we can show that  there is bipartisanship.   With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for myself and  Senator Cortez Masto to engage in a colloquy and then yield to her.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, I thank Senator Udall, the ranking  member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee. I am honored to be  working with him on that committee in a bipartisan way, as he talked  about.   I am also very honored to represent the great State of Nevada, a  State that is home to civically active Tribes. Nevada's Tribal  communities deal with many of the same challenges that plague Native  communities throughout the United States. Indigenous people suffer from  higher rates of poverty, illness, and substance abuse than the general  population.   I recently received this communication from the Walker River Paiute  chairman, Amber Torres, about the importance of the Medicaid expansion  for her community. Chairman Torres wrote:         I feel that the impacts on cutting Medicaid expansion for       Nevada would be detrimental to the people. With this coverage       we have been able to obtain services for our male and       childless adult population. Our people have been able to       obtain services that have not been approved or do not qualify       through Indian Health Services.    She then goes on to say:         A large portion of our reservation is covered by the       expansion and have seen their health ailments being addressed       in a timely manner due to alternative means of coverage.    She said:         We have seen our covered recipients percentage go from 20       percent to 45 percent, with our numbers continuing to rise       daily. If Medicaid expansion is repealed, what is the       alternative for these people . . . ?        Historically Indian Health Services has only been at a       Medical Level Priority 1 for our service delivery area, which       means bleeding, blind, broken or dying. Is this what we need       to look forward to going back to?    Chairman Torres's question is one a lot of Native Americans are  asking right now and a question I wish to pose to Ranking Member Udall.   The Federal Government has a sacred trust and responsibility to the  Native communities of Nevada and throughout the country. I ask the vice  chairman, would rolling back Medicaid expansion in Nevada and other  States like mine result in pre-ACA Indian Health Service coverage and  care, as Chairman Torres discussed?    I say to Senator Cortez Masto, thank you so much. Thank  you for bringing the statements forward from Chairwoman Torres. She has  every right to be concerned.   The short answer to her question is, yes, we don't want to go back.  Chairwoman Torres is right to be concerned. Tribal leaders across the  country want to know how this bill would impact their members, but, as  Senator Heitkamp highlighted, Republican leadership has not engaged in  any meaningful Tribal consultation.   I know that is something that concerns you a lot. Working with you on  our committee, you always raise that issue--Tribal consultation and how  important that is. That did not occur before these proposals were put  before us.   Repeal of the Medicaid expansion would pull millions of dollars out  of critical funding at the Indian Health Service and would return the  entire system to life or limb. Medicaid funding at IHS has increased by  over $240 million since the Affordable Care Act passage, and that is an  increase of 43 percent.   Under the ACA, Tribes and urban Indian health facilities have started  offering a much wider range of healthcare services to Native Americans,  such as OB-GYN, podiatry, and behavioral health.   I have mentioned the old official IHS motto several times: ``Don't  get sick after June.'' This was a motto because the Indian Health  Service would run out of money after June. So what people would say  with regard to their healthcare in Indian Country is ``Don't get sick  after June''--a pretty outrageous situation. In practical terms, that  motto translated to exactly the sort of healthcare rationing Chairwoman  Torres described in her letter.   Imagine living in that sort of healthcare system, where diabetics are  told that help is only available once their kidneys start to shut down,  where expectant mothers can't access prenatal care.   The reality is that Graham-Cassidy--and we hope another proposal  doesn't come forward like Graham-Cassidy; we know they buried that  today--would turn back the clock in Indian Country, taking us from this  current era of Tribal healthcare innovation back to the days of life  and limb.   I thank Senator Cortez Masto for her great advocacy for Native  Americans. I know very well her work as State attorney general. I know  she worked with Tribes and wanted to try to work through problems  rather than litigate them all the time.   I wanted to say to your chairwoman in Nevada that we really  appreciate her hard work on behalf of her Tribal members and other  Tribes around the country.   I yield to the Senator from Nevada.   Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. I thank the vice chair.   It is true that Indian Country made significant gains under the  Affordable Care Act. Before the ACA, the Indian Health Service  regularly denied Tribal members' claims for basic care and preventive  services, such as mammograms, women's health screenings, or diabetes  management care.   Because of the chaos the Trump administration has created in the  healthcare markets, this problem is not being confronted, it is being  exacerbated across the country. We have seen it in Nevada. Insurers are  pulling out of the ACA exchanges in rural areas, thanks to the  uncertainty these continued efforts to repeal the ACA, such as Graham- Cassidy, are creating in the healthcare market.   Democrats are ready to work with Republicans to fix the problems with  the Affordable Care Act. We want to provide certainty that brings  insurers back into the health insurance marketplaces, lower premiums  and prescription drug prices, and improve healthcare. We can't kick  millions of people--including the members of the Walker River Paiute  Tribe and the 27 other Tribes and community organizations in the State  of Nevada--off of their healthcare.   No one in this country should be forced to choose between paying  their medical bills and putting food on their table. All too often, our  Tribal members are confronted with that very choice.   I will not stop fighting to oppose these efforts to take away the  healthcare of Native communities in Nevada and millions more Americans  throughout our country. It is time we work together.   I thank the vice chair.   I yield the floor back.    Thank you very much, I say to Senator Cortez Masto. Today,  you can at least tell your chairwoman that this bill has been  withdrawn. There is not going to be a further vote on it. But I would  urge her--and I know you know this well--we need to stay vigilant. This  can be brought up at any time. It can be attached to a major piece of  legislation moving forward. So urge her to continue this great  advocacy. We really appreciate your advocacy.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
