 Madam Speaker, last week's violent attack on Congress  was an act of domestic terrorism. The U.S. Capitol building was  desecrated and vandalized. Members of Congress, their staff members,  and those who work in this temple of American democracy were  terrorized. The women and men of the Capitol Police who work every day  to protect us were beaten. Two officers lost their lives as a result of  this tragedy.   Make no mistake, this was a terrorist plot to disrupt Congress; to  prevent Congress from performing its duty under the Constitution to  certify the results of the Electoral College that Joseph R. Biden and  Kamala D. Harris will be sworn in as President and Vice President of  the United States on January 20, 2021.   This domestic terrorist attack was an attempted coup against the  United States of America by attacking the U.S. Congress and the Vice  President of the United States Michael R. Pence. And this coup was  inspired, encouraged, and supported by Donald J. Trump--the deranged  and dangerous man who currently occupies the White House.   Today, I will vote to impeach Mr. Trump--for the second time--for  high crimes and misdemeanors. If his actions in inciting the  insurrection of January 6, 2021 do not warrant impeachment and removal  by the Congress, then truly nothing is worthy of impeachment. Congress  must protect this nation from Mr. Trump and from future Presidents who  may seek to follow in his dangerous footsteps. We must impeach.   When Mr. Trump leaves the White House and is again a private citizen,  I strongly urge the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate and  prosecute Mr. Trump for crimes committed against our democracy and the  people of the United States.
