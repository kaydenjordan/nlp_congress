 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand  a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground  that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum  is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in great admiration of Harve  Mogul, who, for more than a quarter century, has served as the CEO of  United Way of Miami-Dade.   Through its many successful programs in education, financial  stability, and health, this wonderful organization strives to create a  stronger Miami.   Harve has been dedicated to public service from a young age, serving  as a teacher in the Peace Corps and working at several United Way  chapters across our great Nation. In 1991, he took on the great task of  leading the Miami chapter, where he arduously worked to broaden the  organization's advocacy and philanthropic efforts.   Throughout his tenure, Harve has spearheaded many campaigns,  including a national event to advance the U.S. Holocaust Memorial  Museum, of which I am proudly a council member.   Harve is now ready for a new chapter in his life. He will be stepping  down from his CEO position, but he will continue to advance the goals  of this noble organization.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of our community and the many individuals who  have been positively impacted by Harve's contributions, I want to say  thank you to my friend, ``mi amigo.'' He is an inspiration to us all.  Good luck and Godspeed to Harve Mogul.                            ____________________
