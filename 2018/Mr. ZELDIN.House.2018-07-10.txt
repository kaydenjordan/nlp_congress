 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, throughout the next hour, we will discuss  the President's correct decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear  agreement, otherwise known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,  as well as the urgent need to eliminate Iran's problematic nuclear and  nonnuclear activities.   Joining me tonight are Members of Congress from across our great  country who are deeply passionate about America's best interests and  supportive of the President's decision to withdraw from the Iran deal.   Mr. Speaker, this first speaker who we will hear from tonight is  someone who I was elected with in 2014, who I have had many  conversations with about the importance of ensuring that America's  foreign policy is strong, consistent, and effective. He has been a  strong, consistent, and effective voice for the need to pursue a better  path forward with regard to the United States' relationship with Iran  and the need to combat their nuclear and nonnuclear activities.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for his  comments. The people of Arkansas who listened to his remarks this  evening, people back in my district who are listening to Congressman  Hill, and people from all around America, can tell that he gets it.   Unfortunately, as we were negotiating the Iran nuclear deal, we had  people who were negotiating from weaker and weaker positions, and,  unfortunately, ended up accepting a deal that crossed many of their own  red lines that were set. I think we would have been in much better  shape if we had more people like the gentleman  [[Page H6034]]  from Arkansas in the administration at that time. Fortunately, he is  here in Congress with us, and I thank the gentleman for participating  this evening.   Speaking of getting it, we have another leader from the House  Financial Services Committee, chairman of the Subcommittee on Monetary  Policy and Trade,  Andy Barr from the great State of Kentucky, an  exceptional Member of Congress who understands the financial system of  our great country, the leverage that we have with regard to the  sanctions, the way that leverage disappeared, and the way that we  negotiated away that leverage with the sanctions relief.   He understands that we are dealing with an adversary that doesn't  respect weakness. They only respect strength. I appreciate the  gentleman being here and everything he does in the Financial Services  Committee here in Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for  speaking. That was outstanding.   For anyone who is trying to get caught up with the 101, 201, or 301  of what has been going on over the course of the last few years and  hasn't been paying attention, they can just listen to the gentleman's  remarks two or three times over and understand, study, ask questions,  and get brought completely up to speed as far as what went wrong and  how we go forward from here.   So I thank the gentleman for participating, for his leadership, and  for his great remarks tonight.   When I was first elected, I would be at events, and I would let  people know about how I have two titles being both the highest ranking  Jewish Republican in Congress and the lowest ranking Jewish Republican  in Congress. But then the numbers doubled. We went from one to two in  115th. If you are keeping score at home, that means we are on pace so  that in January of 2023 there will be a minyan here in the House of  Representatives of Jewish Republicans. So we have a little ways to go,  but we are blessed to have a freshman who is joining us here tonight  from the great State of Tennessee,  David Kustoff, whom I guess I will  call the cochair of the Jewish Republican caucus of the House of  Representatives. He is my friend from Tennessee, a great Member, a  great freshman Member, and a great leader and voice on this issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee. It is  so great to have him here not just for tonight's remarks and his  leadership on this issue, it is just so great to have him in Congress.  I thank the gentleman so much for his friendship and for his important  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, last month, President Trump correctly withdrew the  United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA,  otherwise known as the Iran nuclear deal. Tonight, during this hour,  several Members of Congress were speaking here on the House floor  regarding the administration's strategy to curb Iran's malign interests  in the region and ensure Iran is no longer rewarded for its bad  behavior.   The Iran deal was fatally flawed for what was in it and fatally  flawed for what was not in it. First, it is important to reflect on key  lessons that should be learned from the manner in which the United  States made several bad errors negotiating this so-called deal.                                time  2015    We must learn these lessons to make sure that history never repeats  itself.   First, the United States signed a preliminary agreement in 2013 that  preemptively traded a large portion of our leverage even before formal  negotiations began. The Iranians came to the table desperate for  sanctions relief. They were not there as freedom-loving, good citizens  of the world, nor were they aspiring to be. The leverage was sanctions  relief, which was proof that the sanctions were working.   Nonnuclear activities weren't also on the table but should have been.  Once you negotiate away all the leverage that will bring the Iranians  to the table in the first place, you don't have the leverage left to  deal with all of Iran's bad activities that you need to deal with.   Second, the United States underestimated just how desperate the  Iranian leadership was in order to stay in power. There is no reason  for the United States to assume the position of weakness that it did in  the negotiation. We should have been, by far, the stronger party in the  talks. For some very odd reason, the United States continued to  negotiate from a weaker and weaker position for no good or acceptable  reason.   Next, one red line after another was crossed, set by the United  States. When they were crossed, there were no consequences, further  weakening our negotiating hand.   The United States also very much cared about hitting target dates  that the Iranians didn't care whether or not were hit. That, too,  further weakened our negotiating hand.   When the President and his administration gets rolled by a foreign  adversary, we all, as Americans, are getting rolled. It is a huge  problem. This was made worse by paying a $1.7 billion cash ransom to  get our hostages released. Pallets of unmarked cash had to be airlifted  and delivered at the same exact time as the releasing of our hostages.   Now, there are a lot of people who say it wasn't a ransom. When you  have to pay $1.7 billion on pallets of cash delivered at the exact same  moment as releasing the hostages, it is kind of hard to cut it any  other way. Paying this cash ransom to the world's largest state sponsor  of terrorism showed the ridiculous lengths the Obama administration was  willing to go, at any and all costs, to appease Iran and show weakness  to other American adversaries who were witnessing this all play out.   Recent reports revealed that the Obama administration misled the  American people and granted a license letting Iran access the United  States' financial system when U.S. Government officials pledged that  they would never allow Iran to access U.S. investments or markets.   This Iran nuclear ``deal'' provided Iran with a jackpot of up $150  billion in sanctions relief without even asking for a signature.  Secretary Kerry called it ``an unsigned political commitment.''   Ben Rhodes, the White House's taxpayer-funded fiction writer, created  an echo chamber to promote a false narrative and sell a devil's bargain  of a deal to the American people.   Even Democratic Members of this Chamber were feeling the heat from  the White House, forced to support what they were privately admitting  was an unsigned, unchecked bad deal.   Secretary Kerry admitted this deal was never intended to receive  congressional approval. He said this wasn't a treaty, because a treaty  would have been ``impossible to pass.''   I don't know how anyone out there would define what a legal  definition of ``treaty'' is, but I am pretty confident that that  wouldn't be it. The U.S. should have never entered this historically  bad deal to begin with and really could have done a much better job  negotiating it.   As I mentioned earlier, the Iran nuclear deal was fatally flawed for  what was in it and fatally flawed for what was not put in it. Next, I  will discuss some of the reasons why it was fatally flawed for what was  in it.   The JCPOA isn't a pathway for how to prevent Iran from acquiring a  nuclear weapon. It is a blueprint for exactly how Iran attains a  nuclear weapon. Two of the biggest issues with what was in it, inside  the JCPOA you have a very flawed verification regime and highly  problematic sunset provisions.   President Obama said this deal wasn't built on trust; it was built on  verification. I don't know how you support a deal that is built on  verification when you have no idea what the verification regime is. I,  as a Member of Congress, still have not received the secret side deals  between the IAEA and Iran that outline the verification regime.   When Secretary Kerry was before the House Foreign Affairs Committee  last Congress, I asked him if he had read it, and he said no. The  Secretary of State did not read the verification regime. But the  American public was told this was a deal not built on trust, built on  verification.   We have learned since some of what is in the side deals, like Iran  collects some of their own soil samples and is the inspector of some of  their own nuclear sites.   It is crazy; right?   The United States made a slew of permanent concessions in exchange  for temporary concessions on the part of the Iranians, a point which  comes into much greater focus as the sunset provisions are analyzed.  The sunset clause undermines any reasonable justification for the deal,  providing Iran the capability to obtain a nuclear weapon within a few  years even if it didn't cheat on the deal at all. That, of course, is  in addition to the $150 billion of sanctions relief.   Under the JCPOA, Iran was still allowed to assemble a limited amount  of advanced centrifuges that could enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon  within 1 year. However, Iran has even violated those minimal  restrictions multiple times.   Iran has spun more IR-6 centrifuges than permitted under the JCPOA.  It has assembled more IR-8 rotor assemblies than it is permitted to. It  has attempted to acquire carbon fiber that it had agreed not to. It has  stockpiled more heavy water than what was allowed under the JCPOA.    Just think, the people who have said that Iran has not violated the  letter of the deal are all examples of the letter of the deal being  violated.   With regards to verification, the Iranians have said before, during,  and after this deal that they would allow no access to their military  sites whatsoever. We said that we were going to have access to their  military sites.   The Iranians said the entire time, before, during, and after: You  will never have access to our military sites.   On top of it all, the United States agreed that we wouldn't have any  of our weapons inspectors participate in any of the inspections.   The IAEA, on its own, has failed to conduct a thorough review of  Iran's nuclear capabilities. Just one example, in September 2015, when  the Iranian officials then granted limited access to  [[Page H6037]]  IAEA inspectors at the Parchin facility, although environmental samples  revealed chemically man-modified particles of natural uranium, the IAEA  did not pursue an explanation or even an inquiry. This Joint  Comprehensive Plan of Action is a house of cards.   So, what are we doing? Not only was a better deal absolutely  attainable, but no deal would have been better than this agreement.   Next, I want to discuss in further detail why the JCPOA was fatally  flawed for what was not in it.   When Secretary Kerry chose to ignore Iran's bad, nonnuclear  activities in the region, he negotiated away all of the leverage that  brought the Iranians to the table in the first place. You cannot  separate Iran's ballistic missile development designed to deliver a  nuclear warhead from its nuclear weapons program.   Iran has continued to pursue its ICBM development in violation of  U.N. Security Council resolutions.   Iran has continued to finance terrorism. It is the world's largest  state sponsor of terrorism and has continued to work to overthrow  foreign governments.   Iran supports Assad in Syria, Hezbollah, and the Houthis in Yemen.  They have consolidated massive territorial control, building a land  bridge between Tehran and Beirut, a direct threat to the security and  stability of regional partners such as Israel and Jordan.   By failing to address Iran's nonnuclear activities, the JCPOA has  given Iran more resources to pursue its terrorist ambitions in the  region.   These are, unfortunately, just a few of the examples of Iran's bad  activities.   Since the JCPOA was entered into, Iranian aggression in the Middle  East, including Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere, has only increased.   Iran has launched as many as 23 ballistic missiles since the  conclusion of the July 2015 nuclear deal.   They have illegally financed terrorist activities, wreaking havoc in  the Middle East.   Iran has recommitted to wiping Israel off of the map, calling them  the Little Satan.   They chant death to America, and they call United States the Great  Satan in their parliament, in their streets on their holidays, all  while unjustly imprisoning American citizens.   In the past 2 years, Iran has blown up mock U.S. warships and seized  one of our Navy vessels and subsequently held hostage and publicly  embarrassed 10 American sailors.   Do you remember Secretary Kerry's reaction to Iran holding hostage  and embarrassing those sailors? His response was: Thank you.   He was thanking the Iranians. He defended the whole situation as  evidence of an improved relationship with Iran. That is living in an  alternate version of reality.   One fundamental question is often misunderstood, and in many cases it  is not even asked: What leverage could we have, moving forward, to  tackle all of Iran's threatening actions if we eliminate the sanctions  that bring the Iranians to the table in the first place?   President Trump is absolutely correct to reimpose the toughest  sanctions against Iran's oil and financial sector and IRGC officials,  agents, and affiliates. In order to regain the leverage that brought  the Iranians to the table, we must increase financial pressure so that  Iran does not have the ability to back terrorist groups across the  world and keep their economy afloat.   With Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor  John Bolton working so closely with our President to counter Iran's  aggression, I feel confident when they say: ``No path to a nuclear  weapon, not now, not ever.''   The onus is on Iran. If they like the sanctions relief and they want  to keep the sanctions relief, then the United States has just a few  reasonable requirements: the verification regime needs to be fixed; the  sunset provisions need to be lifted; and the other bad and nefarious  legal activities must end.   If there are any other nations around the world that want to keep the  sanctions relief in place, then convince Iran to change its behavior  and agree to the United States' very reasonable demands.   It is very telling that so many nations in the Middle East are  supportive of President Trump's determinations to push back against  Iranian aggression. They are the ones that are most impacted, and they  support the decision.   In 2009, millions of Iranians poured into the streets to protest a  fraudulent election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The United  States and the rest of the world then offered zero support following  that undemocratic election. President Obama said it was none of our  business, which proved to not only be wrong, but also a huge error in  judgment.   We must learn from our lesson of 2009 and not repeat that same  mistake. The United States must support the millions of Iranians who  continue to march in the streets desperate for support to help them  turn the tide in Tehran and all throughout Iran. There are millions  of people in Iran who want a free, stable, democratic Iran.    Now, in 2018, Iranians have once again courageously poured into the  streets to protest the brutality of President Hassan Rouhani's regime.  Over the last few months, we are witnessing the largest protests in  Tehran since 2012.   Keep in mind that whenever we hear about how the most moderate  candidates get elected in Iran--this is a point I have heard a lot.  Iran elects the most moderate candidates, but so often they leave out  the important point that the 12,000 most moderate candidates are denied  access to the ballot altogether. The only choice has been to pick a  pro-regime hardliner. We should be under no illusions otherwise.   By withdrawing from the JCPOA, President Trump is sending an  important message to the Iranians that America will not accept a regime  that tortures its own people, funds terrorist activities, and vows for  the destruction of the United States and our great ally, Israel.   The United States is a nation that is not even close to equals with  Iran. We are the greatest Nation in the world, and when we engage in  these negotiations, we must do so from a position of strength and not  relinquish that. That is all that this adversary respects. We can't be  silent not because we want war, but because we want to prevent it.   The good news is, now, in July of 2018, again we are treating Israel  like Israel and Iran like Iran. One of my complaints and many other  Americans is, for a while, we were treating Israel like Iran and Iran  like Israel. It made no sense.                                time  2030    I mentioned earlier in this hour how important it is for the United  States to be strong, consistent, and effective in our foreign policy;  to strengthen our relationships with our friends; to treat our  adversaries as our adversaries, understanding that our enemies, our  adversaries, do not respect weakness; they only respect strength.   I wish that the start of the negotiation had gone down very  differently in the first place, but fast forward to today. With  President Trump, Secretary Pompeo, Ambassador Bolton, their team, and  with other countries aligned with us, especially in the Middle East, we  can pursue a better path forward.   For all of those who are interested, whether you like the JCPOA or  not, if you like the sanctions relief or not; but hopefully all  concerned with Iran's bad activities, especially their nuclear and  their non-nuclear activities as well, you can help us, putting the onus  on Iran and encouraging them to accept our very reasonable demands.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, again, everyone who participated in  tonight's hour. I would like to thank Sara Matar from my team, who has  worked very hard on this issue throughout her time in my office. This  is an issue that isn't going away anytime soon. It is one that will be  passed on from one generation to the next. As our great republic  continues to thrive, exist, grow, to be strong, and to protect our  freedoms and liberties, we must be strong as a people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 31 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, July 11, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
