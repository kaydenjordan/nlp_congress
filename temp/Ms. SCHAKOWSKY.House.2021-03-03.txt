 Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank my friend, Ayanna  Pressley, the wonderful congresswoman from Massachusetts. I have had  the pleasure of knowing Ayanna Pressley well before she was even 16,  and she was ready to vote as soon as that.   I want to say that all over the country, and especially in my  district, I feel we see young people, young activists, who are working  tirelessly to make their voices heard, from battling climate change,  battling gun violence, to advocating for racial justice and economic  equality.   This is their century, and our national leadership should be  accountable to them, to these young people in their generation who will  be most impacted by the existential threats that are looming before us  today.   This is a serious proposal. Sixteen-year-olds are doing the work of  adults, and they should be treated with the respect that they deserve  and the participation that they should be able to have.   So I heartily support this amendment and urge my colleagues to  consider it carefully and vote for it.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to say thank you to the  millions of Americans who peacefully put this bill on the agenda.   It was nowhere last year until we saw 8 minutes and 46 seconds of a  man being murdered, a Black man, George Floyd. People--White, Black,  all different colors--took to the streets, and they said, ``No more.''  I want to thank those activists and ordinary people who said we don't  have to tolerate this.   The bill passed last year, and it is going to pass again because the  American people are tired of this racism and the killing and killing  and killing of Black people.
