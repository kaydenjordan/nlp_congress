 Madam President, I rise this evening with a simple and  sober message: The United States has entered a very dangerous period, a  dangerous national security moment the likes of which we have not seen  since the height of the Cold War. Although alarming, the moment is  clarifying. The job of the Department of Defense and Congress is and  always has been to provide for the common defense, as provided in the  Constitution. We must stay focused on American military might and so  prevent our adversaries from changing the course of our future.   An American-led 21st century is a peaceful and prosperous century.  That is not what a century led by the Chinese Communist Party would  look like. It is no surprise the pariah states of Russia, Iran, and  North Korea are growing closer to Beijing and to each other. A free  world is actually something that threatens them.   As the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, it is my hope  that we will decide not just to compete in this dangerous era but that  we win. To that end, I have identified three priorities: deterring  conflicts, winning technological competitions, and investing in our  military's personnel.   First, deterring conflicts. In American history, one foreign and  defense policy has succeeded above all others: a national policy of  preparedness.   President Washington said:         To be prepared for war is one of the most effective means       of preserving peace.    Theodore Roosevelt called it ``wielding a big stick.'' President  Reagan called it ``peace through strength.'' Indeed, we ought to listen  to those great captains of American purpose. We should rearm and  strengthen the United States so no adversary dreams of acting against  our interests.   With that in mind, I want to start with Taiwan and Ukraine. Without a  doubt, there is no greater challenge than deterring Xi Jingping from  taking Taiwan. Failing to defend Taiwan would plunge the globe into an  economic depression and end our hopes for an American-led century.   To ensure that never happens, Congress should pursue four priorities  with Taiwan this year.   First, we should pressure the Biden administration to exercise the $1  billion of drawdown authority we provided them in the Taiwan Enhanced  Resilience Act last year.   Second, we should match Taipei's growing investment in critical  capabilities. I am disappointed that the Biden administration has once  again failed to request foreign military financing money for Taiwan.  Congress will have to act.   Third, we should fix the foreign military sales backlog and pursue  real reforms to the process. Right now, it takes us too long to get  crucial weapons to our allies. For example, unless something changes,  Taiwan will wait nearly a decade to get a recent order of Harpoons.   Fourth, we should expand our work with allies and partners to help  Taiwan defend itself with military and nonmilitary tools of power.   Yet, when it comes to deterring conflicts in the Western Pacific,  helping the Taiwanese defend themselves is only part of the puzzle. The  U.S. military itself must also be ready.   First, Congress and the Department of Defense should act this year to  accelerate the most important short-term capabilities for our forces in  a Western Pacific scenario. As in prior years, we will focus on a  concise list of near-term joint capabilities, such as advanced naval  mines, munitions, nonkinetic cyber and electronic warfare techniques,  space capabilities, and a range of battle management software  technologies related to the Joint All-Domain Command and Control  effort.   Second, we should accelerate the innovative work in the Army and  Marine Corps to reestablish their presence in the first island chain  and expand our alliance partnership networks. Specifically, I look  forward to continuing the committee's focus on the Pacific Deterrence  Initiative. This initiative seeks to enhance our basing and logistics  infrastructure west of the international dateline.   Third, we should focus on our munitions industrial base this year.  Congress and the Department of Defense will expand the efforts in the  Reed-Inhofe amendment, which has actually cut bureaucratic redtape and  has pushed the Pentagon to sign multiyear contracts for 17 different  munitions. We must promptly provide the industrial base with resources  to expand production of key munitions, such as the Long Range Anti-Ship  Missile and Standard Missile-6.   Fourth, we must tackle structural supply chain and workforce issues  that hamper our munitions production. These activities are key to  expanding our magazine depth, and they will significantly add to  deterring China.   Even as we seek deterrence in the Western Pacific, we note that  deterrence did not work in Ukraine. Our goal now should be to maximize  U.S. interests through Ukrainian victory and deter further Russian  aggression, including against our NATO and our non-NATO allies.   I will continue to focus on providing the Ukrainians with everything  they need to achieve battlefield gains faster and hasten Ukraine's  victory. As General Kellogg testified to our committee 2 weeks ago,  Beijing is watching our actions in Ukraine. They are weighing whether  to join the fray in this conflict.  [[Page S808]]    That brings me to my second priority: investing in our  competitiveness. While our fundamentals remain strong here in America,  the Chinese are outcompeting us in multiple arenas. The Chinese are  running the so-called 100-year marathon. To them, victory in that race  means toppling American global leadership. We need to make the long- term investments to compete in the coming decades in this marathon. The  Chinese Communist Party is working overtime to achieve what they call  ``the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation'' by 2049. Their goal is  to be the global center of economic, political, and military power.   China has pulled off the fastest military buildup in history, and  they are still building. Beijing has achieved real growth in its  defense budget every year for two straight decades--every year for two  straight decades. It is quite likely they already spend more than we  do, particularly if we count only our China-focused military spending.  These investments are paying off for Xi Jingping.   Quite honestly, in many areas of warfare, China's military already  exhibits greater quantity and sophistication than our own. I am  particularly concerned about the rapid advancement of the Chinese navy  compared to ours. The Secretary of the Navy recently shared a troubling  fact: In one shipyard alone, the Chinese now boast more productive  capacity than in every American shipyard combined.   I had the privilege of leading Congress to pass the SHIPS Act, which  requires the Navy, in statute, to achieve a 355-ship fleet as soon as  practicable. Unfortunately, the Biden administration has shirked its  responsibility to enforce this statute and to maintain American naval  superiority.    The administration has repeatedly sent Congress requests to actually  shrink the fleet. This is unacceptable. It should be unacceptable on  both sides of the aisle.   Thankfully, we took important steps in last year's National Defense  Authorization Act to prevent the Navy from retiring 12 ships. We now  need to make sure the Navy's battle force inventory grows each year  instead of shrinking. I will push to make sure we build three  destroyers per year, maximize the production of amphibious ships, and  restore a healthy submarine industrial base.   For centuries, naval power has been the cornerstone of American  defense policy. When we defeated the Axis Powers in World War II, our  victory took place just as much in the steam and sweat of our shipyards  as it did on the shores of Normandy or Iwo Jima. It validated George  Washington's words from a century and a half earlier when he said,  ``Without a decisive naval force, we can do nothing definitive.'' So  let's do the most definitive thing we can: make a monumental investment  in American command of the seas.   It is also critical that we revitalize our capabilities in the air  and in space. In many ways, our challenges in aircraft production  mirror those of our shipbuilders: Years of anemic budgets have created  a brittle industrial base. We need to expand our orders of tactical  fighter aircraft above 72 per year to get our combat air forces  healthy. We need similar actions in tankers and other aircraft. We  cannot continue to buy fewer aircraft every year while our older  aircraft costs more to maintain. This is a death spiral. The same  problems hold for our nuclear weapons production infrastructure, which  my predecessor, Senator Inhofe--along with Senators Fischer, King, and  others--has worked for years to rectify.   Our defense industrial base should focus less on efficiency and more  on effectiveness. Again, it is helpful to look back to World War II to  understand what I mean. In the beginning of 1942, the Nazi war machine  controlled all of Western Europe. Japan's empire spanned from the  borders of India to our smoldering fleet in Pearl Harbor. The forces of  liberty were not on the march but on the defense. It took what one  author called ``freedom's forge,'' or American industrial capacity, to  defeat evil. We need to unleash our forge of freedom again--complete  with all the 21st-century technologies that make it superior. Pentagon  bureaucracy cannot keep getting in the way of this goal.   To that effect, we must also focus on improving the Department of  Defense's ability to develop, integrate, and purchase innovative  technology at scale. It is time for a culture shift at the Pentagon and  here in Congress, one that prioritizes speed and effectiveness over  compliance and efficiency. We may have to assume a bit more risk  together, but we can and must accelerate innovation--accelerate  innovation--while also improving oversight if we have the right tools.   We will win by deterring conflict, by winning the tech race, and  thirdly and finally, by investing in our military personnel. We have  long had cutting-edge technology, but our secret weapon has always been  our people.   As a veteran myself, I know how important it is to attract the best  personnel to serve our country in uniform. Unfortunately, we find  ourselves in the worst military recruiting shortfall in 50 years. The  injection of a hyperpolitical culture into our fighting forces I think  takes a sledgehammer to military readiness and recruiting. I think it  is part of the problem with our recruiting.   I will partner with any Member of Congress to expand the population  of Americans eligible for military service. I will also promote  solutions in this Congress, including increased support for Junior ROTC  and ROTC programs and expanded incentives for servicemembers. As we  recruit, we must never lose sight of our current troops. We will  continue to care for servicemembers and their families.   All this will take hard work, new ways of thinking, and new  partnerships between Congress and the executive branch. It will also  require additional funding.   We must achieve continued real growth in the defense budget.  Significant real growth is absolutely required to strengthen deterrence  against the Chinese Communist Party to an acceptable risk. Any  additional investments in our national defense should have the best  return possible, and we should innovate in new ways that will result in  real savings to the taxpayers over the long run.   In conclusion, the challenges we face are significant. Our  adversaries are testing us every day, and we cannot afford to make  mistakes in our defense policy or to try to do defense policy on the  cheap. Legendary columnist the late Charles Krauthammer reminded us  often that ``decline is a choice.'' But I am confident we can choose to  pass this generational test of American resolve if we work together in  the spirit that has so long defined the work of this Congress and the  Armed Services Committee.   To my colleagues on the committee and across this Chamber, I say:  Let's get to work.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
