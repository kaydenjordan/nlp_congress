 Mr. Speaker, over the last few months, the situation at  our border has evolved into a serious crisis caused by policy changes  from the Biden administration that have incentivized illegal  immigration. This is not my opinion; this is the information I received  firsthand on my recent trip to the border.   These policy changes include: ending the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy;  implementing catch and release; and suspension of the portion of title  42, which allowed for expelling unaccompanied minors. I witnessed  massively overcrowded rooms, or pods, where many children are being  held for weeks at a time.   The enormous influx of illegals has given the drug cartels the  insidious opportunity to ship drugs into our country, leading to an  increase in fentanyl smuggling by more than 2,000 percent and illegal  weapons by more than 100 percent.   Of grave concern to those I spoke with is the rumor that title 42  will be fully rescinded by the White House, which would lead, Mr.  Speaker, to an unmitigated disaster at our border.   We ask President Biden and Vice President Harris to actually visit  the border, speak with the agents on the ground, and learn what is  going on. This is not a Republican or a Democrat issue; this is a  humanitarian and national security crisis that can be solved.                            ____________________
