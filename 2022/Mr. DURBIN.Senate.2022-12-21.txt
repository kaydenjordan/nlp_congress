 Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask       unanimous consent that the Committee on the Judiciary be discharged       from further consideration of S. 4240 and the Senate proceed to its       immediate consideration.         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Durbin       substitute amendment be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be       considered read a third time and passed; and the motion to reconsider       be considered made and laid upon the table.         Mr. President, I will come to the floor later this       morning or early this afternoon to discuss this bill, which Senator       Graham joined me in cosponsoring, to say the United States should never       be a safe haven for war criminals, regardless of where they committed       their crimes. I will speak to that at a later moment.                                      ____________________                Mr. President, early in my political career, I learned an       important lesson: If you want to succeed, you don't go it alone. For       every major decision, you need a trusted friend to turn to, someone who       will be honest with you and steer you in the right direction.        In my life, I have been lucky to have many friends who pass that       test, including my mentors: Paul Douglas, the United States Senator       from Illinois, who introduced me to this world when I was a college       senior; and my predecessor in the United States Senate, Paul Simon.       Another Illinois legend who joins that rank is Gene Callahan.        Paul Simon and Gene Callahan were two of the hardest working and most       grounded people I have ever known. They were public servants in every       sense of the word. The two of them pioneered an approach to politics       that I have tried to live up to: return every phone call; respond to       every constituent; always, always, always remain true to your values.        Sadly, both Paul Simon and Gene Callahan have been gone for many       years, but their legacy lives on in a public servant who has perfected       their model for leadership. That public servant's name is Congresswoman       Cheri Bustos. For the past 10 years, she has represented Northwest and       Central Illinois in the House, and she happens to be Gene Callahan's       daughter.        Since Cheri was first elected in 2012, she has lived, breathed, and       fought for every family in the 17th district. From providing the best       constituent service in the House to securing more funding for her       district than any other Democrat in the House, Cheri quickly set       herself apart as one of the brightest leaders in our State's history.        She will be retiring at the end of this Congress, but before she       heads home, I want to take a moment to share how proud I have been to       watch our MVP from East Moline emerge as the All-Star champion of the       United States Congress.        Cheri grew up in a family that stressed the importance of public       service. Her grandfather, Joe Callahan, was a hog farmer and a New Deal       Democrat who represented one of Illinois's most rural counties in the       State general assembly. He instilled in Cheri a deep appreciation for       rural America and the family farms that feed our Nation.        Whenever the State legislature was in session, Grandfather Joe would       stay with Cheri, Gene, and the rest of the family in Springfield. It       was during that same period that I first met Gene Callahan. The two of       us were working for then-Lieutenant Governor Paul Simon.        Gene would invite me, Paul, and sometimes even Senator Alan Dixon       over to the House for a spirited conversation about the news of the       day. It was truly a ``kitchen cabinet.'' Oftentimes, when we sat at the       dinner table dishing about politics, we were joined by another       youngster, a participant. A young Cheri Callahan was around, listening       carefully. It is where she learned her first lessons in politics.        Growing up, Cheri was passionate about a lot more than politics. In       high school, she was a force to be reckoned with on the basketball       court. Just as importantly, she understood the value of being a team       player--so much so that in college, she was picked as the MVP on both       the basketball and volleyball teams.        That is a quality that really defines Cheri Bustos--from the       basketball court to the floor of the House, she is a team player who is       in it to win it--not just for herself but, more importantly, for the       people who were counting on her.        Throughout her life, Cheri's passion for victory has been surpassed       only by a capacity for empathy. She always listens. It is another       lesson she learned from her dad, Gene, and her mom, Ann, and Paul       Simon. All of whom, like Cheri, had something to do with public       service, either by participating in journalism, public service, or       supporting those who do.        In Cheri's case, she was a reporter with the Quad-City Times for 17       years. She started on the night shift as a police reporter. It was a       tough job and doesn't pay a lot, but Cheri struck gold. While working       for the Quad-City Times, she met a young sheriff named Gerry Bustos.       And all these years later, they are happily married with three children       and two grandkids.        Cheri won her first election in 2007 for a seat on East Moline City       Council. I know that she won it because I knocked on doors for her. A       few years later, she called me and said: I am moving on up. I want to       run for Congress. I will admit, my wife and I were surprised. Making a       leap from city council to Congress is not for the faint of heart, but       Cheri was an obvious natural.        That first campaign began in the kitchen with one staffer: her nephew       Brad. The two of them traveled all over northwest and central Illinois       in his car, which had no working air conditioning and was pretty much       held together with duct tape. But like Gene had taught her, Cheri       showed up to every event, every townhall, every fundraiser, every phone       bank. It was a heartfelt campaign that started off on a shoestring.       That November, Cheri won that tough district by eight points.        A couple of months after her victory, Cheri and Gerry made their       nearly 15-hour drive to Washington with a U-Haul hitched to their Jeep       Wrangler. It was the beginning of an amazing congressional career.        During the first term, Cheri launched ``Cheri-on-Shift,'' her       practice of working alongside constituents at their jobs. In Cheri's       words, the Cheri-on-Shift experiment gave her ``a feel for what people       do for a living, how they support their families, their struggles, why       they take pride in their jobs.''        Over the past decade, Cheri has served drinks at the Golden Hen Cafe       in Galena, planted soybeans with a farmer in Galesburg, and taken care       of senior citizens at the Lifescape facility            [[Page S9715]]            in Rockford. She has done everything from cleaning an ice rink with a       Zamboni to trying her hand at beekeeping. And with every Cheri-on-      Shift, she would ask her constituents: What do you need from me in       Washington?        Just ask her staff. The answers to those questions made all the       difference in Cheri's office.        Consider the case of a nurse in Galesburg who told Cheri she was so       concerned about the lead pipes in her home that she was planning on       dropping out of nursing school to cover the cost for replacing them.       Cheri told her: We are going to do this right. And soon, she learned it       wasn't just one nurse who was suffering from lead pipes, but the entire       community.        So Cheri kept her promise to that nurse. She found the Federal and       State dollars to help make things right in Galesburg.        If you want to see the difference that can be made, look at what       Cheri has done for the Rock Island Arsenal. When I entered the Senate,       the Rock Island Arsenal was on its last leg. I'm sorry to say, there       were people at the Pentagon determined to close it. I was not going to       let that happen, but I needed the right partner--and that partner was       Cheri. Today, the Rock Island Arsenal's future is bright. We worked       together with Tammy Duckworth to secure hundreds of millions of dollars       in funding and projects to upgrade that facility.        In fact, the Rock Island Arsenal will soon be home to the largest 3-D       printer in the world, which will build lighter, cheaper, and safer       frames for military combat vehicles. It is one of the many ways that       Cheri has helped position Illinois to lead in the future of       manufacturing with union workers at the helm.        Justice and opportunity for all--that has been Cheri's passion since       she was the little girl that I first saw at the Callahan dinner table.       It is the passion that has defined her years in public service and her       decade in Congress.        One of her final acts in Congress is one that will have impact across       America for decades to come. She passed a law to end forced arbitration       for sexual assault survivors. After she steered that bill through the       House, I had the honor of working on it successfully as chair of the       Senate Judiciary Committee. This law will ensure that every survivor       can have their day in court. And it wouldn't have happened without       Cheri Bustos.        So it is sad for me that Cheri is leaving at the end of this term. It       is worth noting that in returning home, she has remained true to those       who sent her here. You see, Cheri is a strong believer in stepping out       of your comfort zone. She says it is ``where the magic happens.'' And       it is a theme throughout her career. Every 10 years or so, Cheri       switches gears--from journalism to healthcare to city council to       Congress; and, now, I don't know what the next step will be.        I think I speak for every resident in Illinois's 17th district in       saying: Cheri, we can't wait to see what you achieve next. My wife       Loretta and I are amazed, but not one bit surprised, to see how far you       have come. You see, we have trusted you for a long time--when you were       a babysitter for our kids, the graduate of Illinois Women's Institute       for Leadership, the IWIL Training Academy, to one of the most       accomplished legislators and constituent advocates in the House of       Representatives.        Somewhere out there, both Gene and Ann Callahan are beaming with       pride with what their daughter has achieved.        I want to wish a wonderful holiday season to Cheri, her husband       Gerry, her sister Lynn and her husband Al, her three kids, Tony, Nick,       and Joey, and their daughters-in-law, as well as the grandkids. Now       that you are retiring, I am sure you will have plenty of time for       dancing to Stevie Wonder around the Christmas tree.                                                    FDA              Mr. President, in July, the FDA Commissioner Robert Califf requested       an external review of the Agency's food offices.        It was months after the infant formula crisis began, when a bacterial       outbreak forced Abbott to shut down one of the largest formula       facilities in the country and sent parents into a panic. Remember, this       crisis could have been prevented by the FDA. FDA inspectors found       several compliance issues at Abbott's Sturgis plant in September 2021.       The Agency also received a complaint about that same exact facility in       October 2021. But, they didn't ask Abbott to initiate a recall or warn       the public until February 2022.        This wasn't the first time FDA has failed to prevent an outbreak       though. This year alone, the FDA has opened more than 25 investigations       into foodborne illness outbreaks. So I was glad when Dr. Califf       recognized that the FDA has fallen short of its responsibility to       protect Americans, and turned to the Reagan-Udall Foundation to conduct       an external review. It was long overdue.        This month, the foundation completed its review. Its report concluded       that the FDA's culture, structure, and lack of funding have undermined       its effectiveness. The foundation found that, ``there is no clear       leader or decisionmaker'' in FDA's food offices, which tips the scales       ``in favor of inaction, minimizing risk, and maintaining the status       quo.''        Inaction, minimizing risk, and maintaining the status quo--Americans       deserve so much more. They deserve the fundamental assurance that what       they feed their families won't make them sick. That is exactly why the       foundation concluded its report by calling on FDA and Congress to       implement structural reforms. Specifically, one of the options the       foundation recommends is that FDA to be separated into two agencies:       the Federal Drug Administration and the Federal Food Administration. As       it happens, I introduced legislation earlier this year with       Congresswoman DeLauro that would do just that: the Food Safety       Administration Act.        The Reagan-Udall Foundation also encouraged Congress to take a close       look at the FDA's funding and resources. Consider the fact that the FDA       had just nine employees working in the infant formula office when the       crisis hit. That is nine people overseeing a $3.5 billion industry--      absolutely unacceptable. We need to do better than that.        Commissioner Califf needs to act on the foundation's recommendations       as soon as possible. We, in Congress, need to address this issue with       the seriousness it deserves as well. All of us have family members,       friends, and constituents who have fallen ill after a meal--or even       died. Let's reform the FDA before the next crisis.        I yield the floor.        The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip.                                                 Broadband               I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr.       Hickenlooper) is necessarily absent.         Madam President, reserving the right to object.         Madam President, first, let's state clearly for the       record: Neither the Senator from Texas nor the Senator from Minnesota       nor the Senator from Illinois wants to make it easier for these crimes       to be committed. We are all committed to the same goal of reducing the       number of crimes and making certain that those who are responsible pay       the price for that misconduct--that terrible, disgusting misconduct.        I have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for years       to help combat the scourge of human trafficking and to keep children       safe from sexual exploitation.        Preventing human trafficking and protecting survivors are issues that       really do bring us together, Republicans and Democrats.        The goal of this legislation is noble: to ensure that schools are a       safe place for children, where traffickers cannot prey on their       innocence. I wholeheartedly agree with this goal. We should be doing       everything we can to deter traffickers, especially those who prey upon       children. However, I cannot ignore the serious concerns about specific       wording in this bill that is part of the legislation before us.        In particular, the Department of Justice, responsible for prosecuting       these crimes of child sex trafficking, has identified a number of       serious problems with the way that the No Trafficking Zone Act is       written.        They sent us a memo. It is a lengthy memo, at least 4 to 6 pages of       detailed analysis of this bill. I asked them to take it seriously and       give us their serious report. They did.        In technical assistance provided to the sponsors of this legislation,       including the Senator from Texas, the Department of Justice concluded       that ``this proposed legislation will only create confusion and       additional hurdles for sentencing [child sex trafficking] offenders.''        Listen carefully. The Department of Justice, that has the       responsibility of prosecuting these crimes, analyzed this proposed       change in the law and said it would create confusion and additional       hurdles for actually sentencing those guilty of child sex trafficking.        I am sure the Senator from Texas did not have this intent, nor the       Senator from Minnesota.        The Department of Justice also said the legislation is not ``well-      tailored to address child sex trafficking'' and that ``it is       unnecessary since both statutes implicated already allow for a sentence       up to life imprisonment.''            [[Page S9735]]              In other words, according to the Justice Department, this bill, in       its current form, will not lead to stiffer sentences for these horrible       offenses and, in fact, may make it harder to prosecute child sex       traffickers.        In light of these concerns, I have repeatedly offered to work with       the author of this bill in the House of Representatives. My staff has       communicated that we could revise this bill and expedite its passage       into law. We could meet the same noble goal of the original legislation       but do it in a way that is consistent with the express--express--      concerns of the Department of Justice.        The changes needed are really quite simple. Instead of amending the       applicable statutes, the amended legislation would ensure that the       sentencing guidelines account for child trafficking that was committed       in a school zone.        This simple revision guarantees that the recommended sentence for a       defendant will be higher if the defendant knowingly committed the       offenses in a school zone.        It also resolves all of the infirmities identified by the Department       of Justice that could jeopardize prosecutions of child sex traffickers.        I want to make it clear. I take this matter very seriously, as I am       sure the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Minnesota do. We       watched carefully as the Department of Justice set their analysis. We       responded to it in a responsible way, and we said to the House author       of the bill, please accept these changes. They achieve your original       goal, and do it in a way that would not make it more difficult to       prosecute those who are guilty.        Unfortunately--unfortunately--so far, the author of this bill in the       House of Representatives has refused to work with us on these changes.        Their position is that we cannot change a single word of the bill.       That is not the approach to take when we are dealing with legislation       of such a serious matter. We should take care that every word achieves       the goal that we all want to seek--to lessen number of crimes of sex       trafficking.        As a result, we are at an impasse because I am unwilling to pass       legislation that the prosecutors tell us will make their job more       difficult. And I believe that they are right, in our own analysis.        Madam President, for these reasons, I object to this request, but I       reiterate, as I have over and over and over again to the House author,       that I stand ready and more than willing to work with our colleagues in       the House, along with Senator Cornyn and Senator Klobuchar, to ensure       that this legislation moves forward.        To express my good faith on this, I am going to make the following       request: As in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the       Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further--let me start       over so it is clear on the record.        Therefore, I object to the original request for unanimous consent,       and I ask that the Senator from Texas modify his request such that the       Durbin substitute amendment at the desk be considered and agreed to;       the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and       the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.         I object.         Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate       proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination:       Calendar No. 1195, Richard L. Revesz, of New York, to be Administrator       of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of       Management and Budget; that the Senate vote on the nomination without       intervening action or debate; that the motion to reconsider be       considered made and laid upon the table; and that the President be       immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate resume       legislative session.         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senate       proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 602, S. Res.       472.         Mr. President, I further ask that the committee-reported       substitute amendment to the resolution be withdrawn; the Menendez       substitute amendment at the desk be agreed to; the resolution, as       amended, be agreed to; the preamble be agreed to; and the motions to       reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no       intervening action or debate.         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Committee on       Rules and Administration be discharged from further consideration of H.       Con. Res. 82, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the concurrent       resolution be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be considered       made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate       proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 876 submitted earlier today.         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the       resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to       reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no       intervening action or debate.         Mr. President, for 10 months, the Ukrainian people have       put up a valiant fight--a fight that many thought they were going to       lose in just a few days, but here they are, still standing.        As Ukraine has liberated city after city from Russia's grip, the       world has borne witness as crime scene after crime scene has been       revealed.        Ukraine's investigators have already documented more than 50,000       alleged            [[Page S9756]]            Russian war crimes--the number keeps climbing; executions, torture,       rape, mass graves, innocent people--men women and children--dead in the       streets or in their homes, some with their hands tied behind their       backs, others bearing the telltale signs of torture.        President Zelenskyy, who has bravely made the trip to Washington this       week and will speak to us in just a few moments, has called on leaders       around the globe to ensure that the perpetrators of these atrocities       can find no safe haven in their countries.        He is right. We must send a powerful message to Vladimir Putin and       his henchmen and to the rest of the world that war criminals will have       no place to hide, let alone in the United States of America.        But right now, at this moment, there is an egregious loophole in our       laws that prevents Federal prosecutors from holding foreign war       criminals found in this country accountable.        Senator Grassley and I introduced the bipartisan Justice for Victims       of War Crimes Act to close this impunity loophole and give our       prosecutors the tools they need to ensure that war criminals have       nowhere to hide, let alone the United States.        The Departments of Justice, State, and Defense support this change.       Congress must act.        This morning I asked for unanimous consent, and this bill was passed       with unanimous consent.        I wanted to put this statement in the Record because I think it is       appropriate, as we gather in this Chamber to walk to the House Chamber       for an address to the joint session of Congress by President Zelenskyy       of Ukraine, that we keep in mind that we are standing in this together       with the civilized nations of the world on the side of Ukraine and       against the war criminals that Vladimir Putin is turning loose on the       battlefield.        Let us stand together for the values that this country stands for and       which the Ukrainian people are dying for every day.        This is a cause worth fighting. I am glad to be part of the effort--      the bipartisan effort to support President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian       people to bring freedom to their country.        I yield the floor.         We yield back all time.         I ask for the yeas and nays.         Madam President, on November 26, the East St. Louis       Flyers--Illinois' winningest high school football program--defeated the       Prairie Ridge Wolves 57-7. By handing Prairie Ridge their first loss of       the season, the East St. Louis Flyers took home the Illinois High       School Association's Class 6A Championship, the school's 10th State       football title.        As an Assumption High School Pioneer and native son of East St.       Louis, I went to school just a few minutes down the road from East St.       Louis Senior High School--or East Side as we called it. Even back then,       East Side was a dominant force in high school athletics. So much so       that in 1960, when the Assumption Pioneers managed to pull off an upset       win against the East Side Flyers at Parsons Field, our entire school       was given the day off to celebrate. While Assumption High School closed       in 1989, East St. Louis Senior High has fought on and is now the last       remaining high school in my hometown, serving about 1,500 students.       Over the years, they have continued to excel in athletics, enjoying       success thanks to coaching legend Bob Shannon, who led the Flyers to       six Illinois State championships and two national championships during       his time as head coach.        East St. Louis is a city that has fallen on hard times, a story all       too common in this Nation. What used to be an economic powerhouse on       the Mighty Mississippi with flourishing meatpacking, rail, and       manufacturing industries, the City of Champions now struggles with       frequent flooding, limited economic opportunity, a shrinking tax base,       and bouts of high crime. Yet despite these challenges, the Flyers of       East St. Louis Senior High were able to persevere and fly on to win       their 10th State football championship.        After falling to the Cary-Grove Trojans by one point in the 2021       Class 6A Championship game, there was no guarantee that the Flyers       would make it back to the State championship. The Flyers had a rough       start to the 2022 season, losing two of their first three games after       dropping contests to St. Frances Academy from Baltimore, MD, and a road       game against the Creekside Seminoles of Fairburn, GA. A testament to       the team's resilience, the Flyers would go on an 11-win tear, which       included 6 shutouts thanks to the Flyers' stout defense. In the 4th       game of that 11-game winning streak--an 80-0 win over the Alton       Redbirds--Flyers' Head Coach Darren Sunkett notched his 200th career       win. This milestone caught the attention of a coaching legend, none       other than the University of Alabama's Nick Saban, who reached out to       congratulate Coach Sunkett. After such a dominant victory, you might       expect the team would celebrate and rest on their laurels. Instead,       after one of the week's grueling 3-hour practices, Coach Sunkett made       his team run sprints due to poor coverage on one of the kick-offs. It       was back to hard work.        Despite his demand for excellence and attention to detail, Coach       Sunkett knows that success on the field is not all that matters. He       wants his players to be well-rounded and has designed a program to help       his players succeed on and off the field. Having grown up with little       chance to explore outside his hometown of Camden, NJ, Coach Sunkett       makes every effort that his players experience life outside of the 89       blocks of East St. Louis, often taking his team on the road to test       themselves against the Nation's best teams.        Football is much more than touchdowns or tackles, first downs or       sacks, or even wins and losses. It is about collective effort, a group       of people coming together to achieve something more than what they       could achieve on their own. For many of the young men of the East St.       Louis Flyers football team, football represents opportunity. An       opportunity to make a better life for themselves and their families,       get a quality education from one of the Nation's leading universities,       and get a degree that will open up many more opportunities. What these       young men have been able to do this season, despite the odds being       stacked against them, is nothing short of remarkable.        To the players: whether you suit up and play at a top-tier collegiate       program next fall or you never play another down of football, remember:       You will always be champions. Congratulations on bringing the 2022       Illinois High School Association's Class 6A Championship home to East       St. Louis.                                      ____________________
