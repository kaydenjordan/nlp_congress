 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for his  leadership and for the 2 minutes, which may be the most important 2  minutes I have had on the floor in a very, very long time, because what  we debate here today is not an ideological disagreement. It is not a  question of whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, Mr. Speaker. It  is a fundamental question of who we are as a country and will we abide  by the values that not only make us successful in times of war, but  which distinguish us as a people and allow us to say that we are an  exceptional nation.   When our troops--troops like Jason Crow, the sponsor of this  legislation--go to engage in combat in foreign lands, they are armed  and equipped with the very best technology money can buy. But from the  human standpoint, from the all-important humanitarian and cultural  standpoint, they are blind and deaf. That is fixed by locals who risk  everything, not necessarily for the money, but because they believe in  who we are. This is the moment when we return the favor by saying: If  you stood with us, we will stand with you.   It is far from a national security perspective, because God help  those who go into a country if we don't take care of those who helped  us in Afghanistan. But, more importantly, it is about our values.   Mr. Speaker, you know very well that our military has at its core the  value that we leave no one behind. Now we decide whether we live by  that value or whether we take the cheap, the easy, the quick, and  ultimately, the dangerous way out. It is dangerous for the next  conflict we find ourselves in and dangerous because of what that will  tell the world about our commitment to loyalty and the values that make  us exceptional.
