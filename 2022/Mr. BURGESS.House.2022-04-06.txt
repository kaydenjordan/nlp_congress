 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R.  471, the PAUSE Act, to protect all Americans from Biden's border  crisis.    Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of yet  another Contempt of Congress resolution that has no purpose other than  to punish. If the January 6th Select Committee wanted to actually  compel production of the documents and records they subpoenaed, they  would instead be suing for civil enforcement. But that takes time, and  there are only eight months left before these subpoenas expire.   Congressional Committees may conduct investigations in pursuit of a  legislative purpose. I ask: What legislative purpose would be served by  referring Peter Navarro and Daniel Scavino for criminal Contempt of  Congress rather than suing for civil enforcement?   Additionally, the question of executive privilege is not legally  settled. President Biden has stated he would not grant executive  privilege regarding Mr. Scavino's testimony, but the Presidential  Records Act governs presidential records, not the testimony of aides to  former presidents. The committee also demanded ridiculous compliance  timelines in requests to Mr. Scavino, further indicating a lack of  willingness to undertake a legitimate and thorough investigation.   As we get closer to the end of the year, will the Select Committee go  straight to recommending Contempt of Congress for every subpoenaed  individual that requests accommodations or an extended timeline?   I urge a no vote on this misguided resolution.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1023         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 471) to prohibit the Secretary of Health and Human       Services from lessening the stringency of, and to prohibit       the Secretary of Homeland Security from ceasing or lessening       implementation of, the COVID-19 border health provisions       through the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided  [[Page H4228]]       and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of       the Committee on Energy and Commerce; and (2) one motion to       recommit.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 471.
