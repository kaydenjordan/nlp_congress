 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6 as did  my colleagues.   The opioid crisis has impacted nearly every community across this  country, and in order to most effectively combat this crisis, we must  establish a comprehensive response plan.   I am pleased this bill includes a version of my amendment offered in  committee to establish a system to track Federal funding for drug  control efforts, ensuring the government knows exactly where the money  is being spent, how it is being used, and if it is working.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and I ask my colleagues to do so as  well.
