 Mr. Speaker, Republicans have said they want a healthcare  system that cuts costs and covers more Americans, yet their bill does  no such thing.   Last week, Republican leadership in the Senate unveiled their draft  healthcare bill. Their bill makes extreme cuts to the Federal Medicaid  program and doubles down on the President's vow to repeal the  Affordable Care Act.   The nonpartisan CBO came out and said that 22 million Americans stand  to lose health coverage. Their bill does nothing but further harms the  communities and threatens the livelihood of neighborhoods nationwide.   The healthcare debate in our country should be about increasing  funding, promoting prevention, protecting and enhancing the quality of  life for each and every person in Philadelphia, the Commonwealth, and  our Nation.   What do we have to lose? We have a lot to lose. We are talking about  the lives of 22 million Americans who stand to lose their healthcare.  The numbers do not lie. These are our veterans, our seniors, our  students, and our children.   We cannot turn a blind eye. The livelihood of our neighborhoods  depends on our commitment to stop this disastrous bill from becoming  law. There is a lot at stake, and our neighbors have too much to lose  if we turn a blind eye.   We have heard from all of our colleagues tonight that clearly this is  going in the wrong direction. And we, members of the Congressional  Black Caucus, stand together to fight this horrible bill.   One last thing I want to say to my colleague on Caribbean Americans.  June is Caribbean American Heritage Month, and I think the most of my  colleague. I have learned a lot from watching her in action. She has  that spirit and that drive as a Caribbean American. She has helped  shape and strengthen the fabric of our communities.   I thank the congresswoman publicly for all that she has done as a  great Caribbean American in this body.  [[Page H5178]]
