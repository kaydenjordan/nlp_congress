 Madam Speaker, there is an old African proverb that says:  Until the lions tell their own story, the tales of the hunt will always  glorify the hunter.   Who are the lions? They are the victims. They are Black and Brown and  indigenous. They have suffered, endured, and survived 200 years of  brutality, slavery, racism, Jim Crow, oppression, deprivation,  degradation, denial, and disprivilege.   We have learned in this country one thing, that justice comes in  small steps. And when we consider the enslavement of the Negro, the  extermination of the Indian, the annexation of the Hispanic, our Nation  that we love had an iniquitous conception.   So these small steps, no matter how painful they are, must be taken.  This bill helps move us toward a more perfect Union. I urge passage of  the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.
