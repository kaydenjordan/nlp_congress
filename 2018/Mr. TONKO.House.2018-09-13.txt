 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support much needed investments in our Nation's water systems.   Earlier this year, EPA estimated some $472 billion is needed to  maintain the Nation's drinking water infrastructure over the next 20  years.   We have woefully underinvested in drinking water for far too long,  and now crumbling pipes and failing systems pose a serious threat to  public health and public safety.   Later today, the House is expected to vote on S. 3021, America's  Water Infrastructure Act, the latest iteration of WRDA.   It is a good bill, the result of bipartisan and bicameral  negotiations.   I am incredibly proud of the work done by both majority and minority  members of the Energy and Commerce Committee on H.R. 3387, the Drinking  Water System Improvement Act, which was reported out of committee  unanimously in July of 2017. Nearly all of that bill has been  incorporated into S. 3021.   I would like to highlight a number of the provisions that I am  pleased were included in the final package.   Since 2014, I have introduced legislation to reauthorize the Drinking  Water State Revolving Fund, the primary source of Federal funding for  our water systems. Since its creation, the program has never been  reauthorized, and funding has been flat, despite the growing needs in  our communities.   S. 3021 would increase the authorization from $1 billion annually  until it reaches a $1.95 billion level in fiscal year 2021.   In addition to providing significantly increased funding through the  SRF, I want to mention a number of other provisions.  [[Page H8176]]    First, WRDA makes numerous important changes to the SRF program,  including extending the length of loans from 20 to 30 years, and up to  40 years for disadvantaged communities, while increasing the set-aside  for these communities by raising the maximum and, importantly,  instituting a minimum amount of assistance.   It provides $125 million annually to support State water offices  through the Public Water Systems Supervision grant program.   It seeks to improve the availability of compliance data submitted by  water systems and States.   It promotes better asset management practices, improves consumer  confidence reports, and reauthorizes the Source Water Petition Program.   It includes funding for EPA to review methods and technologies to  prevent and detect leakage, contamination, and other problems.   It requires Buy America standards for SRF projects through fiscal  year 2023 and prevailing wage standards to ensure that American workers  are benefiting from these investments.   It provides funding for systems to conduct risk assessments of their  resilience to extreme weather.   It establishes a grant program to help schools and daycare centers  replace water fountains containing lead components.   Also related to lead, it requires future EPA needs assessments to  include the cost of replacing lead service lines.   I know a number of communities are dealing with emerging  contaminants, such as PFOA and PFOS. Currently, only systems serving  more than 10,000 people are required to test for unregulated  contaminants. This bill requires water systems serving over 3,300  people to monitor for these contaminants, empowering local residents to  take action to mitigate serious health threats that they may not have  known existed otherwise.   This would mean that thousands of communities, communities like  Hoosick Falls, New York, and similarly sized systems would no longer  have emerging contaminants go undetected, potentially threatening their  residents for years.   Finally, while not included in the committee-passed bill, WRDA  authorizes $100 million for areas hit by natural disasters to repair  their water systems, enabling post-Maria Puerto Rico to access funds  without the financial burden of State matching requirements.   This is not an exhaustive list of provisions in this title, but it  gives a sense of the breadth of policies that were included to improve  the Safe Drinking Water Act.   This bill is not a clean water silver bullet, but it will put us on  the path to end the decades of neglect of our water infrastructure and  make the investments needed to maintain and upgrade our systems in  order to protect public health.   I want to thank my colleagues, Representative Harper, Chair Shimkus,  Chair Walden, and their staffs for working with our side of the aisle  on this legislation. I want to acknowledge the contributions of our  ranking member Representative Frank Pallone, Jackie Cohen, Jean Fruci,  and Rick Kessler, and other members of the Energy and Commerce minority  staff for their hard work.   I always say that every life and every job in this country depends on  access to safe drinking water. The needs are great and the cost of  inaction is high.   Today, Congress has the opportunity to act. I urge my colleagues to  support America's Water Infrastructure Act and for the Senate to take  it up immediately                            ____________________
