 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Houston Astro's right fielder and a constituent of the First  Congressional District of Georgia, Mr. Josh Reddick, for his  contribution to his hometown: the Josh Reddick Stadium.   Mr. Reddick is a highly successful Major League Baseball player with  a World Series title and two Defensive Player of the Year Awards.   But I am proud of Mr. Reddick for continuing to make his community a  top priority and helping to improve the quality of life for children  with special needs.   Last year, he donated $1 million to build the state-of-the-art Josh  Reddick Baseball Stadium in Effingham County, which is accessible for  all children, including those with special needs.   On Saturday, July 21, the stadium officially opened, ready for play.   Thank you, Mr. Reddick, for your gift to Effingham County and for  your desire to help all children enjoy the game of baseball. Good luck  during the rest of this season in the majors.                            ____________________
