 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in  recognition of the impressive career and technical education students  in Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional District.   Career and technical education helps learners of all ages gain  valuable skills that have the potential to lead to good-paying jobs and  rewarding careers. It all starts with our Nation's most valuable  resource: our people. Hardworking men and women and the dedicated  students who have chosen to pursue a technical career are the backbone  of our economy.   As co-chair of the bipartisan House Career and Technical Education  Caucus, I couldn't be happier to congratulate Jakob Dixon of Indiana  County, Pennsylvania, on recently winning a gold medal for his work  with sheet metal at the SkillsUSA National Leadership and Skills  Conference. The 56th annual event took place in Louisville, Kentucky,  and hosted upwards of 6,500 students to compete in more than 100  different skills-based competitions. Jakob will be a senior this fall  in the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning program at the  Indiana Career Technology Center.   Additionally, in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, Northern Cambria  Middle School celebrated its back-to-back national championships in the  41st annual Technology Student Association national conference in  Washington, D.C., just earlier this month.   More than 8,500 students from across the country competed in 70  different events, including woodworking, programming robots, debate,  and more. Every student from Northern Cambria Middle School who  competed in the contest achieved national recognition as a top 10  finalist.   Mikey Konitsky, Chris Yahner, Peyton Myers, and Braden Moriconi  became national champions in the mechanical engineering competition, a  category they have also won in the Commonwealth State of Pennsylvania.   Additionally, Chris Yahner and his classmate Caleb Born placed third  in the Nation in structural design and engineering, and Garret Link  placed ninth in the Nation for flight endurance.   I am proud of Jakob Dixon and the students of Northern Cambria Middle  School and the many students like them across the Commonwealth and the  country who have chosen to pursue a skills-based career in such a  competitive workforce.   Students like these are in high demand. More than 80 percent of  manufacturers claim talent shortages prevent them from keeping up with  customer demand, and 46 percent of employers say they have difficulty  finding talent, particularly in the skilled trades.   Career and technical education prepare students to be career ready by  providing core academic skills, employability skills, and technical  job-specific skills through hands-on learning opportunities.   We need more students like Jakob, Mikey, Chris, Peyton, Braden, John,  Caleb, and Garret. The value they will add to the American workforce  one day cannot be overstated.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, on June 28, I had the  privilege of attending the fourth annual Frank Varischetti All-Star  Football Game in Brockway, Pennsylvania.   The Frank Varischetti Foundation hosts this annual event with support  from the Brockway Gridiron Association and the Brockway Area School  District. The event brings the region together for a great gridiron  game in support of the academic futures of local students.   In addition to showcasing the best football talent in the region,  $1,000 scholarships are awarded by game sponsors. This year, I was  proud to represent many players from Pennsylvania's 15th Congressional  District in awarding 20 scholarships.   The event also recognized the late coach Andy Evanko, who passed away  last month from ALS, with a moment of silence. Coach Evanko was a  staple in his community and coached the Curwensville Golden Tide  football team from 2000 to 2018 with an impressive career record,  winning more than 70 percent of his games as head coach.   These young men and their coaches truly exhibited the value of hard  work and the importance of good sportsmanship.                            ____________________
