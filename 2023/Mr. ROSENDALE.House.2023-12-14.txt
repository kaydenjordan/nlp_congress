 Madam Speaker, in July, the House Republicans passed  the most conservative NDAA in history that ended Biden's taxpayer- funded abortion travel fund, stopped taxpayer-funded gender transition  surgeries, and prevented American citizens from being indefinitely  detained without charge or trial. I was proud to vote for that  legislation.   I understood that this bill would change in the Senate and knew that  compromise was inevitable.   However, I cannot support a bill written by the D.C. uniparty that  removes all of the reforms and watch as leadership once again suspends  the rules we fought to restore, preventing Members from even amending  this flawed legislation.   Even worse, this legislation includes a clean extension of FISA  section 702, which has allowed the FBI to spy on U.S. citizens more  than 278,000 times without a warrant. The FBI, under President Biden,  has been weaponized against the American people, and major reform is  needed.   FISA should not be combined with our national defense, and it is  unacceptable that leadership is bypassing regular order to jam Members  by forcing them to vote on two unrelated bills with one vote. Make no  mistake about this, folks: This one vote will allow the United States  Government to spy on you and the United States military to lock you up  in Guantanamo Bay without representation.
