 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Jan  Schakowsky, for yielding and for her leadership on making this happen,  as well as thanking Chairman Latta, Chairman Walden, Ranking Member  Pallone, and my good friend Fred Upton from Michigan.   The hard work here has gotten us to the point where we are today. The  SELF DRIVE Act is going to improve our economy and save lives on the  road.   Passing this bill today means we are one step closer to signing a  responsible framework for the deployment of highly automated vehicles  into law. It means we are going to improve mobility for seniors and  people with disabilities, reduce congestion on the road, improve energy  consumption, and, as everyone has said, actually improve safety on the  road.                                time  1145    More than 35,000 people died on our roadways. And as you heard Mr.  Upton say, we are hearing 40,000 self-driving cars has the promise to  save lives when 90 percent of those are by human error, but only if we  get it right. And that is why it is so important that we study these  issues and do this the right way.   Our legislation ensures that safety is at the forefront by requiring  manufacturers to submit safety assessment certifications before one  self-driving vehicle hits the road. It also requires that  manufacturers, for the very first time, submit a plan for how we will  address both cybersecurity and data privacy. It is moving the needle  forward on safety while providing a reactive and flexible framework for  the regulation of self-driving cars.   Today we are one step closer to reshaping American innovation for  generations to come. We cannot let this opportunity slip by us. It is  essential to ensure the future of American innovation because this is  fundamentally an issue of American competitiveness.   Automated vehicles are going to be developed, whether we want it or  not, and it is a question about whether we are going to remain in the  driver's seat and not secede it to China or India or Western Europe.   The SELF DRIVE Act steers us in the right direction on these  important issues.    Mr. Chairman, while I have great respect for my friend  and colleague from Georgia, this misguided amendment would undermine  FDA's work to enforce the critical patient safety protections that were  passed in the Drug Quality and Security Act in response to a deadly  fungal meningitis outbreak that killed 22 people in my home State of  Michigan. Passing this amendment could ultimately lead to another  crisis like what we saw.   This amendment would prohibit the FDA from finalizing a draft  memorandum of understanding that outlines when and in what quantity  traditional compounding pharmacies can distribute compounded drugs  across State lines. Hamstringing FDA's ability to ensure that  interstate shipments are only made from pharmacies in States that are  exercising oversight over that activity could create a gaping loophole  and would turn back the clock to the days when bad actors like NECC  were free to ship tainted products and murder people across the country  without oversight.   It is completely unacceptable. We should be standing up for the  strong patient protections in DQSA rather than turning back the clock.
