 Mr. Speaker: ``This is Carl Eggleston. There's always  hope.'' So ends every voice-filled greeting on Carl's phone in the 36  years I have known him. No better few words describe the resilient,  optimistic, and indefatigable man I love.   I first met Carl Eggleston briefly during the congressional campaign  of Ira Lechner in 1982. Carl was friends and political allies with the  brain trust of the campaign: Darrel Martin and Linda Moore. A few years  later, we worked very different parts of Virginia in Jerry Baliles'  winning race for Governor. But my life changed completely when I  visited Carl at his home in Farmville in the summer of 1988, at the  beginning of my first-ever candidacy for office.   Carl agreed to join my small team, and from that day forward, he was  my constant companion. We traveled everywhere across the Commonwealth  together. He introduced me to the most important players in Democratic  politics and virtually every important African-American leader in the  State. I discovered that Carl was universally respected and liked and  that his endorsement helped immensely. In the coming years, we worked  many campaigns together--some winning, some losing--always as trusted  friends and allies.   But the real Carl Eggleston story is so much more interesting than  his long history in Democratic Party leadership. He was born in poverty  to two loving parents in the Jim Crow South. The closing of the Prince  Edward County schools, when Carl was 9 years old, is the tragic stuff  of massive resistance legend.   He stayed home for 3 years, schooled only by his mother, then spent a  fourth year in a neighboring county trying to catch up. After high  school, Carl apprenticed in a funeral home and caught the  entrepreneurial bug. Bravely, in a business where families loyally  cling to the funeral director who has buried their elders, Carl created  his own funeral home: one client in year one, two or three the  following year. He persisted against the greatest odds and competition,  and Eggleston Funeral Homes are now 30 years old and thriving.   The child of a racially and bitterly divided South, Carl ran for  Farmville city council and was the first elected Black man since  reconstruction perhaps ever. After one term, he ran for mayor and lost  handily. I still marvel at the courage and the hope he must have had to  stand for office in Prince Edward County, alone among all the counties  in the United States to close its public schools rather than integrate  them. One can only imagine the hostility Carl faced in the local  population as he dared to lead them. Twice more, over the decades, Carl  ran for mayor, getting closer each time, and earning the support and  respect of much of Farmville's White community.   So with respect for his many achievements, including the long years  chairing the Prince Edward Democratic Committee, the Fifth  Congressional District Democratic Committee, my greatest appreciation  for Carl Eggleston is founded on his strong and generous character. He  is the friend I treasure most.   I have never heard him utter an unkind word about another person. He  is unfailingly loyal, trustworthy, and patient. He works every moment.  He is the quiet civil rights leader and political force who has been  responsible for so much of the forward progress in Virginia over the  last generation.   On the occasion now of the publishing of his autobiography, I am  proud to call Carl Eggleston my friend, and I know that you will enjoy  and appreciate his story. Carl's life is proof that there is always  hope.                            ____________________
