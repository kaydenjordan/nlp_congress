 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a legend, the  Honorable Congressman John D. Dingell, whom we lovingly call in  Michigan ``The Dean.''   Congressman Dingell will truly be missed. For 59 years, he served our  great State of Michigan and our country. He believed in the power of  this institution, the power it had to transform hate to love, to  elevate the most vulnerable and to uplift our servicemen and -women.   Dean Dingell's legacy will live on with his memorable work on the  historic Civil Rights Act, the Clean Air Act, and the need for  universal healthcare.   I still remember to this day as a State legislator in Michigan when I  had an environmental injustice issue going on in my district and he got  me a United States Coast Guard hearing, a public hearing, in southwest  Detroit. He called me, and he said: Kid, this is your last chance to  fight the injustice.   I still remember coming in to serve on a panel with him at the  University of Michigan--Ann Arbor campus on immigrant rights and the  need for immigration reform. I sat next to him, very frustrated after a  long day in Lansing fighting for scrap metal reform, and saying to him:  How can you do it so long? The special interest groups are so tough,  and they are so tainting the process when it comes to issues that  matter for our people.   He taught me and spoke to me about the power of stillness.   Congressman Dingell's strength and humanity will truly be missed. I  thank the gentleman for his wicked sense of humor. Even more  importantly, I am grateful he was always so warm and kind to us younger  activists and for never trying to reduce my voice or others' voices.   His drive for a better world will live on with his lovely Deborah, as  he calls her, his best friend and my current sister in Congress,  Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.   Some of the last things he was saying, of course, was the incredible  humor that he had on Twitter, but I still remember the specific thing  that he said: ``I signed up to fight Nazis 73 years ago, and I'll do it  again if I have to. Hatred, bigotry, and fascism should have no place  in this country.''   As a Muslim girl growing up in America today, I am grateful to  Congressman Dingell for his courage and his love.   Rest in peace, my friend. Thank you so much.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
