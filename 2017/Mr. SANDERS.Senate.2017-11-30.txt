 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1720, and ask  unanimous consent that Senators Franken, Wyden, and Nelson be added as  cosponsors.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is not in order.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1720, and ask  unanimous consent that Senators Franken, Wyden, and Nelson be added as  cosponsors.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is not in order.    Mr. President, I do not ask for the unanimous consent,  but I would like to speak on an amendment that I will be offering  later.   Mr. President, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and  the Republican leadership are busy every day telling the American  people how this piece of tax legislation is going to help the middle  class and how it was written for the middle class.   We see President Trump going to Missouri and saying: This bill is not  going to help me, who is a billionaire; it is really designed for the  middle class. I trust that I will not shock too many people when I  suggest that what President Trump is saying is not accurate, is not  truthful.   This legislation, according to numerous independent studies, will  provide 62 percent of the tax benefits to the top 1 percent. So 62  percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent, while it increases  taxes on 87 million middle-class households by the end of the decade.   Here we are, as every American knows, living at a time of massive  income and wealth inequality. The middle class is shrinking, millions  of people are working longer hours for lower wages, and 40 million  people are living in poverty. But over the last 40 years, the people on  the top have been doing phenomenally well, and today we have more  income and wealth inequality than at any time since the late 1920s.   Given that reality, who in their right mind believes that it makes  sense to give huge tax breaks for the people on top, while raising  taxes for the middle class? Do you know what? My Republican colleagues  here may think that makes sense. That is not what the American people  believe. Poll after poll after poll suggests--as it did with their  disastrous healthcare legislation--that the American people do not want  this legislation.   If you can believe it, the Joint Committee on Taxation told us just  last night that by the year 2027, 150 million households in America  making $200,000 a year or less will see their taxes go up, not down,  under this disastrous bill. Why? Because the tax cuts for middle-class  families expire by the end of 2025, while--surprise of all surprises-- the tax breaks for large corporations are made permanent.   The benefits for the middle class expire. They are temporary. The  benefits for the corporate world are permanent. The leadership of the  Republican Party is telling the American people that trickle-down  economics--giving huge tax breaks to the wealthy and large  corporations--will expand the economy, will create new jobs, and will  bring in so much revenue that, magically, it will pay for itself. Just  give tax breaks for billionaires and large corporations, and those tax  breaks will pay for themselves.   But here is the reality. The reality is that trickle-down economics  is a fraudulent theory. When Ronald Reagan slashed taxes for the rich  in 1981, economic growth went down by 1.9 percent the following year,  and the unemployment rate increased from 7.5 percent to 10.8 percent.  The 1981 tax cut was so successful that Reagan had to increase taxes  eleven times after that.   After President George W. Bush cut taxes for the wealthy and large  corporations, we lost nearly 500,000 private sector jobs, the national  debt almost doubled, poverty increased, and median income went down.   After the rightwing Republican leadership in Kansas--the last example  of the theory of trickle-down economics--cut taxes for the wealthy,  revenue declined so much that they had to make savage cuts in  education, healthcare, transportation, and infrastructure.   Trickle-down economics did not work under Reagan, did not work under  George W. Bush, and did not work in the State of Kansas. It is a  fraudulent theory cooked up by think tanks funded by billionaires and  the wealthy.   Every independent expert who has taken a look at this tax bill has  said that it will substantially increase the deficit even after  accounting for economic growth.   The Joint Committee on Taxation has told us that this bill will  increase the deficit by $1.4 trillion over the next decade.   I want to make this point because it has not been made enough. Mark  my words. If this legislation is passed, if the deficit goes up by $1.4  trillion, I believe without any doubt, that the Republican Party will  come down here to the Senate and go to the House and say: My goodness,  we have raised the deficit, and in order to deal with that, we have to  cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, nutrition, education,  affordable housing, and every program that is important.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Yes.    Absolutely, but it is not just an idea I have. It is not  just a theory I have. These numbers were put right into the budget  passed by the Senate, which called for a trillion-dollar cut in  Medicaid, then a $470 billion cut in Medicare, and massive cuts to  other programs.   Let's not even talk about the budget of several months ago. Let's  just talk about what our colleague Senator Marco Rubio yesterday-- yesterday--told a group of Wall Street lobbyists.   Let me quote Senator Rubio. He said:         Many argue that you can't cut taxes because it will drive       up the deficit. But we have to do two things. We have to       generate economic growth which generates revenue, while       reducing spending. That will mean instituting structural       changes to Social Security and Medicare for the future.    That was what Senator Rubio said yesterday.   Well, let me translate what Senator Rubio said yesterday and what  Speaker Paul Ryan has been saying. It is not theoretical. What they are  saying is exactly what will happen. I hope that the senior citizens all  over this country, people who are trying to get by on $13,000 a year on  Social Security, people who are trying to get by on disability, people  who are dependent on Medicaid for their insurance to help them stay  alive when they combat life-threatening diseases like cancer or heart  disease, people in America who are struggling today to put food on the  table, and working families who are trying to figure out how possibly  they might be able to send their kids to college will listen up because  they are virtually admitting--they are telling us--that they are going  to come back and cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.   Yesterday, I made a challenge. I said to my Republican colleagues: If  I am wrong, and it is not your intention to come back here and cut  Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and education, please come down to  the floor and tell me I am wrong. Tell me you have no intention to do  that. I will apologize to you.   Well, we have not heard any Senators come down to the floor to tell  us they will not cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other  programs. In fact, off the floor Senator Rubio indicated that that is  exactly what they intend to do.   Let's be clear. We are not just talking here about a tax bill. That  is a disaster unto itself. That is a massive--   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic time has expired.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 more  minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    Thank you.   I will wind it up, actually, in less than 3 minutes.   Here is the bottom line. The bill that these Republicans are going to  vote on would create massive tax breaks for the rich, raising taxes for  the middle class, raising the deficit by $1.4 trillion, creating a  situation where 13 million lose their health insurance and premiums go  up by 10 percent. That is only half of the story. The other half of the  story is that they are going to come back, and they are going to pay  for the tax breaks for the rich and large corporations by slashing  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.   This legislation is an assault on the middle class and working  families of this country. It must be defeated.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    Mr. President, I am so happy that my colleague, my  friend from Pennsylvania, is concerned about fairness, which, no doubt,  is why 62 percent of the benefits in this tax proposal are going to go  to the top 1 percent, and after 10 years we are going to see over 80  million middle-class families pay more in taxes while the richest  people in this country get huge tax breaks. If that is the definition  of fairness, then I don't quite know what unfairness is about.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Blumenthal,  Merkley, and Warren be added as cosponsors to amendment No. 1720, which  I am offering.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, the amendment I am offering with Senators  Leahy, Brown, Harris, Baldwin, Udall, Reed, Markey, Heinrich, and  Hirono is very simple and straightforward, and I am glad that a number  of my Republican colleagues are on the floor because they can help me  as we go forward on this amendment.   What my amendment would do is establish a point of order to prevent  cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid benefits, which could  be waived only by two-thirds of the Senate. In other words, what we are  trying to do here is make it harder for there to be cuts to Social  Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.   I want everyone in America to know that this tax proposal is more  than a tax proposal. It is my absolute belief that as soon as this tax  proposal is completed and drives the deficit up by $1.4 trillion--I  have zero doubt that my Republican colleagues are going to come back to  the floor of the Senate and suddenly say: Oh, my goodness, the deficit  has gone up. We have to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.   I happen to see my friend from Pennsylvania here on the floor--a  friend. I say to him, and I say to the leader of the Senate, Mr.  McConnell: I will withdraw this amendment if you can assure the  American people tonight that you are not going to come back to the  Senate and cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Can I have that  assurance?    I would yield time--good. I would yield time to my  friend from Pennsylvania to assure--now, I see Senator Rubio down here  as well. He just the other day--correct me if I am wrong, Senator  Rubio. I know you have just walked in, and I have gotten you into this  debate. But correct me if I am wrong, if you did not say yesterday that  the Senate would now proceed to an ``entitlement reform,'' which, in  fact, will mean cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.   I will yield to my friend from Florida to tell me whether I am  accurately portraying what he said just the other day.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.    I know that.    I know that.    I know that.    Reclaiming my time.   Let me quote you, Senator Rubio, and tell me if this is right. This  is a quote that you just made yesterday,  [[Page S7543]]  and if I am wrong, I apologize. But as I understand it, you spoke to a  group of Wall Street lobbyists, and this is what you said:         Many argue that you can't cut taxes because it will drive       up the deficit. But we have to do two things. We have to       generate economic growth which generates revenue, while       reducing spending. That will mean instituting structural       changes to Social Security and Medicare for the future.    Let me help define what my Republican colleagues mean when they talk  about structural changes to Social Security and Medicare. It will mean  that at a time when senior citizens are splitting their pills in half,  Republicans will go forward with massive cuts to Medicare.   Maybe their idea will be to raise the retirement age to 70, forcing  older workers in terms of Social Security to work more before they can  get their benefits. Maybe it will be privatizing Medicare and giving  people a voucher. When my Republican friends talk about saving Social  Security and Medicare, what they are talking about is cutting it.    I will yield.    I will yield.    I will yield 1 minute.    OK, and I did not say the words do appear. What I did  say is that when this legislation is passed and you add $1.4 trillion  to the deficit, then you are going to come back and cut Social  Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.   So is my friend from Pennsylvania now--and that is interesting--are  you guaranteeing the American people that you will not be cutting  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid?   Don't use the word ``save'' because what ``save'' means is a cut.  Will you guarantee the American people now that there will be zero cuts  to benefits in Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid and that you are  not--excuse me. It is my time. I will yield to you. I will yield to  you, but let me finish. I yielded to you before.   Will you guarantee the people of this country that after this bill  passes, you will not come back, raise the retirement age, voucherize  Medicare, raise the retirement age for Medicare, or cut cost-of-living  increases by instituting a so-called Chained CPI? Do I have your word  on that?    Let me be very clear. Do I have your word now that you  as a Senator--I know you can't speak for everybody--that as a Senator,  after this bill is passed--and I suspect it will--you will not support  any cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid? Do I have that  word from you?    Oh, there it is.    Oh, there it is.    Oh, there it is.    Oh, there it is.    Oh, there it is.    I am reclaiming my time--reclaiming my time.    He just let the cat out of the box--or whatever the  phrase is. He just told you he is going to cut Social Security. That is  it, my friends. He will not cut it--what he just said is that he will  not cut it for people on Social Security right now. I hear that. But if  you are 50 years of age or if you are 55 years of age, they just told  you--my friend from Pennsylvania just told you that they may go forward  to raise the retirement age; they may cut your cost-of-living  adjustment. That is what he just said.   So there is a plan, and that is exactly what they intend to do. That  is why I hope we can get strong support for this amendment, which will  require a two-thirds vote to prevent any cuts to Social Security,  Medicare, and Medicaid.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.
