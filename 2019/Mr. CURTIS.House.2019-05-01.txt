 Mr. Speaker, Utahns believe in being good stewards of our  planet, leaving the Earth better than we found it.   When I served as the mayor of Provo, we pursued policies to construct  LEAD-certified buildings, create more environmentally friendly transit  options, and educate our residents on how they can be better stewards  of the environment. We considered these efforts to be meaningful steps  in the right direction.   But, imagine my surprise when I arrived in Congress and learned of  the dangerous winner-take-all system of governing that has overtaken  Washington, especially on issues impacting the environment.   Instead of a pragmatic approach to a positive change through small  and consistent consensus, an all-or-nothing approach dominates the  debate and villainizes all but the most extreme positions.   Congress is a place where ideological purity is rewarded more than  results. It is easy to vote on a messaging bill that the sponsor knows  will never be passed into law and then go home and take the applause  from the like-minded constituents, but it is difficult to leave the  echo chambers and work across the aisle with individuals who have  different backgrounds than yourself and find common ground.   The most obvious example of this is the climate change debate in our  country where, today, my Democratic colleagues have taken the easy  path. The  [[Page H3347]]  bill we are voting on today has 224 Democratic sponsors and not a  single Republican sponsor.   Instead of working with Republicans on our four-part approach to  addressing climate change through innovation, conservation, adaptation,  and preparation, we are sending a partisan bill to die in the Senate.   I attempted to work with my colleagues on this bill. I offered a  good-faith amendment that would increase transparency and competition  by comparing emissions produced by all the countries in the Paris  Agreement. This amendment wasn't even allowed a vote by the Democratic  leadership, although there was no problem allowing votes from their  Democratic friends' amendments.   In fact, only three Republican amendments will be considered, and 26  Democratic amendments will be offered for debate.   It is as if my colleagues on the other side are afraid of hurting the  feelings of China and Russia by pointing out that they are not pulling  their weight.   I have long been a proponent for the environment, and I was proud to  receive the Utah Clean Air Partnership Person of the Year award in  2017. I have championed hundreds of thousands of acres of bipartisan  conservation in Utah.   I, like all Utahns, care deeply about conserving our planet and our  way of life for future generations, but I cannot vote for H.R. 9  because I believe it further divides us apart, reinforcing the false  narrative that all Republicans don't care about the environment because  they are unwilling to get on board with an all-or-nothing, unrealistic  approach to addressing climate change.   H.R. 9 completely ignores the serious and legitimate concerns about  the cost and effectiveness of the Paris Agreement.   H.R. 9 ignores that President Obama's pledge to the Paris Agreement  could cost the United States $250 billion and nearly 3 million jobs in  this next 6 years; and it ignores that, in the next 20 years, this  commitment could cost us $3 trillion and 6.5 million American jobs.   H.R. 9 also ignores that, because of innovation and technological  improvement, the United States is already leading the world in reducing  greenhouse gas emissions. Since 2000, the United States has decreased  annual carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 800 million tons, the largest  absolute decline among all countries since 2000.   H.R. 9 ignores the fact that, if the United States cut CO2  emissions to zero, it would not even come close to offsetting the  emissions coming from the rest of the world.   H.R. 9 even ignores that the Paris Agreement allows China, the  Earth's largest greenhouse gas polluter, to increase their emissions  through 2030 with little evidence to show that they plan to comply in  the future.   I have heard over and over that the U.S. must remain in the Paris  Agreement to show leadership. And I ask you: What kind of leadership  leads to double-digit unemployment in rural America but lets China off  the hook?   I agree that America must continue to show leadership, but let's  focus on leadership that goes back to the core principles of  innovation, conservation, adaptation, and preparation. This bill fails  to do any of that.   Let's continue leading the world and bettering our environment, but  let's not pretend that H.R. 9 is a silver bullet to our evolving world.   I hope that we can stop with the easy, cheap rhetoric that offers  false promises and divides our country even further and focus on those  things that make meaningful change.                            ____________________
