 Mr. Speaker, in March, our public health  experts said that we needed to stay home to fight this virus and to  bend the curve. Those public health experts urged the administration  and Congress to design COVID-19 relief that included 8 weeks of  paycheck protection and enhanced unemployment compensation through  July, all with the thought that that was the amount of support that we  needed to provide, given the nature of this virus.   Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to state the obvious: Months later,  America remains in the throes of a brutal pandemic, Americans are  hurting, and Arkansans are hurting. Every day I hear from restaurant  owners and hotel operators who are concerned about whether or not they  will stay in business and whether or not they can survive.   Central Arkansans tell me that they are spending more time worried  about their school kids, keeping their schools open, and having  reliable broadband to be able to do telemedicine and tele-education.  More central Arkansans are taking their meals at food banks. Mr.  Speaker, frontline workers depend on help and our health industry to  deliver the care that is essential.   Yet, Mr. Speaker, for what has the House leadership and Speaker  Pelosi brought us back to Washington, D.C., to consider? Is it to  consider this much-needed delivered COVID-19 relief for the American  people?   No.   Is it to extend the deadline for the Paycheck Protection Program or  bring the discharge petition to the House floor that House Republicans  have proposed, that has over 180 signatures of this body to help our  small businesses who desperately need that assistance?   No.   Mr. Speaker, while Arkansans and Americans are suffering, and while  Republicans are working to extend critical assistance like the Paycheck  Protection Program, our House Democratic leadership is putting a bill  to legalize pot on the floor of the United States House for a vote.   Let that sink in. In the midst of this pandemic and in the midst of  calls across the country to help the American people, our leadership in  this House has proposed a bill to legalize pot.   My friends on the other side of the aisle are showing just how much  they are out of touch with conditions in our country today. People are  working to make ends meet for their families. They are trying to  educate their children while juggling work obligations. They are trying  to protect themselves and their loved ones from this virus.   And that is why we are here this week: To legalize pot?   Mr. Speaker, Republicans are leading. Our discharge petition could  help small businesses right now, and every Democrat should sign it.  Yet, Mr. Speaker, for 40 times, our Speaker of the House has blocked  the consideration of extending the Paycheck Protection Program. House  Democrats need to follow the lead of House Republicans and put  Americans above their special interest friends by moving COVID-19  relief today on this House floor, by calling up our discharge petition  and voting on paycheck protection relief.                          Recognizing Clayton Boothe     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  exceptional young man in my district, Clayton Boothe, who was raised to  value a broad span of interests. At just 17 years old, he is excelling  in many of these areas.   He is captain of his quiz bowl team, founder of Maumelle High  School's chess team, and a member of Arkansas' Governor's School and  the National Honor Society. He is ranked top of his class, and he is  one of 16,000 semifinalists in the 2021 National Merit Scholarship  Program out of 1.5 million nationwide applicants.  [[Page H6053]]    He is a writer who is working on a novel. He is a musician and a  member of the Arkansas Sympathy Youth Orchestra. He hopes to attend  Northwestern University in Chicago, and I expect him to succeed  wherever life takes him. I congratulate Clayton on his hard work and  keen interests.   Keep it up, Clayton, and make Maumelle High School and your family  proud.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mr. McCaul, for  the time and take a moment to salute and provide tribute to Congressman  Eliot Engel for his extraordinary service as chair of the House Foreign  Affairs Committee. His wise counsel will be missed in this House.   Mr. Speaker, let me thank, too, my good friend on the House Financial  Services Committee, a colleague and collaborator on many good things,  my friend, Congressman Al Green from Houston, for his service and  leadership on this important matter.   Austin Bennett Tice, an international correspondent in Syria and a  Marine veteran who we have heard about today, has been missing since  2012. And my constituent, Dr. Majd Kamalmaz, a noted child therapist  who was in Syria attending the funeral of a relative, has been missing  since 2017.   These families deserve certainty and recovery of their loved ones,  Mr. Speaker. Both Mr. Tice and Dr. Kamalmaz have called on American and  international leaders to bring home their loved ones.   It is our duty to do whatever we can to ensure that these and all  other Americans held abroad are returned safely and as soon as  possible.   I am grateful for the leadership of President Trump and now National  Security Advisor and former Special Envoy for Hostage Affairs Robert  O'Brien for their steadfast determination to bring American citizens  home.   Our work will not be complete until all Americans are reunited with  their families and their loved ones.   We ask for God's blessings on this House floor for those held in  captivity and for their loved ones.   Mr. Speaker, I vote in favor, and I urge my colleagues to vote in  favor of this important legislation. Let's pull together in this House  to bring home our American hostages.
