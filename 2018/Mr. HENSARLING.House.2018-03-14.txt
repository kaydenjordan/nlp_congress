 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 773, I call  up the bill (H.R. 1116) to require the Federal financial institutions  regulatory agencies to take risk profiles and business models of  institutions into account when taking regulatory actions, and for other  purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, we were told many, many years ago that Dodd-Frank was  passed to deal with the big Wall Street banks, that somehow our  community banks and our credit unions would be held harmless because,  Mr. Speaker, they didn't cause the crisis.   Now, we can have the discussion of what did--that is a whole  different discussion for a different day--but unfortunately, regardless  of whatever good intentions there might have been at the time, and I  don't offer an opinion as to those intentions, the facts are that,  since Dodd-Frank was passed, the big banks are bigger and the small  banks and credit unions are fewer. We are losing, on average, a  community bank or credit union every other day in America.   And as we lose them, Mr. Speaker, so do we lose the hopes and dreams  and desires of our constituents, of so many  [[Page H1577]]  hardworking Americans who deserve to buy that car, who deserve to be  able to own their own home, who deserve, after working so many years on  the assembly line, to finally capitalize their own small business. But  none of this is going to happen unless we actually tailor this  regulatory burden to the size and complexity of the financial  institution, something that, in many respects, was promised by Dodd- Frank but not delivered by Dodd-Frank.   So I am very, very happy that, today, we have yet another bipartisan  bill from the Financial Services Committee that is aimed to promote  economic growth, to help hardworking Americans, again, achieve their  American Dream, because half of this country is living from paycheck to  paycheck, and we need to ease that economic anxiety, and so we have got  to make sure that the lifeblood of credit, that capital, is flowing  through the system.   It is our community banks in particular that fund our small  businesses. Unfortunately, up until the advent of the new  administration, Mr. Speaker, small business lending by banks was at a  25-year low, entrepreneurship was at a generational low.   Now, thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we have turned that corner,  but we have so much further to go. So a particularly hardworking member  of the House Financial Services Committee, the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Tipton), has come to us today with H.R. 1116, the Taking Account  of Institutions with Low Operation Risk Act, yes, Mr. Speaker, the  TAILOR Act.   Simply put, what this bill does is simply directs the Federal  financial regulators to, again, simply tailor their regulations to  entities based upon their size, their risk profile, their complexity.  It also demands that they have some transparency in this process by  requiring that the regulators report to Congress, report to the  representatives of ``we the people'' how they have actually tailored  the regulations--again, something that was implied, something that was  promised in Dodd-Frank but did not actually occur.   Again, Mr. Speaker, every single day we hear from our community  financial institutions. I heard from one in New Mexico that said:         You know, we are a $300 million community bank in an area       with high unemployment. Thirty-seven percent of our employees       are active in community organizations, Little League,       charities, and many serve in leadership positions in these       organizations, and we also make tens of thousands of dollars       in charitable contributions every year; but if our bank can't       survive, you take away the local leadership, you take away       the economic engine of our community.    This banker was clearly talking about the regulatory burden.   I heard from one in Iowa:         I am a mortgage consumer lender and also the compliance       officer of a small community bank in rural Iowa. I have been       in banking for over 30 years and always enjoyed my job until       the last 5 years. The new rules that will be implemented are       ridiculous, and at that time, we may discontinue to offer in-      house mortgage loans.    Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, my mailbox runneth over.   As our small banks and credit unions go, so goes the American Dream.   At a bare minimum, let's tailor the rules and regulations to the size  and complexity of the institution so our credit unions, so our banks  can thrive and, thus, our constituents can thrive and meet their  economic goals and responsibilities.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton), the sponsor of the TAILOR Act, who also serves  as the vice chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations of our Financial Services Committee, a very, very  hardworking member of the committee and a real leader to help preserve  and maintain our community banks and credit unions.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), the chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit and a real  leader on our committee for proper regulation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the chairman of the Financial Services  Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), who is the chairman of our Monetary Policy and  Trade Subcommittee.  [[Page H1580]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Kentucky.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), the vice chairman of the Financial  Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), a senior member of the Financial Services  Committee, and the former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee,  who knows how important our community banks are to the world of  agriculture.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), a very hardworking member of the House  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), someone who knows that one size does not  fit all.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Speaker, I don't have any further speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have left.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton)  for his leadership. Again, whether it be through failure, whether it be  through merger or acquisition, we still, on average, are losing a  community bank or credit union a day in America. And when we listen to  them, Mr. Speaker, what we know is it is the regulatory burden.   I know that the ranking member speaks frequently of the Wall Street  megabanks. They have done quite fine under Dodd-Frank. The ranking  member likes to allude to their profitability. Listen, I hope every  business in America can find some way to be profitable, but that is not  the question.    The real question is the profitability of our constituents, half of  whom are living paycheck to paycheck. And it is those constituents who  we care about when we lose an opportunity for them to capitalize their  American Dream.   When I hear from Colton in Terrell, Texas, in the Fifth District that  I proudly represent, who says:         You know what? Me and my wife have been unable to get a       mortgage due to credit. We are 25 to 30 years old. We have       good credit, but we are getting denied.    That is everything to do with the regulatory burden, Mr. Speaker.   I heard from Sara in Eustace in my district. She writes:         I would like to refinance with a cashout option to fix some       storm damage to my property and home, but I found out that it       is not an option for me because the government doesn't       believe I should be able to do this.    I heard from Alan, in Kaufman, Texas, who said:         However, as a small-business owner, I offer owner financing       for real estate to people with little or no credit, but the       overregulation of Dodd-Frank has caused my cost of business       to rise. I am forced to pass that cost on to the consumer.       Regulations cost the consumer, not the business.    So the ranking member wants to know who is for this bill. Well, I can  [[Page H1583]]  tell you what, Colton is for this bill, Sara is for this bill, Al is  for this bill, and, oh, by the way, so is the gentleman from Washington  (Mr. Heck), Democratic member of our committee; so is the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Gottheimer), Democratic member of our committee;  so is the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gonzalez), Democrat member of our  committee; so is the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott), Democratic  member of our committee.   Again, there is lots of great bipartisan work that goes on at the  House Financial Services Committee. Regrettably, very little of it  takes place with the participation of the ranking member.                                time  1700    Again, this is a very simple bill. It just says tailor the  regulation. Tailor the regulation to the size and complexity.   Mr. Speaker, I don't believe in too-big-to-fail banks. I don't  believe any financial institution is too big to fail in America. I am  not going to vote to bail them out with taxpayer funds; maybe the  ranking member will.   But if I did, if I believed in too-big-to-fail banks, it would be  limited to about eight or nine. Using the ranking member's favorite  phrase, the Wall Street megabanks. Then, fine. Then why don't we see an  amendment from her that limits the entirety of Dodd-Frank to the so- called Wall Street megabanks? I am still waiting for that amendment. I  have yet to see it.   Why don't we release the rest of the banking and credit union world  to help finance the American Dream, to help finance the cars, to help  finance the small businesses, to help finance the homes?   Again, it is a simple amendment. It is a bipartisan amendment. And,  by the way, it happens to be one of the most important amendments  supported by the trade associations for the credit unions and for our  community banks. So they believe in it, Mr. Speaker.   So I encourage every Member of this body to vote for the TAILOR Act  and save our community banks and credit unions to finance the American  Dream.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to claim time in opposition.    Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to my friend  from Virginia, and he is my friend, but I also must say that rarely in  the history of the House have I ever seen a motion to recommit that has  less to do with the underlying bill than this one.   I know that my friends on the other side of the aisle, over a year  later, still cannot accept the outcome of the election, which,  unfortunately, is a complete slap in the face of democracy.    I know there is an element that works full time on the other side of  the aisle to impeach the President. This is their full-time avocation.  Meanwhile, on this side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker, we continue to work  in order to try to improve the lot in lives of the common working man  and woman.   So we were very proud to work with the President on the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act that has brought us the lowest unemployment rate in America in  17 years.   Under their economic policies, Mr. Speaker, what we saw were high  levels of unemployment. What we saw were stagnant wages. What we saw  was 1.6 percent GDP growth when in the postwar era we have averaged 3  percent economic growth. What we saw under their economic policies was  that people couldn't make ends meet. Too many were still living  paycheck to paycheck.   And now I hear from my constituents. I heard from one the other day  who said: Guess what? They just announced at my husband's business  everybody is getting a 5 percent pay increase.   I just heard from Michael in Terrell, who is a doctor, and he said:  Thanks to President Trump--who they are trying to impeach--thanks to  President Trump and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, now I can afford to buy  a new ultrasound machine for my rural practice, and I am going to  actually hire an additional ultrasound technician.   All due to the President, again, they are trying to impeach.   I heard from Charles in Winnsboro who said: You know what? The new  tax reforms will drop my tax bracket by 17 percent, and this will allow  me to rebuild my shop that had been destroyed.   And then I look at the employers in my hometown of Dallas, Texas:  American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, AT&T, Comerica. So many of them,  Mr. Speaker, are offering $1,000 bonuses. Many are offering increases  in minimum wages. Many have increased 401(k) plans. All, again, due to  the activities of the Republicans, because not one single Democrat  supported the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   So I understand how my friends on the other side of the aisle wish to  attempt to change the subject because they are probably now embarrassed  they didn't support it, because they have seen how much good it has  done, how much of a difference it makes.   So if they want to waste the House's time by once again trying to  find ways to undermine the President, impeach the President, I know it  is a full-time job for many, but on this side of the aisle, we are  going to continue to make sure that the lot of the common man and woman  is improved. We are going to make sure that our community banks and  credit unions can lend to them. We are going to ensure that there is  great economic growth so that we can continue to fund the American  Dream. That is what we are going to do on this side of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to reject the motion to  recommit and to support the underlying TAILOR Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
