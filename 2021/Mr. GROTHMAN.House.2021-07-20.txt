 Mr. Speaker, I would like to address the crisis we have  on our southern border.   Last week, I was fortunate enough to go with three other Congressmen  to see the Rio Grande Valley sector, and I want to educate the American  public, as well as my colleagues, as to what I saw down there. It is my  personal belief that it is the biggest crisis that we are facing today.   First of all, let's just look at the raw numbers. In June, we have  had contact with 190,000 people at the border. Now, a lot of those are  turned around. We do not know, because the numbers are not yet  available, how many are let in the country, but we believe about 16,000  children who were unaccompanied by an adult are let in; we believe  about 24,000 other family members are let in; and we believe about  30,000 people who are not touched by the Border Patrol and who are  sneaking across the line are let in.   So, we believe that more than 70,000 people, who we did not pick and  did not vet, were let in America in June, as opposed to about 6,000  people last June. That is kind of a dramatic change, 6,000 to 70,000  people.   Normally, this time of year, by the way, those numbers are falling,  but they went up in June compared to May. Why? Normally, it is hot this  time of year, and people are less likely to travel south of the border,  but more people are coming up here.   I have been down to the border four times this year, and things are  different from sector to sector. The Rio Grande Valley sector is that  which borders the Gulf of Mexico. I want to point out that, there,  people are coming from  [[Page H3744]]  countries you would expect, primarily Honduras, then Guatemala, then  Mexico, then El Salvador, although other countries like Haiti, Ecuador,  or Cuba are also in the top 10, a little bit different than other  regions where Brazil led the way or where Russia was very close to the  top.   I want to point out that according to the Border Patrol agents I  talked to, frequently, these people are not necessarily starving or  poor, with the exception of Venezuela and Cuba, where they have had to  put up with socialist Marxist governments. They appear well fed. Some  of them, particularly from Cuba or Europe, are actually, judging by  their clothes or the purses they have, relatively well off.   I stood on the border in a path between the Rio Grande River and  where you check in with the Border Patrol. During the 45 minutes I  stood there, again and again and again clumps of people, 15 people, 45  people, 25 people, were coming across. They were rather jolly, despite  the fact that I was standing next to a Border Patrol agent. That did  not intimidate them. They knew that, under our new laws, they would be  escorted in. They just smiled, waved, and were completely happy.   They knew that they would wind up being looked at, at the border.  That is why people just kept coming, until 3 o'clock in the morning, as  one of my colleagues saw.   What other comments can I make about watching this huge sea of  humanity cross the border? It is strengthening the cartels. I do not  know if I believe it, but a Border Patrol agent told me that he felt  the Mexican cartels are now making more money escorting people across  the American border than they are from drugs. I can't document that.  That is just what I was told.   If you have to come across the border, if you come across the Rio  Grande, people have to realize, you do not get to come across unless  you deal with the drug cartels. They will charge someone from Mexico  about $3,000; from Central America, about $5,000; from Brazil--and  these are all abouts--you negotiate your own price with the cartels,  maybe $10,000.   I didn't see anybody coming from China, but our tour guides at the  Rio Grande Valley said it was not uncommon to get people from China.  They may be paying up to $20,000.   You get different trips. When you come up from Central America, first  of all, you are escorted toward a place near the border between Mexico  and Central America. Then, you pay to get from a gathering place there  to a gathering place just south of the American border. Then, you are  escorted to the Rio Grande River and over the Rio Grande River. Maybe  for a higher quality trip, it might cost you $12,000 to get a better  boat, that sort of thing, as you worked your way north.   You have to pay. We recently heard a story from the Border Patrol in  which somebody from Ecuador refused to pay. He felt like he could just  come across the border. The gangs just killed him on the spot, boom.  That is the type of thing you are dealing with.   A lot of sexual assaults, so as our Border Patrol interviews people,  they try to do something about it. But, obviously, given the hodgepodge  nature of the border, I think very rarely are they able to catch the  assailant.   To give you a further idea of how difficult it is, people might say:  Why does the Border Patrol not intercept the boat coming across the Rio  Grande? Because what the drug cartels will do if there is a little  child on the boat, and there is frequently a little child, they will  just throw that child in the river, knowing full well that the U.S.  Border Patrol, being compassionate Americans, will help that 1-year-old  or 3-year-old child to safety rather than go after the drug cartel or  the person working for the drug cartel, escorting people across the  border. I was told again today, talking to our Border Patrol, that is  very common, that they would throw a little child in the river.   Kind of an interesting thing, if you watch these people come across,  it is so automatic that, nowadays, they get a little wristband, like  you might get at a county fair. That wristband varies depending upon  the quality of trip you are going to get, as well as which gang is  escorting you across. It is just done automatically.    Like I said, you come to the southern border of Mexico. Then, you  take a plane, train, or bus through Mexico and enter another gathering  place just south of the border. You are escorted to the river, and then  escorted on a boat across. Like I said, depending on the quality of the  trip, $3,000, or from Asia, $20,000--a very difficult thing.   The next thing we learned down there, you might think: What does  Mexico think about the new policies implemented by the United States?  Of course, the biggest policy is that we got rid of the migrant  protection program, where people who were going to ask for asylum had  to stay south of the border. For whatever reason, the Biden  administration decided to get rid of that.   Since then, the Border Patrol agents I talked to felt they were  getting less cooperation with Mexico. They are still getting  cooperation, but it frayed the very good cooperation we had with the  Mexican border patrol 6 months ago because the attitude of the Mexican  border patrol themselves or the police themselves is: Why should I risk  my life taking on the drug gangs when the Americans on the other side  don't really seem to care about protecting their own border?   The next thing to point out, that I didn't know looking at TV, is it  is not unusual at all to have people come here without their own ID.  Without their own ID, of course, you have to take their word for it, as  to who they are. You can't do criminal background checks like you want  to do.   Bizarrely, even without an ID, the wonderful American taxpayer will  fly you or bus you wherever you want to go in the United States. When I  left that area, in the McAllen airport, I saw people with manila  envelopes. On the envelope, it says: ``I do not speak English,'' but it  gives directions as to where you should go.   As we talked to some of the immigrants coming across, they knew where  they wanted to go. ``I want to go to Chicago.'' ``I want to go to New  York.'' ``I want to go to Louisiana.'' So, we dutifully put the  instructions on the manila envelope, without ID, and they are allowed  to get on the airlines without ID, something that none of us could do,  and we take them wherever they want to go.   The next comment I will have is people talk about keeping families  together. Under the current system, as we open up the border, we see  not a small number of children all alone in what I can only describe as  cages. I would say they are maybe 20 feet by 20 feet with maybe eight  kids in there all under the age of 5, or another fencing area with kids  who are older than that crowded together, maybe 10 to 13. They are,  obviously, kids. We do let kids in who claim to be under 18 who almost  certainly aren't. But in any event, it is kind of heartbreaking to see  these little kids under the age of 5 sitting on mats, asleep at 10 in  the morning without any adults to accompany them, without their parents  to accompany them.   Now, you might say: What are they doing here? Bizarrely, I think,  parents will send their kids north to live with an aunt and uncle or  gram or grandpa or whatever, and they put the address and the name of  the people on their T-shirts or with something the kids are carrying.  Then, the kids show the Border Patrol their T-shirts, and the United  States sends the kids to a nonprofit organization that takes them to  New York, Baltimore, or wherever.   It frustrates the Border Patrol because, of course, in the United  States, if we knew parents who just wrote on a 3-year-old's shirt  ``take Johnny to 123 Elm Street in Los Angeles, California,'' and  dropped him off at the airport, those parents would be getting a call  from social services.   But here, in dealing with immigrants, we don't consider that unusual  at all. ``Oh, Johnny, we are supposed to find a way to take you from  McAllen to 123 Elm Street in West Bend, Wisconsin.'' Why? We have no  problem doing that. It is just something that bothers the Border Patrol  and bothers me as well.   The next thing to think about, something new that the Border Patrol  sees, and I am a big advocate for those people who are born with  different abilities, but it is apparent to the Border Patrol that, more  recently, they are getting kids who they wonder if they are coming from  orphanages, who have different abilities than the rest of us--  [[Page H3745]]  you could say special needs. We are seeing more of that come across the  border.   Of course, America is a very wonderful country, and we do take these  kids in. I am sure we will find special programs for them. But I think  it ought to be openly discussed if we are seeing a new trend of  countries south of the border feeling that it is up to the United  States to care for this population.                                time  1930    I am going to comment a little bit on the people they call got-aways.  Obviously, if you have so many young kids who are being processed here,  Mr. Speaker, the Border Patrol has to spend a lot of time filling out  paperwork and interviewing these folks.   What happens when the Border Patrol is filling out paperwork and  changing diapers? They don't have time to guard the border.   As a result, we have heard in certain sectors the Border Patrol is at  one half the number of people they want on the border, which is why  this time last year they had about 6,000 got-aways sneaking in every  month, and now there are 30,000 got-aways sneaking in every month.   A discussion of what I learned at the border is incomplete without  talking about the drugs that are coming across the border. Ever since I  have had this job, we have talked about the number of people who are  dying in this country by illegal drug overdoses. I think after a while  people's eyes tend to glaze over, and they may not be aware that in the  last 6 or 7 years the number of people dying in this country has  doubled.   When I first got this job, it was about 45,000 a year, and I was just  stunned at 45,000. It is not that far away from the number of people  who died fighting in Vietnam, and every year that many people die of  drug overdoses in this country. It has doubled. It is now up to 90,000  a year.   When I talked to the local DEA agent in Milwaukee, he told me that he  felt the drugs from all of the overdoses in Milwaukee County--which at  the time was 540 a year--probably came across the southern border. Just  like every other member of law enforcement in Wisconsin, they wonder  what we are doing in Washington to prevent these drugs from coming  across the southern border.   Why is there such a big increase?   I think two things: First of all, more drugs are coming across the  border. As marijuana becomes legalized in more and more States and  grown legally in more States, there is a speculation that the drug  gangs who, after all, make money selling drugs, are shifting from  marijuana to harder drugs.   Secondly, the current drug of choice, the drug that is being used by  these horrible cartels--and by the way, we ought to put more of these  people in prison, not less--the type of drugs that are being brought  across by these cartels is fentanyl.   I had always thought that heroin was about the most dangerous thing  you could take, Mr. Speaker. Fentanyl is much more dangerous than  heroin, which is why I recently talked to a district attorney in my  district, and in his area there were as many people who died from drug  overdoses last year as the 3 prior years combined. It is what we see as  the young people shift or older people shift from heroin to fentanyl on  purpose or not on purpose, because frequently the fentanyl is put in  with the heroin.   So if we care about the 90,000 people who are dying every year in  this country of illegal overdoses and we think about the poor families  who lose their loved ones and wonder what we are going to do, it seems  that a minimum part of the response has to be to respond at the border.   One more time, it seems like we are going in the opposite direction.  We are doing less at the border. More people are coming across, and  more people coming across means more fentanyl; more fentanyl coming  across means more fentanyl-laced heroin; and more fentanyl-laced heroin  means more people dying and more broken hearts of the families of the  people who are dying.   So what can I recommend to the wonderful Congressman in the Chair?   First of all, I will ask the Biden administration not to get rid of  title 42. That is the section that allows the Border Patrol to turn  people around because of fear of COVID. There are rumors that the use  of title 42 is soon going to be dropped by the Biden administration.  Perhaps the uptick in COVID will cause them not to do it. But as I  said, already we have 70,000 people a month crossing the border, and if  the word gets out that we are no longer going to turn away single  adults or families with kids over the age of 7 who are right now being  turned around because of COVID, that 70,000-a-month figure is going to  shoot up even more.   Secondly, with regard to COVID right now, the Border Patrol checks  people, but they only check people if they have a temperature of at  least 99; otherwise, they just send them on--which includes a lot of  asymptomatic people--to the nongovernmental organizations who take  these people next.   If they test positive there, then these organizations put them up in  hotels or apartments.   But because they are here illegally and they want to get inland to  America, what do the people with COVID do once they are placed in a  hotel or placed in an apartment?   They leave right away. So, right now, as a practical matter the  policy of the Biden administration of people who come here--I am not  talking about unvaccinated people, I am talking about people who  literally have COVID--the response of this country is we let them in. I  would beg the Biden administration to do something about that concern.   So keep or expand title 42 so people can't get here because of COVID.  And, secondly, when people test positive for COVID, don't let them out.  That is kind of opposite of the whole story we are getting from the  President.   The third thing I would like to ask the President to do--and I made  this request, I think it was 3 weeks ago now--please put someone other  than Vice President Harris in charge of the border. She went down to  the El Paso sector. She did a few-hour perfunctory check.   I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, I learn so much more every time I am  down there, and usually I stay down there a couple days each. Every  sector of the southern border is different, and there are nine sectors  there. I happened to be in the Rio Grande sector this time. It is very  different from what you learn in the Tucson sector, Mr. Speaker, and  very different from what you learn in the San Diego sector.    Please, President Biden, pick someone who either has a zeal to  control the southern border or at least is personally responsible  enough to go down there and do something. Because I will tell you, Mr.  Speaker, that 70,000 figure now up from 6,000 a year ago is going to do  nothing but grow; and if you ever get rid of title 42, it is going to  rocket up through the roof. I don't think there is any country-- particularly a country with a generous welfare state like we have--who  can survive purely open borders.   So there is your primer, Mr. Speaker, for all the people fortunate  enough to be in the room and fortunate to be listening at all.   I beg President Biden to take the border more seriously, and I beg  the media of this country to take the border more seriously. I do not  think anything that the government does or does not do is more  significant than what happens with the 70,000 people who are coming  across the border today, and what I believe will happen as soon as the  weather gets a little cooler and it becomes more apparent to people  around the world, soon that number is going to go from 70 to 80 to 90  to 100 and maybe significantly more than that.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the time, and I yield back the balance  of my time.                            ____________________
