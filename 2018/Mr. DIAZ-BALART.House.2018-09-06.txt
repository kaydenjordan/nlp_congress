 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Hill for allowing us, those  of us who knew, worked with, admired John McCain, to have this moment,  to have this time to honor and to remember and to, frankly, speak about  someone who all of us admired so much.   Senator John McCain was, as you have heard from everyone and from all  of us who knew him and who had contact with him, he was a patriot and  he was a great American hero. I am profoundly blessed to count this man  as both a trusted colleague and a loyal friend.   We have heard so many things about him today, tonight, because,  again, of this wonderful moment that Mr. Hill has done for us here  tonight, allowed us to do tonight.    Mr. Speaker, one thing that some of you may not know  about John McCain's time at the Hanoi Hilton was that he spoke of a  Castro regime thug and his Cuban underling. They were sent to Vietnam  to torture American POWs, to torture John McCain's friends. He had  hoped to one day identify those barbaric individuals and bring them to  justice.   Sadly, John did not see that egregious injustice, along with so many  perpetuated by the Castro regime, resolved in his lifetime.   John witnessed firsthand the evil of communism, along with the  tyranny and the inhumanity that it breeds. A tyrant capable of such  brutal oppression of his own people could also be responsible for  unspeakable atrocities to those who would stand up to the tyranny.   Perhaps that experience, Mr. Speaker, personally motivated John  McCain's passionate advocacy for freedom and human dignity, as well as  his untiring outreach to those languishing under tyranny anywhere in  the world, as Mr. Costa mentioned just a little while ago.   He was a fitting chairman of the International Republican Institute's  board since 1993, an organization whose mission is to promote freedom  and civil society and democracy to some of the world's most repressive  environments. That mission aligned perfectly with Senator McCain.   So, yes, although I am deeply saddened by a loss of such magnitude, I  will tell you that I am encouraged by the knowledge that his example  will continue to inspire and educate for many, many generations to  come.   There will never be another one like John McCain and we are all  fortunate to have had the benefit of his service to our Nation.    I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas.    Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank Mr. Hill for bringing  us together and for allowing us to remember and to honor a great  American hero.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
