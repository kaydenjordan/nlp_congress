 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of  retiring Bedford County, Virginia, Sheriff Mike Brown. The county's top  law enforcement officer since 1996, Sheriff Brown has devoted nearly 50  years to protecting the citizens of his home county and the  Commonwealth of Virginia.   In his time as sheriff, Mike has led efforts to modernize the  department and expand cooperation with surrounding departments. These  efforts led to the 1998 creation of the Southern Virginia Internet  Crimes Against Children Task Force, an organization whose purpose is  locating and prosecuting individuals who prey on our children.   In the most recent reporting year, the task force arrested 227  individuals accused of crimes against children and identified 127 child  victims. Over 20 years, an untold number of children have been  protected and hundreds of predators have been put behind bars because  of Sheriff Brown's efforts to establish the task force.   In 2017, Sheriff Brown was appropriately named National Sheriffs'  Association Sheriff of the Year.   Madam Speaker, I thank Sheriff Brown for his service to the citizens  of  [[Page H2515]]  Bedford County and all of Virginia, and I wish him and his family all  the best during a well-earned retirement. His service leaves a legacy  we can all be proud of.                            ____________________
