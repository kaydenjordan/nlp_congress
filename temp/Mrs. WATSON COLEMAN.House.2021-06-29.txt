 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize some of  the amazing track talent from the 12th District.   This past weekend, Athing Mu of Trenton, the child of Sudanese  immigrants, dominated her 800-meter Olympic qualifying race, nearly  breaking the American record despite an early collision on the track.  This young woman is finally getting the recognition she has worked so  hard for.   No less impressive was Dunellen's own Sydney McLaughlin, who broke  the world record for the 400-meter hurdles, becoming the first woman to  ever run the race in under 52 seconds.   We have known about these extraordinary young women for quite some  time back home, but now America has had the opportunity to see them in  action.   New Jersey is so proud of them. I can't wait for them to show the  world what they will do at the Olympics.                            ____________________
