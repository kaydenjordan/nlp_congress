 Madam Speaker, I am struggling to understand what we are  doing here today. We already know that the Democrats go to great  lengths to defend the unconstitutional Affordable Care Act.   They really believe that Congress can and should force the American  people to buy something, whether they want it or not. We know this  because they made everyone vote on this same provision in title I of  the rules package last week. Now we are here voting on the same thing  this week.   ``Why?'' some Americans may ask. Because Democrats are trying to sell  this farce as a vote to protect people with preexisting conditions.   But this is not a healthcare vote. This is a vote to give cover  because the law they passed was unconstitutional, and the individual  mandate was deeply unpopular.   They could put an end to this by passing a law that abides by the  Constitution, but they are not willing to do that. Instead, we are  wasting time here today voting on something for the second time.   Republicans know that we can protect the people with preexisting  health conditions without infringing on basic freedoms. This is why,  last week, we voted on an amendment to the rules package to guarantee  no American citizen can be denied health insurance coverage as a result  of a preexisting condition.                                time  1600    I voted to ensure that no American citizen can be charged a higher  premium or cost sharing as a result of a preexisting condition.   But the majority would rather spend time and taxpayer money defending  the constitutionality of the ACA's individual mandate. They seem to  have forgotten that the Supreme Court told them, back in 2012, that  Congress does not have the power to make the American people purchase a  product.   The Democrats should not spend more taxpayer money defending the  indefensible.   Congress should focus its energy on making healthcare more affordable  and giving people meaningful choice in healthcare again.
