 Madam Speaker, I support this legislation  because hospitals and small businesses in our communities need relief.   Our communities need this bridge over troubled waters.   This legislation rightfully invests $300-plus billion into the  backbone of our economy: small businesses. It puts $75 billion into our  Nation's hospitals and ensures that those serving our most vulnerable  receive the resources they need to save lives. It invests $25 billion  in testing.   As the chair of the CBC Health Braintrust, we must make sure that the  testing goes into the areas disproportionately affected, like the Black  and Brown communities.    This legislation includes language developed by me, along with  Congresswomen Bass, Lee, and Pressley, as well as Senators Warren,  Harris, and Booker, to ensure that we collect and analyze racial data  related to the obvious disparity in COVID-19.   The better data made possible by this bill must effectively direct  resources into our communities where needed, not where best connected.   Let us also remember the postal workers, the State and local  governments, our teachers. They need our resources also.   Madam Speaker, I want to give my condolences to Senator Warren for  losing her brother to COVID-19.
