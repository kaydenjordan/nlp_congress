 Madam Speaker, I rise tonight in recognition of National  Law Enforcement Day.   Our officers who hit the streets on behalf of our safety, we need to  show them appreciation, and I do. We also need to give them better  tools and better laws that make their job easier, because it is,  indeed, at the end of the day, us who they are protecting.   We have things happen in California, like we saw with the tragedy,  due to lack of control of our borders, with Officer Singh, who  unfortunately had to give his life unnecessarily. These tragedies need  to end.   On this day, as we recognize them, the thin blue line between us as  citizens and the harm that could be brought to us is greatly  appreciated.   For those who are always out there and every day get up, kiss their  families good-bye, and, hopefully, return home at the end of that day  safe as they have kept us safe, we honor them. We ask for God's  blessings for safety and to return home each day intact as they keep  our communities intact.   We need to do a better job of honoring them by giving them the tools,  the laws, and the secure borders that would help them accomplish that.                            ____________________
