 Mr. Speaker, I rise to call the House's attention to  ongoing human rights abuses in Pakistan, particularly in the province  of Sindh. For years, political activists and religious minorities in  Sindh have faced daily threats of forced conversion, disappearances by  security forces, and murder.   Hundreds of Sindhis remain unaccounted for and others have been held  away from their families for months or years to create a climate of  fear and repression. There is also a disturbingly high incidence of  terrorist violence against religious minorities, which Pakistani  security forces have been unable or unwilling to prevent.   I call upon the administration to prioritize these issues with  Pakistan, which is conducting their national election today. The  assault on religious and ethnic minorities in Pakistan must end, and  the hundreds of people who have been detained indefinitely must be  released.                            ____________________
