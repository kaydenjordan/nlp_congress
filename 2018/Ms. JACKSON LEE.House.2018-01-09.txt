 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4559, the Global Aviation  System Security Reform Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his leadership on this  legislation.   This legislation would require the TSA to conduct a global aviation  security review in order to improve aviation standards across the  global aviation system within 180 days of enactment.   The security review within this bill is required to include input  from the TSA's Office of Global Strategies, Office of Intelligence and  Analysis, and the Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement,  and must identify best practices for foreign partners.   While the TSA has taken tremendous steps to improve aviation security  at airports with direct service to the U.S., there is more that can be  done.   In the last 12 months, we have seen the global aviation threat  landscape evolve to include an increased threat to cargo security, and  passenger planes being targeted with bombs hidden in large electronic  devices.   The TSA is continually working with global partners and stakeholders  to ensure that aviation standards are being maintained and elevated as  needed.   Under this legislation, improvements that should be made to aviation  security will be highlighted for Congress.   This legislation has the potential of providing a very good roadmap  for Congress to address areas of improvement for global aviation  security and to ensure that we constantly strive towards the safest and  most secure aviation community.   Mr. Speaker, I note that, in the last couple of days, through the  holiday season, those people who were either stuck in airports, and  bags that were stacked, and people couldn't find bags are not  considered a security issue. It was a weather issue. But we understand  how crucial it is that the traveling public has needs in the free  flowing and secure flowing of aviation. Giving the Congress a roadmap,  I believe, is a very important step.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4559, the ``Global Aviation  System Security Reform Act of 2017.''   This legislation would require TSA to conduct a global aviation  security review in order to improve aviation standards across the  global aviation system within 180 days of enactment.   The security review within this bill is required to include input  from TSA's Office of Global Strategies, Office of Intelligence and  Analysis, and the Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement,  and must identify best practices for foreign partners.

Under this legislation, improvements that should be made to aviation  security will be highlighted for Congress.   This legislation has the potential of providing a roadmap for  Congress to address areas of improvement for global aviation security,  and ensure that we constantly strive towards the safest and most secure  aviation community.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4559 will give this body a strong sense of the  direction for global aviation security improvements.   As threats to aviation security grow more sophisticated, this bill  seeks to ensure that TSA is keeping pace with the threat landscape.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me again emphasize the importance of identifying  best practices to be utilized by our system and to utilize these best  practices to improve the security for the traveling public.   H.R. 4559 will give this body a strong sense of direction for global  aviation security improvements. As threats to aviation security grow  more sophisticated, this bill seeks to ensure that the TSA is keeping  pace with the threat landscape.                                time  1330    Since I have no further speakers, I am closing by saying, with that,  I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4559.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I thank the manager for his kind words.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerability  Disclosure Reporting Act. I very much want  [[Page H44]]  to thank the committee for bringing the Jackson Lee bill to the floor  and the work that we did on it in committee.   I wish to speak specifically to the work that is done on the Homeland  Security Committee as I discuss this legislation. I think it is very  important to take note of the fact that the ranking member works very  hard to generate very positive legislation and that we have been able  to see a large number of bills, some that I have been able to sponsor,  come to the floor of the House.   Mr. Speaker, therefore, I thank the chairman, Mr. McCaul, and the  ranking member for making the Homeland Security Committee so productive  in generating important legislation to ensure the security of this  Nation. I thank them for their leadership in putting the security of  our Nation's cyber assets first, whether they are computing resources  used in voting technology, or industrial control systems that support  the delivery of electricity, oil and gas, or management of  transportation systems that are vital to our Nation's economic health.   Mr. Speaker, I was chairman of the Transportation Security and  Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee some few sessions ago. This was  when infrastructure was included in the transportation and security  domain. I can tell you that, even then, we began to acknowledge the  crucialness of protecting the cyber system and how far-reaching cyber  systems can go, as far away as water systems, to bridges, to dams, and  in between, and to note that a lot of our cyber system, 80 percent of  it was in the private sector, probably more at this point.   H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act, which I  introduced, requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a  report on the policies and procedures developed for coordinating cyber  vulnerability disclosures.   The report will include an annex with information on instances in  which cybersecurity vulnerability disclosure policies and procedures  were used to disclose details on identified weaknesses in computing  systems or digital devices at risk.   The report will provide information on the degree to which the  information provided by DHS was used by industry and other  stakeholders.   The report may also contain a description of how the Secretary of  Homeland Security is working with other Federal entities and critical  infrastructure owners and operators to prevent, detect, and mitigate  cyber vulnerabilities.   It is important to restate that our cyber system is largely in the  private sector. It does not alleviate or eliminate the role that the  Federal Government should play. This legislation squarely places with  the Federal Government the responsibilities of dealing with  those critical infrastructure owners and operators to prevent, detect,  and mitigate cyber vulnerabilities.    The reason that I have worked to bring this bill before the full  House for consideration is a problem often referred to as a zero-day  event. A zero-day event describes a situation that network security  professionals may find themselves in when a previously unknown error or  flaw in computing code is exploited by a cybercriminal or terrorist.   The term ``zero-day event'' simply means that there is zero time to  prepare a defense against a cyber attack. That is not the place that we  would like to find ourselves.   When a defect in software is discovered, their network engineers and  software companies can work to develop a patch to fix the problem  before it can be exploited by those who may seek to do us harm.   We have evidence that the cyber world is a good world, but it can be  a dangerous world and impact the life and quality and democracy and  freedom of Americans. We want to be prepared and never have to face, in  this most powerful country in the world, something called a zero-day  event.   H.R. 3202 seeks a report on the ongoing Department of Homeland  Security's policies and procedures for coordinating cyber vulnerability  disclosures, such as zero-day events, with private sector partners.  Because vulnerabilities can be used by adversaries, it is important  that this sensitive information be managed securely so details are not  routinely made available, neither to the public nor to Congress.   H.R. 3202 provides the Congress with the opportunity to understand  the process and procedures used by the Department of Homeland Security  and the benefit these disclosures may have for private sector entities  participating in programs in support of cybersecurity.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Lillie Coney of my district and Jean de Pruneda,  a fellow on the Committee on Homeland Security, for their work on this  important legislation.   I urge Members of the House to vote in favor of H.R. 3202, the Cyber  Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act.   Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize again a point that I made earlier.  Because vulnerabilities can be used by adversaries, it is important  that this sensitive information be managed securely so details are not  routinely made available, neither to the public nor to Congress.   It is important to take note of the fact that the work we have to do  is ongoing and continuing.   H.R. 3202 will give this body important information on our  governmentwide efforts to secure civilian agency networks and the  collaborative ongoing work to provide information to private sector  partners on computing vulnerabilities. There is no security in keeping  zero-day events secure from disclosure and not working on solutions.   Cybersecurity is found in finding the zero-day events, creating  solutions to defend against them, and sharing the solutions broadly so  that they can be deployed. Once solutions are in place, the zero-day  event should be disclosed to the public so that scholars and  researchers can learn from the experience.   In essence, what we are saying is that we want to make sure that we  are in the driver's seat, that we know the vulnerabilities, that we can  confront the zero-day events, and that we can do that, meaning the  Federal Government, in working with the private sector to ensure that  we do protect this Nation.   Before I close, since we are dealing with Homeland Security Committee  issues, I think it is important to take note of the fact of the  crucialness and the importance of having a DACA fix and working  together, as we have been doing, to ensure that the thousands and  thousands of young people located across the Nation, who came here  through no fault of their own, have a serious pathway of protection, in  particular, the 140,000 that are in the State of Texas.   If we can stand here as bipartisan Members, I know that we can  continue to work on that crucial and important issue, which I stand  with those young people to ensure to get that done.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article by Morgan Chalfant,  ``Lawmakers approve `cyber vulnerability' bill,'' written in The Hill.                       [From the Hill, July 26, 2017]                Lawmakers Approve `Cyber Vulnerability' Bill                            (By Morgan Chalfant)         A House panel advanced legislation on Wednesday requiring       the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to give lawmakers       more information on how it discloses cyber vulnerabilities to       the private sector.        The legislation was sponsored by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee       (D-Texas) and received broad support from members of the       House Homeland Security Committee, including Chairman Michael       McCaul (R-Texas).        The bill would require Homeland Security Secretary John       Kelly to send a report to relevant congressional committees       describing policies and procedures used by the DHS to       coordinate the disclosure of what are called ``zero days''--      cyber vulnerabilities that are unknown to a product's       manufacturer and for which no patch exists.        The federal government decides whether to disclose zero       days to the private sector through the vulnerabilities       equities process (VEP), which was first acknowledged by the       Obama administration in 2014 but is still shrouded in       secrecy. While the government is said to err on the side of       disclosure, the VEP has proven controversial because so       little is known about it.        The process has attracted increased scrutiny in the wake of       the outbreak of the ``Wanna Cry'' ransomware, which is       believed to be based on a hacking tool developed by the       National Security Agency.        Lawmakers in both chambers have sought to boost       transparency of the VEP.        On Wednesday, Jackson Lee touted the legislation as       providing an opportunity for Congress to better understand       the process by which the DHS shares threat information  [[Page H45]]       with private companies and how that information benefits the       private sector.        ``Because vulnerabilities can be used by adversaries, it is       important that the sensitive information is managed securely       and the details are guarded against premature disclosure,''       Jackson Lee said during a committee markup.        ``There's no security in keeping zero day events secure and       not working on solutions,'' she said. ``The protection is in       finding the zero day events, creating solutions, sharing the       solutions broadly, then disclosing the vulnerabilities to the       public.''        The report mandated by the legislation would include an       annex of information on specific instances when the DHS       disclosed vulnerabilities to private sector companies in the       previous year and information on how industry acted on the       information. It could also contain information about how the       DHS is working with other federal agencies and departments,       as well as owners of critical infrastructure, to mitigate the       threat of these vulnerabilities.        Kelly would be required to submit the report, which would       be unclassified but could have a classified annex, within 240       days of the enactment of the legislation.        The committee approved the legislation in a voice vote with       no amendments, sending it to the full House for a vote.     Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support  H.R. 3202, and I thank my manager as well.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 3202, the Cyber  Vulnerabilities Disclosure Reporting Act.   I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for their  leadership on putting the security of our nation's cyber assets first  whether they are computing resources used in voting technology or  industrial control systems that support the delivery of electricity,  oil and gas, or management of transportation systems all are vital to  our nation.   H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act, which I  introduced, requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a  report on the policies and procedures developed for coordinating cyber  vulnerability disclosures.   The report will include an annex with information on instances in  which cyber security vulnerability disclosure policies and procedures  were used to disclose details on identified weaknesses in computing  systems that or digital devices at risk.   The report will provide information on the degree to which the  information provided by DHS was used by industry and other  stakeholders.   The report may also contain a description of how the Secretary of  Homeland Security is working with other Federal entities and critical  infrastructure owners and operators to prevent, detect, and mitigate  cyber vulnerabilities.   The reason that I worked to bring this bill before the Full House for  consideration is the problem often referred to as a ``Zero Day Event.''   Zero Day Events are vulnerabilities in software or firmware that have  gone undetected or undisclosed, but if exploited by terrorists could  cause great harm to computer networks, data, or complex computing  dependent systems.   Our nation's electric power grid; industrial control systems that  operate bridges, dams, water treatment facilities or food processing  plants are all vulnerable to the potential harm that could be caused if  a weakness in software or firmware goes undetected.   Critical infrastructure must be secured against terrorist attacks  that may use Zero Day Event vulnerabilities to attack critical  infrastructure or civilian government agency computing assets.   Zero Day Events discovered in commercial software applications such  as the ``Heartbleed'' and OpenSSL cryptographic software library  vulnerability.   Proactive and coordinated efforts are necessary to strengthen and  maintain secure critical infrastructure including assets that are vital  to public confidence in the cyber nation's safety.   This bill supports the ongoing work of the Department of Homeland  Security in security civilian agency and coordinating with private  sector computing network owners and operators.   The nation's critical infrastructure is diverse, complex, and  interdependent.   The overwhelming majority of critical infrastructure is privately  owned or managed.   Critical Infrastructure owners and operators are uniquely positioned  to manage risk to their operations and assets.   What is needed is a better understanding of how vulnerability  discoveries lead to better protection for computing networks.   Zero Day Events require a coordinated approach to assignment of  responsibility for developing patches or solutions, and a means of  effectively distributing the solution without alerting potential  terrorist or cyber criminals.   H.R. 3202 provides the Congress with the opportunity to understand  the process and procedures used by the Department of Homeland Security  and the benefit these disclosures may have for private sector entities  participating in programs in support of cybersecurity.   I thank Lillie Coney of my staff and Jean de Pruneda a Fellow on the  Committee on Homeland Security for their work on this important  legislation.   I ask my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3202.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of 3202, The ``Cyber Disclosure  Reporting Act.''   I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for their  leadership on putting the security of our nation's cyber assets first  whether they are computing resources used in voting technology or  industrial control systems that support the delivery of electricity,  oil and gas, or management of transportation systems that are vital to  our nation economic health.

With that, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3202.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4555, the DHS Interagency  Counterterrorism Task Force Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4555 authorizes DHS personnel to participate in  overseas interagency counterterrorism task forces. Since the attacks of  September 11 and the demise of central al-Qaida, there has been an  upsurge in the number of foreign terrorist organizations. The terrorist  threat picture demands that DHS work to ``push our borders out'' and  deal with terrorist threats overseas. As such, it is important that DHS  deploy DHS personnel overseas to engage in counterterrorism information  sharing with international partners.   Our close partnerships with countries around the world, especially in  Europe, are essential to preventing returning foreign fighters from  attacking the U.S. homeland. However, we remain concerned that  terrorist organizations, in particular, ISIS, al-Qaida, and their  affiliates, continue to plot attacks against the U.S. homeland and our  interests abroad.   Authorizing the participation of DHS personnel in overseas  interagency counterterrorism task forces will facilitate better  counterterrorism information sharing, which will help protect the  homeland and U.S. interests abroad. As such, I support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, H.R. 4555 authorizes the participation of  DHS personnel in overseas interagency counterterrorism task forces.  This measure seeks to help safeguard our homeland by fostering DHS  overseas partnerships and facilitating counterterrorism information  sharing.   I want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford) for  sponsoring this legislation and for working with me on my amendment,  which added reporting language on the activities authorized by this  measure.   This is an important step forward and, again, I might emphasize, the  work that is being done between the ranking member, Mr. Thompson, and  the full committee chair, Mr. McCaul, in bringing our committee  together in producing a myriad of constructive legislation all geared  to our task, because, when all is said and done, we are the Homeland  Security Committee within the Homeland Security Department, created in  the aftermath of the most heinous, horrific tragedy in the history of  the United States of recent recollection that was not an incident of  war.   Therefore, I think the American people, and I know the American  people are owed our diligence and are owed our commitment and are owed  our studiousness. I am very pleased to say that, on this committee, the  production of legislation that comes to the floor, all is geared to  securing the homeland.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 4555.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4555, the ``DHS Interagency  Counterterrorism Task Force Act of 2017.''   H.R. 4555 authorizes DHS personnel to participate in overseas  interagency counterterrorism task forces.   Since the attacks of September 11th and the demise of central al  Qaeda, there has been an upsurge in the number of foreign terrorist  organizations.   The terrorist threat picture demands that DHS work to ``push our  borders out'' and deal with terrorist threats overseas.   As such, it is important that DHS deploy DHS personnel overseas to  engage in counter-terrorism information sharing with international  partners.   Our close partnerships with countries around the world, especially in  Europe, are essential to preventing returning foreign fighters from  attacking the U.S. homeland.  [[Page H47]]    However, we remain concerned that terrorist organizations, in  particular ISIS, al Qaeda, and their affiliates, continue to plot  attacks against the U.S. homeland and our interests abroad.   Authorizing the participation of DHS personnel in overseas  interagency counterterrorism task forces will facilitate better  counterterrorism information sharing, which will help protect the  homeland and U.S. interests abroad.   I thank the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Rutherford, for sponsoring  this legislation and for working with me on my amendment which added  reporting language on the activities authorized by this measure.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 4555.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr RUTHERFORD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for  her very commonsense amendment to this bill, which made it stronger and  better, and I do appreciate the bipartisan work on that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let me thank both gentlemen from  California for their leadership and for their very important work on a  very important crisis fight for human rights and freedom.   Just yesterday I rose to the floor of the House to recount my  experience over the weekend joining the Iranian-American community in  Houston on a busy corner at Post Oak and Westheimer. We joined together  as Americans to begin to articulate that there is no divide when it  comes to the freedom of speech, freedom for all to have access to  protests and democracy.   So today I rise to support H. Res. 676, and I rise to speak in horror  of the 1,000 Iranians that have been arrested and almost two dozen  killed. We mourn their loss. We recognize that it has to be all of us,  our allies included, that must stand and join in the language of this  resolution, and it is, of course, to ensure that sanctions are  pointedly targeted at those who want to oppress the protesters.   Interestingly enough, the protesters are now from rural and the  middle class. The questions of the economy are very much a part of it,  that Iranians are not able to live and to be able to have economic  opportunity. Their young people have no growth. So this is far  reaching, which is, of course, surprising to the regime.   They were hoping to quash this. They have no answers. And the answers  should be a concerted, committed, and dedicated group of allies,  including the United States, leading in efforts to support these  protesters.   So I rise today to join in standing with the people of Iran in their  legitimate and peaceful protest. I ask that the regime be condemned,  and I ask that the communications, Mr. Speaker, be allowed to continue  and that our companies don't reject----    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California  for yielding.   I believe it is so important that the communication--the work that we  are getting ready to do here in the United States, to provide  communications technology, needs to go forward. We must include in our  petition--meaning our petition as Members of Congress--that our  companies do not deny or quash the rights of Iranians to communicate  with each other for peace, freedom, and democracy.   Our message to the regime is: it is time to open the doors of freedom  in Iran. Iranian Americans, Americans, the United States Congress, and,  of course, all of our government stand for peace, freedom, dignity, and  democracy for the people of Iran.    Mr. Speaker, I have often come to this floor to  remind my colleagues of the devastation that the people of Texas have  experienced with Hurricane Harvey. I certainly don't intend to ignore  our other friends in the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Florida, and  California who have experienced their own devastation, along with  Louisiana.   But I am excited today, Mr. Speaker, because I am introducing a bill  that celebrates the history of Texas. H.R. 4745 is the emancipation  national historic trail. Many people know that the Emancipation  Proclamation was not heard in Texas but for 2 years later in 1865.   This emancipation national historic trail recounts the journey of  many of those individuals: freed slaves going from the Osterman  Building and Reedy Chapel in Galveston, Texas; along Texas State  Highway 3, Interstate Highway 45 North, Freedmen's Town, and  Emancipation Park in Houston, Texas; following the migration route of  newly freed slaves and other persons of African descent; from the major  19th century seaport of Galveston.   It is a collaboration with people from both parties throughout the  community. It is one of unity, Mr. Speaker. It is one where we are  coming together.   I look forward to passing this legislation with my colleagues-- Republicans and Democrats--because it is a celebration of the history  of Texas.                            ____________________
