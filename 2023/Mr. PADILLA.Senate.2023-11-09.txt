 Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  Guaranteeing Overtime for Truckers Act, which I introduced today.   America's truckdrivers are on the frontlines of keeping goods and our  economy moving. More than 70 percent of goods across the United States  are shipped by truck.   Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting supply chain  crisis exacerbated longstanding challenges for truckers, including long  hours away from home and time spent waiting--often unpaid--to load and  unload at congested ports, warehouses, and distribution centers.   As our Nation makes historic investments in our port and supply chain  infrastructure through the bipartisan infrastructure law, we should  also improve wages and working conditions for essential workers and  ensure they are paid for all of the hours they work.   However, for more than 80 years, Federal law has denied truckers  guaranteed overtime pay benefits that are afforded to nearly all other  professions. This means that if a truckdriver experiences delays due to  congestion or weather, they are often not paid even though they are  working. Requiring overtime will create an incentive for the shippers,  receivers, and carriers to get cargo loaded and unloaded--keeping  truckers and our supply chain moving.   The motor carrier exemption exacerbates trucking workforce  challenges. In fact, a February 2022 freight and logistics supply chain  assessment by the Department of Transportation urged Congress to repeal  this exemption. Additionally, research suggests that when truck labor  rates are fair, there is less driver fatigue, fewer regulatory  violations, and lower crash rates.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bill to repeal the overtime  exemption for motor carriers.   I want to thank Senator Markey for coleading this bill with me, and I  hope our colleagues will join us in support of this bill that will  ensure that trucker compensation reflects the fact that these jobs are  essential.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  Guaranteeing Overtime for Truckers Act, which I introduced today.
