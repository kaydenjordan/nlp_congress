 Mr. Speaker, as Mr. Calvert can attest, Jerry Lewis was  a larger-than-life figure.   Over the course of his four decades of public service, Jerry was able  to rise through the ranks here at the House to become the chair of the  House Appropriations Committee. I notice a lot of appropriators here  with us today, sharing their memories and paying their respects, as  well.   Mr. Lewis earned the respect of Members from both sides of the aisle  and worked tirelessly to promote our national defense, care for our  veterans, and ensure folks back home in my community and his community  of San Bernardino County received our fair share of resources.   Jerry was quick to remind people that he was a kid from San  Bernardino. Maybe that is why he liked me a little more than he should  have, because I was a kid from San Bernardino as well. But that kid  went on to serve his community by advocating for it in Sacramento and  eventually here in these halls.   Too often, our region in California is an afterthought. Smaller than  our neighbors to the west in Los Angeles and Orange County, the Inland  Empire, my home, was always Jerry's home, and we have always had to  fight for our fair share of resources.   But Jerry dedicated his career to delivering resources for our  community, and his impact can still be felt on the ground today and  through the years ahead.   He served as my family's representative in Congress for many years.  Later, I had the opportunity to represent him, first as his mayor and  then as his representative in Congress.   He often called me ``my mayor.'' He would say: ``How is my mayor  doing today?'' when he would see me around town, usually when he would  see me at his favorite spot downtown where he was grabbing lunch with  his bride.   I have never shared this story with Mr. Calvert. Jerry and Arlene  were the first individuals to call me after I was appointed to a city  council vacancy a bunch of years ago. The council appointment happened  in the evening, and they called early in the morning Pacific time. They  didn't quite wake me up, but it was a morning hour on the West Coast.  They congratulated me on the appointment, and Jerry talked about the  importance of local government making an impact in our daily lives. He  reminded me that serving was a huge honor but also an immense  obligation and responsibility.   While our politics, at times, were different, and he was quick to  remind me of that, I will always be grateful for the advice, for the  friendship, for the time he and Arlene spent with me over the years,  meeting in his Rayburn office, back in town, or at community events. He  was always measured; he was always professional; and he always put his  community first.   It is a testament to his legacy that his colleagues from both sides  of the aisle are here today to remember him.   My thoughts continue to be with Arlene and the family. I appreciate  his contributions and his friendship.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for this Special  Order.                                time  1400
