 Mr. President, President Trump has nominated Joseph  Balash to be Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals at the  Department of the Interior. In that role, Balash will oversee the  Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Bureau of  Safety and Environmental Enforcement and the Office of Surface Mining  Reclamation and Enforcement, and head ``Interior's management of all  federal lands and waters, and their associated mineral and non-mineral  resources, as well as the appropriate regulation of surface coal  mining.''   Balash has worked for years in Alaska politics, including as the  former commissioner of the Alaska Department of Natural Resources.   In 2013, as the acting commissioner of the Alaska Department of  Natural Resources, Joe Balash advocated for exploration in the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge. Balash petitioned the U.S.  [[Page S7908]]  Fish and Wildlife Service ``to reconsider its decision to bar [Alaska]  from conducting seismic studies in the Arctic National Wildlife  Refuge.''   Also, Balash has stated that he supports the Trump administration  rewriting the 5-year plan for the offshore oil and gas leasing plan,  which could likely lead to new areas being opened up to offshore  drilling.   I am a strong supporter of protecting the Arctic National Wildlife  Refuge and oppose opening up new areas of the Atlantic to offshore  drilling. For these reasons, I oppose his nomination for Assistant  Secretary for Land and Minerals at the Department of the Interior.
