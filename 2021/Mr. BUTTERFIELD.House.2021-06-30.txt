 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 60th  anniversary of the North Carolina Sweet Potato Commission.   The role of this commission is to support growers and increase sweet  potato consumption. Their efforts have been tremendously effective as  the popularity of sweet potatoes has increased at home and especially  abroad.   North Carolina leads the Nation in sweet potato production and has  done so for the last 50 years. There are over 450 sweet potato farmers  in North Carolina, and those farmers produce about 65 percent of all  sweet potatoes grown throughout the country.   I am proud to recognize and congratulate the North Carolina Sweet  Potato Commission on its 60th anniversary. I wish them another 60 years  of continued success.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to  me.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3684, the INVEST in  America Act.   This legislation invests in communities like mine all across the  country that are in desperate need of infrastructure improvements.   Madam Speaker, this past weekend, I took the train back to  Washington, D.C., from my hometown of Wilson, North Carolina. As I  waited to board the train, I noticed significant deterioration to  facilities of the station, including the platform and the canopy. Like  many train stations across America, the Wilson Station is in dire need  of repair and renovation. The INVEST in America Act, among other  things, provides funding to address these issues.   I thank Chairman DeFazio for including over $57 billion in grant  funding to help repair and modernize our aging train facilities. I also  thank the chairman for the inclusion of five transformative  infrastructure projects across my district.   Madam Speaker, this momentous bill delivers on a promise that we made  to the American people. Let's build back better.
