 Mr. President, today, I would like to honor the  life of Jonathon Drake of New Durham, NH, who tragically lost his life  in a car accident in May. A social worker at the University of New  Hampshire's Institute on Disability, Jonathon worked to help at-risk  youth succeed and was beloved by his family, his colleagues, and his  community. A childhood cancer survivor, he dedicated his life to  helping young people and was recognized for his exceptional work with  the first annual Rockstar Award from YOUTH M.O.V.E. New Hampshire.  Jonathon dreamt of being a school principal one day, and was working  toward completing his certification at the time of his death.   In addition to his work, Jonathon was dedicated to his wife, their  two young sons, and to the many people he embraced as family. At a  celebration of Jonathon's life, hundreds of community members gathered  to share memories of their friend who had been taken from them far too  soon.   One of my favorite things about New Hampshire is our all-hands-on- deck spirit, where people roll up their sleeves and work together to  strengthen our communities. Both in his work to improve the lives of  at-risk youth and his love for those around him, Jonathon Drake  perfectly exemplified this New Hampshire spirit, and we can honor his  memory by carrying on his work and rededicating ourselves to the work  of improving our communities and being a friend. May he rest in  peace.                            ____________________
