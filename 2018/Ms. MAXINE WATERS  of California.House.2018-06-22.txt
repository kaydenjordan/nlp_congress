 Mr. Chairman, first I would like to say that I  appreciate the bipartisan work of the bill's sponsor, Chairman  GREG WALDEN, and, of course, Chairman KEVIN BRADY and our  cosponsor FRANK PALLONE and cosponsor RICHARD NEAL on this bill,  H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     The bill, as drafted, includes many positive provisions and extends  well-intended legislative efforts to address the opioid crisis in this  country. That said, as we all know, in the United States, people suffer  from a wide range of substance use disorders, including alcoholism and  the abuse of illegal drugs like heroin, methamphetamine, crack, and  other forms of cocaine. Likewise, there are a range of entities that  provide different types of substance abuse treatment services.  [[Page H5567]]    The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that we have a clear  understanding of the substance abuse treatment services available, the  communities and the populations that are being served, the types of  substance use disorders being addressed, and any other unmet needs or  inadequacies in the way we are addressing substance abuse issues.   My amendment would direct that the Department of Health and Human  Services conduct a nationwide survey of entities that provide substance  use disorder treatment services. Based on the results of that survey,  my amendment directs HHS to develop and submit to Congress a plan to  direct appropriate resources in order to address inadequacies in  services or funding identified through the survey.   The survey called for by my amendment is intended to complement  existing efforts by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration, SAMHSA, to examine substance use treatment services in  order to develop a concrete plan to address unmet needs.   Mr. Chairman, let me just say that I appreciate the information that  was shared by the majority whip, Mr. Scalise, when he talked about the  baby who was born addicted, and we are going to have a lot of that.   I have one regret, having worked on the issue of crack cocaine, that  we did not do something to do the research that was necessary on these  babies that are born addicted, to find out what happens to them later  on in life and whether or not these children are handicapped and  disabled in some ways, have learning disabilities, and on and on and  on. So I would like to work with Mr. Scalise to do the follow-up for  the research that is so necessary.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
