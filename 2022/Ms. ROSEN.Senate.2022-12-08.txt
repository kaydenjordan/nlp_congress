 Mr. President, on November 30, 2022, I missed rollcall  vote No. 363 while attending a meeting and event at the Department of  the Interior announcing the future designation of a new National  Monument in Nevada. Had I been present, I would have voted yes on vote  No. 363, cloture on the nomination of Camille L. Velez-Rive to be U.S.  District Judge for the District of Puerto Rico.                            ____________________
