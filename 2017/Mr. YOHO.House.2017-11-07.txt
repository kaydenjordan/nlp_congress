 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Biggs for putting this very  important hearing together. I am going to cut mine a little bit  shorter.   After the previous election, a lot of people were angry. They came to  our office demanding special investigations into the Trump campaign and  the Russia probe. I forewarned them then, and I will make this  prediction now: that if it goes there and it leads to the previous  administration or Hillary Clinton, are you willing to go down that  rabbit hole?   Here we are today. I think we need to follow this because it has led  to that.   Without going too much into all the stuff that has already been said,  we can talk about how the Obama administration approved the sale of the  Canadian mining company with significant U.S. uranium reserves to a  firm owned by a Russian Government. The NRC, the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission, assured Congress and the public the new owners could not  export any raw nuclear material from the American shores. No uranium  produced at either facility may be exported, the NRC declared November  2010 in a press release. We found out that is not true.   As has been brought up, over 20 percent of our uranium is going into  the hands of Russia. Beyond the mines in Kazakhstan, which are among  the most lucrative in the world, the sale gave Russia control of one- fifth of all uranium production capacity in the U.S.   Since uranium is considered a strategic asset with implications for  national security, the deal had to be approved by a committee composed  of representatives from a number of United States Government agencies.  Among those agencies that eventually signed off was the State  Department, then headed by Mrs. Clinton. Frank Giustra, a mining  financier, has donated $31.3 million to the foundation run by former  President Bill Clinton.   As the Russians gradually assumed control of the Uranium One in three  separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show how a  flow of cash made its way into the Clinton Foundation. We could go on  and on about this.   Shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire the  majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 from a  Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin  that was promoting Uranium One stock. Very interesting. I remember when  President Clinton was asked about his high speaking fees. He kind of  brushed it off with a laugh and said: Well, there are people who like  to hear me speak.   Fordham University professor Zephyr Teachout, a highly regarded law  professor who has written extensively about political corruption--and  she is a Democrat--said:         As a Democrat, I am concerned about Hillary Clinton as a       general election candidate. These questions aren't going       away. There is a pattern of foreign donations and speaking       fees that the Clinton Foundation and her husband have found       their ways to the Clinton Foundation.        Bill Clinton made 13 speeches between 2001 and 2012 in       which he was paid $500,000 or more. The interesting part is       11 of those speeches were made after Hillary Clinton became       Secretary of State--pay to play.        Why did the Clinton Foundation change its name to the Bill,       Hillary, and Chelsea Clinton Foundation?        It is surmised that it was because the public and large       corporation donors backed away from the questionable, if not       unethical, and possibly illegal activities.    I just want to speak as an American. We come up here from different  backgrounds. I see people who are here tonight who spoke tonight all  from different backgrounds. The thing we hear about over and over again  is that we want transparency and accountability. We demand that, but we  never see it. So as these investigations go forward, my hope is that  there is a conclusion to an investigation and that the people who broke  the law are held accountable so that we don't have to talk about  another investigation that spends the American taxpayers' money without  somebody paying the price for misrepresenting the American people and  turning over strategic products of this country--uranium in this case-- to a foreign entity that doesn't want the best for America.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Arizona for putting this  on and leading this.
