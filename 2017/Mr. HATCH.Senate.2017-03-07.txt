Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage Senator  Klobuchar in a colloquy to commemorate Rare Disease Day in order to  discuss issues facing patients and the families of those who have been  diagnosed with these types of conditions.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, as cochairs of the Rare Disease Caucus,  Senator Klobuchar and I have worked hard to bring more hope to patients  and their families who are coping with rare diseases on a daily basis.   Today 1 in 20 individuals worldwide is living with one or more of the  more than 7,000 rare diseases, 95 percent of which do not have an  effective treatment. While the incentives provided by the Orphan Drug  Act, first championed by me in 1983, has led to the approval of nearly  600 orphan drugs, much more needs to be done.   Many patients living with rare diseases rely on the FDA to evaluate  and approve treatment options for their conditions. That is why it is  so important for the FDA to use its authority to accelerate the  evaluation and approval of drugs for treating rare diseases and for  Congress to ensure that proper incentives exist for research to  discover and make affordable treatments and cures available for this  community.   To address this issue, Congress passed the FDA Safety and Innovation  Act of 2012, which refined and strengthened the tools available to FDA  to accelerate the evaluation and approval of new drugs targeting unmet  medical needs for rare conditions. I have been paying close attention  to how this new authority translates into advances for patients  suffering from conditions such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, atypical  hemolytic uremic syndrome, Bertrand-N-glycanase deficiency, and other  rare diseases.   In light of these changes over the past few years, I ask my friend  from Minnesota whether the current approval process is achieving its  goals of safety and efficacy without hampering the development of new  therapies.    I appreciate that question.   We must continue to urge the FDA to fully implement its relatively  new authority. Every one of us in this body represents constituents who  are battling rare diseases, and I urge the FDA to consider this  flexibility as applied in reviewing all candidates' therapies.   I will continue to work closely with my Senate colleagues to ensure  that the FDA uses the tools, authorities, and resources required to  provide patients and physicians with new treatment options. I have also  contacted the FDA frequently during the past year to encourage the  agency to listen to the voices of patients during the agency's  evaluation process.   When the Senate considers the nominee for FDA Commissioner, I will  continue to stress the importance of incorporating a balanced and  flexible approach when weighing risks, benefits, and outcomes,  especially when dealing with small patient populations with such  rapidly progressing prognoses.   Patients with limited or no treatment options are depending on FDA to  utilize the flexibility outlined in FDASIA. This law, which provides  full and fair review of new drug therapies in a timely manner, gives  hope to patients suffering from life threatening diseases and, of  course, their families as well.   I ask Senator Klobuchar, how can we move forward into the next user  fee agreement?    I thank my dear friend, the senior Senator from Minnesota,  for her time with me today. It is very meaningful to me and, I think,  to everybody who is concerned about this rare disease situation in our  country.   This is just the start of our conversation for this Congress. There  is so much left for us to do, and I am certain we will succeed as long  as we stay together and work in a bipartisan way. So I thank my dear  colleague for her words and support and the good leadership she  provides in the Senate.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
