 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  my hometown Taylorville Junior High School's seventh grade girls'  basketball team on their 2021 State championship win.   After a back and forth game, the score was tied at 16-16 with 4  seconds to go. The Tornadoes came out triumphant after Grace Rogers hit  a clutch shot.   The seventh grade girls' basketball team ends their season with an  overall record of 26-2. This team's hard work, dedication, and  sportsmanship shine throughout our entire Taylorville community.   I give a big tip of the hat and personally congratulate my good  friend and head coach, Doug Bowsher. I congratulate all the girls on  this wonderful, championship team for their hard work and dedication,  and I am excited to see what the future holds for this championship  Taylorville Tornado team.                          Congratulating David Brown     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate my good friend David Brown for his retirement after more  than 30 years at WAND in Decatur, Illinois.   David's ancestors moved from New Hampshire to Illinois in 1867 in a  search for new farming opportunities. David is a centennial farmer, and  his son is the sixth generation from his family to farm in central  Illinois. After graduating from Millikin University, David also worked  at WSOY radio.   David first joined the WAND news team as an ag reporter when the Farm  Progress Show came to central Illinois in 1991. At WAND, many of his  colleagues described him as a mentor, a friend, and one of the hardest  workers they have come to know.   Throughout David's tenure at the station, he was loved by all and  received an award for Media Excellence in Agriculture. According to  David, he had the best of both worlds, working at his passion, and then  getting to share the importance of agriculture with the viewers as a  farmer and as an ag broadcaster.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate David on his retirement. It is well  deserved. Now David has a little more time to spend with his four  children and six grandchildren.                      Recognizing Ray and Barbie Swinda     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Decatur residents Ray and Barbie Swinda and their Facebook page,  Support Decatur IL Business.   Ray his wife, Barbie, have been using their Facebook page to show off  local Decatur businesses and restaurants they have been enjoying, and  encouraging others in the community to follow their lead in buying and  eating local.   Ray and his wife started their page in response to larger chains  harming the diversity of options for food and services in the Decatur  area that Ray remembers existing as a kid. Many of the businesses that  have been featured on their page have been shocked by the increase in  traffic. Ray and Barbie have received responses from others in the  community, including Mayor Julie Moore Wolfe herself, and have become  local leaders simply through their work in promoting local businesses  and restaurants.   I urge everybody, if you are traveling through Decatur, Illinois, and  you want a good recommendation, go visit Ray and Barbie's Facebook  page, and you will see some great plates of delicious food.   I also personally congratulate Ray and Barbie on the success of their  Facebook page and thank them for being pillars of the community and  encouraging so many others to invest in our local businesses.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and  colleague from California. It was 10 years ago when we all came in as  brand-new freshmen. One of the first questions I asked any of my  colleagues from the State of California when I got here was: Are you a  Raiders fan?   Today, we are all Raiders fans, but just so everybody knows, he is a  49ers fan. That is okay.   As my friend says, there is a lot of disagreement in this place. He  and I don't agree on a lot of issues that are coming in front of this  institution during this week or the upcoming weeks or, frankly, the  past few years. But we are here all together to celebrate the life of a  man who had an impact on all of us in this great Nation, especially on  a young Raiders fan who became that Raiders fan when I lived in the  State of Iowa.   Anyone who knew me as I was growing up knows that there is only one  football team that I root for, and that is the Oakland Raiders, then  the Los Angeles Raiders, then the Oakland Raiders, and now the Las  Vegas Raiders.   Most people in this country know John Madden as that broadcaster.  This is the guy who actually broadcast professional football games on  every single television network. What a feat that is. People knew him  for being afraid to fly and driving a bus, talking about food, and  writing with the little scribbler pen on the screen. What they don't  know about John Madden is that his life was football before he became  that broadcaster.   He helped make my life about football because, one day on January 9,  1977, my family, as I was 7 years old, sat down to watch the Super  Bowl. It was the first football game I had ever watched in my life.                                time  1500    Now, many people who know me are not going to be surprised by this.  Everybody else in my house was rooting for the Vikings, so I had to be  obstinate and say: I guess I am going to root for the Raiders.   What I saw in that game was something that I still have never  forgotten. I didn't know who John Madden was, but I learned about what  he meant to that team. All I knew was there was a great team led by a  great quarterback, Ken Stabler, whom John Madden allowed to call his  own plays.   Madam Speaker, can you imagine that in today's day and age, allowing  the quarterback to call their own plays?   Bill Belichick probably is having a seizure right now thinking about  that. There is no way they are going to let people call their own  plays. But John Madden believed in his players, and those players  believed in him. They went out there, and they did their job that day.   I was hooked, watching Jack Tatum knock Sammy White's helmet off in  an incomplete pass. I knew when I got to play football, I had to play  defensive back. That was the coolest thing I had ever seen in my life.  Ever since that day, there were Raider shirts, Raider pajamas, and  Raider helmets. I actually still have my first one that I used to use  in grade school, and it still has No. 30 on the back because my hero  growing up was Mark van Eeghen, the fullback for the Raiders.   My good friend and colleague Burgess Owens, who played on the next  Super Bowl team, not for Coach Madden, but for Coach Flores, actually  has promised me a chance to meet Mr. van Eeghen, so I am going to take  him up on that. But to hear Burgess talk about stories of being a  Raider, it is what John Madden, Al Davis, and the Al Davis family built  and the entire Raiders organization built that made players want to  come to Oakland and be a part of that winning atmosphere.   John Madden helped create that winning atmosphere. Players like Ken  Stabler, Mark van Eeghen, Burgess Owens, Jack Tatum, George Atkinson,  Otis Sistrunk, Dave Casper, Fred Biletnikoff, Cliff Branch, you name  it, Madam Speaker, they were there, and they created that atmosphere.   But they needed a leader, and that leader in the 1976 season leading  up to January 1977 was none other than John Madden, a great coach, a  Hall of Famer. And from what I hear--because I never had the great  chance to meet him--he was just a great person.   As time has worn on, I have gotten to know people in the Raiders  organization, and they epitomize the same values John Madden did. When  you look at what is happening right now with the leadership of Mark  Davis; the president of the team, Dan Ventrelle, my good friend; and so  many others, they are taking that same John Madden attitude. We saw  what happened on Sunday when they willed themselves through great  players and great leadership into the playoffs.   I know John Madden's family lit the flame that day in honor of Al  Davis, and that flame was also lit that day in honor of John Madden. I  am so glad the Raiders had a victory. I wish them well.   Go Raiders. This week, beat the Bengals. And let's never forget the  impact of John Madden.    Will the gentleman yield?    Weren't the Raider fans Republicans,  too?
