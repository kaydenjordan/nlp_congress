 Mr. Speaker, yesterday the House passed H.R. 6395, the  William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act.   The passage of this year's NDAA in the House was a bipartisan  achievement done under extremely difficult circumstances, and I would  like to congratulate Chairman Adam Smith, and particularly Ranking  Member Mac Thornberry, as this will be his final NDAA before his  retirement at the end of this year.   I wanted to take a few moments to highlight some of the provisions in  this legislation which I am grateful were included.   These include provisions which will strengthen manufacturing in my  home  [[Page H3617]]  State, protect the employment rights of our Nation's servicemembers,  help to improve maternal and mental healthcare for servicemembers and  their families, and strengthen ties with one of our Nation's oldest  allies.   The Southern New England Regional Commission, H.R. 5124, which this  bill included, establishes a regional commission that will facilitate  the investment of Federal funds in southern New England, including my  home State of Rhode Island, to build upon our regional strengths, such  as defense manufacturing, shipbuilding, and renewable energy. This  initiative will generate critical economic growth in the region to  reduce poverty, unemployment, and out-migration in counties that were  hit hardest by the Great Recession and now by COVID-19.   Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge Congressmen   Joe Courtney,  Joe Kennedy,  Stephen Lynch,   John Larson, and Bill Keating, who are cosponsors of  this legislation, and I thank them for their support of this critical  initiative which will benefit all of our districts.   This year's NDAA also includes the Justice for Servicemembers Act,  H.R. 2750, which I authored, clarifying that the statutory rights of  servicemembers and their families under the Servicemembers Civil Relief  Act cannot be waived through forced arbitration unless it is agreed to  after a dispute arises.   American servicemembers, veterans, and their families have sacrificed  much in service of our country. They have fought to protect the  fundamental idea that we are a nation of laws and institutions that  guarantee the rights and prosperity of every American.   Since the Second World War, Congress has created many laws, including  the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, to provide essential protections  and guarantee every veteran and Active-Duty servicemember, including  the Reserves and National Guard, the right to be free from workplace  discrimination on the basis of their military service and their right  to their day in court to enforce these protections. But for too long,  forced arbitration has eroded these fundamental protections by  funneling servicemembers' claims into a private system set up by  corporations without the same procedural safeguards of our justice  system.   Buried deep within the fine print of everyday contracts, forced  arbitration clauses block the brave men and women in uniform, as well  as their family members, from having their day in court to hold  corporations accountable for breaking the law. This bipartisan  provision ends this shameful practice by clarifying that arbitration  clauses are only enforceable if agreed to by servicemembers or their  families after a dispute arises.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Congressman Jared Golden,  Congresswoman Susan Davis, and Congressman Guy Reschenthaler, for their  strong bipartisan support for this provision to protect our men and  women in uniform.                                time  0915    Also included in this year's NDAA is a provision which will require  the Department of Defense to provide a report to Congress on the  maternal healthcare, in particular mental healthcare, that is available  to our Nation's servicemembers, as well as the spouses of  servicemembers.   According to the CDC, 1 in 8 women nationwide experience symptoms of  postpartum depression, and in some States that percentage can be high  as 1 in 5.   Yet, according to the What to Expect Project, data related to  instances of postpartum depression and other mental health conditions  associated with pregnancy and childbirth is not widely available.   This report required by the amendment will require the Department of  Defense to outline the care that is currently available for  servicemembers and their spouses who may experience symptoms of  postpartum depression.   Finally, this year's NDAA will include a provision which will  encourage greater investment and trade between the United States and  Portugal.   Last year, I introduced the Advancing Mutual Interests and Growing  Our Success, or the AMIGOS Act, H.R. 565, which makes Portuguese  nationals eligible for E-1 and E-2 nonimmigrant visas if the Government  of Portugal provides similar nonimmigrant status for U.S. nationals,  legislation which passed the House without opposition in December of  last year.   Access to these investor visas will allow Portuguese investors to  support projects in the U.S., benefiting our economy as well as that of  Portugal.   As one of the first countries to recognize the United States after  the Revolutionary War, Portugal is one of our closest economic partners  and strongest allies.   Today, the United States maintains that longstanding relationship as  the fifth largest export market for Portugal, and its largest trading  partner outside the European Union.   The AMIGOS Act will strengthen this trade partnership and strengthen  ties with our longtime NATO ally, Portugal.   I would like to acknowledge Congressman Bill Keating and Congressman  Devin Nunes for their support of this provision, and the instrumental  role they played in securing its inclusion in this year's NDAA during  the House Armed Services Committee markup.   I would, once again, like to thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member  Thornberry for supporting these provisions, and for their work on this  year's National Defense Authorization.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, it has been more than two months since  the House passed the HEROES Act. In  [[Page H3622]]  that time, there have been more than 50,000 new coronavirus deaths,  bringing the total to more than 140,000 Americans and more than 2.5  million more cases. Yet the Senate has done nothing.   This important legislation provides much-needed relief to States and  cities experiencing lost revenue, to support our heroes on the front  lines.   It ensures our first responders and essential workers are entitled to  hazard pay and guarantees up to $200 billion for those who have risked  their lives working during the pandemic.   It expands testing, tracing, and treatment to all Americans.   It puts money back in the pockets of struggling Americans with a  second round of stimulus payments up to $6,000 per household.   It preserves health coverage by protecting the more than 5.4 million  Americans who have lost their employer-provided health insurance.   It extends the weekly $600 Federal unemployment benefit through  January, providing a vital safety net for a record number of Americans  who are unemployed. Right now, that expires in just 9 days.   It helps worried families afford a safe place to live, assisting  renters and homeowners with rent, mortgage, and utility payments and  other housing-related costs.   I urge the Senate to pass this bill immediately.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2214,  legislation that will repeal the President's shameful Muslim ban, and  strengthen our immigration system by ensuring immigration decisions are  not made on the basis of religious discrimination.   In the face of religious intolerance, Roger Williams established the  great State of Rhode Island on the principles of religious liberty and  separation of church and State. These are important principles that  were ultimately incorporated into our founding documents.   In fact, President Washington, addressing the Hebrew congregation at  Touro Synagogue, wrote in a famous letter in 1790, when they asked,  Will we have religious freedom in this new country? He wrote those  words: ``For happily the Government of the United States gives to  bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance.''  [[Page H3635]]    And what has been the result of this religious discrimination, this  Muslim ban? It has resulted in mothers and fathers being separated from  their American children. Foreign students are prevented from studying  at our Nation's great universities; and doctors from countries under  the ban aren't able to come here to provide care to patients in the  United States, despite healthcare shortages across the Nation during a  global health pandemic.                                time  1115    In addition to that, Madam Speaker, this legislation violates the  founding principles of this country of religious freedom. I am very  proud that this legislation is being brought to the floor so that we  can reaffirm that important principle not only in the founding  documents of our country but in the present immigration laws and their  application.   In addition to that, there has been a lot of discussion about how we  are paying for this. I am very proud that this legislation includes  provisions of the Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Through  Promoting Competition Act, which will save taxpayers over half a  billion dollars in the form of lower prescription drug prices. All  across the country, prescription costs are skyrocketing. People are  going bankrupt and even dying because they can't afford prescription  medication.   H.R. 2214 addresses product hopping, an anticompetitive tactic used  by Big Pharma to protect and extend their monopolies over certain  prescription drugs, leading to dramatically higher prices. This  legislation expressly prohibits hopping under the FTC Act, and the bill  is subject to the same equitable remedies, including restitution and  disgorgement of profits. So, all this talk about folding into the pay- for would actually produce lower prescription drug prices for  Americans, and somehow that is a bad idea? Give me a break.   This bill reasserts the prohibition against religious discrimination,  one of the most important founding principles of this country, and it  pays for it by delivering lower prescription drug prices for the  American people.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler, Congresswoman Chu, and  Congresswoman Jayapal for their great work, and I urge my colleagues to  pass this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for the  Senate amendment to H.R. 1957, the Great American Outdoors Act. This  legislation will establish permanent funding for the Land and Water  Conservation Fund and establish a National Parks and Public Land Legacy  Restoration Fund supporting deferred maintenance projects on federal  lands. The funding authorized by this legislation will assist many  states, including my home state of Rhode Island, in improving state  parks and beaches, and preserving open spaces and wildlife habitats.  Additionally, funding for deferred maintenance projects within the  National Park System will help ensure that resources remain available  to Rhode Island in the future for required improvements and  developments for sites like the Roger Williams National Memorial and  the Blackstone Valley National Historic Park.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        July 22, 2020, on page H3656, the following appeared:   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for the Senate amendment  to H.R. 1957, the Great American Outdoors Act.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      While I support this legislation, I am hopeful that the Natural  Resources Committee, as well  [[Page H3657]]  as the House Appropriations Committee, will work to improve funding  outcomes for coastal states under the Land and Water Conservation Fund.  Per-capita, coastal states receive approximately forty cents on the  dollar compared to funding received by inland states. Rhode Island's  coastal economy generates more than $2 billion annually, and supports  more than 41,000 jobs, while New England as a whole supports nearly a  quarter of a million jobs through its coastal economy. As a result of  geography, coastal states face a number of challenges which many inland  states do not face, including beach erosion, migrating fish stocks  which impact commercial fisheries, and vulnerability to tropical storms  and other weather-related disasters. All of these challenges are  further exacerbated by the effects of climate change.   Congress needs to be able to support critical programs like the Land  and Water Conservation Fund and also ensure that coastal communities  are able to receive necessary funds to preserve their coastlines,  protect wildlife, and support workers who rely on jobs supported by  ocean economies. I look forward to working with Chairman Grijalva to  discuss ways in which we may be able to achieve this going forward.    Madam Speaker, John Robert Lewis, an American hero, a  civil rights icon, a movement leader, a peacemaker, a teacher, a drum  major for justice, a mentor, a colleague, and a friend.   I want to begin by thanking John's family for sharing him with us and  with our country.   As I listened to my colleagues tonight speak about John, I realize  that he made each one of us feel like a very special person to him. I  also realize that words can't really capture John Lewis and what he  meant to us, to our country, and to the world.   I had the privilege, like so many of my colleagues, of walking across  the Edmund Pettus Bridge with John and listening to him speak about his  work in the civil rights movement; to be part of an effort to organize  a sit-in here on the House floor to demand action on gun violence; to  work with John when we played a really critical role in our right for  passage of the Equality Act and made the case that LGBTQ Americans were  entitled to full equality in this country; on his visit to Newport  News, Rhode Island; or traveling to South Africa to celebrate Robert  Kennedy's ``Ripple of Hope'' speech.   John Lewis made America more just, he made us all more human, because  he deeply believed in justice and equality. They weren't just things  that he believed in; it is who he was.   And most importantly, he reminded us always to be optimistic, because  he believed in the fundamental decency of every human being. And even  in the darkest moments, he would encourage us: ``Keep the faith,  brother. Keep fighting.''   And it is that belief in the fundamental goodness of everyone, that  optimism, that John left with us.   And so, John, knowing you, serving with you, has been the greatest  honor  [[Page H3685]]  of my life. I thank you for all that you have done for me and for our  country, and we promise you that we will keep the faith and keep up the  fight.   Rest in peace, my friend.
