 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, but I  also believe that the House of Representatives should go one step  further, and I believe we should institute a censure for Mr. King to  signal to this country and to our children that this behavior is  unacceptable.   The underlying premise is that we have had leaders at the highest  levels down the street from here condone and continue to perpetuate  race-baiting and white supremacist language that is not good for this  country. We need to come together. We are a weaker country today  because we are so divided.   What this is all about is whether the United States is going to move  forward saying that we are a united country, that we respect  diversity--and not only respect it, but recognize that our diversity in  this country is our greatest strength. It is our greatest cultural  strength, and it is our greatest economic strength. This House needs to  take this resolution one step further.                                time  1445
