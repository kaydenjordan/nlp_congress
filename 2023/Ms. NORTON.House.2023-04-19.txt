 Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this profoundly  undemocratic, paternalistic resolution. The House of Representatives,  in which the nearly 700,000 District of Columbia residents have no  voting representation, is attempting to nullify legislation enacted by  D.C.'s local legislature, whose members are elected by D.C. residents.   By scheduling this vote, I can only conclude that the Republican  leadership believes that D.C. residents, a majority of whom are Black  and Brown, are unworthy of governing themselves.   The dictionary defines democracy as ``a government in which the  supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by them directly or  indirectly through a system of representation usually involving  periodically held free elections.''   D.C.'s lack of voting representation in this Congress and Congress'  plenary authority over D.C. are the antithesis of democracy.   The legislative history and merits of D.C.'s Comprehensive Policing  and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022, which is the subject of this  disapproval resolution, should be irrelevant since there is never  justification for Congress nullifying legislation enacted by the  District of Columbia.    I would like to set the record straight. D.C.'s Comprehensive  Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of 2022 is consistent with  House Democrats' George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, President  Biden's executive order on policing and police accountability and  transparency legislation enacted by dozens of States, both red and  blue, to improve public safety and public trust after the murder of  George Floyd.   D.C.'s Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform Amendment Act of  2022 would, among other things, make it easier to fire officers for  misconduct; prohibit the hiring of officers with prior misconduct;  require the release of the names and body-worn camera recordings of  officers directly involved in an officer-involved death or serious use  of force; strengthen civilian oversight of police; establish a public  database of sustained allegations of officer misconduct; make officer  disciplinary records subject to release under the D.C. Freedom of  Information Act; and prohibit choke holds and asphyxiating restraints.   Congress requires D.C.'s local legislature, the D.C. Council, to pass  the permanent version of legislation twice, separated by at least 13  days. The Council passed the Comprehensive Policing and Justice Reform  Amendment Act of 2022 by votes of 11-0 and 13-0. While the legislation  was enacted without the D.C. Mayor's signature, the Mayor has urged  Congress to oppose this disapproval resolution.   The D.C. Council has 13 members. The members are elected by D.C.  residents. If D.C. residents do not like how the members vote, they can  vote them out of office.   Congress has 535 voting Members. The Members are elected by residents  of the States. None are elected by D.C. residents. If D.C. residents do  not like how the Members vote, they cannot vote them out of office.   The Revolutionary War was fought to give consent to the governed and  to end taxation without representation. D.C. residents cannot consent  to any action taken by Congress, whether they are national or local  matters, and they pay full Federal taxes. Indeed, D.C. pays more  Federal taxes per capita than any State, and more total Federal taxes  than 23 States.   Mr. Speaker, I say to every Member of Congress: Keep your hands off  D.C. If you want to legislate on local D.C. matters, become a D.C.  resident and get elected Mayor or councilmember.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote ``no.''    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding, and I would  like to respond to something that was said on the other side of the  aisle.   Both public- and private-sector employers across the country have had  difficulty recruiting and retaining employees in recent years. In fact,  the difficulty law enforcement agencies across the country have with  recruitment and retention predate the police reforms enacted after the  killing of George Floyd.                                time  1245    Prior to the killing of George Floyd, a 2019 survey conducted by the  International Association of Chiefs of Police found that ``the  challenge of recruiting law enforcement is widespread and affects  agencies of all types, sizes, and locations across the United States.''   The survey also found that ``the difficulty in recruiting law  enforcement officers and employees is not due to one particular cause.  Rather, multiple social, political, and economic forces are all  simultaneously at play.''
