 Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, I  continue to reiterate my stance and my position over the last almost 4  months now about my opposition to this policy.   Now, the burden is not on me to pass legislation to stop this illegal  policy. The burden is on the administration. The burden is on the  administration to stop breaking the law.   So let me just say this one more time--because I keep getting asked  the same question over and over again--I will keep my hold. I will keep  it on until the Pentagon follows the law or changes the law. It is that  simple. Those are the two conditions that would get me to drop the  hold. So, until these conditions are met, I object.    Reserving the right to object, my position continues  to be, follow the law or change the law. For that reason, I object.
