 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                          Republican Healthcare Bill     Mr. President, I come this morning to talk about the  impending passage of a very failed healthcare bill in the House of  Representatives and to remind my colleagues that this legislation  moving through the House of Representatives is the first time in the  50-plus years of the Medicaid Program that they are going to pass  legislation to cap and cost-shift Medicaid costs to States.   This is an $839 billion cost shift from the Federal government to  States and a one-quarter cut to the Federal Medicaid investment over a  period of ten  [[Page S2746]]  years. Some 14 million Americans will lose Medicaid coverage. These  draconian and arbitrary budget caps will leave States with impossible  choices to cut people from care, cut provider reimbursements, or reduce  benefits. Overall, 24 million Americans will lose their health  insurance. That is according to a recent Congressional Budget Office  analysis.   Why do I say this is a broken promise? Because it was very clear  that, when President Trump was a candidate, he said he was not going to  cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid.   Why is that important? Because these are trusted programs that have  worked cost effectively for so many Americans in giving them access to  care. Now is not the time, as we have seen a Medicaid expansion, to now  cost-shift Medicaid to the States by breaking this promise and putting  in it, for the first time in 50 years, a substantial change to the way  Medicaid works. It does represent, in my opinion, a war on Medicaid-- one that we cannot afford to wage.   Communities that have benefited from Medicaid expansion have seen the  value of coverage and a healthy population. All you have to do is to  talk to healthcare providers, hospitals, chambers of commerce, and  others to get them to say that, yes, having more people with healthcare  coverage in our community has helped us in raising the standard of  living.   Why is that? First of all, uncompensated care is no longer put at the  hospital's doorstep. Secondly, the population with healthcare coverage  is healthier, getting treatment in advance as opposed to waiting for a  crisis. It represents an investment in the community that allows a  community to stabilize.   These are important issues for us to discuss. I hope my colleagues in  the Senate will not fall for this ploy or that they will not go back on  promises made by this administration not to cut Medicaid.   There are other aspects of the bill coming over from the House of  Representatives, obviously, dealing with preexisting conditions, and we  know from our own experience in the State of Washington that high-risk  pools have covered only a tiny portion of people with preexisting  conditions and are inadequate unless properly funded. As an article  from the Seattle Times, from 2009, entitled ``Dozens of patients cut  from state's high-risk insurance pool'' stated: ``with premiums that  can top $20,000 a year, patients don't exactly clamor to join the  state's high-risk health-insurance pool--a public insurer of last  resort for patients with cancer, AIDS and other serious diseases . . .  ,'' and ``the premiums cover only about 30 percent of the patients'  medical and prescription expenses.''   There are many things that are working in the Affordable Care Act. We  have done great things on rebalancing; that is, to rebalance people  from nursing home care to community-based care.   This chart shows how many States in the United States of America are  doing this. This is in the Affordable Care Act. We wrote a provision  encouraging States to try to rebalance their population, not  encouraging so much nursing home care because it is so expensive, and  instead, trying to deliver the long-term care people need in their  individual communities.   The great success of this is that many States in the Affordable Care  Act took us up on it--States like Nevada, Iowa, Missouri, Texas,  Arkansas, Mississippi, Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York,  and Maine. I saw in our own State, over a 15-year period of time, that  we saved roughly $2.7 billion. That is $2.7 billion of cost. Instead of  paying for a Medicaid population in expensive nursing home settings, we  instead innovated and put them into what was a cost-effective delivery  system in which people love to stay in their home as they age as  opposed to the notion of expensive nursing home care.   I mention that because that $2.7 billion could be the kind of savings  we would see in these States. So I tell my colleagues from the House:  Innovate; don't capitate. Don't try to say that you have an ingenious  idea on how to take care of healthcare costs by simply capitating, for  the first time in 50-plus years, the Medicaid Program and then leaving  the States to pick up the bill.   It won't work. Follow the ideas and strategies that are much better  in helping us cut costs for an aging population that is living longer,  and look for fixes that are already there in the Affordable Care Act to  do so.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I note, too, that we are going to be  moving today, before we leave here, to what is the Omnibus resolution  to keep the government open.   I wanted to mention an important aspect of the legislation we are  going to be voting on. Pursuant to provisions in the Customs bill, we  are now going to put funding into trade enforcement--a very important  aspect of our trade agenda.   We know that more than 96 percent of the world's customers live  outside the United States. By some estimates, at least 70 percent of  the world's purchasing power is outside the United States. That means  that we need to keep working hard to reach these new markets and these  customers. The growing middle class has great purchasing power.   In 2015, the global middle class spent $33 trillion. By some  estimates, the middle class could surpass 4 billion people by the year  2021, making it a majority of the world's population.   Approximately one in three jobs in the State of Washington are tied  to international trade. Washington State exported approximately $80  billion in goods in 2016--from airplanes and coffee to apples and  software. I know this about our State: we understand that we are in a  global economy and that we have great products to sell in international  markets.   Agriculture exports are very important to our State. Agriculture adds  about $51 billion a year to our State's GDP, and the agricultural  sector makes up more than 13 percent of our State's economy. In 2016,  Washington exported $15 billion worth of food and agriculture products  with $7 billion being of Washington origin. We are No. 1 in the nation  in production of apples, hops, spearmint oil, wrinkled seed peas,  concord grapes, sweet cherries, pears, green peas, raspberries for  processing, blueberries and aquaculture. We are No. 2 in production of  potatoes, certain kinds of grapes, nectarines, apricots, prunes, plums,  sweet corn for processing, and a variety of other things.   This is to say that in the State of Washington, we grow a lot for  overseas markets. Why am I talking about this important aspect of this  bill that is passing to keep our government open today? Because in our  State and across our country, we need to encourage more small  businesses to export. And we need to make sure we have enforcement of a  level playing field so that U.S. companies of all sizes and U.S.  workers are protected as they compete in that global economy.   That is why, in the previously passed Customs bill, I created a Trade  Enforcement Trust Fund at the Office of U.S. Trade Representative. Now,  with this legislation passing today, we are putting $15 million toward  that trust fund to be spent exclusively on enforcing trade agreements.  We need to enforce the agreements and make sure Washington and  businesses around the country get a fair deal as we work on trade. And  $15 million in the fund would help us fight trade issues we have seen  all over the globe.   For example, sometimes people try to sell their products by taking  the great labels we have on Washington apples and putting them on  foreign apples making them seem like Washington apples, when in reality  they are not. This bill gives us money for trade enforcement to address  these challenges.   Sometimes we have intellectual property that is hijacked or stolen  from companies in our State. This bill puts more enforcement in place  to fight those crimes and to make sure we are enforcing our trade  agreements. The trust fund gives the framework and workforce to enforce  trade laws governing exports to that burgeoning,  [[Page S2747]]  as I said, growing middle class outside the United States. We must make  sure our products are sold and sold correctly and any disputes that are  happening are resolved and resolved quickly so our trade with those  countries can be cost-effective to our growers, to our manufacturers,  and to the workforce within our State.   I am sure every Member here who has companies that have done trade in  this global economy can tell you stories of how the lack of trade  enforcement has cost them business. This fund is a very positive shot  in the arm to our U.S. trade office, so they have the resources to do  more enforcement and make sure our products are winning in the overseas  markets.   I yield the floor.                             BUDGETARY REVISIONS     I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous  consent that the time be equally divided.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Fischer). Without objection, it is so  ordered.   The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
