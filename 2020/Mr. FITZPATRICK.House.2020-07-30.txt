 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an amazing  member of our community. Nicky Christopher is a 12-year-old from  Yardley, Pennsylvania, who has been working to brighten the day of  people across our community.   Over the last several months, Nicky has decorated dozens of homes to  celebrate birthdays, graduations, and bar and bat mitzvahs and other  causes for celebration.   In an amazing show of community spirit, families have donated  supplies and decorations to help Nicky continue to bring joy across our  community. And while Nicky receives some cash donations, he takes any  money that is not spent on supplies, and he donates that money to  children who have been displaced from their homes.   Mr. Speaker, Nicky's kindness and generosity are an inspiration for  our entire community and our entire Nation. I know that he has been  able to brighten the day of so many people in our community when they  have really needed it the most.   Last month I had the opportunity to meet Nicky over Zoom, and I  cannot say enough about what an amazing young man he is and how proud I  am to represent him in Congress and how incredibly proud his family  must be.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Nicky for bringing so much light to our  community and to our Nation. We need more people like him.                            ____________________
