 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act, critical legislation  protecting newborns from infanticide. This is the 50th time we have  petitioned this Chamber, and I ask for this bill's immediate  consideration in the House.    Madam Speaker, if this unanimous consent cannot be  entertained----
