 Mr. Speaker, in preparation for reauthorizing the farm bill  in 2023, I rise today to deliver the fifth installment of my farm bill  impact series where I am highlighting various aspects of the farm bill  that deserve Congress' awareness and support.   If America is going to thrive, the people who feed, fuel, and clothe  America must thrive.   The farm bill strengthens our country's national security because it  strengthens our food security by supporting the tireless efforts of  farmers, ranchers, and our agricultural producers.   Agriculture is a risky business, and Mother Nature can be a tough  business partner. Almost no other American industry faces such  volatility from forces like pests, disease, wind, drought, and fires  like the ones in Reno County, Kansas, and Paradise, Kansas, over the  last few months.   Natural disasters are make-or-break situations for the people who  ensure that America remains the most food secure country in the world.  That is why emergency programs within the farm bill are so critical.   The Livestock Indemnity Program and the Emergency Assistance for  Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish provide benefits to  producers for livestock deaths caused by disease and adverse weather.   A veterinarian from Ashland, Kansas, told me that during the Starbuck  fire back in 2017, to which he was an emergency responder, Clark  County, Kansas, alone lost 6,000 to 9,000 head of cattle right at the  beginning of calving season.   One producer suffered $1.8 million in cattle losses during this  disaster. The Livestock Indemnity Program helped producers who lost  cattle in this disaster put their livelihoods back together.   However, LIP only covered cattle mortality at the time, not severely  injured cattle. Rather than watch badly injured cattle get euthanized  just to trigger LIP program payments, this veterinarian helped make  changes to the program that are still in place today which provide  better protection for producers and their livestock.   These programs, and many more, are investments in the future of our  country, and they must remain strong in the 2023 farm bill if America  is going to remain food secure and self-determining as a Nation.   Natural disasters, diseases, and weather emergencies, unfortunately,  do happen, and America cannot afford to have these factors cripple the  businesses of the men and women who keep us fed, fueled, and clothed.   That is why we need to think carefully and critically about the  degrees to which we support emergency programs within the 2023 farm  bill.   I will be back on the floor soon to deliver another installment of my  farm bill impact series and highlight more programs and titles within  the bill that Congress must understand and support to ensure that  agriculture thrives in America.                            ____________________
