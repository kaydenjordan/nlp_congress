 Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, before I begin, I wanted to acknowledge  that this morning, countless Floridians woke up to a world turned  upside down in the wake of Hurricane Ian. Hundreds of thousands in  Puerto Rico remain without power more than 10 days after the storm that  ravaged the island.   I want them to know that Vermonters will stand by your side as you  rebuild your communities and  [[Page S5520]]  your lives, and so will Republicans and Democrats in this Chamber.   Now, the continuing resolution we are about to consider contains  $18.8 billion for the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund, which would bring  available resources in the fund to approximately $35 billion to respond  to these and other disasters.   We likely are not going to know the extent of the damage for several  days. Every time you watch the news you hear of more damage. But I  remind my colleagues that we are the United States of America, and I am  ready to work with my colleagues to respond with what is needed.   I do not care whether a State is represented by Democrats or  Republicans. You are part of the United States of America, and as  chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I will work with you during  the months ahead to get the funds you need.   Now, that said, I am glad we have reached an agreement to fund the  Federal Government through December 16, and I want to thank my good  friend Vice Chairman Shelby for working on this. But I especially want  to thank Leaders Schumer and McConnell for their work and cooperation  in reaching this point. They both understand the need to go forward.   I am glad that we were able to secure $1 billion to bolster LIHEAP  ahead of the winter heating season. My home State of Vermont will  receive an infusion of $5.7 million from this funding. Now, that is  going to go a long way to help families pay their bills when they are  faced with rising fuel costs and plummeting temperatures. It helps them  not to have to make the decision ``do I eat or heat.''   The bill also includes $12.35 billion in emergency assistance for  Ukraine, $2.5 billion to support recovery efforts for the Hermit's  Peak-Calf Canyon fire in New Mexico; $2 billion in community  development block grants to help communities recovering from major  disasters in 2021 and 2022.   I am disappointed that some of my Republican colleagues blocked  additional funding to combat COVID-19 or monkeypox. I will continue to  work with Republicans and Democrats to secure these necessary resources  in the omnibus.   And, finally, I want to be clear. This is only a temporary measure.  As the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I am committed to  completing the work of the committee before the end of this Congress.   Running on autopilot after December with rising inflation would be  irresponsible. It would leave priorities of both Republicans and  Democrats underfunded and underresourced. The Federal Government funds  programs that the American people rely on. We should do the job that  the American people sent all of us--all 100 of us--here to do.   I want to thank Vice Chairman Shelby's staff. As I said earlier, I  thank the majority leader and the Republican leader for their help and  cooperation in bringing this together. I also want to thank my staff,  Charles Kieffer, Chanda Betourney--there are too many names to mention,  but these are people who worked through recesses, weekends, long hours,  long nights. I get to go home by midevening. They stay there most of  the night to get it done.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  all of the names of our staff at the end of my speech.   The continuing resolution is a strong bill, and it is a bipartisan  bill. I urge my colleagues to accept it.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                              Democratic Staff         1. Charles Kieffer        2.
