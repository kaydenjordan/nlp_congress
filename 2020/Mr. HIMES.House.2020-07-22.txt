 Mr. Speaker, last Saturday night, Christopher David, a  veteran of the United States Navy, was walking in Portland when he came  upon an odd sight: Federal agents, in full tactical gear, heavily  armed, looking for all the world like the operators that we drop into  terrorist havens in Afghanistan, patrolling the streets of an American  city; detaining Americans; hustling them, unexplained, into rented  minivans.   Now, is Mr. David a masked ninja of anarchy? No.   Was he throwing rocks or carrying bottles of gasoline? No.   Mr. David was curious, and he stood there, clearly unarmed, clearly  not a threat, curious.   And here is where it gets interesting, and any American who hasn't  seen the video needs to look at it right now.   A Federal agent, gas mask, body armor, camouflage, bristling with  weapons and tactical gear, approaches Mr. David, winds up, and beats  Mr. David repeatedly with his truncheon.   Mr. David doesn't move. His hand has been broken by a Federal agent,  but he doesn't move, not a muscle.   Well, the agent is confused by this and he hesitates. But backup  arrives. Another Federal agent sprays Mr. David repeatedly in the face  with pepper spray. Now this is heartening to the first agent, so he  winds up and hits Mr. David again with his bat.   Now, I don't care how cynical you have become about our country. I  don't care whether you have signed over your time, your talent, your  treasure, your integrity to the support of Donald J. Trump. If you have  a drop of American blood in your veins, your soul dies a little as you  watch the heavily armed Federal agent beat a United States Navy  veteran.   So what are combat-ready Federal agents doing in the streets of a  city which does not want them there in a State which did not ask for  them?   Are there bodies piling up in the streets of Portland?   Are there 150,000 dead--just to choose a number--Americans in  Portland? No. There is not a single fatality. Of course not.   Like so many cities, Portland boiled over in rage at the murder of  George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis Police Department. And,  yeah, regrettably and illegally a minority of protestors have committed  acts of vandalism; bottles and rocks have been thrown, windows broken,  threats made. That is not okay, ever.   But protecting property in Portland or anywhere else is the job of  the local police department, the State police and, in a worst-case  scenario, the National Guard. Why?   First, while Federal agents are legally entitled to protect Federal  property, they are not authorized to patrol municipal streets to  enforce State and local law. That is an idea that goes back to our  dissatisfaction with King George, and it is an idea that my Republican  friends used to care about.   Second, operationally, agents of the Border Patrol and the Marshals  Service are not trained to manage protests. They are trained to patrol  borders and to chase fugitives. A heavily armed individual with no  identification or insignia trundling people, without explanation, into  an unmarked van is likely to be misunderstood in a way that could lead  to violence, particularly in a heavily armed society.   Finally, there is the question of the President's intentions, which  are pretty clear. We have seen how the President responds to real  crisis; almost 150,000 Americans dead of COVID-19, denial,  misinformation.   We have 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the  COVID-19 deaths on the planet. That is a disgrace. It is a lethal  disgrace.   George Floyd, an unarmed Black American, dies at the hands of the  police, like so many before him. That is a lethal crisis.   The President was asked about Black Americans dying at the hands of  police and he says: ``So are White people; so are White people. What a  terrible question to ask.''   And now the President threatens to send heavily armed Federal agents  to New York, Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore. Do we have a problem? No, we  do not.   Take it from an unclassified Office of Intelligence and Analysis  report by the Department of Homeland Security: ``The regularity of  violence amidst lawful protests in Portland since 26 May contrasts with  national trends, which reflect a steady decline in violence during the  last 2 weeks''--``a steady decline in violence during the last 2  weeks.''   Mr. Speaker, this is important because democracies die, but they  don't die fast. They die because people come to believe that the media  is the enemy of the people. They die because a President's supporters  are more given over to that President than they are to the rule of law;  and they die because citizens become used to the sight of Federal  agents acting, not to protect them, but to attack them.    We have been warned. The question is: Now what do we do?                            ____________________
