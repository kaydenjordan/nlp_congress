(ii) Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 11-05; Date:       February 1, 2011; Military Department: Navy.        (iii) Description: On February 1, 2011, Congress was       notified by congressional certification transmittal number       11-05 of the possible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms       Export Control Act of the Government of Australia's request       for ten year Through-Life-Support (TLS) for Australia's fleet       of twenty-four (24) MH-60R helicopters. The sustainment       effort included spare and repair parts provisioning, support       and test equipment, publications and technical documentation,       U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical and       logistics support services, and other related elements of       logistics support. The estimated cost was $1.6 billion, with       no Major Defense Equipment (MDE).        On July 10, 2018, Congress was notified by congressional       certification transmittal number 18-0A of the extension of       the sustainment support will include additional spare parts       through June 2028 as requested by Australia. There was no       increase in MDE cost. The case value increased from $1.6       billion to $2.8 billion.        On June 15, 2020, Congress was notified by congressional       certification transmittal number 0H-20 of the addition of the       following MDE: three (3) airborne Embedded GPS/INS (EGI) with       GPS security devices and four (4) T700-GE-401C turbo engines.       This equipment resulted in a net increase in MDE cost of $5       million and a corresponding decrease in the non-MDE value by       $5 million. The total estimated cost remained $2.8 billion.        This transmittal notifies Australia's request for continued       sustainment and support services for its MH-60R helicopters.       No additional MDE is being added and there is no increase in       MDE cost. The total estimated cost will increase to $4.3       billion.        (iv) Significance: This proposed sale will improve       Australia's capability to perform antisurface and       antisubmarine warfare missions as well as secondary missions,       including vertical replenishment, search and rescue, and       communications relay. Australia will use the enhanced       capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to       strengthen its homeland defense.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale supports the foreign       policy and national security objectives of the United States       by improving the security of a major non-NATO ally that is a       key partner of the United States in ensuring peace and       stability around the world.

National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS)       Medium Range Air Defense System (MRADS) Description. This is       a System of Systems (SOS) consisting of the Sentinel Radar,       the Fire Distribution Center (FDC), the AIM-120 Advanced       Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), the AIM-120       Extended Range Missile (AMRAAM-ER), and the AIM-9X Missile.       The NASAMS MRADS is designed for mid-range air defense and       can be deployed to engage fixed wing and rotary wing       aircraft, cruise missiles, and unmanned aerial systems       (UASs). The NASAMS MRADS is not a Program of Record (POR) for       the U.S. Department of Defense, but the SOS architecture does       consist of several PORs: the U.S. Army's AN/MPQ-64 Sentinel       radar, the U.S. Air Force's AIM-120 AMRAAM missile, and the       U.S. Navy's AIM-9X Missile. The NASAMS is comprised of both       U.S.- and Norwegian-manufactured components. Norwegian       components will be procured by the Raytheon Company.       Norwegian involvement will be managed by Raytheon using       export authorizations received from the U.S. Department of       State.        2. NASAMS Fire Unit (FU). Consists of one fire distribution       center (FDC); one AN/MPQ-64F1 surveillance, acquisition, and       tracking radar; three truck-mounted Canister Launchers       (LCHR); and the High Mobility Launcher (HML).        3. Fire Distribution Center (FDC). The command & control       entity, FDC, is the major operator interface in NASAMS. It       provides all command and control functionality necessary to       effectively conduct Air Defense  [[Page S1785]]       missions, both in a stand-alone configuration as well as in a       netted configuration integrated with other units. The FDC       interfaces and controls the AN/MPQ-64F1 Sentinel radar and       the Canister and High Mobility-Launchers. The FDC also       interfaces (voice and data) to the national command and       control structure.        4. AN/MPQ-64F1 Sentinel Radar. This is the organic mobile       Air Defense acquisition and tracking sensor for the United       States Army. Sentinel provides persistent air surveillance       and fire control quality data through command and control       systems to defeat UAS, cruise missiles, and fixed-wing and       rotary-wing aircraft threats.        5. Canister Launcher (CLS). Purpose is to transport, aim,       and fire the U.S. Air Force AMRAAM, AMRAAM-ER, and the U.S.       Navy AIM-9X Sidewinder missiles. Under the remote control of       the FDC, the launcher permits rapid launching of one or more       missiles against single or multiple targets and can support 6       engagements simultaneously. The launcher provides 360-degree,       all weather, day and night, missile launch capability.        6. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        7. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        8. A determination has been made that Ukraine can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        9. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Ukraine.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
