 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Farm  Workforce Modernization Act of 2019.   I want to thank Representative Lofgren for her leadership, as well as  colleagues on both sides of the aisle, for making this vote today  happen. It will be a historical vote.   California, my home State, is our Nation's bread basket; yet, over 40  percent of California's farms don't have the workforce they need to  feed our population. The same is true for many farms across the country  that depend on skilled immigrant farmworkers.   These men and women work in our fields to plant, care, and harvest  our produce that feeds our families, both in the U.S. and  internationally. They do good work, good honest work, but live in an  uncertain situation.   Farm owners and farmworkers agree that this reform is desperately  needed. This bill offers a stable workforce for our farmers, who need  to compete in the global food markets, and provides an earned legal  status for farmworkers.   I urge passage of H.R. 5038.
