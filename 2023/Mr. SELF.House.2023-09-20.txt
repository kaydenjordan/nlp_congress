 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, and I agree with my colleagues  across the aisle: You cannot choose your own facts, and this is a moral  discussion.   Abortion is not reproductive health. Abortion takes a life. There are  two people involved in this issue, and one of them dies. This is not  healthcare. This is not a political issue. It is a moral issue that our  Nation needs to grapple with.   This motion must not pass.
