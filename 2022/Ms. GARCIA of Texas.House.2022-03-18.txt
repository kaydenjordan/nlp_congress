 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  90th anniversary of a Houston-area community staple, the Houston  Livestock Show and Rodeo.   Anyone who lives in or around Houston knows about the Houston Rodeo,  but outside of their legendary fried Oreos, incredibly tasty brisket,  and impressive livestock shows and rodeo, it is a family-friendly place  where families and communities across the region learn about  agriculture.   The Houston Rodeo has a special place in my heart, Madam Speaker, as  it does to many Texans. Growing up on a farm, I still remember my first  trip to Houston was to attend the Houston Rodeo.   Today, it is the world's largest rodeo with attendance surpassing two  million people. Money raised at the rodeo goes to scholarships. This  year alone, 350 4-year scholarships will be awarded.   The Houston Rodeo is a Houston gem. It is a Texas gem.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate the Houston Rodeo on its 90-year  anniversary, and I look forward to the next 90 years.
