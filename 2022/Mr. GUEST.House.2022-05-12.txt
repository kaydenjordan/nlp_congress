 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 903. When Congress  created the Transportation Security Administration more than 20 years  ago in the wake of the attacks on 9/11, this body provided the TSA  Administrator with unique authorities in the management of its  personnel.   H.R. 903 would eliminate this vital flexibility and infringe upon  TSA's ability to immediately respond to evolving threats and to protect  the traveling public.   This bill goes against Congress' intent by moving an entire agency  into  [[Page H4883]]  an antiquated 1940s system of title 5 of the U.S. Code. TSA will not be  able to take emerging intelligence and quickly change security  screening procedures at airports without unnecessary and dangerous  delays due to the collective bargaining requirements of this bill.   Since 9/11, TSA has kept our Nation's transportation system secure.  Airport screeners and Federal air marshals have responded time and time  again to emerging threats.   For example, checkpoint screenings procedures were changed almost  overnight in response to the liquid explosive plot in 2006 and the  personal electronic device threat in 2017. Such immediate and agile  responses will be severely hindered under H.R. 903. Security policies  should not be subject to union bargaining.   In addition, TSA will no longer be able to easily remove employees  who have committed serious misconduct. If a TSA screener is caught  smuggling drugs or weapons, it will be nearly impossible for TSA to  immediately terminate them due to the layers of bureaucracy in the  title 5 system.   According to TSA, this bill will cost an astronomical amount of  almost $8 billion over a 5-year period, and much of that money won't go  to the frontline personnel. The amount of overhead costs associated  with moving an entire agency to title 5 means that billions of dollars  will be spent on the transition and will require the hiring of hundreds  of new employees, not frontline workers who would be protecting the  traveling public but, instead, bureaucrats who will facilitate this  massive labor relations effort.   If we actually want to address the needs of frontline workers, we  would focus on securing more funding for their pay. Instead, H.R. 903  will waste billions in taxpayer dollars to create more bureaucracy and  provide even more money to headquarters and those who work there who  already have a much higher salary than the dedicated frontline  personnel.   I am extremely concerned that passing this bill would create a  massive unfunded mandate that will ultimately divert critical funding  from other important DHS priorities like border security,  cybersecurity, and emergency response.   If my friends in the majority were truly focused on prioritizing and  improving the pay of TSA frontline workers, rather than prioritizing  and empowering the unions, they would support frontline pay raises  without the expense and the unnecessary bureaucracy of title 5.   Unfortunately, the majority rejected an amendment by Ranking Member  Katko at the markup that would have done just that--improve the pay of  frontline screeners and air marshals, not the high-paid bureaucrats at  headquarters, without all the waste that title 5 would provide.   I and many of my colleagues stand ready to raise pay for frontline  workers, but I cannot in good conscience support a bill that is  fiscally irresponsible, undermines our national security, hinders the  agency's missions and flexibility, and prioritizes the interests of the  unions over the interests of the dedicated frontline workforce and the  traveling public.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 903, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko).    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gooden).   Mr. GOODEN OF Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas for  stating so eloquently what I and I believe everyone in this Chamber  agrees with, and that is that the TSA agents, the men and women who  work for the American people at the airport, are protecting our Nation.   They are on the front lines, which is why I am rising today to urge  my colleagues to do something very simple, and that is to protect  Americans from terrorists and dangerous criminals when they fly and to  assist the TSA by taking away a very dangerous policy that they have  enacted from the top that they are encouraging and forcing these agents  on the front lines to deal with. That policy is one of allowing illegal  aliens onto commercial aircraft without proper identification.   It was confirmed to me from the TSA administrator that migrants are  allowed to use arrest warrants and warrants for deportation to board  flights alongside everyday travelers. This was confirmed to me before  Christmas last year. Despite my demands and those of many of my  colleagues, the Biden administration has done nothing to stop this.  Anyone in this country illegally, or with a warrant for arrest, should  be detained and brought before a judge, not permitted to travel to the  city of their choice.   This should be a commonsense request. I will remind my colleagues  that the TSA was created in response to the September 11 attacks, but  it seems as if we have forgotten that. The lax policies by the TSA that  allow unvetted aliens to board flights without identification presents  a serious national security threat each and every day and jeopardizes  the lives of the American people.   My constituents, and I would venture to argue those of my colleagues,  perhaps some of my open border friends across the aisle, would agree  that our constituents deserve to fly in a safe aircraft.                                time  1300    My constituents have to pull out an ID to board a flight, but this  TSA has said that if you have an arrest warrant, that is good enough to  get through security. I think that is crazy, and I think the American  people do as well. I introduced this motion to recommit to protect our  skies, verify the identity of travelers, and notify law enforcement if  someone is in our country illegally.   There is zero excuse to delay when the ongoing border crisis is  putting every single community in our Nation at risk. In just 10  months, the Biden administration allowed over 45,000 noncitizens to fly  without an ID, nearly 160 passengers each and every day. We also know  this administration is allowing people on the terrorist watch list into  our country, and we have no clue who is boarding these flights.   I urge my colleagues to protect our airways and prevent another  tragedy like 9/11 from occurring by adopting this motion.   Mr. Speaker, if we adopt the motion to recommit, we will instruct the  Committee on Homeland Security to consider my amendment to H.R. 903 to  prohibit the TSA from accepting documents such as an arrest warrant or  notice to appear as a valid form of identification. I ask unanimous  consent to insert the text of the amendment in the Record immediately  prior to the vote on the motion to recommit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is clear that all Republicans support  increasing the pay of our TSA frontline workers. We know that they are  crucial to the security of our traveling public.   But this bill that we are here debating is not a bill that deals  specifically with that. If that were the case, in markup Ranking Member  Katko's amendment, an amendment that would have provided a $3,000  immediate salary increase to all frontline workers, 5 percent raise on  top of that, year one; year 2, a 3 percent raise; year 3, a 3 percent  raise; year 4, a 4 percent raise.   This bill that we are talking about today is a bill that is not just  to increase pay, which we all agree on, but this is, instead, a labor  bill. This is, instead, an attempt to unionize an entire Federal  agency.   Mr. Payne spoke about that a little bit when he got up a few moments  ago when he talked about the blue-ribbon committee that was established  and said that there was not one labor leader on that committee. We  shouldn't be putting labor leaders in the position of putting them on  committees where we are talking about protecting the traveling public.  That committee that he referred to, in 2019 TSA received a report from  that bipartisan committee--and I stress that it was a bipartisan  committee, the Blue Ribbon Panel Reviewing TSA Human Capital Service  Delivery. The panel was composed of former officials from both  Democratic and Republican administrations and included the chief human  capital officer for DHS under former President Obama.   It says that they strongly--not just recommended, but they strongly  recommended against moving TSA personnel under title 5, and then this  is a quote directly from that report, and it says here, ``One  recommendation the panel heard repeatedly from employees was moving TSA  into the General Schedule (GS). The Panel does not agree. The General  Schedule is a 70-year-old classification and compensation system from  the last century and is the subject of countless studies and  recommendations from good government organizations who consistently  find it is too inflexible to meet the needs of the 21st century  workforce. A better course of action is to use existing ATSA  flexibility to improve the TSA pay system so that it operates at a  level superior to the GS system.''   Those are not my words. Those are not the words of Republicans. Those  are the words of a blue-ribbon committee which was established to study  this very thing. Here we see that Congress is going to completely  ignore the findings of that committee. We are going to ignore a  committee made up of TSA workers, employees, personnel, and supervisors  who served on a committee that was established to look at this very  point, and we are going to completely ignore that.   We are going to now do exactly what this committee recommended  against. And we are doing that not because we want to increase the pay  of the frontline workers, which again we all agree on and we all  support. We would support a bill today that would do that without  putting everyone under title 5. But what this bill is, this is an  attempt to unionize an entire Federal agency and a bill which would  make the traveling public less safe.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I close by thanking the men and women of TSA, especially  the screeners, air marshals, and other frontline workers.   The debate we are having today does not impact the sincere  appreciation we have for the tremendous job they do each and every day  to secure the transportation system.   While we disagree on the best way forward, we all share the same goal  of improving the pay and morale for TSA frontline workforce. It is  important not only for the success of the agency but for the security  of our Nation. Unfortunately, this bill is not the answer, and,  therefore, I cannot support it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 903, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment. While  I appreciate some of the issues my majority colleagues seek to address  in this en bloc amendment, the bottom line is, there is nothing that  will improve the bill or address the multiple concerns I have in it.   Nothing in this en bloc amendment will preserve TSA's flexible  authority to implement immediate security procedures in the face of  national security threats. Nothing in this en bloc will ensure that  screeners who commit gross misconduct are immediately relieved of their  duties. Nothing in this en bloc will protect the rest of the Department  of Homeland Security from having its key mission areas--like border  security, cybersecurity, and counterterrorism vetting--from being  raided to pay for this massive unfunded mandate.   Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this en bloc amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendments  en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, these arguments go to further what we  talked about earlier. This bill is not about a pay increase for our  frontline workers. This isn't a bill about protecting the traveling  public. This is a bill about unionizing an entire Federal agency.   My friends across the aisle say that TSA already has the authority to  do what Representative Cammack's  [[Page H4890]]  amendment sets forth. What is the harm in putting that in the body of  the legislation itself?   Should it not be clear to everyone who reads the legislation that  collective bargaining should not hold up improvement to security?  Should that not be made clear?   Should we not set forth that they already have that? What harm does  it do in setting that forth again?   Again, we all want to see that our TSA frontline workers get the pay  raise that they need and deserve. What we oppose on the Republican side  is the complete unionization of this Federal agency.   I will tell you that this is a critical amendment to our national  security. Historically, we look back, and when Congress stood up TSA in  the wake of 9/11, they deliberately provided flexibility to the agency  to deal with the evolving threats to our transportation system. It is  imperative that the TSA Administrator maintain that authority to make  immediate changes to screening procedures when addressing national  security threats.   The amendment of my good friend from Florida simply preserves that  authority and makes it clear that the Administrator has that authority  and exempts security procedures from the collective bargaining process.   Without this critical amendment, security changes like those made in  response to the 2006 liquid explosives or the 2017 personal electronic  device plot could be significantly hampered or delayed if subject to  collective bargaining. We simply cannot afford to put our national  security on the bargaining table.   I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for leading this important  issue, and I urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My amendment would sunset the requirements of H.R. 903 at the end of  fiscal year 2022 if Congress does not appropriate sufficient funds to  carry out the bill.   With H.R. 903 having an estimated cost to taxpayers of nearly $2  billion, or $8 billion if you use TSA's own estimates, it is critical  that the bill does not simply become an astronomical unfunded mandate.   This amendment will remove this bill's requirement to move TSA to  title 5 if sufficient funding is not appropriated specifically for  those requirements. This will protect other critical homeland security  missions, like cybersecurity and border security, from being raided to  pay for this legislation.   In TSA's feedback on H.R. 903, they explicitly stated this:  Implementation of H.R. 903 ``without additional, adequate  appropriations would have dire impacts upon the TSA mission and  negatively impact national and economic security.''   Let me read that again. It said that without proper appropriations,  it would have a dire impact ``upon the TSA mission and negatively  impact national and economic security.'' That is from TSA itself.   Those are the words of the agency that we are looking at changing,  and they are warning us. They are warning Congress that if we do this,  and then we don't follow through with the funding, we are putting the  traveling public at risk. If this is not clear enough, I don't know  what is.   I urge all Members to support this fiscally responsible amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers so I am prepared to  close when the majority is prepared.   Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time. In closing, I  refer back to the words of TSA. These are not my words. These are not  the words of the Republican caucus. These are the words of TSA, which  was tasked with a critical mission, and the words of TSA are words that  we should take into account when we are debating this amendment and  debating this bill.   The words of TSA: Implementation of H.R. 903 ``without additional,  adequate appropriations would have dire impacts upon the TSA mission  and negatively impact national and economic security.''   This amendment is simple. If we are not going to fund this, we cannot  put our national and economic security at risk, and this should be  sunsetted.   I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment represents a new frontier in legislative  dysfunction. It hinges the rights of TSOs on Congress' ability to pass  a completely different bill.   This is not serious legislating. It is a bad faith gimmick and  unworthy of support. There is no justification for making the rights of  the TSA workforce contingent on the broken annual appropriations  process.   This amendment sends the message to the TSA workforce that their  fundamental rights have an expiration date.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, just as  my colleagues and I did when it was brought up in the committee.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, the people of the great State of Mississippi  are grateful for the service of the 12,500 National Guard  servicemembers of our State and for the leadership of General Durr  Boyles.   Our guardsmen are dedicated to keeping Mississippi safe by providing  response to disasters and by serving our Nation on domestic and foreign  military missions. During floods and hurricanes, our guardsmen  transport and rescue civilians inundated by high waters. After the  storms, National Guard engineers repair infrastructure and utilities  and provide logistics support to citizens.   With 65 readiness centers statewide, the Mississippi Army National  Guard can quickly respond to any number of events at a moment's notice.   The Mississippi Air National Guard, operating from the 186th Air  Refueling Wing, the 172nd Airlift Wing, and the Combat Readiness  Training Center, provides access to services across the globe.   On behalf of the people of Mississippi, I thank every man and woman  who serves in the Mississippi National Guard for their dedicated  service to our State and our Nation.
