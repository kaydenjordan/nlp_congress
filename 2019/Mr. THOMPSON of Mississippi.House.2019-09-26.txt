Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3106, the Domestic and  International Terrorism DATA Act.   El Paso. Poway. Pittsburgh. Charlottesville. Charleston. Oak Creek.   In the last 7 years, these great American cities have found  themselves involuntarily linked by the horror of domestic terrorism.                                time  1500    Just last year, in 2018, there were 50 extremist killings in the  United States. Every single one had links to rightwing extremism,  mostly white supremacist extremism.   Between 2009 and 2018, there were 427 deaths linked to extremism in  America. Nearly three-fourths of those were linked to domestic  rightwing extremists, as compared to the less than one-fourth linked to  Islamist extremists.   The Committee on Homeland Security has tackled the challenge of  understanding and preventing domestic terrorism head-on. In May of this  year, the committee held its first-ever hearing on domestic terrorism  while we took testimony from the FBI, DHS, and the Justice Department  on white supremacist and other domestic terrorism movements.   Since then, the committee has broadened its oversight of domestic  terrorism by not only weaving it into our traditional work with respect  to foreign terrorist groups but also by focusing on how social media  platforms are exploited to recruit, plan, and carry out terrorist  attacks.   All along, the committee has given special attention to the  challenges associated with keeping places of worship and other public  spaces secure in a current terrorism climate by, among other things,  holding roundtables in Jackson, Mississippi, and Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be here to present H.R. 3106, a bill that  was approved by the committee on a bipartisan basis to improve the  Federal response to domestic terrorism.   Today, Americans have a sense that domestic terrorism threats are  significant but have not been presented with the full-threat picture.  There is some information available to the public, but it is limited.  Americans have learned, for example, there were more arrests tied to  domestic terrorism than to international terrorism in 2017 and 2018.   In May, the FBI revealed that it had around 850 active domestic  terrorism investigations across the country. As of July, according to  the FBI, the number of domestic terrorism arrests in 2019 is on par  with the number of international terrorism arrests.  [[Page H8029]]    In the absence of complete and reliable information from the Federal  Government, groups like the Anti-Defamation League have done this  Nation a great service by collecting and publishing data on the threat  of extremist violence in the United States.   My bill would require the FBI, the Justice Department, and the  Department of Homeland Security to publish an annual report on  terrorism. Enactment of this legislation would help Americans  understand, over time, the nature of the terrorism threat and how it is  evolving.   Importantly, the legislation also requires Federal agencies to share  information on how the government is keeping us safe. We need to know  how many staff are on the job and how many terrorism-related  investigations, indictments, prosecutions, and convictions there have  been.   The bill has been endorsed by the Anti-Defamation League, the Arab  American Institute, the Jewish Federations of North America, the  Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Leadership  Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the Muslim Advocates, the NAACP,  the National Action Network, and the Southern Poverty Law Center.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record endorsement letters from the  following organizations: the Anti-Defamation League, the NAACP, the  Arab American Institute, the Jewish Federations of North America; the  Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and the Southern Poverty  Law Center.                                                      July 12, 2019.        Dear Representative: We are writing to urge you to support       H.R. 3106, the Domestic Terrorism Documentation and Analysis       of Threats in America Act, or the Domestic Terrorism DATA       Act, which we have endorsed.        The ADL (Anti-Defamation League) is a leading anti-hate       organization and has been working to secure justice and fair       treatment to all since its founding in 1913. As part of our       mandate, we have been compiling and analyzing comprehensive       domestic terrorism data for years. We use this data to       investigate the threat of extremist groups and domestic       terrorism, work with law enforcement to help keep our       communities safe from those threats, and inform debates about       how to shape policy. ADL has long found that data collection       is essential to effectively counter hate and extremism in all       forms. Without transparency, collective efforts, and       comprehensive data collection, advocacy and solutions are not       possible.        Our data show that threats against Jews, Muslims, and other       minorities in the United States are at disturbingly high       levels, and a key reason for that is the resurgence of white       supremacist ideologies. ADL's latest report on extremist-      related murders, Murder and Extremism in the United States in       2018, found that 78% of the 50 murders committed by       extremists in 2018 were tied specifically to white supremacy.       The ten-year overview tells a similar story: Of the 313       people killed by right-wing extremists between 2009 to 2018,       76% were killed by white supremacists, making white       supremacists the deadliest extremist movement in the United       States over the past decade.        The proliferation of hate and the dangerous ideology of       white supremacy puts our communities at risk. From       Charlottesville to Pittsburgh to Poway, American communities       are under attack. In a time of crisis such as this, one might       expect a complete overhaul of the priorities, policies, and       resources that the U.S. government brings to bear to counter       and prevent this ideology from claiming its next victims.       Instead, Americans have been met with an abdication of that       duty, while the government, in fact, has reduced resources to       counter domestic terrorism, leaving our communities more       vulnerable to the next inevitable tragedy.        The Domestic Terrorism Documentation and Analysis of       Threats in America Act focuses on increasing the       coordination, accountability, and transparency of the federal       government in collecting and recording data on domestic       terrorism. H.R. 3106 would Require FBI, DOJ, and DHS to       produce an annual, unclassified joint report that provides       the following: data on domestic terrorist incidents;       assessments, investigations, indictments, prosecutions, and       convictions with a domestic terrorism nexus; the number of       full-time staff working on domestic terrorism employed by DOJ       and DHS, as well as a new requirement for the Government       Accountability Office (GAO) to audit the annual joint       reports.        Data drives policy; we cannot address what we are not       measuring. Collecting accurate and transparent data on       domestic terrorism is an essential way to ensure this threat       to American democracy receives the attention it deserves.       That is why we urge you to support the Domestic Terrorism       DATA Act.            Sincerely,      Erika Moritsugu,        Vice President,      Government Relations, Advocacy and Community Engagement.                                   ____                                                               NAACP                                                     June 27, 2019.      Hon. Bennie Thompson,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.       Re: NAACP Strong Support for H.R. 3106, the ``Domestic           Terrorism Documentation and Analysis of Threats in           America Act''        Dear Congressman Thompson: On behalf of the NAACP, our       nation's oldest, largest and most widely-recognized       grassroots-based civil rights organization, I would like to       thank you for your leadership and courage in introducing H.R.       3106, the Domestic Terrorism Documentation and Analysis of       Threats in America (the ``Domestic Terrorism DATA'') Act.       Upon enactment, your bill would foster crucial transparency       and facilitate informed policymaking on domestic terrorism.        Today, federal efforts to address domestic terrorism are       largely outside of public view. Furthermore, genuine threats       to the American people are misunderstood, or driven by       limited information. Yet according to the Washington Post,       right-wing domestic terrorism is on the rise, and currently       presents a more dangerous threat to our nation and her people       than terrorism that has international origins. There is a       need for centralized, reliable, publically accessible       information on domestic terrorism to inform effective       counter-terrorism policymaking. By requiring an annual,       unclassified joint report produced by the FBI and US       Department of Homeland Security and the US Department of       Justice that provides, among other things, an assessment of       domestic threats, H.R. 3106 will help to advance       Congressional and public understanding of trends in domestic       terrorism.        It is through this informed understanding of the extent to       which these genuine threats to our well-being as a nation       that we will be able to effectively address this challenge.       H.R. 3106 will not only help us measure this threat, but also       manage the programmatic solutions.        Thank you again for your visionary leadership in       introducing H.R. 3106, the ``Domestic Terrorism DATA'' Act.       The NAACP is pleased to endorse this crucial legislation and       we will work with you and other, like-minded Members of       Congress to pass it into law. Should you have any questions       or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me at my       office.            Sincerely,      Hilary O. Shelton,        Director, NAACP Washington Bureau & Senior Vice President       for Policy and Advocacy.                                   ____                                            Arab American Institute,                                                     July 17, 2019.      Hon. Bennie Thompson,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson: We write in support of the Domestic       and International Terrorism Documentation and Analysis of       Threats in America Act (H.R. 3106). Your bill would provide       Congress and the general public with more information about       federal counterterrorism activities related to acts that meet       the definitions of domestic terrorism and interntional       terrorism codified in federal criminal law. In addition to       promoting increased transparency, accountability, and       oversight of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS),       Department of Justice (DOJ), and Federal Bureau of       Investigation (FBI), the Domestic and International Terrorism       DATA Act would also promote a better understanding of the       nature and extent of acts that meet the definitions of       domestic terrorism and international terrorism.        Members of Congress and the general public lack sufficient       understanding of how the federal government utilizes existing       authorities and resources to investigate and prosecute acts       that meet either definition of terrorism. As demonstrated in       recent congressional hearings, there is a general desire       among lawmakers for more information about the federal       government's approach to counterterrorism, particularly when       it comes to white supremacist violence. Many communities,       including Arab Americans, are concerned about the increased       threat of white supremacist violence. However, many of these       same communities are also concerned about the impact of       federal counterterrorism policies on civil rights and civil       liberties. The Domestic and International Terrorism DATA Act       is responsive to both concerns, as the data collection and       reporting required of the federal government would produce       statistics on different threats facing communities, including       that of white supremacist violence, while also creating       opportunities for transparency, accountability, and oversight       of federal counterterrorism activities.        This legislation comes at a time when many are questioning       the adequacy of the federal government's response to the       threat of white supremacist violence, and whether additional       authorities or resources are needed. Research from AAI and       other organization indicates that while the federal       government's response to white supremacist violence is       inadequate, the problem is one of priorities and not a lack       of tools. The federal government already has the requisite       authorities and resources to effectively respond to threats       of white supremacist violence. Critically, the Domestic and       International Terrorism DATA Act does not provide additional       tools, but simply requires the federal  [[Page H8030]]       government to demonstrate how it is using its existing       authorities and resources to effectively report and respond       to white supremacist violence.        In addition to providing critical information about the       federal government's approach to acts that fall within the       definition of domestic terrorism, the Domestic and       International Terrorism DATA Act will provide information       about federal efforts under the ``international terrorism''       label as well. Congress and the general public will benefit       from increased oversight of the federal approach to       counterterrorism activities, regardless of whether those       activities are initiated under the heading of ``domestic       terrorism'' or ``international terrorism.''        Your staff may follow up with our Policy Counsel.            Respectfully,                                                        Maya Berry,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                              The Jewish Federations                                                of North America,                                                       June 6, 2019.      Hon. Bennie Thompson,      Chairman, House Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson: On behalf of The Jewish       Federations, I want to convey our support for the ``Domestic       Terrorism DATA Act.''        Over the past three months, the Federal Bureau of       Investigation (FBI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS),       and National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) have issued no       less than 6 Joint Intelligence Bulletins (JIBs) on threats to       synagogues, churches, and mosques, cultural community       centers, and other establishments or individuals associated       with various faiths.        According to these JIBs, the FBI has investigated more than       100 threats to religious institutions over the past year, and       the FBI, DHS, and NCTC assess ``domestic actors will continue       to pose a lethal threat to faith-based communities in the       Homeland and remain concerned about the difficulty of       detecting US-based threat actors and HVEs, especially lone       offenders, and the individualized nature of radicalization to       violence.'' The JIBs highlight a number of incidents,       including:        The Chabad of Poway attack in San Diego, CA, April 2019;        The Tree of Life synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh, PA,       October 2018--the most deadly attack on the US Jewish       community ever recorded;        The killing of two African- American patrons at a Kruger's       grocery store after failing to gain entrance to the       predominantly African-American First Baptist Church of       Jeffersontown, KY, October 2018;        The surveillance of the physical security measures by       alleged agents of the Government of Iran at the Chabad House       (synagogue), August 2018; and        The Bombing attack at the Dar AI-Farooq Islamic Center in       Bloomington, MN August 2017, among others.        Together, the FBI, DHS, and NCTC warn that the county must       remain vigilant in light of the enduring threat to faith-      based communities posed by domestic extremists, homegrown       violent extremists, and international terrorist       organizations. Unfortunately, the threat to Jewish communal       security emanates from across the entire ideological       spectrum.        For these reasons, The Jewish Federations of North America       endorses the ``Domestic Terrorism DATA Act,'' as an important       measure to assist policy makers, federal, state, and local       counterterrorism and law enforcement officials, and private       sector security partners to better and more effectively       deter, prevent, preempt, and respond to hate crime incidents       and domestic and international terrorist threats in the       United States. JFNA looks forward to working with you and       your staff to build bipartisan support for the bill.            Sincerely,                                                Robert B. Goldberg,      Senior Director, Legislative Affairs.                                   ____                                              The Jewish Federations                                                of North America,                                                      July 12, 2019.      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Mike Rogers,      Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Rogers: The       Jewish Federations of North America endorses H.R. 3106, the       ``Domestic Terrorism DATA Act.''        The markup of H.R. 3106 coincides with the United States       Secret Service's National Threat Assessment Center's release       of its second annual report on mass attacks in public spaces       The Secret Service studied 27 incidents where a total of 91       people were killed and 107 more injured in public spaces in       2018. Among the incidents: the fatal attack at the Tree of       Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh.        In introducing the report, Secret Service Director James M.       Murray wrote that each new tragedy, including the attack on a       synagogue in Poway, CA, ``serves as a reminder that we must       continue to research and provide robust training and       awareness to help prevent these tragic outcomes.'' The       report's findings underscore that research and information       sharing, communitywide, are essential to preventing attacks       directed at houses of worship, workplaces, schools, and other       public spaces, and concludes that threat assessment,       supported by leadership, collaboration, and information       sharing, are required to facilitate effective prevention.        In this context, the ``Domestic Terrorism DATA Act,'' is an       important and timely measure to assist policy makers,       federal, state, and local counterterrorism and law       enforcement officials, and private sector partners, such as       The Jewish Federations, to better and more effectively deter,       prevent, preempt, and respond to Domestic Terrorism. Through       the DATA Act, communitywide stakeholders will gain a better       understanding of the domestic terrorism threat landscape and       how best to allocate resources.        For these reasons, we urge bipartisan support for H.R.       3106, and respectfully urge the Committee to favorably report       the bill by voice vote and without objection.            Sincerely,                                                Robert B. Goldberg,      Senior Director, Legislative Affairs.                                   ____                                              Lawyers' Committee for                                          Civil Rights Under Law,                                                      June 19, 2019.      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson: On behalf of the National Lawyers'       Committee for Civil Rights Under Law (Lawyers' Committee), I       write to express our support for The Domestic Terrorism       Documentation and Analysis of Threats in America (Domestic       Terrorism DATA) Act.        Diverse communities across the country are targeted for       hate crimes and acts of mass violence. As the Lawyers'       Committee works to confront hate targeting communities, we       are faced with challenges from the federal government,       including the underreporting of hate crimes, and little       publicly available data on crimes that meet the definition of       domestic terrorism.        The Lawyers' Committee supports efforts to improve data       collection around hate crimes and domestic terrorism       investigations. During a time when communities have       experienced an increase in white supremacist violence, and a       time when the Federal Bureau of Investigation created the       ``Black Identity Extremist'' designation, it is imperative       that our policies are data driven, and that communities,       advocates, and lawmakers have access to data on domestic       terrorism investigations. The Domestic Terrorism DATA Act       would assist in fostering transparency and would facilitate       informed policy making.        As Kristen Clarke, President and Executive Director of the       National Lawyers' Committee testified at a House Judiciary       Committee Hearing on April 9th, we encourage the use of       existing laws to investigate and prosecute acts of hate       violence to the full extent of law, and to oppose efforts to       create new legislation that risk the further criminalization       of communities of color.        Chairman Thompson, your important efforts to improve data       collection around white supremacist violence is a necessary       step to address the crisis of violence targeting impacted       communities. The Domestic Terrorism DATA Act does so in a       manner that would improve data collection without risking the       further criminalization of communities of color, many of whom       have been targeted by counterterrorism policies in the past.        We applaud your leadership and look forward to working with       you.            Sincerely,                                                  Nadia N. Aziz,                             Interim Co-Director and Policy Counsel,      Stop Hate Project.                                   ____                                        Southern Poverty Law Center,                                     Montgomery, AL, June 10, 2019.      Chairman Bennie Thompson,      Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson: I write to extend the Southern       Poverty Law Center's full support for the chairman's recently       introduced H.R. 3106, the Domestic Terrorism Documentation       and Analysis of Threats in America Act (also known as the       Domestic Terrorism DATA Act). We believe the bill's goals of       fostering transparency surrounding domestic terrorism data       and increasing research on the issue are of paramount       importance. In testimony on June 4, 2019, before the       Subcommittee on Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, my       colleague Lecia Brooks included specific support for this       legislative effort in her remarks.        We fully agree with your comment that, ``There's an urgent       need for robust, centralized, and transparent Federal data to       inform counterterrorism policymaking--and Americans deserve       to know exactly how their government is allocating resources       to understanding and confronting the scourge of domestic       terrorism. At this critical time, Congress needs to lead on       the issue of domestic terrorism and direct Federal agencies       to prioritize efforts to counter these homeland security       threats.''        We believe this proposed legislation is an important step       toward countering the growing problem of white supremacist       terrorism in the United States and abroad. We thank  [[Page H8031]]       the chairman for taking this legislative initiative and offer       our assistance in this effort if it can be helpful in any       way.            Cordially,                                           Heidi Beirich, Ph.D.,                                     Director, Intelligence Project,                                       Southern Poverty Law Center.     Mr. Speaker, put simply, H.R. 3106 is a  commonsense bill that will improve transparency into a growing homeland  security threat.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this critical  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, September 19, 2019.      Hon. Bennie Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 3106, the ``Domestic Terrorism       DATA Act,'' that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction. I       appreciate your consulting with us on those provisions. The       Judiciary Committee has no objection to your including them       in the resolution for consideration on the House floor, and       to expedite that consideration is willing to forgo action on       H.R. 2106, with the understanding that we do not thereby       waive any future jurisdictional claim over those provisions       or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                 Washington, DC, September 18, 2019.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of           Representatives Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 3106, the ``Domestic Terrorism DATA Act.'' The Committee       on Homeland Security recognizes that the Committee on the       Judiciary has a jurisdictional interest in H.R. 3106, and I       appreciate your effort to allow this bill to be considered on       the House floor.        I concur with you that forgoing action on the bill does not       in any way prejudice the Committee on the Judiciary with       respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or       similar legislation in the future, and I would support your       effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House--Senate conference involving this       legislation.        I will include our letters on H.R. 3106 in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of this bill.       I look forward to working with you on this legislation and       other matters of great importance to this nation.            Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Correa).    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3106, the Domestic and  International Terrorism DATA Act was approved unanimously by the  Committee on Homeland Security. This show of unity demonstrates that  there is bipartisan support for ensuring that the American public has  data on domestic terrorism and Federal efforts to counter this threat.   Congress and the American people need transparency from the  government. We need to know about the domestic terrorism threats we  face and how the government is allocating resources to confront them.   Importantly, in addition to ensuring that such critical data is made  available, H.R. 3106 requires DHS to research the transnational aspect  of domestic terrorism. Increasingly, there is an awareness that white  supremacist extremists rarely act in a vacuum. From the United States  to New Zealand to Norway, networks of extremists inspire each other to  violence.   Further, the committee recently received testimony about the  similarities and the recruitment tactics utilized by white supremacist  extremists and ISIS. Both groups engaged in tactics that focused on  victimization and distrust of political leaders and public institutions  and heavily on propaganda that  [[Page H8032]]  emphasized themes of purity and militancy.   Mr. Speaker, I also thank the staff of our committee who worked on  this. Sandeep Prasanna, Jenna Hopkins, Charles Carithers, and Nicole  Tisdale made a yeoman's effort toward getting us to where we are today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3106 to ensure  greater transparency on this pressing and growing issue, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House  Resolution 577, I call up the bill (H.R. 3525) to amend the Homeland  Security Act of 2002 to direct the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and  Border Protection to establish uniform processes for medical screening  of individuals interdicted between ports of entry, and for other  purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3525, the U.S. Border Patrol Medical Screening  Standards Act, as amended, seeks to build on legislation passed by the  House in July to strengthen the medical care and attention provided to  migrants who cross our borders.   In July, in response to reports of inhumane conditions at our  southern border and the death of six children who had been in CBP  custody, the House approved a bill to require in-person medical  screening by licensed medical professionals for apprehended  individuals.   H.R. 3525 builds upon that measure by focusing on improving health  screening processes and recordkeeping within DHS. The bill authored by  the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Underwood) takes a two-pronged  approach.   First, it requires DHS to research innovative solutions for  deficiencies in the medical screening it conducts at the border. This  research is to be carried out in consultation with national medical  professional associations that have expertise in emergency medicine,  nursing, and pediatric care.   Importantly, in carrying out the research, DHS is directed to pay  particular attention to the screening of children, pregnant women, the  elderly, and other vulnerable populations.   Once completed, DHS is required to transmit to Congress information  on what actions the Department plans to take in response to the  research findings.                                time  1515    The second prong of H.R. 3525 is focused on driving DHS to improve  interoperability among components responsible for the care of  apprehended individuals. It does so by requiring DHS to set up an  electronic health records system to track health screening and care of  individuals in DHS custody. This system would create records that could  be accessed by all the relevant DHS components.   The benefits of such a system are unmistakable:   A migrant's medical information cannot get lost.   There will be a clear system to track when any followup medication or  medical attention is needed, ensuring cases will not fall through the  cracks.   It will also avoid duplication of medical services and time delays  due to lost or incomplete medical records.   As important, all the information gained from the initial medical  screening will follow the children and adults as they are transferred  to other DHS components.   Even though apprehension numbers have recently declined, we must take  the lessons learned from the poor handling of the recent migrant crisis  to heart and drive performance improvement within DHS.   H.R. 3525 represents a step in the right direction, and, as such, I  urge my colleagues to support the legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Underwood), sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Roybal-Allard), the chairwoman of the  House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Miss Rice), the chair of the Homeland  Security, Border Security, Facilitation, and Operations Subcommittee.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, six children have died in DHS  custody over the past year.   On Christmas Day in 2018, 8-year old Felipe Alonzo Gomez died in the  custody of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. He was the second child  that month to die in CBP custody. And after  [[Page H8035]]  his death, CBP implemented a new medical screening process for young  children in their care.   However, as we soon learned, this process was not adequate, because  four more children died in CBP custody from preventable illnesses and  substandard living conditions.   Even after these new screening processes were put in place, both CBP  personnel and their facilities along the southern border remained  completely ill-equipped for months. That is why this past July, the  House passed H.R. 3239, the Humanitarian Standards for Individuals in  Customs and Border Protection Custody Act.   This bill would require DHS to improve screening processes and  utilize professional medical staff. And it allocated other necessary  resources to conduct effective initial medical screenings for all  people in CBP custody.   Today, I am proud to support Congresswoman Underwood's effort to  build on that legislation.   I was honored that, in her first few months in office, Congresswoman  Underwood joined me on two separate trips to the southern border. She  drafted this bill as a direct result of what she witnessed on those  trips.   H.R. 3525 directs DHS to consult with medical experts to improve its  medical screening process and to finally establish an electronic health  record system for people in CBP custody.   DHS has always been on the cutting edge of innovation, leveraging the  latest in technological advances to fulfill its critical mission of  protecting our homeland. And I believe it is now vital that DHS use  that same approach when caring for the individuals and families in its  custody.   The Department has a long, successful history of working with the  private sector to achieve its counterterrorism, emergency response, and  cybersecurity goals.   This bill would require DHS to consult with national and medical  professional associations who have the expertise in emergency medicine,  nursing, pediatric care, and other relevant medical skills to make sure  that DHS is providing appropriate medical care to migrants in its  custody.   It specifically instructs DHS to research innovative approaches for  screening vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, the  elderly, and people with disabilities.   CBP is long overdue for an electronic health records system. In 2019,  there is no good reason why an agency under as much strain as CBP is  still using paper records. An electronic health record system would  improve CBP's internal operations and expedite coordination when  children and adults are transferred to other agencies.   I would hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle agree  that not one more child should die in the custody of the Federal  Government.   This bill should not be controversial. It is bipartisan; it offers  commonsense solutions; and it will help save lives.   I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 3525  today.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend  her remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Barragan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in the last year, six children have died after being in  CBP custody. This disheartening statistic demands our attention,  especially when you stop to think that, in the entire decade preceding  these deaths, not one child died in CBP custody.   Processes for the treatment of migrants crossing the border clearly  need to be improved. H.R. 3525 does that by forcing DHS to look at its  medical screening process and come up with ways to improve it and  address any performance gaps. It also helps move the Department's  recordkeeping into the 21st century.   H.R. 3525 is one step we can take to ensure that the money that DHS  is already spending on screening and caring for apprehended families  and children is done wisely.   And I might add, Mr. Speaker, all of us saw the conditions that  children were kept in along the border. You can't put children in  fences. You can't give people inadequate healthcare. You can't do those  things.   Most of us in this body are either parents or grandparents or we have  relatives who are. For us not to care about children is something that  America should never be proud of. We are a nation of values. Our values  have to say that children matter.   Ms. Underwood's bill clearly says that children in the custody of the  United States Government matter. Not only do they matter, but we have  to keep up with them; we should not lose them. If they are sick, we  need to have copies of their records accessible so that our  professionals who are tasked with the responsibility of taking care of  them actually know what is going on.   So I am clear about the bill. If my colleagues on the other side are  not interested in helping children and solving this problem that we  have along our borders, then that is too bad. Democrats are prepared to  work with them if they want to. If not, children do matter.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3525, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
