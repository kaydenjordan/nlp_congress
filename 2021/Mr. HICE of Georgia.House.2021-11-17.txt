 Madam Speaker, the House Democrats have done  this. It is all one big party. And while we are going to be celebrating  Thanksgiving next week, families gather together giving thanks, I am  absolutely confident there will not be one family in America giving  thanks for the economic crisis created by President Joe Biden and the  Democrats--the crisis, economically, that they are serving the American  people.   According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, this is going to be  the most expensive Thanksgiving in history. From turkey to potatoes,  pumpkin pie--you name it--this is going to be the most expensive  Thanksgiving ever; probably a whole lot fewer second trips for food, or  thirds, or whatever your family is accustomed to.   Meanwhile, what is the answer that our Democrat friends are giving  us? Democrats here in Washington have a great solution: Let's spend  trillions of more dollars. Let's make inflation go up even more. Let's  put more pain and suffering around the Thanksgiving tables and the  pocketbooks of the American people. While Americans are pinching their  pennies, literally, to live within their means, President Biden and his  socialist cronies from the other side of the aisle here in Washington  are wanting to spend even more of the hard-earned money of the American  taxpayer and the American worker.                                time  1715    The Democrat socialist gravy train has left the station, and the  American people, I assure you, are not at the table. They are not on  board with what is happening in this country.   Americans are the ones paying the price for this. They are paying the  price for President Biden's budget-busting policies--more money at the  gas pumps, more money at the Thanksgiving table this year, more money  for everyday goods. We can go down the list.   It is high time--it is past time--that President Biden and the  Democrats stop this reckless, runaway spending. Our economy cannot  afford trillions more dollars that we don't have for unnecessary  spending for socialist, Marxist spending, robbing us not only of our  hard-earned income but our liberties, our freedoms that we love and  cherish in this country.   It is time that we put a stop to this nonsense.
