 Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of National Human  Trafficking Awareness Month and the dedicated volunteers who work to  end modern-day slavery.   As a parent, there is nothing scarier than the thought of children  being removed from their families and trafficked.   Oftentimes, when we think about human trafficking, we envision  terrible situations across the globe, but according to the Texas  attorney general, there were more than 300,000 victims of human  trafficking just in Texas.   As we bring attention to this far-too-common tragedy, I thank some of  the incredible organizations in Collin County that work tirelessly to  help survivors. Traffick911, CASA of Collin County, Rescue Her,  Treasured Vessels, New Friends New Life, and the Collin County  Sheriff's Office are all helping lead the fight against human  trafficking.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to  join in thanking these organizations and recognizing the importance of  spreading awareness about human trafficking today and every day.                            ____________________
