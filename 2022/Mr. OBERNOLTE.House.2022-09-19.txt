 Madam Speaker, I thank the Member for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I stand deeply concerned today about the state of our  economy. Last week, the Department of Labor released the latest  statistics for inflation in the United States. It shows that inflation  continues to occur here at a rate above 8 percent, a 40-year high.   Even more alarmingly, the Department of Labor says that core  inflation has increased in August over the month of July and that real  wages have declined 3.4 percent on an annualized basis.   What that means is that my constituents cannot buy the same quantity  of the things that they need this year as they could last year, even if  they got a raise for the labor that they produced.   Madam Speaker, every single day I hear of constituents who are  desperate because of the results of this inflation. Imagine my  embarrassment when I have to tell them that inflation was caused by  actions of their own Federal Government. Economists already answered  why we are experiencing this inflation. It is a combination of several  things.                                time  2100    As our economy emerges from the pandemic, there has been an increased  demand for goods and services, and a constrained supply chain which  restricts our ability to respond to that increased demand. An economist  will say that will make prices go up.   The other thing that has occurred is that this Federal Government has  dumped almost $5 trillion of excess government spending into our  economy over the last 18 months--$5 trillion. To give you an idea of  how big that number is in context, normally our Federal Government only  spends about $5 trillion in a given year. So we are increasing  government spending by a rate of almost double that of the normal rate.  Madam Speaker, when that occurs, you put even more pressure on goods  and services, and that causes prices to increase further.   Earlier this year, the San Francisco branch of the Federal Reserve  Bank wondered why inflation was so much worse here in the United States  than that experienced by other countries, particularly in Europe. They  did a study and several months ago they released the results of this  study, and their findings were stark. They said that deficit government  spending is at the root cause of why inflation is so much worse here in  the United States than it is in other countries.   Madam Speaker, when the actions of government result in people paying  more--that is called a tax. Inflation in the United States represents  an unseen tax paid by every single American family. Unfortunately, this  is a tax that is borne disproportionately by those who can least afford  to pay it--the impoverished and the working poor in this country.   I have an even deeper concern this evening, Madam Speaker. Several  weeks ago the Congressional Budget Office released their long-term  fiscal forecast in which they analyze the finances of the United States  over the next 30 years. They do this every year, and Congress, frankly,  never pays attention. Madam Speaker, Congress and  [[Page H7961]]  the American people need to start paying attention to what the CBO has  to say.   The CBO says that our current national debt stands at over $30  trillion. If you do the math, that is over $90,000 for every single  American man, woman, and child--over $90,000 each--and that is today.   The CBO says that right now our Federal Government runs a deficit of  about 30 percent of all Federal spending. That represents about 4  percent of our gross domestic product. At the end of the forecast  period, the CBO says that our deficit will nearly triple to 11 percent  of our GDP.   At that time, just paying interest on the national debt will eclipse  all of our Federal spending on Social Security. It will eclipse all of  our Federal spending on Medicare. In fact, it will become the single  largest expenditure of Federal Government, requiring over half of all  Federal tax revenue to pay--over half. That is under the current fiscal  conditions.   Ironically, the Federal Reserve Bank is being forced to raise  interest rates as a result of the inflation that this Federal  Government has caused. Every time the Fed takes the action that they  are likely to take this week in raising the discount rate by three- quarters of a point, it increases the cost of our interest payments on  our national debt by $180 billion a year, which makes the problem even  worse.   In fact, the CBO says that if the Federal Reserve is forced to raise  interest rates by 3 percentage points--and we know that they have  already gotten to about halfway there--that by the end of their  forecast period, just paying interest on the national debt will consume  over 100 percent of Federal tax revenues.   In other words, Madam Speaker, we won't even have enough money to pay  the interest on the debt that we have rung up. That is unacceptable.  This should be something that everyone in this Chamber is talking about  because what the CBO says is that sometime in the next 30 years there  will come a day of reckoning. The sooner it comes, the less painful it  will be. It will be painful no matter what we do, but if we wait it  will be extremely painful.   Madam Speaker, we must get our fiscal house in order. The only way to  solve this problem is to reduce our habit of deficit spending. Now, I  know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle like to say this is  an easily solved problem. The problem is that we don't tax Americans  enough. Well, the CBO had an answer to that, too.   They said that over the next 30 years, in their forecast period,  average Federal tax revenues will be over 18 percent. That is a  substantial increase over the current Federal tax revenue over the last  50 years. In other words, Madam Speaker, what we have is not a revenue  problem, we have a spending problem. The only way we can get this  problem under control is to reduce our Federal spending and control our  deficit.   Madam Speaker, almost every year in this Chamber multiple bills are  introduced attempting to impose a balanced budget requirement-- sometimes within our House rules, sometimes within our Federal  Constitution. I, myself, introduced a balance budget amendment last  year in this Chamber.   We try to do it in a responsible way that won't disrupt the economy.  We do it over a 5-year phase-in period. We allow for periods of fiscal  emergency to be declared in which the President, with the concurrence  of Congress, can override the requirement that the Federal budget be  balanced in times of warfare and times of economic crisis.   Madam Speaker, we must pay attention to this problem. We must balance  our Federal budget. If we do not, not only us but our children will pay  the terrible consequence.
