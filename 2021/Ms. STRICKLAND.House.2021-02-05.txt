 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my  amendment, which requires the Office of Apprenticeship to use best  practices to recruit and retain nontraditional candidates.   In 2019, only 9 percent of the 280,000 apprentices surveyed by the  Department of Labor were women. Merely 16 percent were non-White. In a  country where nearly half the labor market is made up of women and one- quarter are people of color, our training programs--often debt-free  pathways into good-paying jobs--must include the full diversity of our  Nation.   My amendment addresses this problem by ensuring that apprenticeship  programs have ample resources to effectively recruit and retain  nontraditional candidates. But we can't sop there. We must continue to  uplift all communities in the South Sound, my home, and across the  Nation by equitably supporting women and people of color pursuing the  American Dream. Everyone deserves access to economic opportunity and  stability.   Madam Speaker, I urge the adoption of this amendment and the  underlying bill.
