 Mr. President, in recognition of National POW/MIA  Recognition Day, today I wish to call attention to the importance of  maintaining focus on efforts to bring home America's prisoners of war,  POWs, and missing in action, MIA. Let us join in honoring America's  servicemembers, including those who have yet to make it home, and  recognizing the enduring service of military families who watch and  wait for the return of their loved ones.   We must continue to seek answers until all American servicemembers  are home. Many American families have waited decades for resolution  about the fate of their loved ones who went missing while serving our  Nation. I commend those who are working to bring America's  servicemembers home and who keep a spotlight on the service of those  who remain missing. Idahoans, including members of the POW*MIA  Awareness Rally Corp., raise awareness about the continued need to  return our missing servicemembers, holding annual rallies and other  events to keep a spotlight on the service of those who remain missing  and the need for answers for their families. Their efforts are greatly  valued in helping to ensure that the return of American servicemembers  is prioritized.   The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency reports that more than 360  Idahoans are among those who have not yet been recovered following  their service in World War II, the Korean war, and the Vietnam war.  Their service and return must be ever fixed in our national attention.  My prayers are with their families and friends that they may experience  the long-awaited return of their loved ones. We cannot let up in the  search. As Americans, it is our duty to bring home those who have given  so much for us.                            ____________________     Mr. President, my colleague Senator Jim Risch joins  me today in honoring the city of Cascade, ID, in its 100th year since  its incorporation.   One hundred years ago, Cascade got its start as a prime location  along the railroad tracks that crossed Valley County, ID, and developed  into the county seat. Cascade became a central place for transporting  the timber harvested nearby to area sawmills and a hub for mining. Like  its neighbors in other parts of Valley County, Cascade has faced booms  and downturns in the logging, mining, and agriculture sectors, with  resilience and ingenuity. The beauty of the local landscapes and  natural resources continue to attract recreation and other outdoor  activities to this picturesque community, and residents embody the  industriousness and warmth at the heart of the community and its  historical roots. Cascade's chamber of commerce aptly highlights  Cascade's ``scenic beauty, fresh mountain air, warm friendly people and  unlimited recreational activities.'' It is truly a treasure of our  great State.   Congratulations to the residents of Cascade on 100 years of  accomplishments in developing Cascade that is a wonderful home and  destination to so many. We wish you well as you continue to work for  the advancement of this great community and its residents.                            ____________________
