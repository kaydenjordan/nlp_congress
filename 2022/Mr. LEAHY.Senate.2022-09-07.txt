 Madam President, in my home State of Vermont, where there  are more cows then people, the local dairy industry is the bedrock of  our communities. From Derby to Pownal, small dairy farms provide honest  jobs and produce fine dairy products sought after by Michelin Star  restaurants across the country. These farms also provide the beautiful  backdrop of green pastures, grazing livestock, and the iconic bright  red barns that attract hundreds of thousands of visitors to our picture  perfect little State every year.   Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, consolidation within the  agriculture industry, falling milk prices, supply chain delays, and the  rising costs of equipment and other goods, small dairy farms have been  hit hard. These difficulties, both longstanding and recent, continue to  lead some lifelong Vermont dairy farmers to move on to other careers or  to retirement, where they are often faced with the difficult decision  to either sell their business and livestock to large, industrial  factory farms, or undertake the difficult journey to find a local  farmer who can take on their business and beloved cows.   Today, I would like to highlight a piece of good news from the  Vermont small dairy industry, a story of how the retiring founder of  the most sought-after small-batch cultured butter operation in the  country found a graduate of the University of Vermont's animal science  program to continue a famous Vermont tradition. Together, Vermonters  Hilary and Ben Haigh, learning from Shoreham's own Diane St. Clair,  have continued a boutique butter business--yet another example of  Vermont perseverance, and the high-quality products coming Vermont's  small family farms, like the Animal Farm Creamery.   I ask unanimous consent that the June 10, 2022, New York Times  article titled ``America's Most Luxurious Butter Lives to Churn Another  Day'' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, June 10, 2022]         America's Most Luxurious Butter Lives To Churn Another Day                             (By Melissa Clark)         Shoreham, VT.--In a wooden barn perched on a grassy hill,       some of the most celebrated cows in the dairy business--the       bovine royal family of American fancy butter--sampled hay in       their new abode.        Diva, the bossiest of the group, hovered regally over the       shy, gentle Cinnamon. Lying down were Ruby and Lacy, who were       chewing cud over their folded forelegs. Rutabaga, May and       Patch ruminated impassively as Dell peed, effusively, in       greeting.        A few months earlier, in February, the herd's former owner,       Diane St. Clair, loaded them onto a trailer and drove them       seven miles down the road from her Animal Farm Creamery in       Orwell, Vt., to Rolling Bale Farm in Shoreham, a 100-acre       organic property nestled into a clearing about an hour south       of Burlington.        ``That was a hard day,'' Ms. St. Clair said. ``But there       was no way for me to continue.''        Ms. St. Clair had spent the previous 22 years making the       most sought-after small-batch cultured butter in the United       States. It's the same butter that the chef Thomas Keller       serves at the French Laundry and Per Se--and that retails for       an eye-popping $60 per pound.        But at 65, she was ready to retire. Decades of twice-daily       milking, barn mucking and hoisting 70-pound jugs of fresh       milk into the butter churn had taken a toll on her back. Her       husband, Al Clarisse, a large-animal veterinarian who was her       only helper, had developed knee problems. And although her       heart still clung to her cherished Jersey cows (her ``other       family,'' as she called them), her creative urges had shifted       from butter to a new, more sedentary, but just as aromatic,       passion: blending exclusive perfumes.        The question was, would she be able to find the right       people to take on her treasured herd and her churn? Or would       her extraordinary butter, with its subtle nutty, grassy       flavors that changed with the seasons, simply disappear?        For many small dairies in Vermont, retirement can be a       heartbreaking matter of selling off cows and equipment to       large agribusinesses and calling it quits. In 1969, Vermont       had 4,017 dairy farms, most of them small, family-run       operations. By 2020, that number had dropped by 84 percent to       636, with many having consolidated to benefit from economies       of scale.        Even at farms where the next generation wants to step up,       dairy farmers are finding it increasingly difficult to make a       living. A national oversupply of milk, made worse during the       pandemic, brought down prices to the point where it may no       longer make financial sense to keep going.        All of this has caused the demise of many beloved farms and       dairy products, including the prizewinning cheeses from Orb       Weaver Creamery, whose owners spent years trying to pass on       their dairy to young cheesemakers before finally having to       sell off their last cow and close down. This was something       Ms. St. Clair intended to prevent: Keeping her business       intact and her bovine ``other family'' together--and far from       any industrial mega-farms--was her top priority.        ``I wanted my cows to go to a farm that would treat them       like I did, with people who would know their names, and who       would name their calves,'' she said.        Happily, Ms. St. Clair's story is a rare piece of good news       in the world of small dairies. It's an example of how one       single-minded, cow-loving farmer was able to create a market       for the kind of handmade cultured butter that had nearly gone       extinct in the United States. Then, through a combination of       resolve and serendipity, she was able to pass that business       to a young family with exactly the right kind of grit,       experience and disposition to carry it on. And they happened       to live just down the road.        Building a Better Butter        ``I wanted my cows to go to a farm that would treat them       like I did, with people who would know their names, and who       would name their calves,'' she said.        Happily, Ms. St. Clair's story is a rare piece of good news       in the world of small dairies. It's an example of how one       single-minded, cow-loving farmer was able to create a market       for the kind of handmade cultured butter that had nearly gone       extinct in the United States.

And they happened       to live just down the road.        When Ms. St. Clair started Animal Farm in 1999, she knew       she wanted to raise Jersey cows. With them came a seemingly       endless river of milk that needed a purpose.        ``Everyone else in Vermont was doing cheese,'' Ms. St.       Clair said, ``I saw a niche with butter.'' Specifically, the       kind of tangy, high-fat, marigold-colored butter she'd eaten       in Europe, for which the ultra-creamy milk her Jersey cows       produced was perfectly suited. (Most dairy cows in the United       States are Holsteins, which yield a larger quantity of milk       with a lower fat content.) Back then, no one she knew in the       United States was making small batches of European-style       butter from their own cows, and there were no guidelines for       how to do it. The nearby Vermont Creamery had started making       European-style butter a year earlier, in 1998, but from       purchased milk, which, like making wine from purchased       grapes, puts the agricultural part of the equation out of the       producer's control.        Besides, Ms. St. Clair said, ``I was in it for the cows.''        Relying on out-of-print dairy manuals from the 19th       century, she eventually figured out that culturing the cream       before churning it, a process also called clabbering, vastly       improved both the taste and the texture, making the end       result thicker and more pliant, and adding a pleasing       nuttiness.        Culturing is a standard practice for premium butter in       Europe, and it was in the United States as well before the       widespread industrialization of the dairy industry shifted to       uncultured ``sweet'' butter, those pale, bland sticks in the       supermarket, because it was faster and cheaper to produce at       scale. (The intense labor involved in producing small       quantities of handmade butter from Ms. St. Clair's own Jersey       cows, along with high demand from luxury restaurants,       accounts for the extravagant price tag.)        Once Ms. St. Clair was satisfied with her experiments, she       overnighted a sampler 3,000 miles away to a famous chef she'd       never met, along with a handwritten letter requesting his       feedback. Thomas Keller remembered the moment well.        ``Diane sent me five little knobs of misshapen butter in a       Ziploc bag,'' he said. ``I called her immediately and said,       `How much do you make? We'll buy it all.' ''        Eventually, she built a small dairy near the barn, brought       in a few more Jersey cows and, still working mostly by       herself and by hand, increased production to 100 pounds of       butter per week and the plush, lightly sour buttermilk that       was its byproduct.        This was the business she had needed to sell. Ben and       Hilary Haigh, both 33, of Rolling Bale Farm turned out to be       the ideal buyers.                    Greener Pastures for a Cherished Herd         Hilary Haigh has always been ``a little obsessed with       butter,'' she said.        When she was studying animal science at the University of       Vermont, her brother gave her a countertop butter churn,       which she used for years before switching to a food processor       when she and Ben married.        The couple met, coincidentally, at Animal Farm when they       were both in college. Ms. Haigh, who grew up on a nearby       farm, was cow- and house-sitting for Ms. St. Clair. Mr. Haigh       was helping his uncle build the dairy's roof.        The two started Rolling Bale Farm in 2014, raising pastured       beef, chicken and lamb to sell at the local farmers' market.       They also kept a family cow to provide plenty of milk to       drink and to feed Ms. Haigh's churn.  [[Page S4469]]         Having a microdairy like Ms. St. Clair's was a dream, Ms.       Haigh said, ``it just happened sooner than we anticipated.''        When she and Mr. Haigh heard that Ms. St. Clair was looking       for buyers, they sent her a handwritten letter expressing       their interest.        It reminded Ms. St. Clair of the letter she'd sent Mr.       Keller all those years ago. ``Who sends letters anymore?''       Ms. St. Clair said. ``It's like it's all come full circle.''        After piecing together two loans and a grant to come up       with the $281,000 necessary to buy the business and install a       dairy at Rolling Bale Farm, the Haighs took over Animal Farm       Creamery in January. (Ms. St. Clair wanted to retire on her       farm, so the business and cows were sold, but not her       property.)        Now, several times every week, Ms. Haigh makes butter and       buttermilk exactly as Ms. St. Clair taught her: by hand, by       herself, in a dairy built on the same pasture where the       Haighs' herd grazes, but with the addition of her two young       sons tumbling underfoot, eating as much butter and cream as       they can get their small hands on.        Then, once a week, she ships the butter to the same six       accounts that Ms. St. Clair had long supplied: Thomas Keller,       the Inn at Little Washington in Virginia, Menton in Boston,       Ocean House in Rhode Island, Dedalus Wine Shop and Market in       Vermont, and Saxelby Cheesemongers in New York.        So far, Ms. Haigh said, none of the accounts seemed to       notice the change of hands. Benoit Breal, an owner of Saxelby       Cheesemongers, said the transition had been ``100 percent       seamless.''        ``The quality is the same,'' he said, ``it's still the       quintessential artisanal butter. There's no one else doing it       like that.''        For her part, Ms. St. Clair misses her cows. But she's       happy to have the time to immerse herself in orris root,       ylang-ylang and the other heady tools of perfumery needed for       St. Clair Scents.        And Diva, Cinnamon, Dell and the rest of the herd seem to       have fully adapted to their new home. ``Ben and Hilary love       their animals; they're good farmers,'' Ms. St. Clair said.       ``Now when I go to visit the cows, they're like, `Oh, hi,       Diane.' ''        She paused and added, a little wistfully, ``They're doing       fine without me.''                            ____________________     Madam President, I have been honored that Vermonters have  sent me here to the U.S. Senate to represent them for many years. In  turn, I always welcome the opportunity to recognize the commitments,  achievements, and successes of Vermonters and the industries found in  the Green Mountain State. Today, I want to highlight the granite center  of the world--not Italy, China, or Brazil--but Barre, a small town of  just over 8,500 year-round residents nestled among the Green Mountains  in central Vermont.   It was 350 million years ago when geologic processes created a unique  granite formation 10 miles deep, 4 miles long, and 2 miles wide in the  heart of present-day Barre. This extraordinary formation is now home to  the world's largest deep-hole granite quarry that produces a form of  granite called ``Barre Gray.'' Known around the world as the finest  quality gray granite on the market, Barre Gray has been an economic  engine and tourist attraction in central Vermont since the first quarry  opened in the 19th century. Barre Gray is renowned by fine architects,  builders, and sculpture artists in every corner of the world and is  just another example of the exports coming from Vermont and extracted  by Vermonters.   The granite industry in Barre has brought jobs and economic  opportunity to thousands of Vermonters over the years, including many  immigrants. Like my grandparents, many people came to Vermont from  Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries in search of a better life.  Through a combination of hard work, skill, luck, and the geologic  processes that created Barre Gray 350 million years ago, many Scottish,  Irish, and Italian immigrants were able to build better lives for  themselves in Vermont working in the granite industry. Unfortunately,  many of the immigrants working in the Barre granite industry also died  in high numbers during the 1918 influenza pandemic. As many of the  Vermonters we tragically lost to COVID-19 are now laid to rest under  Barre Gray granite headstones, so too are many of those who worked the  Barre granite quarry over 100 years ago.   Today, the granite quarry and surrounding manufacturing facilities  employ more than 1,000 Vermonters who create the vast majority of the  granite used in headstones and memorials in the United States. The Rock  of Ages visitor center offers tours of the quarry and their 160,000- square-foot manufacturing facility, which in addition to the nearby  Vermont Granite Museum, attract more than 100,000 visitors per year.  These institutions also serve as important educational experiences for  classes of local school children who frequently take field trips to see  the geology taught in their textbooks take place in real life.   The granite industry and its history in Barre were profiled in a June  16, 2022, article published in the Washington Post. I ask unanimous  consent that the article titled, ``In Barre, Vt., granite is a way of  life--and beyond,'' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, June 16, 2022]            In Barre, Vt., Granite Is a Way of Life--and Beyond                            (By Walter Nicklin)         If one's final earthly travel destination is a graveyard,       then the penultimate stop might well be Barre, Vt., the self-      proclaimed ``granite center of the world.'' Here, in the       scenic foothills of the Green Mountains, are the quarries       that produce many of America's most sought-after tombstones.        Business is booming. The pandemic's ``excess mortality''       has meant increased demand for quality granite to be       quarried, then crafted into memorials. Moreover, as aging       baby boomers realize they won't live forever, they often       embrace their own mortality by purchasing ``pre-need       memorials.''        Even if you don't like the idea of picking your own       tombstone, Barre (pronounced ``Barry'') is worth a visit.       You'll gain an appreciation for what you may have previously       taken for granted, or simply preferred not to contemplate--      namely, gravestones. You'll learn about their fascinating       history, along with the remarkable industry and craft       required in creating them. Most fundamentally, you'll be       exposed to the geological story behind the sturdy stone that       carvers use to immortalize human transience.        Although small (population less than 10,000), Barre is easy       to find, just seven miles from the state capital of       Montpelier. Signage for Exit 6 on Interstate 89 lets you know       this is where the ``Granite Quarries'' are. You then might       drive along Quarry Street or Stone Road on your way to a       place called Graniteville. Along the way, you may pass the       Cornerstone Pub & Kitchen, spot fence posts made out of       granite and catch sight of what otherwise would be       unremarkable commercial signs, such as for lawyers' offices,       engraved in granite.        Granite, granite, everywhere--highlighting the town's       economic raison d'etre and the stone artistry of its       residents. In front of the public library stands a stone       statue of Charles Dickens's Mr. Pickwick. Another statue--of       the poet Robert Bums, next to the Vermont History Center--was       erected by the 19th-century Scottish masons who brought their       stonecutting skills to Barre. On the other side of town is       another, equally imposing statue personifying the Italian       stonemasons who also brought their skills to Barre.        The European immigrants brought with them a tradition of       organized labor, and Barre became the headquarters for the       Quarry Workers' International Union of North America. Still       standing on Granite Street is the old Socialist Labor Party       Hall, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in       2000.        Rock of Ages--not the hymn but a quarry company with a       visitor center of the same name--is perhaps Barre's single       biggest tourist draw, typically attracting more than 100,000       visitors annually. In the fall, when the leaves turn       colorful, attendance peaks. But in mid-May, on the very first       day it opened for the summer season, my wife, Pat, and I       were pleased to find not much of a crowd. In fact, ours       was one of only three cars in the caravan that Roger, the       tour guide, led from the visitor center to the huge Rock       of Ages excavation site called the E.L. Smith Quarry.       Still, Roger jotted on an index card the number of cars       and the number of occupants in each car, so he could be       sure that he could account for everyone at tour's end--      that no one had fallen and vanished into the massive hole       in the ground. Covering about 50 acres and almost 600 feet       deep, it lays claim to being the world's largest operating       deep-hole quarry for dimension stone. (Crushed stone--      gravel--is the product of other quarries.)        Now retired after having worked most of his life in the       quarry, Roger knew whereof he spoke. He explained that the       granite quarried here--known as ``Barre Gray''--is known       worldwide for its fine grain, even texture and superior       weather resistance. Its unique proportions of quartz and       feldspar (granite's main ingredients) make it especially hard       while also exceptionally receptive to intricate carving and       sculpting.        The granite was formed as intrusive igneous rock       approximately 350 million years ago. Called a pluton by       geologists, the Barre granite formation is calculated to be       four miles long, two miles wide and 10 miles deep. Based on       what had been extracted since the Barre quarries began       operation in the 19th century, Roger estimated that ``it       would take 4,500 years to extract all the granite.''        Perched on the quarry's edge was a chain-link fence to       prevent visitors like us from  [[Page S4470]]       falling in. I had seen many quarries over the years, but       nothing like this. As if guarding a precious artwork, the       fence barrier seemed to make the scene that much more       spectacular, even otherworldly. The quarry's sheer sides,       where blocks and slabs had been cut away, looked like a huge       canvas of abstract art, with oxidized water stains dripping       like paint. At the very bottom was a turquoise pool, this       seemingly out-of-place color created by granite sediments and       crystals in the water when slabs of rock are cut. Framing the       scene in the far distance, the distinctive outline of Camel's       Hump, Vermont's third-highest peak, punctuates the horizon.        About five miles away is the Vermont Granite Museum, housed       in a renovated manufacturing shed that dates from the tum of       the last century. Although massive (about 30,000 square       feet), it was called a ``shed'' for its open layout and       cathedral-like ceiling. Machinery to cut and move the granite       blocks was powered by a dam and turbines on the nearby       Stevens Branch of the Winooski River. A railroad spur,       leading directly to the shed, could then transport the       finished stonework. Today's visitors are transported back in       time through hands-on exhibits and collections of rock       specimens and old tools, even industrial rollers made of       granite.        Nearby Hope Cemetery showcases local granite and the       artistry it spawned. Established in 1895, the 65-acre,       parklike setting is a splendid example of the 19th-century       garden cemetery movement, which favored burials in rural,       nonsectarian settings. The coincident, ever-more-popular use       of granite for tombstones and memorials created an outdoor       museum of sculpture. The once-prevalent sandstone slates and       marble headstones proved much less enduring than granite.        I've been called a tombstone tourist for past pilgrimages       to the dead-celebrity-populated burial ground Pere Lachaise       in Paris and Cimitero Acattolico, the Roman cemetery where       the poet John Keats's gravestone famously reads, ``Here lies       One Whose Name was writ in Water.'' But you don't have to be       a melancholic taphophile to appreciate the artistry on       display in Hope Cemetery, such as a Pieta-like statue and       realistic representations of violins and airplanes. It's the       ``Uffizi of Necropolises,'' in the words of Vermont       folklorist Joseph A. Citro. All of the monuments are made of       Barre Gray, and virtually all have been sculpted by Barre       stonemasons--some for their own graves before they died.        For Pat and me, who had lost one old friend to covid-19, a       lone granite memorial in Hope Cemetery seemed especially       poignant. Erected on the centenary of the 1918 pandemic, it       commemorated the many Barre residents who had died of the       flu. They had suffered disproportionately because of their       existing silicosis (called stonecutters' disease) from       inhaling granite dust while working in unventilated sheds.        Our visit to Barre was not all about death and granite,       however. The trip easily included the Vermont fare of covered       bridges, village greens, white church spires and maple syrup.       Indeed, Pat insisted that we experience that quintessential       summertime taste of the Green Mountain State: a frosty       creemee. ``What's that?'' I asked. The delicious answer came       at the Morse Farm Maple Sugarworks: towering swirls of soft       ice cream, especially creamy, served in a cup or cone,       accented with a generous portion of maple syrup or straight       maple sugar.        As granite is hard and enduring, a creemee is soft and       ephemeral--a most harmonious balance.                            ____________________
