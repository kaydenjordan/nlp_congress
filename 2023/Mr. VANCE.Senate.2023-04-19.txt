 Madam President, reserving the right to object, I want to  talk about a few things here and why I am objecting to this nomination  and why I would not vote for it if and when it comes before the full  Senate.   First is a question of competence. This is an ambassador--Ambassador  Sullivan--who went to Ghana and said on local television that she was  proud of the fact that she had failed her Foreign Service exam twice.   It is hard to imagine a Chinese leader going to a country where they  were trying to develop diplomatic relationships and bragging about  failing any type of Foreign Service exam.   I don't know where this idea that we should celebrate failing the  Foreign Service exam amongst our diplomatic corps comes from, but it  doesn't make us look good, and it doesn't help Ambassador Sullivan in  her duties.   Now, a second problem, the last time we sent Ambassador Sullivan to a  senior job in Africa, her successor spent the following couple of  months apologizing for and cleaning up for the job that she had done.  In particular, she did so much to push a very, very divisive set of  ideas in an American political context on a foreign country that had  nothing to do with our national interests.   In particular, she seems particularly fond of the most leftwing  versions of transgender ideology. Now, let me just address this  particular issue.   I have my views on the transgender ideology question. In particular,  I really worry that we are going too far, too fast not in support of  the evidence, prescribing treatments and surgeries and hormonal  therapies that could damage children for years. I think we need to be  patient with this, and we need to follow the science.   This is why, by the way, most of our European allies--Sweden, for  example, a country hailed as a great example of good healthcare, 10  years ago, by many Democrats in this Chamber, is going in the opposite  direction of where we are going on the transgender ideology question.   Now, that said, I can accept that many people disagree with me. But  [[Page S1242]]  that disagreement in an American political context has no place for the  diplomatic corps of our country. We should not be taking something that  a majority of Americans disagree on and try to force it down the throat  of another country. And the fact that we engage in this cultural  imperialism is one of the biggest threats to American national security  in the world today.   Now, let's talk about this cultural imperialism, the fact that it is  unsupported and the fact that it is not good for our country.   We haven't had a real debate in this body. We have not had a  sufficient conversation about whether we want to support certain  ideological preferences in our diplomatic corps.   Why, for example, do we have a liberal White woman going to Africa  and telling them that they are not civilized enough when it comes to  issues of transgender ideology?   Why do we have a diplomatic corps that is taking a hotly contested  issue in an American political context and demanding that African  nations follow the lead of the far left instead of doing what they  think that they should do?   Now, there are going to be people who say that there are all manner  of atrocities that happen in Africa when it comes to sexual issues,  when it comes to gender minorities, and so forth, and, of course, we  think that is terrible, and we don't want that to happen. But she has  gone so much further than that in placing a very particular set of  ideas at the forefront of our diplomacy.   Let me just leave this body with one final thought. Look at the  demographics of the people who have fought and died in American wars  over the last generation. Many Democrats, of course, have done so, and  we honor their service and we honor the sacrifice of themselves and  their families. But a disproportionate share, especially of the  enlisted troops, who are at the forefront of American power--the threat  of military action and, sometimes, the reality of military action is  what gives the State Department so much power in the first place--the  knowledge that, if you don't follow America's lead, you can sometimes  have military and security consequences because of it.    Do we think that the thousands of Americans who have died in  America's wars in the last 20 or so years died so that the trans flag  would fly over the nation of Ghana or any other African nation?   And why is it the policy of this government, again, to take a  controversial topic in the context of an American political debate and  force it down the throats of somebody else?   This is damaging our national security. Larry Summers, an Obama  administration economist, a guy well respected on the left side of the  aisle, said, talking to some of his friends who work in development in  Africa, that when the Chinese come, they bring--let me get the exact  quote here because I don't want to mess it up:         What we get from China is an airport. What we get from the       United States is a lecture.    That is Larry Summers quoting somebody who does economic development  in troubled regions of the world. Why----    Can I finish the point, Senator Coons?    Here is what I would say here. The final point that I will  make is, we have built a foreign policy of hectoring and moralizing and  lecturing countries that don't want anything to do with this.   The Chinese have a foreign policy of building roads and bridges and  feeding poor people, and I think that we should pursue a foreign  policy, a diplomacy, of respect and a foreign policy that is not rooted  in moralizing; it is rooted in the national interests of this country.  Because Ambassador Sullivan is at the lead of moralizing instead of  pursuing America's national interests, I object.
