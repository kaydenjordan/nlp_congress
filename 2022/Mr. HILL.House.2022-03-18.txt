 Madam Speaker, inflation is a thief, and many of us believe  that the Federal Reserve is behind the curve in fighting that thief.   History is repeating itself, Madam Speaker, and Jay Powell is now  fighting and facing precisely what his predecessor Arthur Burns called  the ``anguish of central banking'' in 1979.   Sustained stagflation, high current inflation, growing high  inflationary expectations, and now a commodity shock, these are all of  the problems that Chair Burns faced in the 1970s.   While I welcome the Fed's action to shrink the balance sheet and  start with the 25 basis-point increase in short-term rate targets, this  process should have started in 2020. In my view, they should have been  more aggressive this week and supported a 50 basis-point increase in  short-term rates.   It is time for Congress to reassess and debate the central bank's  mandate. In my view, the Fed should have a single mandate focused on  containing inflation and keeping prices in check for Americans at the  pump, at the grocery store, and whenever they pull out their wallet.                            ____________________
