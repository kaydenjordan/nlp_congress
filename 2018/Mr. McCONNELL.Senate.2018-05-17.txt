 Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 847, Gina Haspel.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call for the cloture motion be waived.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, yesterday, the Intelligence Committee  took an important step toward confirming Gina Haspel to become the next  Director of the CIA. A bipartisan majority voted to report her  nomination favorably to the Senate. I look forward to promptly moving  to a confirmation vote.   The committee's confidence is indicative of the strength of Ms.  Haspel's testimony and her 30-plus-year record of CIA service.  Throughout the process, she demonstrated candor, integrity, and a  forthright approach to the committee's questions. She displayed the  talent and expertise that make her uniquely qualified to face America's  biggest national security challenges, whether in the area of  counterterrorism or renewed international competition among great  powers.   Out of the spotlight, whether at Langley or deployed abroad, Ms.  Haspel has quietly earned the respect and admiration of those who  matter most--the men and women of the CIA and distinguished current and  former intelligence community leaders.   The safety and security of the American people depend on capable  intelligence leadership. Gina Haspel is the  [[Page S2736]]  right woman at the right time. Senators on both sides of the aisle  agree. So I urge each of my colleagues to rise to the occasion and  swiftly confirm our next CIA Director.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, with Republican  policies shaking the regulatory rust off of the U.S. economy, American  job creators, entrepreneurs, and working families have been thinking  big again.   For 8 years, Democrats pushed a one-size-fits-all agenda that heaped  outsized benefits on the largest cities and left the rest of the  country struggling to catch up. Now Main Street businesses across  America feel the wind is at their backs. So they are expanding their  operations, buying more equipment, and hiring new workers.   For too long, taxpayers grappled with an outdated Federal Tax Code  that seemed to keep more of their hard-earned income every year. Now,  thanks to Republican tax reform, working families are seeing paychecks  grow, special bonuses hit their bank accounts, and will send thousands  of dollars less to the IRS next year.   Now that Congress and the President have put a stop to the last  administration's rampant, top-down Federal rulemaking, U.S.  manufacturing is churning back to life as well. The new economic  climate that is taking hold across the country has producers feeling  more confident about planting deeper roots right here in the United  States--new capital investment, new factories, new American jobs.   Novelis, a leading producer of rolled and recycled aluminum, broke  ground just this week on a new factory in Guthrie, KY. The company is  choosing the Commonwealth in which to build the 400,000-square-foot  facility and create at least 125 new jobs, and they are not keeping any  secrets about what is helping them make this investment. Here is a  quote: ``A favorable economic environment,'' including ``the  significant positive impact of tax reform in the U.S., reinforces  Novelis' decision to expand at this time.''   This is not just a Kentucky phenomenon. According to new survey data  from the National Association of Manufacturers, more than 93 percent of  U.S. manufacturing firms have a positive outlook. Already, 77 percent  of manufacturers are reporting hiring new workers, and 86 percent say  they are investing in plants and equipment.   Many American communities revolve around these manufacturing  facilities. Sadly, during the Obama years, they were among the most  likely to be left behind by the so-called ``recovery,'' but now that is  changing. Today, manufacturing wages are growing at their fastest pace  in 17 years. These are just a few signs of our Nation's economic  comeback under Republicans' pro-growth, pro-opportunity agenda.   Remember, not one of our Democratic colleagues voted with us to set  this train in motion--not one. They voted against cutting redtape for  American manufacturers. They voted against the tax reforms that are  growing paychecks and helping to create new jobs. They voted against  the newly lowered utility rates that benefit both families and  employers.   My Democratic colleagues like to talk about supporting the middle  class. These days, it is looking more and more like that is all it is-- just talk. Yet, while they occupy themselves with partisan politics,  Republicans will keep on clearing the tracks and letting the American  economy roll on ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now, speaking of tax reform, I have to  bid farewell to an outstanding member of my staff.   Brendan Dunn has been a key member of my leadership office team for  the last 6 years. He has made an outsized impact as a trusted counselor  and friend.   I, actually, stole Brendan from the Finance Committee in 2012. I am  not sure if Chairman Hatch ever quite forgave me for it. If you have  ever had the pleasure of witnessing Brendan in action, you will  understand why he is a sought-after commodity, whether you need deep  expertise on tax policy or the perfect movie quote for any occasion.   Brendan has been my trusted adviser on issues including tax policy,  banking, trade, and pensions. So I am just glad that his last few  months in the office could be a calm and laid-back period. All he had  to do was play a leading role in crafting generational tax reform and  help steer it across the finish line. Oh, then came Dodd-Frank reform,  for good measure.   This Maryland native holds degrees from Holy Cross, Fordham,  Georgetown, and Notre Dame, but you would not know that this unassuming  leader and reliable source of comic relief holds a J.D. and a Ph.D. in  political philosophy unless you needed to. That is the kind of guy  Brendan is.   His many contributions to my team have benefited this body, the  people of Kentucky, and the Nation. I know everyone who has gotten to  work closely with him is sad to see him depart the Senate. I certainly  am. Yet I have a hunch that his lovely wife, Lee, and his children-- Patrick, Audrey, and Mary--will not mind seeing a little bit more of  him.   So I offer Brendan my sincere thanks for a job very well done and  wish him Godspeed for what lies ahead.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 608.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.
