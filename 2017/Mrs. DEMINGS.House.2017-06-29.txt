 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?    I am opposed in its current form.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Mrs. Demings moves to recommit the bill H.R. 3003 to the       Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to report the       same back to the House forthwith with the following       amendment:        Page 6, insert after line 5 the following:        ``(7) Public safety exception.--For purposes of this       subsection, a State, or a political subdivision of a State,       shall not be found to be out of compliance with subsection       (a) or (b) if the State or political subdivision of the State       certifies to the Attorney General that such compliance would       endanger public safety.''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from  Florida is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill,  which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,  the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here today not just as a Member of Congress, but  as a 27-year veteran of law enforcement and as a former police chief.  As such, I am compelled to warn of the harm this bill, in its current  form, will cause for our law enforcement agencies.   As a police chief, it was my responsibility to reduce crime and  maintain livable neighborhoods; neighborhoods where families can live  in peace, and enjoy local parks, community centers, restaurants, and  shopping; neighborhoods where children can walk to school and play in  their front yard and backyard without fear.   That is the kind of community that everyone in America deserves--one  where they feel safe and secure.   H.R. 3003 impedes on law enforcement's ability to effectively do its  job. It will create an environment that will erode the trust between  law enforcement and the communities they serve.   The local police are the first ones to respond. They are the thin  blue line that stands between those who are in this country, who are  trying to live in peace, and those that would do them harm. We want our  neighbors--immigrants--to call the police to report crimes without fear  or hesitation. When they do not, Mr. Speaker, our community is at the  mercy of the criminals.   This does not make our communities more safe, yet that is what is at  stake with the bill before us. Supporters of the bill claim that it has  an exemption for victims and witnesses, but it is not a complete  exemption.   Law enforcement officers investigate and interview witnesses. Their  goal is to solve crimes, regardless of the immigration status of  victims and witnesses, including victims of sexual assault and domestic  violence.   I filed an amendment with the Rules Committee that would have  exempted victims and witnesses from all of the bill's intrusive  requirements. The Rules Committee blocked me from offering that  amendment, but the bill, in its current form, would undermine law  enforcement's ability to do its job, therefore, making our communities  less safe.   Mr. Speaker, don't just take my word for it. The National Fraternal  Order of Police stands against the bill. They represent over 330,000  law enforcement officers across the Nation. These officers are not  responsible for creating laws, and eliminating Federal grant funding  for political reasons impedes their ability to solve crimes.   As the FOP writes:         Withholding assistance to law enforcement agencies, which       have no policymaking rule, will hurt public safety efforts.    No one knows our communities better than the law enforcement  officials sworn to protect their communities, which is why I have  offered this motion which would exempt from the mandates and penalties  in the bill those jurisdictions in which local law enforcement  officials conclude that the mandates in this bill would endanger public  safety.   Politics should never impede public safety. The President has said  that, when lawmakers vote on this bill, they should put America's  safety first.   I strongly agree, and I urge my colleagues to support this motion and  put our public safety first.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________
