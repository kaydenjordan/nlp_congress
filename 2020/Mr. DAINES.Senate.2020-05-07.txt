 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing the Victory Sewers of Sanders County for volunteering their  time to support their community during the ongoing coronavirus  pandemic.   In the face of these challenging times, a group of nearly 45  Montanans in Sanders County have stepped up to sew gowns for the staff  of Fork Valley Hospital. Volunteers have also used leftover materials  to produce protective masks for our law enforcement and first  responders.   The group has made over 90 gowns and over 500 masks, which have been  distributed to clinics in Thompson Falls, Hot Springs, and to various  emergency service personnel across Sanders County. The Victory Sewers  are comprised of Montanans from Plains, Paradise, Thompson Falls, Trout  Creek, and Noxon.   It is my honor to recognize the Victory Sewers of Sanders County for  their efforts to support our healthcare heroes and those on the  frontlines of this pandemic. The compassion and commitment of these  extraordinary  [[Page S2323]]  Montanans are an inspiration to us all.                            ____________________
