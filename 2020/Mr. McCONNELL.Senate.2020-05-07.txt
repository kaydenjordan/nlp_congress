 Madam President, the United States is battling the  worst pandemic in 100 years. Our Nation has poured unprecedented  resources into defending Americans' health and blunting the damage to  our economy.   The Senate will continue to work on this front. We will find more  ways to keep strengthening our healthcare response and pivot the Nation  toward recovery. That will include strong legal protections to defend  healthcare workers, small businesses, and other institutions against  the trial lawyer feeding frenzy as they work hard to keep serving their  neighbors.                                     FISA    But, Madam President, amid the pandemic, we cannot lose sight of the  other threats we still face as well. The challenges that we faced  before COVID-19 began to spread from Wuhan, China, are still with us  today, alongside this awful virus. There are terror cells, hostile  foreign intelligence services, and adversaries all over the world who  would love nothing more than for the United States to apply social  distancing to our presence on the world stage as well.   Iran has not let popular unrest, a mismanaged economy, or COVID-19  slow their meddling, from Yemen to the Mediterranean. Tehran and its  proxies are undermining the sovereignty of Iraq and Lebanon, aiding and  abetting Assad's mass murder in Syria, sowing regional unrest,  threatening Israel, and targeting American troops and our interests.   A regime that chooses to spend its scant resources on exporting  violence or a so-called space program does not need relief from  sanctions. We must maintain the measure of deterrence we restored with  the decisive strike on Soleimani. That starts today with upholding the  President's rightful veto of a misguided War Powers Resolution.   Meanwhile, in apparent repudiation of the Trump administration's  efforts to help end the civil war in Afghanistan, Taliban attacks  against the country's government and its people have actually spiked.  ISIS, al-Qaida, and Haqqani terrorists continue to operate from Afghan  territory.   Over in Moscow, Putin's regime continues to threaten American  interests along with international security--from bullying incursions  in the free states it used to rule, to influence-peddling and mercenary  adventurism in the power vacuums of Syria and Libya, to spreading  disinformation and undermining democracies all across the globe.   Russian intelligence is not alone in targeting America. China's  efforts to steal government industry secrets are unmatched.   Countering these kinds of hostile activities is a key job of our  intelligence community, and so is stopping terrorist attacks against  our homeland.   So next week, the Senate will turn back to reauthorizing the critical  authorities in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The House- passed legislation we will take up is not a blanket reauthorization of  FISA; it is a careful update designed to provide greater accountability  for the way these authorities are exercised. It will increase  transparency in the FISA process and respond to the shameful abuses of  2016 while preserving the toolbox that professionals use to defend us.  I hope the Senate will pass it next week, free of amendments that would  jeopardize important tools to keep America safe.                                    China    Madam President, there is the matter of the People's Republic of  China. This coronavirus pandemic originated in China. Whether the virus  escaped from a lab or was transmitted at a so-called wet market, we do  not yet know for sure, but China's Communist Party leaders probably do  know, and they owe it to all the nations suffering from this virus to  be truthful and to be transparent. The world deserves the facts--all of  the facts.   Here is one fact we do know: The virus spread was exacerbated by  China's unconscionable efforts to cover it up. The Communist Party  reprimanded and threatened to jail Dr. Li Wenliang, the heroic  whistleblower who tried to warn the world about COVID-19 and later died  from it. Within hours of his death, by the way, a wave of outrage over  CCP's treatment of Dr. Li spread on Chinese social media until the  government censored that as well.   At the peak of the outbreak, the Chinese Communist Party was  reportedly welding its own people inside their own houses. And today,  you better believe the party commissars are training their sights on  the Chinese survivors, activists, and lawyers who dare to seek the  truth.   Outside the borders, China's leaders seem to think they could either  charm, cajole, or threaten the world into submission. They supposedly  donated medical supplies to foreign countries that quickly proved  faulty and unusable. They threatened to boycott Australian beef. They  even threatened to cut off pharmaceutical exports to the United States  so that we would be ``plunged into the mighty sea of coronavirus.''   It is galling but not surprising. This is the same authoritarian  regime that brutalized the Uighur people in modern-day gulags and that  has spent years cheating its way through international commerce and  stealing industrial secrets.   Now it is exploiting the global pandemic it helped exacerbate to  further its crackdown on Hong Kong. A few weeks ago, the government  arrested peaceful democracy activists, including my old friend of  almost three decades, Martin Lee. I suppose they thought the rest of  the world might be too distracted to notice. They were mistaken.   Alongside our friends and partners around the world, the United  States is going to be asking tough questions about our relationship  with the Chinese Communist Party.   I expect the Senate will soon look to pass Senator Rubio's Uyghur  Human Rights Policy Act, a bipartisan bill that will bring more  attention to the plight of this mistreated minority and urge the  President to use targeted sanctions against those responsible for the  repression.   While we and our allies already saw the risks from letting critical  supply chains become too dependent on China, the Chinese Communist  Party's recent behavior has certainly hammered this home. I am  confident that we here in Washington will be examining these strategic  vulnerabilities as well.   We will be looking for the best ways to strengthen our dynamic and  innovative private sector, keep America on the cutting edge, and work  closely with friends who share our values and interests to build a  fairer, more resilient international market.   Notice that China is not retrenching or drawing back within its  borders--quite the opposite.   So if we want to preserve a world built on our democratic values and  principles, if we want to protect American workers, American interests,  and American national security, all of these things will take more  global leadership and more coordination with our allies, not less.   Tomorrow, May 8, is the 75th anniversary of VE Day. If we ever needed  a reminder that American strength is a force for good in the world,  there it is. Thanks to the tireless work of our colleague, Senator Pat  Roberts, tomorrow was meant to be the dedication of the new Eisenhower  Memorial. It has been postponed due to the virus. It almost seems  fitting that 75 years after World War II, the celebration of President  Eisenhower would be delayed by a global crisis that will take American  strength and American leadership to resolve. He certainly knew  something about that kind of situation.   Now, as then, the American people do not want to retreat from the  world, and they do not want to see us slide into second place. They  want us to be smart and strong and safe, and they want the United  States of America to lead.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
