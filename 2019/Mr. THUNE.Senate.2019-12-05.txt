There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2990         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Freedom from Government       Competition Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Private sector business concerns, which are free to       respond to the private or public demands of the marketplace,       constitute the strength of the United States economic system.        (2) Competitive private enterprises are the most       productive, efficient, and effective sources of goods and       services.        (3) Unfair Government competition with the private sector       of the economy is detrimental to the United States economic       system.        (4) Unfair Government competition with the private sector       of the economy is at an unacceptably high level, both in       scope and in dollar volume.        (5) Current law and policy have failed to address       adequately the problem of unfair Government competition with       the private sector of the economy.        (6) It is in the public interest that the Federal       Government establish a consistent policy to rely on the       private sector of the economy to provide goods and services       necessary for or beneficial to the operation and management       of Federal agencies and to avoid unfair Government       competition with the private sector of the economy.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act, the term ``agency'' means--        (1) an executive department as defined by section 101 of       title 5, United States Code;        (2) a military department as defined by section 102 of such       title; and        (3) an independent establishment as defined by section       104(l) of such title.       SEC. 4. PROCUREMENT FROM PRIVATE SOURCES.         (a) Policy.--In the process of governing, the Federal       Government should not compete with its citizens. The       competitive enterprise system, characterized by individual       freedom and initiative, is the primary source of national       economic strength. In recognition of this principle, it has       been and continues to be the general policy of the Federal       Government--        (1) to rely on commercial sources to supply the products       and services the Government needs;        (2) to refrain from providing a product or service if the       product or service can be procured more economically from a       commercial source; and        (3) to utilize Federal employees to perform inherently       governmental functions (as that term is defined in section 5       of the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act of 1998       (Public Law 105-270; 112 Stat. 2384)).        (b) General Rule.--Except as provided in subsection (c) and       notwithstanding any other provision of law, each agency shall       obtain all goods and services necessary for or beneficial to       the accomplishment of its authorized functions by procurement       from private sources.        (c) Exemptions.--Subsection (b) shall not apply to an       agency with respect to goods or services if--        (1) the goods or services are required by law to be       produced or performed, respectively, by the agency; or        (2) the head of the agency determines and certifies to       Congress in accordance with regulations promulgated by the       Director of the Office of Management and Budget that--        (A) Federal Government production, manufacture, or       provision of a good or service is necessary for the national       defense or homeland security;        (B) a good or service is so critical to the mission of the       agency or so inherently governmental in nature that it is in       the public interest to require production or performance,       respectively, by Government employees; or        (C) there is no private source capable of providing the       good or service.        (d) Method of Procurement.--The provision of goods and       services not exempt under subsection (c) shall be performed       by an entity in the private sector through--        (1) the divestiture of Federal involvement in the provision       of a good or service;        (2) the award of a contract to an entity in the private       sector, using competitive procedures, as defined in section       152 of title 41, United States Code, and section 2302 of       title 10, United States Code; or        (3) conducting a public-private competitive sourcing       analysis in accordance with the procedures established by the       Office of Management and Budget and determining that using       the assets, facilities, and performance of the private sector       is in the best interest of the United States and that       production or performance, respectively, by the private       sector provides the best value to the taxpayer.        (e) Contracted Activities.--The head of an agency may       utilize Federal employees to provide goods or services       previously provided by an entity in the private sector upon       completion of a public-private competitive sourcing analysis       described in subsection (d)(3), and after making a       determination that the provision of such goods or services by       Federal employees provides the best value to the taxpayer.  [[Page S6894]]         (f) Regulations.--The Director of the Office of Management       and Budget shall promulgate such regulations as the Director       considers necessary to carry out this section. In       promulgating such regulations, the Director shall assure that       any State or territory, or political subdivision of a State       or territory, complies with the policy and implements the       requirements of this section when expending Federal funds.       SEC. 5. STUDY AND REPORT.         The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, after       consultation with the Comptroller General of the United       States, shall carry out a study to evaluate the activities       carried out in each agency, including those identified as       commercial and inherently governmental in nature in the       inventory prepared pursuant to the Federal Activities       Inventory Reform Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-270; 31 U.S.C.       501 note) and shall transmit a report to the Congress prior       to June 30 of each year. The report shall include--        (1) an evaluation of the justification for exempting       activities pursuant to section 4(c); and        (2) a schedule for the transfer of commercial activities to       the private sector, pursuant to section 4(d), to be completed       within 5 years after the date on which such report is       transmitted to the Congress.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
