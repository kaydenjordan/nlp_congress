 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand  a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground  that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum  is not present.    Mr. Speaker, it has been the honor of my life to  serve in Congress.   Today, I am reminded of why I came here in the first place. Thomas  Jefferson said it quite well: ``We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their  Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life,  Liberty, and the Pursuit of happiness . . . Governments''--that would  be us--``are instituted among Men'' to secure those rights.   Mr. Speaker, that is our mission statement: Congress is the protector  of freedom and liberty. Congress must make sure that the bell of  Liberty rings loudly and strongly, for the American bright star is the  beaming beacon of hope: the hope that all oppressed peoples yearn to  possess.   So, in my final words as a Member of Congress in this House of  Representatives, Congress must hold fast to these truths: that in God  we must trust and be faithful servants of the sacred constitutional  principles of freedom of religion, speech, press, and assembly, for  this is our eternal duty.   Happy trails.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
