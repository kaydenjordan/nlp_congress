 Madam President, this month, many of us are celebrating  Pride Month and reaffirming the rights and freedoms of the LGBTQ  community. We also celebrated the fight for equal rights for women with  the 100th anniversary of the passage and ratification of the 19th  Amendment, which gave women the right to vote.   But instead of celebrating these rights and freedoms, here is what  Senate Republicans have in store for us. This week, they will confirm a  Federal judge to a lifetime appointment who has devoted his career to  advocating against the rights of LGBTQ people and women under the guise  of religious liberty.   Through his actions as a lawyer and private citizen, Matthew  Kacsmaryk, the nominee for the Northern District of Texas, has made his  hostility towards LGBTQ individuals, marriage equality, and  reproductive rights clear.   As deputy general counsel for the First Liberty Institute, Kacsmaryk  urged the Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges to rule that there is  no nationwide right to same-sex marriage. After the Supreme Court  disagreed with him, Kacsmaryk wrote an article criticizing not only  Obergefell, but also the Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. He argued  that the fight for marriage equality and reproductive rights were ``  `radical' . . . demands'' of the ``Sexual Revolution.'' In his view,  this Sexual Revolution ``sought public affirmation of the lie that the  human person is an autonomous blob of Silly Putty unconstrained by  nature or biology, and that marriage, sexuality, gender identity, and  even the unborn child must yield to the erotic desires of liberated  adults.''   As a lawyer, Kacsmaryk advocated for employers who objected to  providing contraceptive coverage as part of the healthcare required  under the Affordable Care Act on religious grounds. Outside of the  courtroom, he continued his advocacy against reproductive rights. In a  2016 interview, he complained about ``imposition of a secular judgment  on an essentially sacred question'' in the contraceptive mandate cases.  He pointed to the First Amendment concerns of religious actors while  failing to mention that the use of contraception is constitutionally  protected.   Kacsmaryk also urged the Supreme Court to allow a Virginia school  board to require students to use the restroom corresponding to their  ``biological gender'' and a State labor and industry board in Oregon to  let a bakery refuse to make same-sex wedding cakes. It is no wonder  that more than 200 groups oppose his nomination, including Lambda Legal  and 74 other LGBT and allied groups, the National Women's Law Center,  and AFL-CIO.   Earlier this year, I entered a letter into the record from about 300  parents of transgender children who opposed Kacsmaryk's nomination  ``because of his demeaning attacks on transgender children and  adults.'' In their letter, these parents pointed to Mr. Kacsmaryk's  efforts to ``repeatedly promote [ ] fringe, junk science about  transgender people, claiming that gender identity doesn't exist and  that being transgender is a `delusion.' '' They explain why his actions  are so concerning and why his nomination makes them fear for their  children. They wrote: ``Kacsmaryk's words are deeply offensive and  harmful. . . . Our children are not a delusion, and neither is our love  and support for them. We believe our children are miracles, like every  child.''   Despite Kacsmaryk's offensive statements and extensive record against  the LGBT community, he is being rushed to confirmation during Pride  Month because Majority Leader McConnell and Donald Trump are intent on  packing the courts with deeply partisan judges with extreme ideological  agendas.   While our friends in the House have been busy passing bill after bill  to protect women from violence, reduce senseless gun violence, and  ensure that all Americans have access to affordable healthcare, Senate  Republicans have ignored these bipartisan bills and maintained their  single-minded focus on confirming extreme judges. That is because  Senate Republicans are trying to accomplish extreme, conservative  outcomes through the courts that they  [[Page S3649]]  been unable to achieve through legislation. As Majority Leader  McConnell previously explained, legislation can be repealed, but  ``[w]hat can't be undone is a lifetime appointment.''   In the past, this lifetime appointment was viewed as an important  protection to ensure courts remained independent and fair minded. Now,  it is being weaponized as a tool to enforce extreme, conservative  policies through the confirmation of deeply partisan and ideologically  driven judicial nominees.   In the past 2-and-a-half years, we have seen why it is so critical to  have fair and independent courts. As Senate Republicans race to pack  the courts with more and more partisan judges with extreme ideologies,  the integrity and independence of the Federal judiciary is at stake.   Americans must be able to trust that courts act fairly and  impartially to protect the rights of all Americans. That is why I will  vote against Matthew Kacsmaryk's nomination today.                            ____________________
