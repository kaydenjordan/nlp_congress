 Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank Chairman Espaillat for the  time in support of H. Res. 672, which is a bipartisan resolution, and I  appreciate his help in moving it through the subcommittee and  committee. This resolution was introduced with our colleague,  Congressman Adam Kinzinger. I want to thank Ranking Member Smith for  his years of dedication on the committee as well.   This resolution expresses robust support for the Three Seas  Initiative to accelerate the development of cross-border infrastructure  in Central and Eastern Europe.   I am also very grateful to the chairman of the full committee, Eliot  Engel, who has given the best years of his life to this country and our  interests around the world, and to Ranking Member McCaul and  Congressman Keating for their commitment to strengthen the  Transatlantic Alliance.   I thank again my colleague, Congressman Kinzinger, for his  partnership to shepherd this resolution to the floor.   I also extend special thanks to Majority Leader Hoyer and his staff  associate Daniel Silverberg for their support.   Throughout the Cold War, the United States led efforts to expand  liberty in Europe. After the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the  United States welcomed the people of the region into the community of  democratic nations. Yet Soviet tyranny left this strategic region  without a significant infrastructure--actually a huge infrastructure  deficit--increasing dependence on malign influence from Russia and,  yes, China, too.   Tragically, Russia seeks to divide Europe by exploiting Europe's  energy dependence, including through the Nord Stream 2 and TurkStream  pipelines. Meanwhile, Chinese state-linked companies like Huawei offer  predatory financing to capture Europe's telecommunications networks  creating surveillance vulnerabilities.   In response, 12 U.S. allies in Central and Eastern Europe launched  the Three Seas Initiative and Investment Fund. The initiative provides  a critical platform to pool financing to construct infrastructure  projects free from malign influence. Currently, the Three Seas fund  totals $1.4 billion. The first investment has been made in the  transportation infrastructure sector.   This resolution encourages Three Seas member nations to increase  investments into the fund. Further, it strongly urges that the vision  of a cross-border cooperation be extended to non-E.U. nations such as  Ukraine and Moldova. Importantly, this legislation encourages support  for financing of clean energy to counter the scourge of climate change.  Following this resolution's introduction, the United States pledged up  to $1 billion to finance energy security projects through the Three  Seas Investment Fund.   In conclusion, the transatlantic relationship is the bedrock of U.S.  foreign policy. Out of the ashes of two world wars, visionary leaders  created institutions like NATO to protect and expand liberty.   The Three Seas Initiative--this time launched and led by our Allies-- is the next step to complete the transatlantic project. It will ensure  a Europe in this 21st century that is whole, free, and at peace.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''    Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in recognition of a beloved  system of parks and trails in my northern Ohio district: Toledo  Metroparks.   On October 27 of this year, Toledo Metroparks was awarded the most  [[Page H5926]]  prestigious honor in the parks and recreation industry: the 2020  National Gold Medal Award for excellence in parks and recreation  management and, with it, the recognition as the number one park system  in the United States of America by the American Academy for Park and  Recreation Administration, in partnership with the National Recreation  and Park Association.   Like many Toledoans, I am immensely thankful for those who have  fought tirelessly to create a genuine, world-class system of parks and  trails right in the heart of our community. In fact, Toledo Metroparks  was among 20 park and recreation agencies and four military  installations across our country and in Germany considered just as  finalists for the award.   Whether you enjoy bird watching, hiking, mountain biking, archery, or  even just relaxing in a hammock, Toledo Metroparks has countless ways  to get you outside and enjoying nature.   Congratulations to Toledo Metroparks for receiving this prestigious  and well-deserved national recognition. With the recent $23 million  grant from the Department of Transportation to construct the Glass City  Riverwalk, a transformative project in the heart of Toledo, our  Metroparks will only continue to get better in this 21st century.   Madam Speaker, our office will gladly fly a flag over this U.S.  Capitol in the honor of this gold medal award to Toledo Metroparks.  Congratulations to all.                            ____________________
