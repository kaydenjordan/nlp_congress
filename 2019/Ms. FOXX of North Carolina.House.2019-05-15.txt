 Madam Speaker, as the national  conversation revolves around infrastructure this week, I would like to  highlight H.R. 300, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency  Act, or UMITA, which I introduced with my Democratic colleague,  Representative Cuellar.   UMITA will further our goal of renewing our country's infrastructure  by making sure that overly burdensome Federal regulations don't hinder  progress on State and local levels.   State and local governments shoulder the greatest cost of  infrastructure projects, and any Federal legislation to assist their  efforts must account for costs of regulatory compliance. Every dollar  spent on compliance with burdensome mandates is less money for the  projects States and localities need.   UMITA passed with a bipartisan vote in the last four Congresses, and  I call for it to be included in any comprehensive infrastructure  legislation considered in this body.                            ____________________
