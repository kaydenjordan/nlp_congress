 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my  colleagues to pass the TRUST Act to ban individual stock trading by  Members of Congress and their spouses.   Now, Representatives are elected to serve their communities back  home, and this bill builds trust and makes important reforms. While the  American people are working hard to keep  [[Page H517]]  their small businesses afloat and keep food on the table, the last  thing Members of Congress should be doing is trading stocks with any  inside information.   As we work to restore Americans' trust in government, this is a  commonsense step in ensuring that Americans throughout the country have  no doubt about the work that we were sent here to do. This bill ensures  more transparency in our government and is another step forward as we  make our Congress more accountable to the people.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored that this is my first cosponsored bill in  the House.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ranking  Member Pallone for yielding his time and for his leadership in this  legislative body.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the so-called Freedom for Health  Care Workers Act. This legislation is an attack on public health and  will endanger the lives of medical personnel and patients. Why should  we remove vaccine protections for nurses and medical workers in our  hospital and clinical settings?   This bill is not supported by our public health officials and  certainly not supported by our nurses on the ground. Why would we  endanger vulnerable populations? This is cruel and irrational.   Over 1 million people have died in this country due to the pandemic,  many of them nurses and healthcare workers. One of them was my mother,  Gaby Elena O'Donnell.   My mom was my rock. She was a kind, loving, and strong immigrant  woman who dedicated her life to serving her country and community. She  served our country as a frontline healthcare worker. My mom also  [[Page H543]]  taught me what real patriotism is, it is serving your neighbors through  service and giving back to your country.   She was on the front lines of this pandemic helping as many people as  possible. In the summer of 2020, my mom lost her life to COVID-19.   This vaccine could have saved my mom's life, but it was not yet  available. I made a promise to my mom and to my community to fight for  legislation that would protect them and keep them from the pandemic and  keep them healthy.   No other family should have to go through what mine did and millions  of others had to go through in this country. We know, due to science,  that the vaccine saves lives, and our medical workers should be able to  go to work knowing that their lives won't be endangered due to the  service they are giving to our country. Vaccinating hospital and  healthcare workers is a basic form of protection that they all deserve.   Mr. Speaker, for this reason, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on  the Freedom for Health Care Workers Act.
