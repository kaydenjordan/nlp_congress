 Madam President, there are some days that are noisy in  DC and in the Nation. It seems as if the disagreements and the  discourse have paused for just a moment, and we remember again that we  are all Americans and that there are issues we are facing as a nation.   Earlier this morning a group of baseball players who are also Members  of Congress were getting together to practice for a congressional  baseball game happening tomorrow night. It is a friendly game, a great  competition for charity, and a few Members, Republicans and Democrats,  from both the House and the Senate get together and practice and then  play the game.   This morning at the Republican practice, a man walked onto the field  and opened fire on guys just practicing baseball.   Steve Scalise, who is the majority whip, was hit, two members of his  detail, Capitol Hill police, were injured, and other individuals who  were there were injured as well. The Capitol Police saved many lives  this morning. They were prepared and they returned fire and were able  to stop the person who was shooting over and over again at everybody he  could see on that baseball field.   What has been interesting today--since I have come out this morning,  as I have walked through the hallways heading back and forth to  different meetings, I have been interested to see many doors that I  have walked by, and when those doors were open, I could hear people  inside praying. There have been at least three organized prayer  meetings on the Hill today, specifically related just to that, and  others spontaneously occurring. Just for a moment we have the  opportunity to be able to reflect and say to God: Thank You so much for  protecting the people on that field.   Thank you again to the Capitol Police, who literally put their lives  on the line to protect the guests and the Members and staff here every  single day.   Once again, we remember that we are a nation that solves things by  conversation. We disagree, and that is OK. We have said for two  centuries that we can disagree. We don't solve it this way, and we  cannot.   I would like to be able to join what is happening all over this Hill  for just a moment in this room--for us to be able to pray for a moment,  as well, for the people who were there and for the people who are going  through surgery right now and for their families. For every single  staff member who is here, every single Member who is here, every member  of the Capitol Hill police, their families are calling them and texting  them and saying: Are you OK? These families are scattered all over the  country, and they are worried.   We can help lead. We can set a tone to tell the Nation that we should  disagree on things, but we don't ever do this. So I would like to ask  for us to be able to take a moment of privilege and just be able to  pray.   Father, thank You for the way that You have protected--for those  individuals who are in surgery now and recovering now, for the Capitol  Hill police, Steve Scalise, and for other individuals who were affected  today, God, we pray that You would bring them healing.   We pray that You would take care of families who are worried and the  Nation that is worried. We pray that You would cause something good to  come out of something that is very evil. Help us to know how we respond  as a nation.   I ask this in the Name of Jesus. Amen.                        Amendment No. 232, as Modified    Madam President, we have a lot of issues that are moving right now  and a lot of issues that we are discussing. Currently we are discussing  sanctions. The sanctions for Russia are entirely appropriate.   I have no question in my mind that Russia has tried to interfere with  our elections. I have no question in my mind that Russia did work to  interfere with the elections across Europe, especially Eastern Europe.  There are individuals in Russia that mean to do our Nation economic  harm, political harm, and to cause turmoil. For whatever reason, they  believe they can strengthen their nation by trying to cause chaos  everywhere else.   As Americans, we believe we strengthen our Nation by helping others  to succeed. For whatever reason, the Russians believe they can  strengthen their nation by trying to cause others to fall. It reminds  me a lot of bullies on playgrounds and in middle schools. For whatever  reason, they do not advance to the level that they find great joy in  helping others; they find their pleasure in trying to diminish others.  There is an appropriate response we can make back to that as a Nation;  that is, to continue sanctions and to be able to press that.   With the sanctions conversation we have about Russia, we also have an  ongoing conversation about sanctions on Iran, and that is one of the  reasons I want to visit with this body today to put this word out. For  whatever reason, the way sanctions are being organized right now  against Russia and Iran, there are two different platforms for how to  unwind those sanctions. The way this bill is currently offered, the  sanctions against Russia cannot be unwound except by congressional  action, but it is not so against Iran, and I am trying to figure out  why.   This Congress came to this floor just about a year and a half ago  with a bill called the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which passed  98 to 1 in this body. It was to be able to take authority back so that  Congress should be able to vote on sanctions being lifted, in case  there is ever a time that any President wants to be able to lift  sanctions. Obviously, that debate was circling around the Iran nuclear  negotiation at that time, and this body voted 98 to 1 that there should  be accountability on any President, regardless of who it is, on the  lifting of sanctions against the largest state sponsor of terrorism in  the world, which is Iran. So we added in those sanctions, but for  whatever reason on this particular vote, those aren't there, and I have  an issue with that.   I would say to this body: Can we learn our lesson? When Congress  creates sanctions on nation-states and on individuals, we should also  have the authority to determine whether they are lifted or not lifted.  Because of that, I have filed simple language to be able to take the  bill we have currently and to be able to add in simple language that  says something very straightforward: The President can, for national  security reasons, lift sanctions on the nation or on individuals for  120 days but cannot renew that until it comes back to Congress. If it  is truly for national security reasons, there will not be any problem  convincing this Congress, either body, that it is essential to be able  to do that. But if you can't convince this body that it is for national  security reasons, you certainly are not convincing the American people  of that.   It is simple, straightforward language that I believe we should have  in all of our sanctions bills. Whether it is North Korea, Iran, Russia,  or whatever it may be, we should simply say that the American people,  through their elected Representatives, say that this group of  individuals should be sanctioned, and no individual can pull that back  unilaterally without it coming back to the American people again to be  able to turn it off. That is how we work as a Nation. I believe that is  how we should work in the days ahead.   This is not a hostile amendment. This is an amendment saying that we  have learned our lesson as a body. We should actually apply this. This  is not a partisan issue. Whether it is a Republican or Democrat  President is irrelevant in this issue. If Congress creates sanctions,  Congress should not release the authority to make decisions on and off.  What we turned on, we should be  [[Page S3471]]  able to turn off. That is the way our system works.   I look forward to the open debate on this simple issue, and I look  forward to our determining as a body how we handle sanctions for any  nation or any group in the days ahead.   With that, I yield back.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.
