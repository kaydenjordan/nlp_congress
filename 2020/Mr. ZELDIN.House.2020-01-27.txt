 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, tonight, over the course of the next hour on  this House floor, Republicans and Democrats united are coming together  for the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz on  International Holocaust Remembrance Day. For all of us, this is an  extra special, extra personal moment.                                time  1945    Six million Jews, and millions of others, died during the Holocaust;  1.1 million people died at Auschwitz alone. Millions of lives were  unfathomably cut short, tearing apart families, communities, and  countries.   Thanks to the heroism of our Nation's Greatest Generation, with their  strength, and their will, and their courage, good ultimately triumphed  over evil.   There must be a permanent, never-ending, never-yielding commitment to  never allow this form of hate and evil to ever rise again. This pledge  must include combating anti-Semitism and anti-Israel hate wherever it  rears its ugly head, and even when it disguises itself as legitimate.   Today, and every day, we must reaffirm our pledge, ``Never Again.''   For everyone who is watching at home, after votes, while we are here,  at times we see Republican Special Orders and Democrat Special Orders;  but this is an important moment in time for us to come together in this  Chamber, united, Republicans and Democrats, as Americans, for humanity  must ensure that this never happens again.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
