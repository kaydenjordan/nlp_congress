 Madam President, it is my honor to congratulate  Adams State University on 100 years of educating students in Alamosa,  CO. The school was established on May 4, 1921, as Adams State Normal  School by the Colorado Legislature following the tireless advocacy of  Colorado State Representative William ``Billy'' H. Adams. Founded as a  teacher's college, Adams State now has more than 3,000 students  enrolled in 27 bachelor's degree programs, nine master's degree  programs, and one Ph.D. degree program.   Located in the San Luis Valley with deep Hispano roots, Adams State  was the first federally designated Hispanic serving institution in  Colorado. The school has also fostered an elite distance-running  culture over decades after hosting the U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials in  August 1968.   Over the past 100 years, Adams State has educated thousands of  community leaders, businessowners, doctors, attorneys, farmers and  ranchers, and, most  [[Page S8442]]  important, teachers and has been a key economic and cultural  educational institution for Alamosa and the entire San Luis  Valley.                            ____________________
