 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Today, we remember one of the darkest chapters in our history, the  Shoah, when 6 million Jews were brutally murdered in a genocide that  left an indelible mark on humanity.   This year marks 75 years since the liberation of the Auschwitz- Birkenau Nazi death camp.   There alone, 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were killed. Today, we  remember them, and we say again: ``Never again.''   International Holocaust Remembrance Day serves as a reminder of what  depravity humans are capable of  [[Page H562]]  when we don't make it a priority to end hate and intolerance. We must  remember the victims now and always, and that includes making Holocaust  education a priority in our schools. I am thankful that today my  colleagues and I passed legislation to do just that.   There is no place for anti-Semitism, racism, hate, or intolerance in  2020. I join with my colleagues today in saying: ``Never again.''
