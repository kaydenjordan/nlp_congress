 Madam Speaker, for those who enable murderous dictators,  the United States system will find you in this life or the next, and  this is the perfect example.   For Alex Saab, the plunderer of Venezuela, justice for his crimes  against humanity will be swift and without mercy.   Why? Because over the weekend we learned that Saab will finally be  extradited to the United States.   He tried to claim diplomatic immunity, but he is not a diplomat. He  is not a politician. He is just another thug for the Venezuelan regime.   Saab was Maduro's leading front man and his number one money  launderer. He is a drug trafficker who is responsible for flooding  American streets with cocaine. He helped finance the worst crimes and  the most appalling human rights abuses committed by the Maduro regime  in Venezuela in the last 15 years.   So it is no surprise that Maduro, the dictator, has pulled out all  the stops to try to prevent his extradition to the United States, but  he could not.   In the meantime, earlier this week, six American executives, American  executives in Venezuela, known as the Citgo 6, were sent back to a  cruel political prison for no reason.   The regime arrested these men on bogus charges in 2020 with no  justification. Now, with no explanation, Maduro has condemned these  innocent American executives to rot in a Venezuelan prison.   Why? Just one reason: retaliation because Maduro doesn't like this  picture.   This is a classic tactic of tyrants. If Maduro thinks that he can  make a prisoner exchange, he needs to wake up and realize that the  United States does not deal with dictators. So the Citgo 6, six  American executives, need to be released now, unconditionally.   Unfortunately, Maduro right now is panicking because his top  confidant will soon be facing trial in an American court of law, and he  will say many things that Maduro doesn't want us to hear.   Today, the victims of the Maduro regime in Venezuela will finally  have some justice, but we, as a Nation, cannot stop until Venezuela is  free of this satanic nightmare called the Maduro regime.                            ____________________
