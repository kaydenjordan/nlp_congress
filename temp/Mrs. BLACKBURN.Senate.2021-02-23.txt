 Mr. President, today, the HELP Committee considered  the nomination of Xavier Becerra, our former House colleague, to head  the Department of Health and Human Services, and tomorrow the Finance  Committee will take their turn at examining his record.   It is hard to think of a nominee more notorious for actively seeking  out ways to undermine religious freedom and our religious liberty. His  contempt for those whose beliefs differ from his own is well  documented, and, in many cases, his positions on those issues are far  more radical than those held by the majority in his own party.   He supports abortion up to the moment of birth, and, in 2003,  actively opposed the partial-birth abortion ban. He cosponsored  legislation that would have forced religious employers to provide  insurance that covers the morning-after pill, in spite of their  mainstream and sincerely held religious beliefs. Bear in mind I said  the legislation would have forced--not an option--forced religious  employers to provide insurance that covered the morning-after pill.   In fact, Mr. Becerra has been so antagonistic toward fundamental  constitutional principles that you could almost forget he doesn't have  the public health experience most Americans would expect the Secretary  of Health and Human Services to possess. In fact, he has no meaningful  experience in healthcare at all--zero, none, not in public health or  large-scale logistical operations or in any other area that might be  helpful as we navigate our way out of a global pandemic. That is right.  He has no healthcare experience.   This lack of experience, combined with his desire to destroy those  who disagree with him, places him among the most unqualified and  dangerous nominees ever to come before the Senate for consideration,  and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing his confirmation.    Mr. President, the first few weeks of the Biden  administration produced an absurd number of Executive orders, soft talk  on China policy, and the threat of open borders. These actions left the  American people confused and diluted their faith in our institutions,  but nothing made the American people feel more unsettled than the  unprecedented second impeachment and trial of former President Donald  J. Trump.   Impeachment is inherently political. The fallout is everything but.  Last week, I was able to spend time talking to Tennesseans about what  they saw and heard during the trial, and I was struck by how fiercely  most of them spoke out against the very idea of it.   The House Managers didn't just fail to prove their case against the  former President. They failed to convince the American people that the  Members of the House of Representatives who supported impeachment acted  in good faith when they drafted their single Article and transmitted it  to the Senate for consideration.   Tennesseans saw no serious inquiry into the alleged connection  between the former President's words and the actions of the dangerous  rioters who breached the Capitol on January 6, 2021. They remain  unpersuaded by the arguments the House Managers offered to prove the  constitutionality of the trial itself. In fact, the only thing they  remain firmly convinced of is that this second impeachment culminated  in nothing but a partisan show trial designed to humiliate the former  President and wipe the voices of more than 70 million Americans from  the pages of history.   The Senate's vote to acquit the former President of these spurious  charges put an end to the House Managers' charade, but it will take  more than an entry into the Congressional Record to help the country  rise above the enmity that fueled it. It is our duty to lead by example  and get to work on behalf of the millions of Americans living under  this cloud of anxiety, fear, and mistrust. I encourage my colleagues to  quiet their hearts in the coming weeks and commit to doing the work  that will put us on the path to economic recovery, quality in-person  schooling, and a strong national defense. Only then will we be  justified in asking those we serve to once again put their faith in us.   I would be remiss if I did not associate myself with the comments of  the Republican Leader honoring Officer Eugene Goodman for his actions  during the January 6, 2021 riot at the United States Capitol.   On that day, Officer Goodman found himself alone, facing off against  a rushing tide of violence. Without blinking, he lured the mob away  from the Senate chamber, protecting us from what we now know was an all  but inevitable tragedy.   I was honored to celebrate these acts of bravery and self-sacrifice  by joining the Senate's unanimous vote in support of S. 35, to award  Officer Goodman the Congressional Gold Medal. I thank him for his  courage and his commitment to duty, and for his willingness to continue  to serve here in the Capitol.                            ____________________
