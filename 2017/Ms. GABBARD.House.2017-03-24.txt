 Mr. Speaker, people in my home State of Hawaii and all  across the country are in desperate need of serious healthcare reform  to bring down costs and increase access to quality care.   The legislation before us, though, is not the answer. It perpetuates  the problems. It is a handout to insurance and pharmaceutical companies  that literally pulls the rug out from those who are most needy and most  vulnerable in our communities.   While corporations rake in over $600 billion in tax breaks, many low- income Americans will see their coverage drop completely.   Medicaid, a program that one in five Americans depend on for basic  care, would be slashed by hundreds of billions of dollars, shifting  costs to already-strained State and local governments.   Our kupuna, our seniors, could see their premiums increase up to five  times more than young, healthy people under these new age rating rules  in this bill.   Simply put, we need a healthcare system that puts people before  profits. I urge my colleagues strongly to vote ``no'' against this  legislation.
