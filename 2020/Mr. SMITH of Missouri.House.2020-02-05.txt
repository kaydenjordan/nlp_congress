 Madam Speaker, just over 12 hours ago,  President Donald J. Trump stood in this Chamber and delivered an  incredible State of the Union Address. He highlighted numerous  successes during his time as President of the United States:   Over 7 million jobs created;   Record unemployment--record unemployment--for five decades;   The lowest unemployment in over 70 years for women;   Record unemployment for African, Hispanic, and Asian Americans;   Doubling of the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000;   Orchestrating phase one of the China trade agreement, which increases  the amount of agriculture products that the Chinese have to purchase  from American farmers--the largest purchase in the history of our  country;   Passing of the USMCA agreement. The President campaigned on it. It  was a promise made. It was a promise kept;   The largest military pay raise in the history of this country.   The President said he was going to build a barrier along the southern  border. He highlighted 100 miles of it being finished in his State of  the Union Address yesterday, with 500 more miles still planned.   He highlighted how his administration has approved a record number of  generic drugs, and, for the first time in over 50 years, drug prices  have actually gone down.   He highlighted numerous successes that all Members of Congress who  attended heard. It was unfortunate to sit in this Chamber and watch the  Democrats on the other side not stand, not applaud for these successes  for America, these victories for America, the people who sent us to  Washington, the people we serve, the people who are our bosses. These  are their victories. These are their successes. But just because they  came out of the mouth of President Donald Trump, the Democrats oppose  them.   Folks, that is chaos in government.   Ever since the Democrats took control of this Chamber, they have had  one mission, one mission alone, and that is to remove the duly elected  45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump.   Their mission wasn't about lowering the cost of prescription drugs.  Their mission was not getting government off the backs of small  businesses, family farmers, and individuals. Their mission was about  removing Donald Trump.   This partisan impeachment sham, this impeachment circus will be done  today. In the United States Senate, President Donald J. Trump will be  acquitted for life. You will see the process that happened in the House  of Representatives was clearly a sham in impeaching the President of  the United States.   It was so unfortunate yesterday to be sitting here and watching  Speaker Pelosi, after the end of the speech, tear up the official  speech of the President of the United States. That shows the true  hatred that the Democrat socialists have for the President of the  United States. That conduct is not fitting for the Speaker of the  House.   When the Speaker tore up that State of the Union speech, she ripped  up the words that recognized one of the last living serving Tuskegee  airmen.   When she ripped up that speech, she ripped up the story of a 21-week- old surviving child who was born in a Kansas City, Missouri, hospital.   When she ripped up that State of the Union speech, she ripped up the  story and the recognition of the families of Rocky Jones and Kayla  Mueller.                            ____________________
