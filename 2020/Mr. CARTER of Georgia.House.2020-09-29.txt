 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor the life of 25-year-old Johnathon Grayer, whose selfless actions  led to saving the lives of multiple school children and a bus driver in  the city of Alma, Georgia.   On Wednesday, August 12, Johnathon was driving a box truck that  collided with a school bus that was making its normal stops. When it  hit the bus, the back was left crumpled like a piece of paper. However,  he remarkably jumped out of the truck, rushed onto the bus, and helped  pull students out of the school bus to safety. He even lifted some  seats off children who were pinned underneath.   Unfortunately, following the incident, Johnathon's body gave out, and  he later passed away in the hospital.   With the help of his courage and selflessness, the lives of 10  children and the bus driver were saved. Although Johnathon's life was  tragically taken, his legacy of sacrifice will live on for countless  years to come. He will always be remembered as a hero who placed others  before himself. His family, friends, and all who knew him will be in my  thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.                            ____________________
