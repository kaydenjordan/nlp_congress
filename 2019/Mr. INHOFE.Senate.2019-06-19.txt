 Mr. President, over the next few days, Senator Reed and I  will be leading the consideration of the National Defense Authorization  Act for 2020. I consider this--and I think he would probably join me on  this--the most significant bill of the year, and it is the most  important bill.   There is an old document no one reads anymore called the  Constitution, which says what we are really supposed to be doing here.  No. 1 on the list is defending America, and now this bipartisan bill is  more important than ever.   The world is more unstable and dangerous than at any time in my  lifetime. The National Defense Strategy gave it to us straight. This is  the document; the National Defense Strategy Commission put this  together. It was made up of experts, equally divided, Democrats and  Republicans. We have had several hearings on this. We have had meetings  and discussed it with our Members. In fact, Senator Jon Kyl, during the  brief time that he was back as a Member of the Senate, dropped out of  this and then went back in. He is very active in this, and so are the  rest.   None of the individuals here have ever been accused of being in any  way partisan. What they put together is a defense strategy that is the  best thing for this country, and they have done a masterful job of this  and actually put it straight to us.   The strategic competition with China and Russia is something that is  relatively new. During the last administration, China and Russia  started surfacing, and they became more prominent and were challenging  us in several areas.   The continuing threats from rogue countries are still important too.  We are talking about Iran and North Korea and the other terrorist  organizations.   New technology and new warfighting domains in outer space and  cyberspace are things that in recent years have become very prominent,  and we have to compete. Our peer competitors are out there even stating  that they are ahead of us, not to mention the years of underfunding by  the previous administration.   When you think about the last administration, if you look at using  fiscal year 2018 dollars and you want to take the last 5 years of the  previous administration, 2010 had appropriations using constant dollars  of $794 billion. In 2015, 5 years later, it was $586 billion. So stop  and think about that. I can't think of any bureaucracy that has taken  that much of a dive in that period of time. We are talking about 20  percent.   So that is the reality we are facing, and this is what we are doing  right now in trying to get our Defense authorization bill. Again, it  will pass. That is one of the few things you can do that you know is  going to pass. It has passed for the last 58 years, and it is going to  pass this year too.   Yet we are facing a real national security crisis. There are real  threats to our military and our way of life, and we are ready to meet  and defeat these threats. We have to continue rebuilding our military,  catching up with our competitors, and making strategic and holistic  improvements to our national defense. I said catch up, and that clearly  states that we are not ahead right now.   Using the National Defense Strategy Commission report as our  blueprint, this year's NDAA pursues ``urgent change at significant  scale'' to meet the needs of our Nation.   Our military leaders have said time and again that stable,  predictable, on-time funding is the single most important way Congress  can help support a strong national defense. We did this last year, and  we are going to do it again this year. It is incredibly important that  we stare down the barrel of sequestration cuts that would, in the words  of former of Air Force Secretary Wilson, ``be absolutely devastating in  scope and scale.''   It is not just her. Others have come before us and said that if we  were to be subjected to sequestration, it would undo all of the  corrections that have been made in the last 2\1/2\ years. This would  undo all of the work we have done to rebuild our readiness. I am  talking about fiscal years 2018 and 2019.   We also know that continuing resolutions are no way to do business,  especially for our military. We have had the military in hearings we  have had. We have traditionally--this year--two very long hearings on  defense authorization in our committee. Each witness who comes in talks  about how devastating it would be if we were to move back to  sequestration or if we have to undo the improvements that we have made.   I know this firsthand. When I go out and visit military installations  in Oklahoma, across the country, and around the world, it is true that  we sit down with the commanders and the base leaders. But also--and I  know my good friend Senator Reed does--we go and sit down and eat in  the mess halls with our kids out there on the frontlines and talk to  them. I have to tell you, they know what is going on. They know when we  are dragging our feet on efforts that we have to fund our military.  They know who is doing it, who isn't doing it, and they are the best  source of getting that information.   The NDAA is the first step in the process of getting them that  military funding. This year, we provided a total of $750 billion to  ensure our troops have the resources they need to defend our Nation.  This represents a bare minimum. People talk about $750 billion, but  stop and think about it. This report says that until we get back to the  point at which we have the military where it should be, we are going to  have to increase each year, during this timeframe, somewhere between a  3 and 5 percent increase--net increase--each year. That is in this book  here, and that is considered to be a bare minimum. Ironically, that is  the same figure that our military uses. The NDAA aligns our defense  resources and policies with our National Defense Strategy, which is  found in this book.   Fully funding our military at $750 billion means we will be more  ready to address great power competition like China and Russia. We are  seeing our military lose ground. Anything less would keep us from  regaining our combat advantage and our duty to deter aggression. I am  using the words carefully. When we say regain, that is what we need to  do, because we are not there  [[Page S3833]]  now. We can't plan to fight the wars of tomorrow with the weapons and  equipment of yesterday.   The NDAA fully funds the Nuclear Modernization Program at or above  request, including the nuclear triad, and directs funding to procure  critical equipment.   The Nuclear Modernization Program has been suffering for a long  period of time. A lot of people look at the triad system and assume  that somehow that is a redundancy. It is not. It talks about systems  that can project a nuclear weapon, and there are three different  classifications. That is what the triad is all about. It is not as if  you can take one or two out of it and still do the job.   In this bill, we have 94 Joint Strike Fighters, 12 new battle force  ships, 105 naval aircraft, new aircraft for the Air Force, including  the 15 KC-46As, and new helicopters for the Army, including 9 new  Chinooks.   We also have to be prepared to meet challenges in new domains. Space  is one of those. General Raymond, who is nominated to lead the U.S.  Base Command, told our committee when we were having a hearing on this  that our superiority in space is questionable. It is not guaranteed.  That is work that has to be done. That is what we are finding in this  bill that we are going to ultimately be voting for in the next few  days.   Our society relies on satellites and space technologies. We need to  address this problem now before it is too late, and I am glad President  Trump has made this a key initiative.   We took President Trump's directive to establish a space force and  came up with a bipartisan plan to establish a force that meets our  needs in space. Our bill would stand up the U.S. Space Force in the Air  Force. This will create a cohesive strategy to protect our interests in  space, improve how we acquire space assets, and improve our space  warfighting culture.   People say: Of all the things we are doing right now, we are doing a  lot of things in space. What does this do that we are not doing  currently? My answer is nothing. We are doing it all now, but this  would allow us to do it better. Our plan prevents additional costs and  bureaucracy and gets us off on the right foot to better fulfill our  mission in space.   The legislation also implements policies that would change the way  the Pentagon is run, allowing it to respond more nimbly and effectively  to the current defensive landscape.   Last, but arguably the most important, the NDAA makes our all- volunteer force--the backbone of our national defense--the biggest  priority.   I happen to be one of the few people--in fact, I think I am the only  one in this Senate Chamber who is a product of the draft. That was back  in the days when we didn't have an all-volunteer force. I came here  absolutely convinced that was the best way to go until I started seeing  what we have out there. When you see these kids and what they are  doing, it is amazing how effective they are. They are truly the  backbone of our national defense. Even though our military advantage  may have been diminished, what hasn't changed are our troops. They are  still the best in the world. We have to continue to look out for them.  It is one of the biggest ways we stand apart from our adversaries or  actors like Russia or China. They don't care about their people. We do.   A lot of times people ask me: Why is it we have to spend so much  money on defense? We are spending more money than Russia and China.   That is easy. Our largest single expense to putting together a  military is its end strength. It is the people.   It is the people. We care about the people. We make sure we are doing  things that are good for the people. I remember we had this big  discussion on the privatization of commissaries not too long ago. That  was something where that is a benefit. It doesn't cost us any more, I  contend, but that is a great benefit for those people--the spouses and  members of the military--in remote places. That is where they go. That  is where everybody wants to go. So it is true that it costs more, but  that is because Russians--it goes without saying, Russians and the  Chinese, they don't really care about the people. They are going to  tell them to go out and fight. They have to do it. That is the largest  single item. They don't have that; we do, and we are better off for it.  That is what this is all about. It will put us back to where we are on  top. We are not second in any of these areas.   It provides the 3.1-percent pay raise for our troops, and that is the  largest we have had in 10 years.   We improved the quality of life for our troops and their families,  making sure our troops have quality healthcare and a solid roof over  their heads.   Just a few months ago, our committee became aware of some really  serious problems in housing. This is only just about last February.  This is something--frankly, I was one of the guilty parties because we  privatized housing some time ago. That was something that--yes, in a  way, it sure makes it easier for us. It makes it easier for the  military. All of a sudden, we found ourselves in a situation where we  sent out bids. We had contractors who were bidding to do the housing  work. Then we found out that--it worked fine for a couple years, but  then, as time went by--this is human nature--people got careless. I  think the contractors got a little bit greedy. So all of a sudden, we  found out we had housing for our people that had mold and all kinds of  serious problems. So we had a hearing on this. Actually, we had two  hearings on this. One was to listen to the tenants all throughout  America who were talking about how deplorable that condition was, and  the other one was we brought in the contractors and talked to them. The  thing that impressed me was, during the second hearing of the  contractors, they admitted there was a problem. They said: There is. We  have become a little too relaxed. They started to clean up their act,  but just in case they did not do that, we actually put a lot of those  provisions in this bill that we are going to be considering now. It  includes a Tenant Bill of Rights. We weren't going to do this until the  end of the summer. We were going to have another hearing and talk about  what we needed to do to correct the problem, but we already know. They  went out there, and they looked.   So in this bill, we have a Tenant Bill of Rights. We have private  housing partners being held accountable, ensuring each installation has  the right personnel to conduct oversight. Overall, we make sure our  military has the infrastructure to support it. Within the funding for  military construction, $3.6 billion is set aside to replenish funds  that may be used to build a wall. There has been a lot of criticism.  People are saying: Well, you used some military funds--maybe some of  the funds that were going to be used for military construction. If that  is the case, we have $3.6 billion set aside here to replenish any funds  that might have been used to build a wall. So they don't have that  argument anymore.   As I said before, this legislation is legislation that all of our  colleagues from both sides of the aisle can support. Defense needs to  be our No. 1 priority. We may not agree on everything, but we can  definitely agree on that.   The Senate Armed Services Committee approved the bill on an  overwhelming bipartisan basis--25 to 2--in only 6 hours. This is kind  of interesting. Each year it falls this way--I guess, intentionally. On  a Wednesday, we get together at 9 in the morning. The Defense  Authorization Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee meet.  We go over what we are going to have to do in terms of this bill, and  we get it done. We got this done actually in 6 hours. I thought that  was a record, and we did it in a little less than that time this time,  but we had a product that was 25 to 2. Only two people voted against  it. We completed this work quickly--less than 2 months after receiving  the administration's budget request. It was my goal to get this done as  soon as possible. I thank the committee and the staff for helping to  get this done.   We all understand the importance of this bill. This is the most  important bill of the year. I think most people understand that and  agree to that. On this committee, we considered 433 amendments and  approved nearly 300 of them. Our markup took 6 hours just because of  our shared commitment to working together.   So I want to thank, particularly, the ranking member of the Senate  Armed Services Committee, Senator Reed, and every member of the  committee  [[Page S3834]]  working to pass this critical legislation. I want to thank the majority  leader, Senator McConnell, for his leadership and for continuing to  fight for a budget deal that includes a strong top line for our  defense.   I look forward to continuing this fair, corroborative process on the  floor in the coming days. We are going to consider amendments. Both  Senator Reed and I want an open amendment process. Then we are going to  pass this bill for the 59th straight year in a row. For nearly 6  decades, Congress has understood the necessity of a strong, capable,  lethal force. The main reason America is the leader of the free world  is because of our military might. Our Armed Forces are the very best in  the world. Our leadership values pave the way for liberty, prosperity,  and security across the globe. We preserve peace through our strength.  Who else said that? Ronald Reagan talked about the necessity to be  strong so we can avoid the very type of threats that are out there.  Freedom isn't free. We understand that. We want to preserve this vital  role--a role that guarantees a future of freedom and democracy for our  children and grandchildren. We have to prioritize our national  security. That is what we have been doing with this NDAA, and that is  why we are going to continue to do it with the passage of this bill.   Again, I want to express my appreciation. It is a tough bill, and we  have spent a lot of hours together, Senator Reed and I, and I think we  have something now that is going to be going through. We do have an  amendment process. It is an open amendment process, and we plan to do  that and get that done.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request that  the Senate resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 1790.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, let me say also that Senator Reed and I  worked together on a lot of these over the years, and this is not going  to be any different than before. We can get it done. We will get it  done on time. We will get it done to put us back in the position we  should be in, the United States of America with our military  capability.   With that, I appreciate it and look forward to working together.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 253, submitted earlier today.         I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to,  the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I request unanimous consent to grant floor  privileges for the duration of this consideration of the NDAA to Kyle  Stewart, my defense fellow, and Jennifer Dougherty, the GAO detailee.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Thursday, June 20; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, morning business be closed, and the Senate resume  consideration of the pending joint resolutions en bloc; further, that  15 minutes be under the control of Senator Menendez and 5 minutes be  under control of Senator Risch prior to 11:30 a.m. tomorrow; finally,  that all time since cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 1790 was  invoked, recess, adjournment, morning business, and leader remarks and  during the consideration of the resolutions en bloc, count postcloture  on the motion to proceed to S. 1790.    For the information of all Senators, the Senate will vote  on the confirmation of the Baranwal nomination at 1:45 p.m. tomorrow.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of our Democratic  colleagues.
