 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  Pierce County Bears who won the Georgia High School Association class  2A football State championship yesterday in Atlanta, Georgia.   This win is the second State championship for the Bears and Coach  Ryan Herring, and it was not earned easily. This game was tied 14-14  all going into halftime, and it didn't get any easier from there.   The Bears had to fight to the very end, eventually sealing the  victory in triple overtime.   Pierce County quarterback, Caden McGatha, was phenomenal in this  victory throwing for two touchdowns to receiver Carson Sloan and  running for an additional four touchdowns himself.   The Pierce County defense was also outstanding, sacking the opposing  quarterback six times.   To the Pierce County Bears and to Coach Ryan Herring, I say  congratulations on this amazing win. This team earned this  championship, it was not given to them.                     Remembering Pastor Clarence Williams     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  Reverend Dr. Clarence Williams who passed away at the age of 64.   Dr. Clarence Williams was a Savannah resident and a longtime pastor  of Pilgrim Baptist Church of Savannah.   In addition to his work leading Pilgrim Baptist Church of Savannah,  Pastor Williams previously served as the moderator of Berean Missionary  Baptist Association, vice president of the National Baptist Convention,  music auxiliary, State music director of the General Missionary Baptist  Convention of Georgia, and many other positions.   He also served as chaplain of Chatham County Sheriff's Department and  the Savannah State University National Alumni Association.   Pastor Williams will be remembered by many for his charismatic  personality, his unwavering faith, and his dedication to serving  others.                Celebrating the Achievements of Ronald Booker     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  achievements of Ronald Booker, a Savannah resident.   After spending 34 years as head basketball coach for the Beach High  School women's basketball team, Ronald Booker was named the special  assistant to the head coach for the women's basketball team at Savannah  State University.   During his career, Coach Booker led the Lady Bulldogs to 12  subregional championships and made 30 State championship basketball  tournament appearances. His teams were ranked by The Atlanta Journal- Constitution in the State's top 10 teams for 26 seasons.   He concluded his coaching career--get this--with a 786-190 overall  record.   In his honor, the city of Savannah has decided to name a portion of  Hopkins Street in front of Beach High School Coach Ronald Booker Way.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mr. Booker on his remarkable achievements  and on his well-deserved honorary designation.                        Frank Callen Boys & Girls Club     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  achievements of the Frank Callen Boys & Girls Club in Savannah,  Georgia.   The Frank Callen Boys & Girls Club was started by Frank Callen in  1917, and the club was accepted into the national organization in 1922.   Since its inception, this club has served Savannah youth by being a  safe place to learn and a safe place to play. It also serves as the  home of some world-class athletes.   LSU basketball star, Flau'jae Johnson and University of Georgia  football star Nolan Smith are both proud alumni of the Frank Callen  Boys & Girls Club. Both of these amazing athletes have graduated to  winning national championships in their respective sports, and they  have not forgotten their roots. Both have recently made generous  donations to the place where they got their start.   I also thank Mark Lindsay who serves as the executive director of the  club. People like Mark are essential in the development of our youth  and our communities as a whole.   I, again, thank everyone involved with the Frank Callen Boys & Girls  Club for the positive impact they are having on our community.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2365, the Dr.  Emmanuel Bilirakis and Honorable Jennifer Wexton National Plan to End  Parkinson's Act.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my dear friend from Florida,  Representative Gus Bilirakis, for his leadership and his excellent work  on this bipartisan piece of legislation. We all admire my friend, and  we thank him for his courage.   This is the first-ever legislation in Congress focusing on curing and  preventing Parkinson's disease and ensuring quality care for those  living with the disease.   More than 1 million people in the U.S. live with Parkinson's disease,  and there are no treatments to cure, prevent, or significantly slow  down the progression.   Mr. Speaker, whether you are living with the disease or caring for  someone, Parkinson's takes a terrible toll on everyone involved.   This issue is also very important to me. As a pharmacist, I have,  through my career, experienced this with many patients. I also watched  my dear friend, Senator Johnny Isakson, courageously battle Parkinson's  disease for over 6 years.   Fortunately, we have an opportunity here today to pass one of the  single largest congressional efforts to address Parkinson's disease.   The National Plan to End Parkinson's Act will build on the great work  being done at places like the Isakson Center, named after Senator  Isakson, to end Parkinson's once and for all.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to do what is best for patients and  for the Parkinson's community by getting this bill passed.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  hard workers of a Georgia establishment that was named among the best  new restaurants of 2023.   Food magazine Bon Appetit released its picks for the best new  restaurants of 2023, forming the list from various places around the  country that they state represent the very best of dining. Brochu's  Family Tradition in Savannah is a part of this list.   Chef Andrew Brochu spent years in Chicago fine dining, ultimately  deciding to open his first restaurant in Savannah, the hometown of his  business partner and wife, Sophie Brochu.   Madam Speaker, the restaurant is situated in a former 1930s grocery  store and is full of charming details that will remind you of the South  almost as much as the food will. With innovative takes on East Coast  favorites, the food is reminiscent of the backyard gatherings and  family dinner parties of Andrew's youth.   I, again, congratulate Brochu's Family Tradition, and wish them the  best of luck going forward.                            ____________________
