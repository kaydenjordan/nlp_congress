 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for  giving us the opportunity to honor a hero, Jeremy Ridlen.   I rise in support of this bill today to designate the United States  Postal Service facility in Maroa, Illinois, as the Jeremy L. Ridlen  Post Office.   Army Specialist Jeremy Ridlen was born and raised in Maroa, Illinois,  where he attended Maroa-Forsyth High School with his twin brother,  Jason.   Jeremy and Jason, like my twin boys, were inseparable. They were  active in their church, played on its softball team, and were included  in its weekly prayer list after they both deployed.   Jeremy and Jason attended Illinois State University and joined the  National Guard shortly thereafter. Their unit, the 1544 Transportation  Company, was deployed to Iraq in 2003. On May 23, 2004, after a truck  rigged with an IED detonated next to his convoy, small arms fire killed  Jeremy in the ambush.   Designating this post office in honor of Jeremy will serve as a  testament to his bravery and a reminder of all those who laid down  their life for the United States of America.   Jeremy Ridlen died serving his country, and for that, he is a hero to  all of us. He put his country above all else, and we thank him for his  service and are thinking of his entire family back in Illinois today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the  opportunity to be here tonight. It is actually bittersweet because we  are here to honor a friend, a long-time friend to many, even to some  sitting here in this institution because Vicki Dixon was an institution  here in Washington, D.C.; not in a bad way, but in a way where she  touched so many lives in such a positive manner.   I am going to go ahead and save my comments about Vicki until later  because we have got some friends that got to know Vicki over the years  like I did, and got to not only become friends but just to see the  wholesome, genuine, kind individual that Victoria Sands Dixon was.   Her career was encapsulated by helping so many people here in  Congress get things done, and her passing is bittersweet to all of us.   One good friend of Vicki and a very good friend of mine is the  ranking member on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Mr. Speaker, I  yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend Mr.  Bost for those heartfelt words.   I now yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood), another good  friend of Vicki.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman LaHood  for those great words. I didn't know she was one of the folks who  started the Lincoln Series. That is great.   That is a great program, and it makes me see the influence of Vicki  Dixon even more. A lot of great people have gone through that program,  and now I know why it is a great program--because of people like Vicki.   Another good friend of Vicki Dixon--well, there is Vicki talking. I  just knocked it down. She is like: Shush, stop saying so many nice  thing about me.   Another good friend of Vicki is her colleague from the State of  Washington. You and your wife were very close to Vicki. I know, after  her passing, we exchanged phone calls to try to find out what happened.   Mr. Newhouse, what is your wife's name again?    I do. Tell Joan I said hi. And it is  now in the Congressional Record that I acted like I didn't know her  name.   In all seriousness, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Newhouse) to tell the American people about our friend Vicki.                                time  1930     Mr. Speaker, I encourage the gentleman  to feel free to stick around if any other thoughts on Vicki's life come  to mind to make sure we let the world know.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to share a note I got from people who were  very close to Vicki, and this epitomizes the influence Vicki had on so  many here. I think this note speaks for so many people. It says: ``I am  still devastated, just like everyone who knew her. Wow.''    You can look around this city, you can look around this Capitol, and  you can see what Vicki Dixon meant. It didn't matter if you were a  Republican or a Democrat. She worked for both administrations. This is  the person who was able to help navigate people in the right direction  to get things done.   Vicki is the perfect example of a career public servant who did not  work for the public attention but for the sake of our country. Vicki  loved the United States of America.   Through Vicki's kindness and professionalism, she won the hearts of  many, from the highest positions here in Washington to the humblest  positions here in Washington. I hope that when we all leave, we can say  the same thing, that our best friends just weren't those who walked  into the best offices in this complex, but that our best friends were  those who made sure the lights worked in these offices, that our  friends were those who make Washington work for all of us just like  Vicki Dixon did.   One of my favorite memories of Vicki is actually getting to meet her.  It was with my great friend, my former boss, former chief of staff  Craig Roberts. He introduced me to her. Then I got reintroduced to  Vicki by my former colleague, my mentor, and my friend and former boss,  Congressman Shimkus.   That brings up a great memory that I have of Vicki and Leader Michel,  sitting right behind home plate. I could tell that the game was going  well because Vicki was very much smiles when I would chase a passed  ball back to the backstop. If the game wasn't going well, she probably  wouldn't look at me while I was going back, making another error maybe,  possibly, and, yes, historically.   But I can remember Vicki sitting there with Leader Michel in a Cubs  jersey. I am from Illinois. I am not a Cubs fan, and neither was John  Shimkus. He was a much more rabid fan of the Cardinals than many. Vicki  Dixon was the only one that could wear a Cubs jersey around Congressman  John Shimkus because she was Vicki Dixon.   From 1989 until her retirement in 2016, Vicki served Secretaries of  the Interior, as I mentioned earlier, under both Republicans and  Democrats. That is where I got a chance to see what she meant to  people.   The constituents I used to work for when I worked for Congressman  John Shimkus got VIP tours of the monuments because Vicki Dixon  realized that when constituents come to Washington, they want to see  their Nation's Capital. She did everything she could to make that  happen, so much so that when I became a Member of Congress, she  continued to help us allow our constituents to see the monuments under  her direction at the Department of the Interior.   I remember a good friend of hers that used to work with her at the  Department of the Interior under President Bush. I have exchanged texts  with Lori Yates, my good friend, over the last few weeks upon Vicki's  passing.   Lori, Vicki knew you were a great friend, too. She knew that that  friendship mattered. And understand that Vicki is in a better place.  Vicki is with her friends and those she loved the most in a place where  there is no pain. But in a place like Washington, D.C., she will be  missed.   Vicki worked for the Office of the Secretary and the Bureau of Land  Management as an expert in external affairs. Before Interior, she  worked for Congressman Dan Crane. She also worked for Veterans Affairs  Secretary Ed Derwinski.   As my colleagues mentioned, Vicki is a native of Shelbyville,  Illinois. Vicki attended Lake Land College in Mattoon.   I can remember one day my wife and I were driving around our hometown  of Taylorville, and we just so happened to drive by Vicki's mom's house  because Vicki's mom, Peggy, lived in my hometown for some time. And who  do I see standing out in the driveway of her mom's house in  Taylorville, Illinois, but Vicki Dixon? Of course, Vicki flagged us  down, and we stopped.   I got to know her mom even after that meeting. I know her mother,  Peggy, is devastated by her loss.   Vicki moved from D.C. to Naples, where she again quickly made new  friends. But on January 8, it is one of those days where you exchange  phone calls with colleagues and friends, and you hate to have that  discussion, but just so everybody knows, Vicki passed peacefully in her  sleep unexpectedly in Naples.  [[Page H328]]    I can't tell you how devastated we all are to know that Vicki is not  going to be able to enjoy that house, that time that she wanted to  enjoy in Naples. But Vicki lived one of the fullest lives I think we  could ever wish for.   Vicki's mom, Peggy, and her family are devastated, and we know that.  I hope you know that our prayers are with them all. I would urge anyone  watching tonight to say a quick prayer for Vicki's mom and Vicki's  family.   But Vicki is resting in peace. Vicki is again in a place experiencing  no pain, and I believe there is a God that allows her to be able to  experience that peace with those she loved the most.   Vicki, we know you are resting in peace, but D.C. is not resting with  you right now. D.C. is honoring you tonight.   There is not a person that I think deserves more than Victoria Sands  Dixon to be honored by an institution that she loved so much.   God bless Vicki and her memory and those who knew her, and let's all  use Vicki as an example.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
