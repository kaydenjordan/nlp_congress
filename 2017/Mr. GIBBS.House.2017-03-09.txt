 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to talk about Melanie, a  constituent from Ohio's Seventh Congressional District.  [[Page H1960]]    Melanie and her husband are near retirement. Before ObamaCare, their  monthly health insurance premiums were around $600. ObamaCare promised  them reduced insurance premiums and increased access to care.   But this promise to Melanie, like it was to millions of Americans,  was broken. Melanie's premium skyrocketed to nearly $1,000 a month for  a plan with a $5,000 deductible. Her monthly premium is now more than  their mortgage.   When her husband was laid off, their options were limited: continuing  coverage through COBRA or entering the ObamaCare marketplace. The  ObamaCare plans were even more expensive. While Melanie's husband was  looking for work, they depleted their savings trying to maintain health  insurance.   Melanie is one of millions of Americans who have been hurt by  ObamaCare. It has raised Melanie's premiums and deductible, and when  she needed an affordable option in an emergency, it wasn't there.   ObamaCare is collapsing. It is time to repeal it and provide relief  to the millions of Americans suffering because of it.                            ____________________
