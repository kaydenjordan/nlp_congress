 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5313) to protect children and other consumers against  hazards associated with the accidental ingestion of button cell or coin  batteries by requiring the Consumer Product Safety Commission to  promulgate a consumer product safety standard to require child- resistant closures on consumer products that use such batteries, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5313         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as ``Reese's Law''.  [[Page H7113]]            SEC. 2. CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY STANDARD FOR BUTTON CELL OR                     COIN BATTERIES AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS CONTAINING                     SUCH BATTERIES.         (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Commission shall, in       accordance with section 553 of title 5, United States Code,       promulgate a final consumer product safety standard for       button cell or coin batteries and consumer products       containing button cell or coin batteries that shall only       contain--        (1) a performance standard requiring the button cell or       coin battery compartments of a consumer product containing       button cell or coin batteries to be secured in a manner that       would eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury from       button or coin cell battery ingestion by children that are 6       years of age or younger during reasonably foreseeable use or       misuse conditions; and        (2) warning label requirements--        (A) to be included on the packaging of button cell or coin       batteries and the packaging of a consumer product containing       button cell or coin batteries;        (B) to be included in any literature, such as a user       manual, that accompanies a consumer product containing button       cell or coin batteries; and        (C) to be included, as practicable--        (i) directly on a consumer product containing button cell       or coin batteries in a manner that is visible to the consumer       upon installation or replacement of the button cell or coin       battery; or        (ii) in the case of a product for which the battery is not       intended to be replaced or installed by the consumer, to be       included directly on the consumer product in a manner that is       visible to the consumer upon access to the battery       compartment, except that if it is impracticable to label the       product, this information shall be placed on the packaging or       instructions.        (b) Requirements for Warning Labels.--Warning labels       required under subsection (a)(2) shall--        (1) clearly identify the hazard of ingestion; and        (2) instruct consumers, as practicable, to keep new and       used batteries out of the reach of children, to seek       immediate medical attention if a battery is ingested, and to       follow any other consensus medical advice.        (c) Treatment of Standard for Enforcement Purposes.--A       consumer product safety standard promulgated under subsection       (a) shall be treated as a consumer product safety rule       promulgated under section 9 of the Consumer Product Safety       Act (15 U.S.C. 2058).        (d) Exception for Reliance on Voluntary Standard.--        (1) Before promulgation of standard by commission.--      Subsection (a) shall not apply if the Commission determines,       before the Commission promulgates a final consumer product       safety standard under such subsection, that--        (A) with respect to any consumer product for which there is       a voluntary consumer product safety standard that meets the       requirements for a standard promulgated under subsection (a)       with respect to such product; and        (B) the voluntary standard described in subparagraph (A)--        (i) is in effect at the time of the determination by the       Commission; or        (ii) will be in effect not later than the date that is 180       days after the date of the enactment of this Act.        (2) Determination required to be published in federal       register.--Any determination made by the Commission under       this subsection shall be published in the Federal Register.        (e) Treatment of Voluntary Standard for Enforcement       Purposes.--        (1) In general.--If the Commission makes a determination       under subsection (d) with respect to a voluntary standard,       the requirements of such voluntary standard shall be treated       as a consumer product safety rule promulgated under section 9       of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058) beginning       on the date described in paragraph (2).        (2) Date described.--The date described in this paragraph       is the later of--        (A) the date of the determination of the Commission under       subsection (d) with respect to the voluntary standard       described in paragraph (1); or        (B) the effective date contained in the voluntary standard       described in paragraph (1).        (f) Revision of Voluntary Standard.--        (1) Notice to commission.--If a voluntary standard with       respect to which the Commission has made a determination       under subsection (d) is subsequently revised, the       organization that revised the standard shall notify the       Commission after the final approval of the revision.        (2) Effective date of revision.--Beginning on the date that       is 180 days after the Commission is notified of a revised       voluntary standard described in paragraph (1) (or such later       date as the Commission determines appropriate), such revised       voluntary standard in whole or in part shall be considered to       be a consumer product safety rule promulgated under section 9       of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2058), in place       of the prior version, unless, within 90 days after receiving       the notice, the Commission notifies the organization that the       revised voluntary standard, in whole or in part, does not       improve the safety of the consumer product covered by the       standard and that the Commission is retaining all or part of       the existing consumer product safety standard.        (g) Future Rulemaking.--At any time after the promulgation       of a final consumer product safety standard under subsection       (a), a voluntary standard is treated as a consumer product       safety rule under subsection (e), or a revised voluntary       standard becomes enforceable as a consumer product safety       rule under subsection (f), the Commission may initiate a       rulemaking in accordance with section 553 of title 5, United       States Code, to modify the requirements of the standard or       revised standard. Any rule promulgated under this subsection       shall be treated as a consumer product safety rule       promulgated under section 9 of the Consumer Product Safety       Act (15 U.S.C. 2058).       SEC. 3. CHILD-RESISTANT PACKAGING FOR BUTTON CELL OR COIN                     BATTERIES.

(b) Applicability.--The requirement of subsection (a) shall       be treated as a standard for the special packaging of a       household substance established under section 3(a) of the       Poison Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 (15 U.S.C. 1472(a)).       SEC. 4. EXEMPTION FOR COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING STANDARD.         The standards promulgated under this Act shall not apply       with respect to any toy product that is in compliance with       the battery accessibility and labeling requirements of part       1250 of title 16, Code of Federal Regulations, and in       reference to section 3(a), shall not apply with respect to       button cell or coin batteries that are in compliance with the       marking and packaging provisions of the ANSI Safety Standard       for Portable Lithium Primary Cells and Batteries (ANSI       C18.3M).       SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Button cell or coin battery.--The term ``button cell or       coin battery'' means--        (A) a single cell battery with a diameter greater than the       height of the battery; or        (B) any other battery, regardless of the technology used to       produce an electrical charge, that is determined by the       Commission to pose an ingestion hazard.        (2) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Consumer       Product Safety Commission.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5313.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 5313, Reese's Law.   I want to begin by thanking Consumer Protection and Commerce  Subcommittee Chair Schakowsky for her dedication to protecting  consumers from dangerous products and Representatives Kelly, Arrington,  and Lieu for introducing this bipartisan legislation that will save  children's lives.   Reese's Law is named after Reese Hamsmith, an 18-month-old girl who  lost her life from complications caused by swallowing a button battery.  These are small, single-cell batteries that look like a disc or a  button. Today, they are used to power common household electronics like  television remotes, key fobs, and meat thermometers. Because of their  small size and availability around the house, button cell or coin  batteries pose a serious  [[Page H7114]]  harm to children under 6 who can suffer serious injuries or death if  they swallow these batteries.   According to Reese's mother, Trista Hamsmith, Reese was a spunky,  sassy, full-of-life little girl who at an early age took the attention  of an entire room the moment she walked in. While Trista was in the  hospital with Reese, she decided that she wanted to spread awareness  about the dangers of button batteries. In her testimony before our  committee, Trista said about Reese: ``Her Earthly battle may be over,  but her true battle, her true plan, and her true purpose has just  begun.''   Reese's Law requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to  establish mandatory safety standards to protect children from ingesting  button cell or coin batteries.   The CPSC's standards should include requirements for button cell or  coin battery packaging to make the batteries more difficult to access.  The packages must also include warning labels to warn consumers about  the dangers of ingesting these products and instruct consumers about  keeping new and used batteries out of the reach of children.   This legislation is a testament to the bravery and tireless advocacy  of Trista Hamsmith and parents everywhere who have lost children to  accidental ingestion of these products. This is crucial legislation  that will save kids' lives, and that is why I call on my colleagues to  support it today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky) who chairs our Consumer  Protection and Commerce Subcommittee, from which this bill came.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as I said, this bill is a testament to the  bravery and tireless advocacy of Trista Hamsmith and parents everywhere  who have lost children to accidental ingestion of these products. So  this is a crucial bill that will save kids' lives, and that is why I  call on my colleagues to support it today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H7115]]     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4551) to amend the U.S. SAFE WEB Act of 2006 to provide for  reporting with respect to cross-border complaints involving ransomware  or other cyber-related attacks, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4551         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4551.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4551, the RANSOMWARE  Act.   Ransomware and cyberattacks by foreign actors are an unfortunate  reality of the modern world, and the United States must be as prepared  as possible to address them.   In 2006, Congress passed the SAFE WEB Act to bolster the Federal  Trade Commission's authority to receive information from its foreign  counterparts and take investigative action in response.   FTC action is critical since the number of consumer complaints  against foreign businesses is staggering, with over 255,000 complaints  submitted to the FTC's database between 2015 and 2019. The estimated  dollar value of losses from just these submitted complaints is in the  hundreds of millions of dollars.   H.R. 4551 amends the SAFE WEB Act by adding important new FTC  reporting requirements. The legislation requires the FTC to provide  regular reports to Congress describing cross-border complaints it  receives that involve ransomware and other cyberattacks by foreign  individuals, companies, and governments with ties to specific  countries.   This bill also boosts the FTC's role in protecting consumers from  ransomware and cyberattacks by helping the FTC and Congress better  understand these attacks and how to combat them. It also requires the  FTC to submit any legislative recommendations  [[Page H7116]]  to advance our Nation's security against these types of attacks. This  information is crucial in our continued efforts to address this serious  issue.   Mr. Speaker, protecting Americans and our businesses against  cyberattacks from malicious foreign actors is not a partisan issue, and  that is why members of the Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously  supported this bill, and why I strongly support it today.   I thank Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee Ranking Member  Bilirakis for his tireless efforts on this legislation, and I urge  everyone to support this important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to stress how important this  bill is. We have heard from the speakers on the Republican side, and I  certainly agree with everything they have said about the increased  ransomware and cyberattacks by foreign actors and bad actors like  Beijing and Russia and some of the others that have been mentioned. It  is really important that we pass this bill to protect the United  States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3962) to authorize notaries public to perform, and to  establish minimum standards for, electronic notarizations and remote  notarizations that occur in or affect interstate commerce, to require  any Federal court to recognize notarizations performed by a notarial  officer of any State, to require any State to recognize notarizations  performed by a notarial officer of any other State when the  notarization was performed under or relates to a public Act, record, or  judicial proceeding of the notarial officer's State or when the  notarization occurs in or affects interstate commerce, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3962         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3962.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 3962, the Securing  and Enabling Commerce Using Remote and Electronic Notarization Act of  2022.   In the modern era, you can cash a check, book a flight, and lock and  unlock your doors all from the convenience of your smartphone. To get  something notarized, a process of authenticating documents required for  wills, marriage certificates, mortgages, and other valuable assets,  many States still require a person to physically appear before a notary  public.   During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person notarizations  were not only inconvenient but also posed a health risk. In-person  notarizations forced far too many consumers to choose between  potentially exposing themselves to COVID-19 in purchasing a house or  updating their wills.   To protect consumers and commerce, dozens of States enacted laws or  took emergency actions to permit electronic and remote online  notarizations. Such notarizations allow the consumer and the notary to  execute notarizations through secure audio-visual communications.   As our lives are returning to a new normal, it has become apparent  that electronic and remote online notarizations are a valuable tool for  facilitating commerce and making notarial services more accessible.  Such tools are particularly important for vulnerable populations like  the elderly, underserved communities, and those  [[Page H7119]]  lacking access to reliable transportation.   But State action alone cannot ensure universal access to electronic  and remote online notarizations that need robust security standards and  consumer protections. This Nation lacks a universal standard for  electronic and remote online notarizations.   As a result, there is no standard that permits nationwide use of  electronic and remote online notarizations, creates robust security  requirements, and ensures electronic and remote online notarizations  are valid nationwide.   That is why I thank Congresswoman Dean for the SECURE Notarization  Act. This legislation will transition notarization to the 21st century  without sacrificing security, making the process more convenient and  safer for the American public.   I commend Representative Dean for her leadership on this bipartisan  legislation. She has been pressing for this to get out of committee and  on the floor, and we are finally here today.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3962  today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H7120]]         Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to support this very important piece of bipartisan  legislation. In the aftermath of COVID, we realize more and more that  this type of electronic notarization really is the way to go.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 8454) to expand research on cannabidiol and marijuana, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8454         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

It shall not be a violation of the Controlled Substances       Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) for a State-licensed physician to       discuss--        (1) the currently known potential harms and benefits of       marijuana derivatives, including cannabidiol, as a treatment       with the legal guardian of the patient of the physician if       the patient is a child; or        (2) the currently known potential harms and benefits of       marijuana and marijuana derivatives, including cannabidiol,       as a treatment with the patient or the legal guardian of the       patient of the physician if the patient is a legal adult.                         TITLE IV--FEDERAL RESEARCH       SEC. 401. FEDERAL RESEARCH.         (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human       Services, in coordination with the Director of the National       Institutes of Health and the heads of other relevant Federal       agencies, shall submit to the Caucus on International       Narcotics Control, the Committee on the Judiciary, and the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the       Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the       Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives a       report on--        (1) the potential therapeutic effects of cannabidiol or       marijuana on serious medical conditions, including       intractable epilepsy;        (2) the potential effects of marijuana, including--        (A) the effect of increasing delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol       levels on the human body and developing adolescent brains;       and        (B) the effect of various delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol       levels on cognitive abilities, such as those that are       required to operate motor vehicles or other heavy equipment;       and        (3) the barriers associated with researching marijuana or       cannabidiol in States that have legalized the use of such       substances, which shall include--        (A) recommendations as to how such barriers might be       overcome, including whether public-private partnerships or       Federal-State research partnerships may or should be       implemented to provide researchers with access to additional       strains of marijuana and cannabidiol; and        (B) recommendations as to what safeguards must be in place       to verify--        (i) the levels of tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, or       other cannabinoids contained in products obtained from such       States is accurate; and        (ii) that such products do not contain harmful or toxic       components.        (b) Activities.--To the extent practicable, the Secretary       of Health and Human Services, either directly or through       awarding grants, contacts, or cooperative agreements, shall       expand and coordinate the activities of the National       Institutes of Health and other relevant Federal agencies to       better determine the effects of cannabidiol and marijuana, as       outlined in the report submitted under paragraphs (1) and (2)       of subsection (a).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 8454.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8454, the Medical Marijuana  and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act, legislation that would expand  comprehensive cannabis research.   In March, the Senate passed S. 253, the Cannabidiol and Marihuana  Research Expansion Act. In April, the House considered and passed H.R.  5657, the Medical Marijuana Research Act, which also passed with strong  bipartisan support last Congress.   The bill before us today, H.R. 8454, represents a bipartisan,  bicameral agreement that resolves the differences between both bills  and brings us to a historic, overdue moment for Congress.   The consumption of marijuana and marijuana-derived CBD for medical  use is approved and regulated in 37 States, the District of Columbia,  Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This translates to tens  of millions of Americans consuming marijuana every year. Yet, we still  do not have a comprehensive body of research on the safety or  therapeutic effects or benefits of marijuana products.   Because of its status as a schedule I substance, research on  marijuana has been regulated in a restrictive, time-consuming way, and  the existing research is not representative of the products that are  currently available to many Americans.   H.R. 8454 streamlines the registration process for conducting  research on marijuana and manufacturing marijuana products for research  purposes and drug development. The bill maintains the appropriate  oversight and control by the Department of Health and Human Services  and the Drug Enforcement Administration and requires both applicants  and regulators to adhere to clear protocols and timelines.   The bill requires HHS and DEA to respond to registration applicants  in a timely manner and requires a regular assessment to confirm an  adequate supply of marijuana, including specific  [[Page H7123]]  strains, for medical research. This ensures that the marijuana being  provided for medical research appropriately reflects the strains and  THC content in millions of products across the country.   Mr. Speaker, this bill also clarifies that doctors can discuss with  patients the potential harms and benefits of marijuana as a medical  treatment.   Finally, H.R. 8454 requires HHS to submit a report to Congress on the  potential therapeutic effects of marijuana and CBD for serious medical  conditions, effects on the developing human brain and body, and  existing barriers to research.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Blumenauer, Harris, Holmes  Norton, Dingell, Cohen, Griffith, Lee, and Case for their leadership on  this issue. I urge my colleagues to support the bill and look forward  to the Senate acting expeditiously on our agreement to expand  comprehensive cannabis research while protecting public health and  safety.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I think this is a great way of  dealing with this issue overall and getting the Senate on board.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 623) to require certain civil penalties to be transferred to  a fund through which amounts are made available for the Gabriella  Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program at the National Institutes  of Health, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 623         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Gabriella Miller Kids First       Research Act 2.0''.       SEC. 2. FUNDING FOR THE PEDIATRIC RESEARCH INITIATIVE.         The Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) is       amended--        (1) in section 402A(a)(2) (42 U.S.C. 282a(a)(2))--        (A) in the heading--        (i) by striking ``10-year''; and        (ii) by striking ``through common fund'';        (B) by striking ``to the Common Fund'' and inserting ``to       the Division of Program Coordination, Planning, and Strategic       Initiatives'';        (C) by striking ``10-Year'';        (D) by striking ``and reserved under subsection       (c)(1)(B)(i) of this section''; and        (E) by inserting before the period the following: ``, and       $25,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2023 through 2027'';        (2) in each of paragraphs (1)(A) and (2)(C) of section       402A(c) (42 U.S.C. 282a(c)), by striking ``section       402(b)(7)(B)'' and inserting ``section 402(b)(7)(B)(i)''; and        (3) in section 402(b)(7)(B)(ii) (42 U.S.C.       282(b)(7)(B)(ii)), by striking ``the Common Fund'' and       inserting ``the Division of Program Coordination, Planning,       and Strategic Initiatives''.       SEC. 3. COORDINATION OF NIH FUNDING FOR PEDIATRIC RESEARCH.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress       that the Director of the National Institutes of Health should       continue to oversee and coordinate research that is conducted       or supported by the National Institutes of Health for       research on pediatric cancer and other pediatric diseases and       conditions, including through the Pediatric Research       Initiative Fund.        (b) Avoiding Duplication.--Section 402(b)(7)(B)(ii) of the       Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 282(b)(7)(B)(ii)) is       amended by inserting ``and shall prioritize, as appropriate,       such pediatric research that does not duplicate existing       research activities of the National Institutes of Health''       before ``; and''.       SEC. 4. REPORT ON PROGRESS AND INVESTMENTS IN PEDIATRIC                     RESEARCH.         Not later than 5 years after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall       submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report       that--        (1) details pediatric research projects and initiatives       receiving funds allocated pursuant to section       402(b)(7)(B)(ii) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       282(b)(7)(B)(ii)); and  [[Page H7125]]         (2) summarizes advancements made in pediatric research with       funds allocated pursuant to section 402(b)(7)(B)(ii) of the       Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 282(b)(7)(B)(ii)).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 623.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 623, the Gabriella Miller Kids  First Research Act 2.0.   We are considering this bill in the memory of Gabriella Miller, who  was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor and sadly passed at the  age of 10 in 2013.   Mr. Speaker, cancer is one of the leading causes of death in American  children, but only 4 percent of the National Cancer Institute's budget  is dedicated to pediatric cancer research.   The Kids First program was first established at the National  Institutes of Health in 2014 after Congress passed the original  Gabriella Miller Kids First Research bill. The goal of this program is  to enhance collaborative research on childhood cancer and structural  birth defects, including the development of a large-scale database of  clinical and genetic data to discover shared genetic pathways between  the disorders.   Since its creation, the Kids First program has recruited over 40  pediatric cancer and structural birth defect cohorts for whole genome  sequencing, representing 20,000 pediatric patients and 48,000 genomes.  The database developed and maintained by the Kids First program has  become a critical tool for pediatric cancer researchers and  practitioners across the country.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us reauthorizes and transfers the Kids  First program from the NIH Common Fund to the Division of Program  Coordination, Planning, and Strategic Initiatives, which will give the  program more stability and allow for appropriate planning. The  legislation also increases the funding authorization to $25 million  annually for 5 years.   I thank Representative Wexton for her leadership on this issue and  Ranking Members Rodgers and Guthrie for working with us on this  important bill.   Finally, I thank Ellyn and Mark Miller for their relentless advocacy  in honor of their daughter. The Kids First program may lead to the next  big medical breakthrough for some of the rarest cancers, and those  breakthroughs simply would not be possible without their longtime  commitment to this effort.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms. Wexton), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, again, I think this is a very important  bill, and I thank Representative Wexton for her leadership on this  issue.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that Members on both sides of the aisle support  the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
