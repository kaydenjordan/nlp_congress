 Mr. Speaker, the leading cause of death of  kids in America is now gun violence.   Mr. Speaker, 110 Americans die every day in America because of gun  violence.   Five weeks ago, ten people from my community of Buffalo, New York,  were shot dead by a white supremacist who planned an attack, drove 300  miles to Buffalo and a Black community of our city.   There was a retired police officer by the name of Aaron Salter. A 30- year veteran of the Buffalo Police Department, he was working security  that day.   Someone once said that the best way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a  good guy with a gun. Officer Aaron Salter was a good guy with a gun,  but he didn't stand a chance. He didn't stand a chance because he was  outgunned and outequipped.   Our police officers in America, in Buffalo, and throughout the  country are outgunned by the bad guys. They are outprotected by the bad  guys.
