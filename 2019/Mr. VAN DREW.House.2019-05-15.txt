 Madam Speaker, from the moment of their founding in  1882, the Knights of Columbus have made charity their first principle.   Their Liberty Council 1910, based at the parish of the Holy Cross in  Bridgeton, New Jersey, is made up of a diverse group of men of the  Catholic faith who are guided by the principles of charity, unity,  fraternity, but particularly, by charity.   A short list of the good works they do includes: blood drives,  planning and implementing youth activities, painting the parking lines  in their churches, helping the homeless, advocating for the most  vulnerable in our society, leading a diaper drive for new mothers in  need of assistance, and helping with various fundraisers in the parish.   The Knights are committed to serving their parish, their community,  and their country, and they do it without fanfare and without expecting  thanks.   I want to thank the men of Liberty Council 1910 and all the local  councils for their service to South Jersey, and the National  Organization for its service to our great country, the United States of  America.                            ____________________
