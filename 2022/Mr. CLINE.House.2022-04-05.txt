 Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to express my thanks to the  gentleman from Michigan for his years of service to this country, to  this body, and to the great State of Michigan.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Virginia Military Institute  Club Boxing Team, which recently won the United States Intercollegiate  Boxing Association National Championships in Atlanta, Georgia. This  victory marks the program's second national title in seven years, the  last of which came in 2015.   Throughout this year's tournament, the team amassed an impressive 20- 8 record, scoring six knockouts, one technical knockout, nine unanimous  decisions, and four split decisions. Of the 14 cadets competing, 5 won  individual national championship belts, while another 7 took home  silver medals. Each of these national champions and runners-up also  earned All-American individual honors for their stellar performances in  their respective weight classes.   The team's coach, Joe Shafer, credited their win to preparation,  dedication, and hard work. Coach Shafer said, ``We represented the  Institute with a fighting spirit: honoring VMI's history, upholding the  passions of our forefathers, and personifying the principles of  excellence for VMI.''   The cadets certainly showcased the very best of the Virginia Military  Institute, and the team should be incredibly proud of their efforts.  Congratulations again to these national champions. They made the  Commonwealth proud.                          America's Economic Crisis     Mr. Speaker, our Nation is in the midst of an economic  crisis, yet the Biden administration fails to take action to ease the  burden on American families.   When inflation began to soar and hit a 40-year high recently, the  President's own chief of staff shrugged it off as a ``high-class  problem,'' insinuating that it was only affecting the wealthy, which we  know not to be true.   Instead of offering solutions, this administration offers excuses.  Perhaps worst of all is the fact that when given the chance to combat  soaring prices by reining in wasteful spending, President Biden went  entirely in the opposite direction by proposing a $5.8 trillion budget  that is more of the same liberal, tax-and-spend policies that have led  us to this economic crisis in the first place.   If Biden's budget were adopted, the national debt would reach a new  record by the end of the decade, growing by over $15 trillion, reaching  $45 trillion by 2032 or about $350,000 per household.   Further, not only does his budget proposal include nearly $2.5  trillion in new or increased taxes, it also increases the corporate tax  rate to 28 percent, higher than even Communist China. As an American, I  am offended by that. Every American should be offended by that.   The Tax Foundation estimated that this increase would kill 159,000  jobs, shrink the economy by $720 billion, and cut wages for low-income  workers.   President Biden's budget will leave the overwhelming majority of  Americans behind, explode the national debt,  [[Page H4157]]  and cause inflation to skyrocket even higher. Our citizens deserve  better than what their President is giving them.                            ____________________
