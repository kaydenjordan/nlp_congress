 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question from Senator Markey to the House  managers:         On Monday, President Trump tweeted, ``The Democrat       controlled House never even asked John Bolton to testify.''       So that the record is accurate, did House impeachment       investigators ask Mr. Bolton to testify?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, the answer is yes. Of course, we asked  John Bolton to testify in the House, and he refused. We asked his  deputy, Dr. Kupperman, to testify, and he refused. Fortunately, we  asked their deputy, Dr. Fiona Hill, to testify, and she did. We asked  her deputy, Colonel Vindman, to testify, and he did. We did seek the  testimony of John Bolton as well as Dr. Kupperman, and they refused.   When we subpoenaed Dr. Kupperman, he sued us. He took us to court.  When we raised a subpoena with John Bolton's counsel, the same counsel  for Dr. Kupperman, the answer was, ``Senator, you serve us with a  subpoena, and we will sue you, too.'' We knew, based on the McGahn  litigation, it would take months, if not years, to force John Bolton to  come and testify.   Because, I think, this is an essential point to underscore, as the  President's lawyers say, ``They didn't try hard enough to get John  Bolton,'' or ``they should have subpoenaed John Bolton''--that this is  what they are telling you--let me show you what they are telling the  court in the McGahn litigation, if we could pull up slide 39.   This is from the President's lawyers who are in the court of appeals  right now in the McGahn litigation: ``The committee [meaning our  committee] lacks article III standing to sue to enforce a congressional  subpoena demanding testimony from an individual on matters related to  his duties as an Executive Branch official.''   I mean, it takes your breath away, the duplicity of that argument.  They are before you, saying: They should have tried harder to get these  witnesses. They should have subpoenaed. They should have litigated for  years; and down the street in the Federal courthouse, they are arguing:  Judge, you need to throw them out. They have no standing to sue to  force a witness to testify.   Are we really prepared to accept that?   Counsel says to think about the precedent we would be setting if you  allow the House to impeach a President and you permit them to call  witnesses. I would submit: Think about the precedent you would be  setting if you don't allow witnesses in a trial. That, to me, is the  much more dangerous precedent here.   I will tell you something even more dangerous, and this was something  that we anticipated from the very beginning, which is that we  understood, when we got to this point, they could no longer contest the  facts that the President withheld military aid from an ally at war to  coerce that ally into doing the President's political dirty work. So  now they have fallen back on, You shouldn't hear any further evidence  or any further witnesses on this subject.   What is more, we are going to use the end-all argument: So what? The  President is free to abuse his power. We are going to rely on a  constitutional theory--a fringe theory--that even the advocate of which  says is outside the consensus of constitutional law to say that a  President can abuse his power with impunity. Imagine where that leads.  The President can abuse his power with impunity.   That argument made by Professor Dershowitz is at odds with the  Attorney General's own expressed opinion on the subject, with Ken  Starr's expressed opinion on the subject, and with other counsel for  the President. Jonathan Turley, who testified in the House, said that  theory is constitutionally, effectively, nonsense. Even 60-year-old  Alan Dershowitz doesn't agree with 81-year-old Alan Dershowitz and for  a reason--because where that conclusion leads us is that a President  can abuse his power in any kind of way, and there is nothing you can do  about it.   Are we really ready to accept the position that this President or the  next can withhold hundreds of millions of dollars of military aid to an  ally at war unless he gets help in his reelection?   Would you say that you could, as President, withhold disaster relief  from a Governor unless that Governor got his Attorney General to  investigate the President's political rival?   That, to me, is the most dangerous argument of all. It is a danger to  have a President engage in this conduct, and it is dangerous to have a  trial with no witnesses and set that precedent. The biggest danger of  all would be to accept the idea that a President could abuse his office  in this way and that the Congress is powerless to do anything about it.  That is certainly not what the Founders intended.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Tennessee.
