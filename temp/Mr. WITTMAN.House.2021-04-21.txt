 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my good  friend, Congressman  Bobby Scott, on receiving the Lifetime Achievement  Award from the L. Douglas Wilder School of Government and Public  Affairs at Virginia Commonwealth University on April 15, 2021.   The Lifetime Achievement Award recognizes an individual Virginian  whose career represents the highest values of public service and  citizenship, and who has made a substantial contribution to the good of  the Commonwealth.   Congressman  Bobby Scott is incredibly deserving of this recognition  and award. He has spent more than four decades in public service,  serving in the Virginia General Assembly for 15 years prior to being  elected, and now serving Virginia's Third District in the U.S. House of  Representatives, where he has been since 1992.   It is my honor to serve the Commonwealth of Virginia with a servant  leader like  Bobby Scott. We share the same desire to work tirelessly  for Virginians and to advocate for the needs of the Commonwealth.   Please join me in congratulating  Bobby Scott on receiving the  Lifetime Achievement Award and in thanking him for his dedicated  service on behalf of all Virginians.                            ____________________
