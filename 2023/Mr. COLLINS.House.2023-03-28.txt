 Mr. Speaker, as I have said on many occasions on the  floor, I am a businessman, and we face a myriad of challenges out  there, not just small business but medium and large business, as well.   I also sit on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and  Aviation Subcommittee and, in doing so, have been talking with numerous  people in the aviation industry, either talking to them or listening to  them in hearings. There is one thing that has been a common theme out  there, and that is workforce challenges.   It seems that the cost of joining the aviation family is keeping a  lot of people out of choosing this vital career. As the demand for  passenger and cargo transportation increases, pilot and mechanic  recruitment isn't keeping up.   That is why, today, I am proud to introduce the Aviation Workforce  Development Act. It is a commonsense proposal to give Americans who  want to pursue a career in aviation, on the ground or in the air, the  same tools as those seeking 4-year degrees, with zero increased cost to  taxpayers.   This bill will allow Americans with 529 plans to use their money to  attend FAA-certified pilot and mechanic training programs. That is it.  It is just another way for students to save for a career in aviation.   I thank Representatives   Jimmy Panetta and   Mike Kelly and Aviation  Subcommittee Ranking Member   Steve Cohen for co-leading on this  effort. I also give a big thank-you to Drew Ferguson, Lucy McBath,  Julia Brownley, and Russell Fry for joining us as original cosponsors.   Mr. Speaker, I am calling on all Members to join us to help empower  more Americans to take to the skies and shore up our aviation  workforce.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, it was just this morning we were having a  hearing and talking about Biden's bloated $1.2 trillion infrastructure  Green New Deal. One-third of that act went to actual infrastructure  projects, and it looks like they are in trouble now because of  inflation.   It is one of the main reasons I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the  Lower Energy Costs Act.   Over the past 2 years under the Biden administration, we have seen  gas prices that are up nearly a dollar after hitting a historic high of  $5 per gallon last summer. With energy demand only increasing, we can't  afford the Biden administration's anti-energy agenda hitting our  pocketbooks any harder.   This crucial piece of legislation will finally end the Biden  administration's war on American energy production by prohibiting  President Biden from banning fracking, repealing restrictions on the  import and export of natural gas, and stopping Biden's $6 billion  natural gas tax.   This bill will also incentivize domestic mineral production to ensure  the U.S. has the resources necessary to compete with China.   We will reform the National Environmental Policy Act to modernize and  shorten the Federal regulatory process that takes years to get through.  The days of projects taking decades to get off the ground are over. In  the U.S., it can take more than 10 years to get a permit to mine, while  our neighbors, our competitors, are much faster, further incentivizing  our companies to export mineral production.   That changes today when we reopen the cleanest energy in the world,  American-made energy.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1.
