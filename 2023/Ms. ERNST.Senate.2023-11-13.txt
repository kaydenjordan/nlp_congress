 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Worth Brewing Company of Northwood, IA, as the Senate Small Business of  the Week.   Worth Brewing Company was founded by husband and wife Peter Ausenhus  and Margaret Bishop in 2007. Peter started in the brewing industry as a  homebrewer while working in the publishing industry. Prior to founding  Worth Brewing Company, he made a career transition and worked at Summit  Brewing Company, a microbrewer based in St. Paul, MN. Worth Brewing  Company opened in the 1886 Worth County State Bank building on historic  Main Street in Northwood, IA. During their early years, Peter both  renovated and operated the brewery while Margaret ran her engineering  consulting business upstairs. Due to their growing business, Peter and  Margaret moved Worth Brewing Company across the street to the 1896  International Order of Odd Fellows--IOOF--Erickson building in 2015.  Worth Brewing Company reopened in the new location in 2016.   Worth Brewing Company has seven year-round beers on their menu and a  specialty beer every month. In addition to beer, they also host ``Pizza  Fridays,'' food trucks, and have a rotating list of drink specials.  Worth Brewing Company also hosts live music, pub trivia, the ``Books A- Brewin''' Club, and other community events. In 2023, Worth  [[Page S5478]]  Brewing Company celebrated their 16th business anniversary.   Worth Brewing Company is actively involved in the Northwood community  and has been recognized for contributions to the microbrewery and  historic preservation industries. In 2019, Worth Brewing Company won  the Adrian D. Anderson Award from Preserve Iowa for their preservation  of the IOOF-Erickson building. Previously, in 2016, they were awarded  the Preservation at its Best by Preserve Iowa for their work on the  IOOF-Erickson building. In 2015, Governor Terry Branstad visited Worth  Brewing Company to congratulate the business on their expansion from  the 1886 Worth County State Bank building to the IOOF-Erickson  building. Peter Ausenhus and Margaret Bishop are actively involved in  animal charities and historic preservation philanthropies in both the  Northwood community and the State of Iowa.   Worth Brewing Company's commitment to providing quality beers,  ciders, and arts in Northwood is clear. I want to congratulate Peter  Ausenhus, Margaret Bishop, and the entire team at Worth Brewing Company  for their continued dedication to Worth County. I look forward to  seeing their continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
