 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, after months of waiting, the Senate is  finally on track to take up and pass the National Defense Authorization  Act, 13 days now before Christmas. The pointless delay in this  fundamentally critical legislation has been a major point of  frustration, not just for colleagues here in the Senate but for the  leadership at the Pentagon and the people who need to make plans for  America's defense.   The Senate Armed Services Committee completed its work last summer,  but the majority leader apparently had other priorities and refused to  put the bill on the floor until now. It simply wasn't a priority.   We spent week after week confirming President Biden's judicial  nominees, but the majority leader couldn't seem to find the time to  take up and pass a must-pass piece of legislation, the annual Defense  bill.   And this is not the first time. It is the second year in a row that  the Senate has not passed its own version of the National Defense  Authorization Act, and so we find ourselves repeating the same bungled  process that played out last year.   Thanks, however, to Senator Inhofe and Senator Reed and our  colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, this bill still reflects  the hard work of our Senate colleagues.   But I want to underscore how unconventional this year's approach was  and make clear why this should not be the norm. We need to return to  what we call regular order around here, which is actually to allow all  100 Members of the Senate an opportunity to fully participate in  crafting critical legislation like this.   Of course, the Armed Services Committee did its job. The committee  held its hearings, worked with Members throughout the Senate, and  compiled a strong bill. But the majority leader is going to put a bill  on the floor and probably, in all likelihood, not allow any amendments  to that bill. In other words, this bill was voted out of the Armed  Services Committee, it was preconferenced with the House of  Representatives, and it is going to be laid before the American people  and this Senate as a fait accompli without adequate opportunity for  debate or amendment or for other noncommittee Members to have a hand in  crafting this important piece of legislation.   This is not how the Senate is supposed to work. Members of the Senate  don't run for the Senate and serve their States with the intent of  being potted plants when it comes to crafting important legislation,  and particularly this legislation, which is perhaps the single-most  important thing we do around here.   So for 2 years, we have skipped these critical steps. But this cannot  be the norm, and here is why: The National Defense Authorization Act  impacts every servicemember's pay. It pertains to military  construction, improvement of barracks, and military modernization. This  bill needs to follow regular order. It needs to be completed on time.   This bill should have been signed into law by President Biden last  September. We are more than 2 months into the fiscal year, and our  military commanders are still waiting for Congress to pass this  legislation and provide the certainty they need to plan for the future.   Mr. President, as you know, I am just talking about the authorization  bill. The actual appropriations process is similarly broken, where,  ordinarily, the 12 appropriation bills would come across the floor as  individual bills or as so-called minibuses rather than the anticipated  omnibus, which is $1.7 trillion worth of spending. The top line of that  bill has not even been agreed to by the ranking member and the chairman  of the Appropriations Committee and the leadership on both sides of the  Congress. Yet we are sitting around, again, 13 days before Christmas,  wondering: Are we going to be presented with another continuing  resolution--it looks like we are--that will take us to the 2 days  before Christmas, December 23? And then this bill of $1.7 trillion,  roughly speaking, will then be plopped out in front of us, and the only  option we will be given is a chance to vote no or to vote yes.   This is not the way the Senate should be operating. It is really a  slap in the face to the American people, who deserve a measure of  transparency, and to the Members of the Senate, who deserve at least  the courtesy and consideration of being able to participate in the  process, rather than being given the ugly choice between voting for a  $1.7 trillion omnibus appropriations bill we had no hand in writing or  to shut down the government. That is the decision that Senator Schumer  has chosen to give Members of this Senate, Republican and Democrat  alike. It is really outrageous.   Back to the Defense bill, it includes a significant increase in  defense funding--at least the authorization for that funding--coming in  at roughly $45 billion above the White House's most recent budget  request. So on a bipartisan basis, Members of the House and Senate-- Republicans and Democrats--agreed that President Biden short-handed the  Defense bill by about $45 billion.   Given the far-reaching threats facing our country and the world and  the continued impact of inflation, this is a necessary increase, and I  am glad House and Senate negotiators agreed that President Biden's  request was insufficient.   First and foremost, though, this bill should take care of our brave  men and women who serve in our Armed Forces. Thankfully, it includes an  authorization for the largest pay raise for our troops in two  decades. That is particularly important when inflation is roughly at a  40-year high. servicemembers and their families are facing the same  inflation headwinds as folks all across the country. So, starting next  month, they will receive a much-needed and well-deserved 4.6 percent  pay increase.    This year's National Defense Authorization Act also includes a range  of reforms to better support military families. In an all-volunteer  military, it is critical that we not only support the men and women who  wear the uniform but also the families who support them and, in effect,  serve with them.   This bill will extend reimbursement authority for spouse relicensing.  For example, it will ensure that nurses, teachers, and other spouses  whose jobs may require State-specific licenses are not saddled with an  added expense when they are reassigned to a State where their current  license is not valid. They can get a new one in their new home State  without additional expense.   This bill also funds programs in Texas independent school districts  that help military dependent children with severe disabilities.   And I am glad it includes bipartisan legislation that I introduced to  help improve sexual assault and domestic violence prevention policies  within the Department of Defense.   In addition to these reforms, the National Defense Authorization Act  will repeal the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, which led to the dismissal of  8,500 servicemembers. Recruiting has become a growing challenge across  the military, particularly the U.S. Army. Last year, the Army fell  15,000 soldiers short of its benchmark and was only able to recruit 75  percent of its recruitment goal.   Army Secretary Christine Wormuth called it ``the Army's most  challenging recruiting year since the start of the all-volunteer  force.'' Given the threats posed by Russia, China, North Korea, and  Iran, among other threats, this is not the time to force courageous  servicemembers out of the Armed Forces, particularly for a vaccine that  doesn't actually prevent COVID. This isn't like a lot of other vaccines  that will actually prevent you from contracting the virus.   This year's NDAA also authorizes investments in nuclear modernization  and other critical projects. It makes major investments in our military  installations, including those in Texas. It will fund military  construction projects at Fort Hood, Joint Base San Antonio, Corpus  Christi, Fort Bliss, and the Army Reserve Center in Conroe, TX.   It also authorizes 16 new F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, which will be  built by  [[Page S7095]]  Texans in Fort Worth. And it will ensure the United States can  replenish our defense stockpile and remain the arsenal of democracy for  the rest of the world, particularly Ukraine.   As Ukrainian forces continue to defend their country, this  legislation will provide additional resources to help them keep up the  fight. Now, this assistance is not a handout or a charity. As much as  we want to see Ukraine win this war, our financial support is not  entirely altruistic.   The United States is not just investing in a Ukrainian victory. We  are also putting our resources toward a Russian defeat. We are trying  to snuff out the fire before it spreads even further west.   Ukrainian forces have shown tremendous courage and stamina in the  face of Russian attacks, and they deserve our unequivocal support. And  I am gratified, as the Presiding Officer knows, that that support has  been bipartisan and overwhelming. For the last 10 months, the United  States has supplied Ukraine with critical military assistance, and  there is no question that our support has been vital to Ukraine's  success so far. But the one thing we can't supply that Ukraine has  supplied in abundance is a will to fight, and they have done so in a  magnificent way.   But the unavoidable fact is that, when we provide weapons to Ukraine  to defend their sovereignty, we take them out of our own defense  stockpile. The transfer of weapons to Ukraine combined with the  production challenges in the defense industrial base has made it  challenging to quickly replenish our own stockpiles; but this  legislation, when it is passed, will help that. It provides $2.7  billion for new munitions, which will help backfill our stockpiles and  expand production capacity. We need to be ready not just to deal with  the current challenges in Europe; we need to be ready for any  challenge, no matter where it arises, especially including in Asia.   It also provides $1 billion to more than double the size of the  national defense stockpile, which will help safeguard against future  supply chain disruptions. This will ensure that our support for Ukraine  does not come at the cost of our own military readiness.   Well, in all the last-minute political jockeying before this bill was  released, we were at least able to keep unrelated matters out of the  bill. There is no marijuana banking provision, for example--hardly  something that has anything to do with providing support for our brave  men and women in the military.    That is how it should be. We need to eliminate those extraneous  matters. This isn't the place for political horse trading. A well- funded and modern defense is not a Republican priority; it is not a  Democratic priority; it is a national priority. We shouldn't use our  troops as a bargaining chip for woke priorities.   In order to protect the American people and our democracy, our  servicemembers and military commanders need a strong and on-time  National Defense Authorization Act. We are too late for on-time, but  this is ultimately a strong bill that will deliver certainty and  stability to our Armed Forces.   There is no such thing as a perfect bill, of course, but this  legislation will go a long way to support our troops and strengthen our  national security, and I look forward to finally getting a chance to  vote for it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print my bill  for introduction in the Congressional Record. The bill provides for a  primary prevention research agenda and workforce.

A bill to require the President to submit to Congress a  report on United States Government efforts to collect, analyze, and  preserve evidence and information related to war crimes and other  atrocities committed during the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine  since February 24, 2022, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Foreign Relations.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print my bill  for introduction in the Congressional Record. The bill requires the  President to submit to Congress a report on U.S. Government efforts to  collect, analyze, and preserve evidence and information related to war  crimes and other atrocities committed during the full-scale Russian  invasion of Ukraine.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 5233         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. UKRAINE INVASION WAR CRIMES DETERRENCE AND                     ACCOUNTABILITY ACT.
