 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the nomination of  Mike Pompeo to be the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. At a  time when we are facing massive attacks against privacy rights thanks  to the explosion of technology, we should be greatly troubled by giving  power to a person who has stated flat-out that he wants to expand the  surveillance state, not rein it in.   Here is the kind of world we are now living in, a world that should  be of concern to every freedom-loving American, whether you are  Democrat or Republican or Independent, conservative or progressive. We  are living in a world where government and the private sector often  know where you are at any time. They know where you are. They know  where you are traveling. They know what books you are reading, what Web  sites you are visiting, and maybe the emails you are sending out or  reading.   I hear a whole lot of discussion on the floor of the Senate about  freedom, about our desire to live and defend a free society. I would  ask my colleagues and the American people--when we talk about freedom,  one of the attributes of a free society is the right to live our lives  the way we want to live our lives, without Big brother knowing  everything there is to know about us. You want to do what you want to,  it is your business; I want to do what I want to do, it is my  business--if we are not harming other people. I believe that is a basic  American right and a basic constitutional right, and I want to see  people at the CIA, at the NSA, at other intelligence agencies who, yes,  will be vigorous about defending us from terrorism but will do it in a  way that is constitutional, that protects the civil liberties and the  civil rights of the American people.   According to the Pew Internet Project, today 95 percent of American  adults own a cell phone. More than three-quarters of American adults  own a smartphone. Eighty-eight percent of American adults use the  Internet. These advancements obviously have enormous advantages.  Everybody knows all of the extraordinary things we can do on the  Internet and all the information we can gain. It is almost unthinkable  that we were living not so many years ago without the advantages of the  Internet. All of these advantages, all of these conveniences come with  a price.   If you have a Google account and the GPS enabled on your phone,  Google creates a map for you of every single place you go in a given  day. Facebook amasses a massive amount of data on you to better target  commercials and advertisements to you. Credit card companies track your  spending habits. Even innocuous things like a loyalty program in which  you gain benefits by buying at a certain store give the private sector  and the government eventually access to a massive amount of information  about you.   When you go to the grocery store and scan your card, it is very  convenient, moves things faster, and you can get a discount, but the  store gets to track everything you purchase. Is that really what want?  Do you want the whole world to have knowledge of everything you  purchase? For just one rather famous example, Target--a huge chain in  America--could tell if a woman was pregnant based on what she was  purchasing at the store. Do we really feel comfortable about that kind  of information getting out into the private sector or the government  sector?  [[Page S383]]    If you are wearing a tracking device today to count your steps, to  count your heart rate and your sleep patterns, you may see it as a way  to become healthier. Your employer or health insurance company,  however, may see it as a way to charge you more if you don't meet  certain employee wellness targets. Are we really comfortable about  corporations knowing all about our health? If you are dealing with a  serious illness, maybe it is something you and your family want to keep  within the bosom of your family and not spread to the whole world.   That companies are collecting this much information on their own is  very troubling to me, but Mr. Pompeo apparently wants to go even  further. Last January, he published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal  in which he wrote:         Congress should pass a law reestablishing collection of all       metadata, and combining it with publicly available financial       and lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable       database. Legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance       should be removed.    Wow. What we are talking about is the U.S. Government having, in many  ways, more information about us than we may even understand about our  own lives. In many ways, it sounds to me that we are moving toward an  Orwellian society where, between the government and the private sector,  there is very little about ourselves that is not known by somebody  else. I am very, very uncomfortable about that.   I want at the head of the CIA somebody who understands thoroughly the  Constitution of the United States and privacy rights and understands  that we can fight terrorism effectively within the Constitution and the  privacy rights guaranteed to the people of our country.   Since June of 2013, here is what we have already learned that the NSA  collects: phone call metadata, including the numbers of both parties-- my number and the number of the person I call--the location, time, and  duration of that telephone call. NSA has access to text messages, email  chat, and Internet browsing history, smartphone app data, including map  data, which can pinpoint a person's location to within a few yards.  They have maps of people's social networks and bank and credit card  transactions. That is a lot of information held by the government and/ or the private sector on the personal lives of the American people.   As I have mentioned, there is nobody in this Congress who does not  understand the threat of terrorism and does not want to see our  government be as strong and vigorous as possible in fighting terrorism  and getting all the information we need to effectively combat  terrorism, to make sure that if somebody is a suspect in terrorist  activities, that we go after that person as strongly and as effectively  as we can. I believe from the bottom of my heart that we can do that  without invading the privacy rights of the American people.   It is not acceptable for Senator after Senator to come here and say  we are defending freedom, we live in a free society, and then vote to  allow the government or the private sector to have an unbelievable  amount of knowledge about each and every one of our personal lives.   Now more than ever, it is vital to have a head of the CIA who will  stand up for our Constitution, stand up for privacy rights.  Unfortunately, in my view, Mr. Pompeo is not that individual.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Oklahoma.
