 Madam Speaker, on January 13, 2023, the Secretary of  the Treasury, Janet Yellen, announced that the United States had hit  its debt ceiling, which is a legal authorization that Congress has done  on a recurring basis since the early 1900s that allows our Treasury to  go out and sell bonds so we can pay the bills for our country,  [[Page H686]]  whether it is fentanyl issues, whether it is our military, or whether  it is our education programs.   Normally, when the Secretary of the Treasury gives that type of  announcement, responsible leadership in Congress takes up the task of  extending the debt ceiling so that our government can continue to  function. We are talking about paying the bills for existing budgets  that have already been passed. That is what the debt ceiling empowers  by Congress moving forward.   It has been 18 days since Ms. Yellen's warning to the country and to  the world, and the leadership of the House has done absolutely nothing.  We have passed a series of pointless resolutions that have no legal  impact in terms of real lives of people in this country and a bunch of  bills that we know are immediately dead on arrival in the Senate.    Again, as the clock ticks, the world wants to know: What is the  Speaker's position? What does he want in terms of doing what every  Speaker, Republican and Democrat, has done over and over again to  protect the full faith and credit of our currency and the paper that  the Treasury sells, again, as basically the gold standard in terms of  financial markets across the world?   Mr. McCarthy has not told us.   What is at work here? If we look at the Republican Study Group, which  consists of roughly 170 Members, they have been talking openly and  publicly about the fact that they want to do entitlement reform, which  is to go after Social Security and Medicare.   Madam Speaker, I would just say that this is a very off-target  proposal and solution because, in fact, Social Security has no bearing  in terms of the operating deficit of the Federal Government, which,  again, the Speaker claims that he cares so much about.   Social Security is funded through a separate revenue stream, the  payroll tax that comes out of working people's paychecks every single  pay period that goes into a fund that, again, is separate and distinct  from the operating budget of the Federal Government.   The proposals of the Republican Study Group, which are to raise the  retirement age from 67 to 70 and to impose a degraded level of CPI  cost-of-living adjustment, a changed CPI, would hit middle-class  Americans hard, particularly younger ones because this is definitely  proposed as sort of a two-tiered Social Security system.   There is a fundamental flaw in the whole approach that is being  suggested and discussed by the Republican Study Group, which is the  claim that the Medicare and Social Security systems are entitlements.   Entitlement is not a legal term. It is not a budget term. It is a  political term. It is an attempt to try to mask the fact that Social  Security, since Franklin Roosevelt signed it into law 80 years ago, is  a social insurance program.   If you don't believe me, look at your paycheck. What your paycheck  shows is that the withholding for Social Security is separate from your  Federal taxes, which go into the operating budget of this country, and  is designated as the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, FICA, for  old-age insurance.   Again, it is an insurance program, and it provides coverage for  people who are retired because they have hit retirement age, for young  people who have lost a parent, or for people on disability.   If we were responsible about trying to deal with the fact that Social  Security is going to be challenged in 2033--it is going to have a  shortfall; it is not going to go bankrupt, which the press sometimes  says--there is a solution to that, which is to lift the earnings cap.  Today, basically anyone who earns income above $160,000 suddenly  doesn't have to pay into the Social Security system.   As Warren Buffett, a billionaire, aptly pointed out, he is paying  less into Social Security than his secretary. It is called the Buffett  rule. The solution, which basically says everybody pays the same rate,  or at least people whose income is above $400,000, would overnight push  back the solvency for decades to ensure that young people, in  particular, are going to have Social Security just like all the  Americans in the preceding 80 years have had. That is really one of the  pillars of middle-class economic security.   In the meantime, the clock is ticking. We know that we are really not  just going to go at the debt ceiling, but we are going to hit full  default by June 1.   This leadership has to do the right thing, just like we have done in  past Presidencies and past Congresses: Extend the debt ceiling.                            ____________________
