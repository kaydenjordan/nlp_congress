 Mr. Speaker, since mid-January we have seen a surge of  immigrants coming into the country along our southwest border. The  numbers are staggering, and the situation along the border continues to  deteriorate daily. In March, over 172,000 individuals were encountered  by law enforcement, the highest number of monthly encounters in the  last 15 years.   Last week, I had the opportunity to visit the border and met with  both Federal and State law enforcement officers. We heard repeatedly  that recent changes by the Biden administration have driven the  overwhelming surge.   Lost in the border conversation is the incredible amount of resources  being diverted to try and manage the immigrants we are encountering.  This shift in resources is being exploited by drug cartels who continue  to use the southwest border as the primary pipeline to bring cocaine,  methamphetamine, and fentanyl into the country.   The question can no longer be: Is there a crisis along the border?   But instead it should be: How long will the crisis last, and how bad  must the crisis become before the President will act?                            ____________________
