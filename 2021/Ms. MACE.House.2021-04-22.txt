 Mr. Speaker, I have seen more damage done in the first 100  days of this administration than I thought possible in 4 years. Rather  than unity, it has been division. Rather than working together, it has  been partisanship.   We are hearing even today in the comments that we are trying to stoke  racial division in this country. This is nothing but a naked power play  today. That is all this is about.   People who can't get their radical agenda passed under the system our  Framers set up now want to blow it up. This is nothing but ideological  terrorism by those willing to completely ignore our Constitution and  system of government.   Whether it is attacks on the First, Second or Fourth Amendment, or  turning our Federal seat of government over to two more far-left  Senators, they simply do not care. They want what they want.   This is not about a balance of power. This is about more power. This  is about government-run healthcare; a $93 trillion Green New Deal;  packing the Supreme Court; higher taxes; and a bigger, less efficient  form of government.
