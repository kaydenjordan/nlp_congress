 Madam Speaker, I rise today because a couple  of months ago, a freight train derailed in my district. Thankfully, the  cars that derailed were not carrying any hazardous materials and no one  was hurt. Earlier this month, another passenger train derailed nearby  as it left the station.   Madam Speaker, 25 percent of the Nation's trains pass through the  Chicagoland area, and many of the country's largest freight lines pass  through my district.   There are children in my district who hop over mile-long trains that  block their path to school.   So why am I talking about rail safety when we are supposed to be  talking about the default?   Because in Illinois alone the Republican default on America act would  take away more than a year's worth of rail safety inspection days--470  to be exact.   If they get their way, Republicans will make rail more dangerous in  my district and across the country, and when accidents happen,  communities like mine pay the price. For that reason, and for the many  reasons that my colleagues are here to bring up, we continue to reject  the Republicans' default plan.
