 Madam Speaker, today is legislative day  5 since House Democrats subverted the Military Surviving Spouses Equity  Act from being a standalone bill.   I am grateful that 86 percent of Congress, 371 Members, have  cosponsored this legislation, who were recruited by determined widows  in the veterans service organizations.   As Minority Whip   Steve Scalise noted on the floor last week:   Here is a bill that can quickly get to the President's desk, and it  gets included in other pieces of legislation that might come months  away. But here is a bill where a Member worked in good faith under the  rules that were created, and it was unfortunate that the rule to bring  the NDAA bill to the floor turned off the Consensus Calendar  specifically for that bill, that one bill, which happened to be the  first bill that met that requirement.   We should work together, bipartisan, to bring the Military Surviving  Spouses Equity Act up for a standalone to eliminate the widow's tax.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
