 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2302) to designate the facility of the United States Postal  Service located at 259 Nassau Street, Suite 2 in Princeton, New Jersey,  as the ``Dr. John F. Nash, Jr. Post Office''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2302         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DR. JOHN F. NASH, JR. POST OFFICE.         (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal       Service located at 259 Nassau Street, Suite 2 in Princeton,       New Jersey, shall be known and designated as the ``Dr. John       F. Nash, Jr. Post Office''.        (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,       document, paper, or other record of the United States to the       facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be       a reference to the ``Dr. John F. Nash, Jr. Post Office''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I speak in support of H.R. 2302, introduced by the  gentlewoman, Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman from New Jersey. The  bill designates the post office located at 259 Nassau Street, Suite 2,  in Princeton, New Jersey, as the Dr. John F. Nash, Jr. Post Office.   John Nash was a brilliant mathematician, publishing groundbreaking  work in many areas. One of his most famous contributions was to the  field of game theory, creating what is known as the Nash equilibrium.   For his achievements, he won a Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in  1994, and the Abel Prize from the Norwegian Academy of Science and  Letters in 2015.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to hearing more about Dr. Nash's life  from the gentlewoman from New Jersey, and I urge my colleagues to  support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 378) to amend title 5, United States Code, to enhance the  authority under which Federal agencies may pay cash awards to employees  for making cost saving disclosures, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 378         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Bonuses for Cost-Cutters Act       of 2017''.       SEC. 2. COST SAVINGS ENHANCEMENTS.         (a) Definitions.--Section 4511 of title 5, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) in the section heading, by striking ``Definition'' and       inserting ``Definitions''; and        (2) in subsection (a)--        (A) by striking the period at the end and inserting ``;       and'';        (B) by striking ``this subchapter, the term'' and inserting       the following: ``this subchapter--        ``(1) the term''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following:        ``(2) the term `wasteful expenses' means amounts made       available for salaries and expenses accounts, operations and       maintenance accounts, or other equivalent accounts--        ``(A) that are identified by an employee of the agency       under section 4512(a) as wasteful; and        ``(B) that the Chief Financial Officer of the agency       determines are not required for the purpose for which the       amounts were made available.''.  [[Page H7949]]         (b) Authority.--Section 4512 of title 5, United States       Code, is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) by inserting ``The head of an agency may pay a cash       award to any employee of such agency whose identification of       wasteful expenses to the Chief Financial Officer of the       agency has resulted in cost savings for the agency.'' after       the first sentence;        (B) in paragraph (1) by striking ``$10,000'' and inserting       ``$20,000'';        (C) in paragraph (2)--        (i) by inserting ``Chief Financial Officer,'' after       ``Inspector General,'' ;        (ii) by striking ``employee designated under subsection       (b)'' and inserting ``designated employee''; and        (iii) by inserting ``or identification'' after       ``disclosure''; and        (D) in the matter following paragraph (2)--        (i) by inserting ``, Chief Financial Officer,'' after       ``Inspector General''; and        (ii) by inserting ``or identification'' after       ``disclosure'';        (2) in subsection (b) by striking ``awards permitted under       this section'' and inserting ``awards for the disclosure of       fraud, waste, or mismanagement under this section''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(c)(1) If the Chief Financial Officer of the agency       determines that potential wasteful expenses identified by an       employee meet the requirements of section 4511(a)(2)(B), the       head of the agency shall notify the President for purposes of       proposing the expenses for rescission under title X of the       Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (2       U.S.C. 681 et seq.).        ``(2) In the case of an agency for which there is no Chief       Financial Officer, the head of the agency shall designate an       agency employee who shall have the authority to make the       determinations for identification of wasteful expenses under       this section.        ``(d) The head of each agency shall make available, along       with, and in the same manner and form as, the provision of       information required under section 1116 of title 31,       information on disclosures of wasteful expenses under this       section, including--        ``(1) a description of each disclosure of possible wasteful       expenses identified by an employee and determined by the       agency to have merit; and        ``(2) the number and amount of cash awards provided by the       agency under subsection (a).        ``(e) An individual may not receive a cash award under this       subchapter if the individual is--        ``(1) an officer or employee of the Office of the Inspector       General of an agency; or        ``(2) ineligible for a cash award under section 4509.        ``(f) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management       shall--        ``(1) ensure that the cash award program of each agency       complies with this section; and        ``(2) submit to Congress an annual certification indicating       whether the cash award program of each agency complies with       this section.        ``(g) Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of       the Bonuses for Cost-Cutters Act of 2017, and every 3 years       thereafter for 6 years, the Comptroller General of the United       States shall submit to Congress a report on the operation of       the cost savings and awards program under this section,       including any recommendations for legislative changes.''.        (c) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The table of       sections for subchapter II of chapter 45 of title 5, United       States Code, is amended by striking the item relating to       section 4511 and inserting the following:  ``4511. Definitions and general provisions.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I speak in support of H.R. 378, introduced by the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann), the Bonuses for Cost- Cutters Act of 2017.   The people in the best position to identify waste throughout the  Federal Government are the employees on the front lines at the Federal  agencies. They are the ones on the ground who know when agencies waste  money. It is in the taxpayers' best interest to encourage Federal  employees to report waste when they see it.   H.R. 378 increases the incentive for Federal employees to report  wasteful spending by authorizing a reward of up to $20,000 for blowing  the whistle on waste. This incentive is especially necessary at the end  of the fiscal year when too many agencies adopt a ``use it or lose it''  mentality regarding their budgets.   Some agencies fear that if they do not spend every last dollar in  their budget, that Congress will somehow decrease their future funding.  That dynamic leads to the most outrageous expenditures in the last week  before the end of the fiscal year on September 30.   Under the structure put in place by H.R. 378, agency leadership will  also be able to verify that spending identified by whistleblowers is  actually wasteful. This was a concern raised by our colleagues in the  minority. We are thankful for their constructive work in getting this  bill to a mutually agreeable compromise.   The bill also maintains Congress' constitutional role in the  appropriations process. As we know, Congress is responsible for  authorizing spending by the Federal Government, and this bill is  careful to respect that authority.   After the agency's chief financial officer affirms that the spending  in question is indeed wasteful, the agency must submit a report to the  President. The President may then submit a recommendation to Congress  to eliminate the wasteful spending in question.   H.R. 378 is the result of a bipartisan process, and I urge my  colleagues to support this bill as an example of what we can achieve  when both sides put their minds to reform and husband the taxpayers'  dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2196) to amend title 5, United States Code, to allow  whistleblowers to disclose information to certain recipients, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2196         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. RECIPIENTS OF WHISTLEBLOWER DISLOSURES.         Section 2302(b)(8)(B) of title 5, United States Code, is       amended by striking ``or to the Inspector'' and all that       follows through ``such disclosures'' and inserting ``the       Inspector General of an agency, a supervisor in the       employee's direct chain of command and up to and including       the head of the employing agency, or to an employee       designated by any of the aforementioned individuals for the       purpose of receiving such disclosures''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I speak in support of H.R. 2196, a bill I introduced  with Ranking Member Cummings, Mr. Lynch, and Mr. Farenthold from Texas  earlier this year to allow whistleblowers to disclose information to  certain recipients.   Whistleblowers in the Federal Government should be able to tell their  supervisors when something is wrong. That is true no matter what, but  especially so in cases involving classified information, which implies  a matter of national security.   If whistleblowers cannot make a protected disclosure to their  supervisors, they are more likely to make an illegal disclosure to  people or entities without the proper security clearances.   Under current law, whistleblowers in the intelligence community can  make protected disclosures to their supervisors. However,  whistleblowers dealing with classified information outside the  intelligence community do not have that same protection.   Federal employees inside the intelligence community can blow the  whistle to their supervisors, to the appropriate inspector general, and  to Congress. Employees outside the intelligence community do not have  those protections when it comes to classified information, and they  have fewer options when it comes to blowing the whistle, except to put  it in the hands of those who have no clearances.   Federal employees outside the intelligence community must be  reassured that they can report wrongdoing to the appropriate people,  including their supervisors. With this protection, whistleblowers will  be less likely to disclose potentially sensitive information on waste,  fraud, and abuse to the media, or other entities or individuals without  the proper security clearance.   This bill allows whistleblowers to make protected disclosures of  classified information to individuals within their chain of command.  There are very few conceivable circumstances in which a whistleblower  complaint to a supervisor would jeopardize national security, but such  disclosures are not currently protected, as strange as that may seem.   There is no reasonable basis for concern about giving whistleblowers  throughout the Federal Government the right to contact those  individuals about waste, fraud, or abuse of a classified nature. These  additional protections will make it easier for these employees to do  the responsible thing when it comes to classified disclosures.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Ranking Member  Cummings, Mr. Farenthold of Texas, and Mr. Lynch of Massachusetts for  their great bipartisan support in this needed reform, and I urge my  colleagues to support my bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2229) to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide  permanent authority for judicial review of certain Merit Systems  Protection Board decisions relating to whistleblowers, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2229         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``All Circuit Review Act''.       SEC. 2. JUDICIAL REVIEW OF MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD                     DECISIONS RELATING TO WHISTLEBLOWERS.         (a) In General.--Section 7703(b)(1)(B) of title 5, United       States Code, is amended by striking ``During the 5-year       period beginning on the effective date of the Whistleblower       Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, a petition'' and       inserting ``A petition''.        (b) Director Review.--Section 7703(d)(2) of such title is       amended by striking ``During the 5-year period beginning on       the effective date of the Whistleblower Protection       Enhancement Act of 2012, this paragraph'' and inserting       ``This paragraph''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I speak in support of H.R. 2229, the All Circuit Review  Act, which Ranking Member Cummings of Maryland and Mr. Farenthold of  Texas introduced earlier this year. It is critical that we guarantee  whistleblowers have access to fair and efficient reviews of their  claims of retaliation.   Between 1982 and 2012, whistleblowers could only appeal retaliation  rulings made against them by the Merit Systems Protection Board, or the  MSPB, to the Federal circuit. That monopoly led to the Federal circuit  shaping key interpretations of whistleblower protection law without a  check by any of the other circuit courts.   In 2012, to the wide acclaim of the whistleblower community, the  Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act ended the Federal circuit  court's monopoly over whistleblower retaliation appeals. The result, as  expected, was better case law and more expeditious appeals.   As a pilot program, that expansion was set to expire 3 years after  enactment. In 2014, Congress acted to extend the program until November  of this year. Now, this highly effective program will expire next month  unless it is renewed. The whistleblower community has benefited  tremendously from the pilot program. There is no good argument against  making this permanent.   Critics had feared that expanding jurisdiction over the MSPB appeals  would lead to a torrent of cases for those circuits, swamping dockets  across the Nation. Those fears have proved to be unfounded. Instead,  the whistleblower community has benefited from other circuits having an  opportunity to interpret Federal whistleblower case law.   H.R. 2229 makes the all circuit expansion permanent, ensuring the  benefits of the pilot program continue. This bipartisan initiative will  put the question of appeal jurisdiction for whistleblower retaliation  cases to rest once and for all.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, September 22, 2017.      Hon. Trey Gowdy,      Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Gowdy: I write with respect to H.R. 2229, the       ``All Circuit Review Act.'' As a result of your having       consulted with us on provisions within H.R. 2229 that fall       within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the       Judiciary, I forego any further consideration of this bill so       that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for       consideration.        The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 2229 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our       committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our       committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation, and asks       that you support any such request.        I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 2229 and would ask       that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of H.R. 2229.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and             Government Reform,                                Washington, DC, September 22, 2017.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.       2229, the All Circuit Review Act. As you noted, certain       provisions of the bill fall within the jurisdiction of the       Committee on the Judiciary. I appreciate your willingness to       forego action on the bill in the interest of expediting this       legislation for floor consideration. I agree that foregoing       consideration of the bill in no way diminishes or alters the       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary with respect       to the appointment of conferees or to any future       jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in       the bill or any similar legislation.        I will include a copy of our letter exchange on H.R. 2229       in the bill report filed by the Committee on Oversight and       Government Reform, as well as in the Congressional Record       during floor consideration, to memorialize our understanding.        Thank you for your assistance with this matter.            Sincerely,                                                        Trey Gowdy.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank Chairman Gowdy for his  support of this legislation, and for the hard work of Ranking Member  Cummings of Maryland and Mr. Farenthold of Texas for all that they have  done to bring this needed bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2989) to establish the Frederick Douglass Bicentennial  Commission, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2989         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Frederick Douglass       Bicentennial Commission Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) Born into slavery on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in       1818 and given the name Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey       after his mother Harriet Bailey, Frederick Douglass has been       called the father of the civil rights movement.        (2) Douglass rose through determination, brilliance, and       eloquence to shape the American Nation. He was an       abolitionist, human rights and women's rights activist,       orator, author, journalist, publisher, and social reformer.        (3) Taught basic reading skills by his mistress until she       was forced to stop, Douglass continued to teach himself to       read and write and taught other slaves to read despite risks       including death.        (4) During the course of his remarkable life Frederick       Douglass escaped from slavery, became internationally       renowned for his eloquence in the cause of liberty, and went       on to serve the national government in several official       capacities.        (5) Forced to leave the country to avoid arrest as an       escaped slave, he returned to become a staunch advocate of       the Union cause and helped recruit African-American troops       for the Union Army, including two of his sons, Charles and       Lewis Douglass. His personal relationship with Abraham       Lincoln helped persuade the President to make emancipation a       cause of the Civil War.        (6) With the abolition of slavery at the close of the Civil       War, Douglass then turned his attention to the full       integration of African-Americans into the political and       economic life of the United States. Committed to freedom,       Douglass dedicated his life to achieving justice for all       Americans, in particular African-Americans, women, and       minority groups. He envisioned America as an inclusive Nation       strengthened by diversity and free of discrimination.        (7) Douglass served as an advisor to Presidents. Abraham       Lincoln referred to him as the most meritorious man of the       nineteenth century. Douglass was appointed to several       offices. He served as the United States Marshal of the       District of Columbia under Rutherford B. Hayes'       administration; President James Garfield appointed Douglass       the District of Columbia Recorder of Deeds. In 1889,       President Benjamin Harrison appointed Frederick Douglass to       be the United States minister to Haiti. He was also appointed       by President Grant to serve as Assistant Secretary of the       Commission of Inquiry to Santo Domingo.        (8) Douglass lived in the District of Columbia for 23 of       his 57 years as a free man, and in recognition of his       leadership and continuous fight for justice and freedom, his       home, Cedar Hill, was established as a National Historic Site       in Anacostia, in Southeast Washington, DC.        (9) The statue of Frederick Douglass in the United States       Capitol is a gift from the almost 700,000 residents of the       District of Columbia.        (10) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of       Frederick Douglass, for Douglass dedicated his own life to       ensuring freedom and equality for future generations of       Americans. This Nation should ensure that his tireless       struggle, transformative words, and inclusive vision of       humanity continue to inspire and sustain us.        (11) The year 2018 marks the bicentennial anniversary of       the birth of Frederick Douglass, and a commission should be       established to plan, develop, and carry out, and to recommend       to Congress, programs and activities that are fitting and       proper to celebrate that anniversary in a manner that       appropriately honors Frederick Douglass.       SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.         There is established a commission to be known as the       Frederick Douglass Bicentennial Commission (referred to in       this Act as the ``Commission'').       SEC. 4. DUTIES.         The Commission shall have the following duties:        (1) To plan, develop, and carry out programs and activities       that are fitting and  [[Page H7953]]       proper to honor Frederick Douglass on the occasion of the       bicentennial anniversary of Douglass' birth.        (2) To recommend to Congress programs and activities that       the Commission considers fitting and proper to honor       Frederick Douglass on such occasion, and the entity or       entities in the Federal Government that the Commission       considers most appropriate to carry out such programs and       activities.       SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I speak in support of H.R. 2989, the Frederick Douglass  Bicentennial Commission Act, introduced by Ms. Norton of the District  of Columbia and Mr. Harris earlier this year.   Next year will mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Frederick  Douglass, a man who has been called the father--and rightfully so--of  the civil rights movement.   Douglass was born into slavery in Maryland around 1817 but escaped by  the age of 21. Douglass went on to publish an autobiography documenting  his life as a slave, called, ``Narrative of the Life of Frederick  Douglass,'' while a fugitive slave.   Throughout his remarkable life, Douglass advocated for justice for  all Americans, encouraging President Lincoln to make emancipation a  cause of the Civil War, and advocating for the full integration of  African Americans into political and economic life in the United States  both during and following the war.   H.R. 2989 establishes the Frederick Douglass Bicentennial Commission  to recommend the best ways to celebrate the legacy of a man who  dedicated his entire life to ensuring freedom and equality for all  Americans.   H.R. 2989 would do this by creating a 16-member commission to plan,  develop, and coordinate activities fitting and proper to honor Mr.  Douglass. The commission will submit two reports to Congress with  recommendations for activities, programs, and other important  information. The commission will end 30 days after the submission of  its final report.   The amended text considered today adds a new section clarifying that  the commission will not receive additional authorized funds and will,  instead, rely on private funds for its operations.   The commission presents an important opportunity to recognize and  support Frederick Douglass' leadership and body of work. He was a  phenomenal man, and I am proud to also be a cosponsor of this important  bill.  [[Page H7954]]    I would like to thank Ms. Norton, Mr. Harris, and the 16 other  cosponsors for their hard work on this bill in honor of Frederick  Douglass.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Harris), who is the  original cosponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to echo all of the comments  that we heard. It is important that all of us take time and pause to  recognize the tremendous work that Frederick Douglass did not only in  his life, but how he impacted the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3031) to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide for  flexibility in making withdrawals from a Thrift Savings Plan account,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3031         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``TSP Modernization Act of       2017''.       SEC. 2. THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN ACCOUNT WITHDRAWAL FLEXIBILITY.

(b) Limitation on Return of Payment Relating to a Change in       Election.--Section 8433(d) of title 5, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``, except that in the       case of an election to receive an annuity, a former employee       or Member may not change an election under this section on or       after the date on which an annuity contract is purchased to       provide for the annuity elected by the former employee or       Member'' after ``this subchapter''; and        (2) in paragraph (2)--        (A) by striking ``change an'' and inserting return a       payment that was made pursuant to an''; and        (B) by striking ``on or after'' and all that follows       through ``the former employee or Member''.

(e) Technical Amendment.--Section 8432b(h)(2)(A) of title       5, United States Code, is amended by striking ``section       8433(d), or paragraph (1) or (2) of section 8433(h)'' and       inserting ``subsection (d) or (f) of section 8433''.        (f) Regulations.--As soon as is practicable, as determined       by the Executive Director of the Federal Retirement Thrift       Investment Board, but not later than 2 years after the date       of enactment of this Act, the Executive Director shall       prescribe such regulations as are necessary to carry out the       amendments made by this section.        (g) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section       shall take effect on the date on which the regulations       prescribed under subsection (f) take effect.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H7955]]  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3031, the TSP Modernization  Act of 2017, introduced by Ranking Member Cummings from Maryland and  Mr. Meadows from North Carolina earlier this year.   Federal employees enrolled in the Federal Employees Retirement  System--known as FERS--enjoy the benefits of a three-part retirement  structure. Those are a defined benefit pension plan, Social Security,  and a 401(k)-style defined contribution plan known as the Thrift  Savings Plan, or TSP.   With its low administrative costs and simple design, the TSP is an  ideal retirement vehicle. Participants can choose from a variety of  investment options, including index funds designed to track the  Standard & Poor's 500 Index, the Dow Jones U.S. Completion Total Stock  Market Index, or a low-risk government securities investment fund.   Participants can also passively manage their investments by putting  money into a Lifecycle Fund, which allows the Federal Retirement Thrift  Investment Board to purchase a combination of investments based on the  year the employee is expected to retire.   Employees have a lot of options when investing their TSP funds, but  when it comes to withdrawing their funds, the options are much more  limited. This is because current statutory rules preclude employees  from taking multiple post-service partial withdrawals. Employees cannot  request a partial withdrawal or annuity purchase after making a  periodic payment withdrawal election.   Statutory rules also require the purchase of an annuity if a  participant fails to make an election by age 70\1/2\. The rules also  restrict an employee's ability to make multiple in-service, age-based  withdrawals.   The Board conducted a study in 2013, which found that separated  participants moved $9 billion from the TSP fund to other, costlier  institutions. Nearly one out of every three of these participants cited  a desire for additional withdrawal flexibility.   The study also found that, among currently employed participants, the  same ratio of participants requested additional withdrawal flexibility  for age-based withdrawals to address life events that arise. This bill  would afford those additional flexibilities to address those concerns.   The bill provides more control to Federal employees over their own  retirement by allowing for multiple post-separation partial withdrawals  and in-service, age-based withdrawals. H.R. 3031 allows employees to  change withdrawal elections as they grow older, and it allows the Board  to avoid purchasing expensive annuities if a participant fails to make  an election by age 70\1/2\.   This bill puts power and control in the hands of the employees that  make our Federal Government run to make retirement decisions based on  their personal situations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank Chairman Gowdy, Ranking  Member Cummings, and Chairman Meadows for their outstanding work in  addressing the needs of Federal employees who give selfless public  service to our Nation and should have this flexibility in their  retirement planning.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3243) to amend title 40, United  [[Page H7956]]  States Code, to eliminate the sunset of certain provisions relating to  information technology, to amend the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2015 to extend the sunset relating to the Federal Data  Center Consolidation Initiative, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows                                 H.R. 3243         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``FITARA Enhancement Act of       2017''.       SEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF SUNSET RELATING TO TRANSPARENCY AND                     RISK MANAGEMENT OF MAJOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY                     INVESTMENTS.         Subsection (c) of section 11302 of title 40, United States       Code, is amended by striking the first paragraph (5).       SEC. 3. ELIMINATION OF SUNSET RELATING TO INFORMATION                     TECHNOLOGY PORTFOLIO, PROGRAM, AND RESOURCE                     REVIEWS.         Section 11319 of title 40, United States Code, is amended--        (1) by redesignating the second subsection (c) as       subsection (d); and        (2) in subsection (d), as so redesignated, by striking       paragraph (6).       SEC. 4. EXTENSION OF SUNSET RELATING TO FEDERAL DATA CENTER                     CONSOLIDATION INITIATIVE.         Subsection (e) of section 834 of the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (Public Law 113-291;       44 U.S.C. 3601 note) is amended by striking ``2018'' and       inserting ``2020''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I speak in support of H.R. 3243, the FITARA Enhancement  Act of 2017, introduced by Mr. Connolly, Mr. Issa, Ms. Kelly from  Illinois, and Mr. Meadows earlier this year.   Today, the Federal Government spends more than $90 billion on Federal  IT, with approximately 75 percent of this money spent on archaic and  legacy IT. This means we are paying more for less: less capability and  less security. Meanwhile, major Federal IT investments often result in  multimillion-dollar cost overruns and delays.   This state of affairs led the Government Accountability Office to  designate Federal IT acquisition and management as high risk in 2015,  meaning this area is at high risk of waste, fraud, abuse, and  mismanagement.   In 2014, Congress passed the Federal Information Technology  Acquisition Reform Act, otherwise known as FITARA, to address some of  these IT challenges.   Congress has maintained a watchful eye to ensure agencies fully  implement the requirements of FITARA and use it as a vital oversight  tool. In fact, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee has held  five hearings on FITARA implementation.   The committee also created a FITARA scorecard to hold Federal  agencies accountable for meeting FITARA requirements, some of which  sunset in the near term.   This bill will help us facilitate Congress' oversight efforts by  extending key FITARA requirements to improve Federal IT.   For example, this bill extends requirements for agencies to publicly  report schedule and cost information and to assess the risks of major  IT investments. This bill also extends requirements for each agency to  regularly assess its IT portfolio, look for opportunities to reduce  duplication, and find savings.   Finally, the bill will help us continue to hold agencies accountable  for consolidating and optimizing their data centers by extending these  requirements--and GAO's verification of these requirements--through  2020.   The GAO, which has been instrumental in assisting Congress oversee  FITARA implementation, supports extending the FITARA sunset dates.   Mr. Connolly from Virginia and Mr. Issa from California have been the  key leaders on the original FITARA law, and they have come together  again to sponsor this bill, along with Representatives Meadows and  Kelly.   The FITARA Enhancement Act is truly a bipartisan effort in making  sure Federal agencies get their information technology management and  acquisition houses in order.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Issa), an original cosponsor of this  bill and also the former chairman of the Government and Oversight  Reform Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Gowdy, Mr. Connolly from  Virginia, and Mr. Issa from California for this important and continued  work that will not only improve IT and reduce duplication but will  continue to save billions of taxpayer dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
