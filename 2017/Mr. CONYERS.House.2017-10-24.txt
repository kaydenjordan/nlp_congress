 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act would prohibit the  Federal Government from entering into or enforcing any settlement  agreement requiring donations to remediate harms that are not  ``directly and proximately'' caused by a wrongdoer's unlawful conduct.   I, regretfully, oppose this measure for several reasons. To begin  with, the bill would prohibit these types of settlement agreements even  though they have been successfully used to remedy various harms,  particularly those caused by reckless corporate actors.   For example, these settlement agreements helped facilitate an  effective and comprehensive response to the predatory and fraudulent  mortgage lending activities of financial institutions that nearly  caused the economic collapse of our Nation, and that led to the Great  Recession.   In fact, settlement agreements with two of these culpable financial  institutions, Bank of America and Citigroup, required a donation of  less than 1 percent of the overall settlement amount to fund  foreclosure prevention and remediation programs to help harmed  consumers.   Now, contrary to the majority's claim, the Justice Department did not  use any of these settlement agreements to fund active groups.  Notwithstanding the production of hundreds of pages of documents by the  Justice Department, along with hundreds of pages of documents produced  by private parties, we have not seen a shred of evidence that the  government included unlawful or politically motivated terms in its  settlement agreements with Bank of America or Citigroup.   The majority also asserts that these settlement agreements are used  by the Justice Department and other agencies to circumvent the  congressional appropriations process. But existing law already prevents  agencies from augmenting their own funds.   By law, donations included in settlement agreements must have a clear  nexus to the prosecutorial objectives of the enforcement agency. And  both the Government Accountability Office and the Congressional  Research Service have concluded that settlement agreements providing  for secondary remediation do not violate Congress' constitutional power  of the purse.   Finally, H.R. 732 would prevent the remediation of systemic harms in  civil and criminal enforcement actions.   These settlement agreements allow parties to resolve their civil or  criminal liability by voluntarily remediating the harms caused by their  unlawful conduct. For some types of unlawful conduct, such as  discrimination based on race or religion, secondary remediation of  harms may be the only remedy available for systemic violations of the  law.                                time  1515    The victims of such conduct are typically not themselves parties to  the underlying action. Therefore, secondary remediation in the form of  voluntary compliance and training programs serves as an important tool  in these cases to protect victims of discrimination. Yet H.R. 732 would  effectively prohibit such relief.   Given these serious problems and some others presented by the bill, I  strongly am led to oppose H.R. 732.  [[Page H8109]]    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), a distinguished member of the House  Judiciary Committee, who is ranking member on the Subcommittee on  Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen).    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman from Tennessee an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Nadler), who is the ranking member on the Subcommittee on  Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), who is a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the ranking member of the Crime, Terrorism,  Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 20 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Meeks).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Chairman, in closing, I note that a broad coalition  of public interest organizations, including Public Citizen, Americans  for Financial Reform, the National Urban League, among others, strongly  oppose H.R. 732. They warn: ``This measure would undermine law  enforcement goals by reducing the availability of suitable remedies to  address these kind of injuries to the public caused by illegal  conduct.''   This bill is, in effect, a gift to lawbreakers that comes at the  expense of families and communities impacted by injuries that cannot be  addressed by direct restitution, and so I have to ask: Why are we  giving a gift to lawbreakers in the guise of H.R. 732?   If you value, as I do, upholding the rule of law, then you will join  me and many others in opposing this seriously flawed measure.   I thank everyone who has participated in this discussion, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, Members of the House, this amendment makes a  bad bill even worse. To begin with, it would prohibit cy-pres  distributions pursuant to which parties attempt to find the next best  use of funds that remain after a class action settlement has been  finally administered. Cy-pres is especially important in actions where  the recovery is so small for an individual class member that he or she  may not bother to make a claim or where a distribution is not  practical.   For example, courts under cy-pres may permit unclaimed settlement  funds to provide indirect compensation to the class, such as future  price reductions or remediation efforts. As a result of this amendment,  however, the unclaimed settlement funds would be returned to the very  entities that caused the injury in the first place. Simply put, this  amendment would benefit the wrongdoers to the detriment of the victims  they harmed.   In addition, this amendment would restrict the amount of compensation  a victim could receive under a settlement agreement to the extent the  victim was actually harmed by the wrongdoer. The amendment completely  ignores the pragmatic realities of systemic harms, such as widespread  long-term or latent environmental damage like lead-contaminated public  water drinking systems--think of Flint, Michigan--where the extent of a  victim's exposure to such harms may be difficult and, perhaps, even  impossible to quantify.   In a letter opposed to this amendment, a group of public interest  organizations, including Earthjustice, Public Citizen, Alliance for  Justice, the Center for Justice & Democracy, and the American  Association for Justice, said it is terrible public policy because  wrongdoers would benefit from a windfall for cheating and harming  consumers, undoing the accountability or deterrence function of the  entire settlement. This is absolutely the wrong result, and so I urge  that this amendment be rejected.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would exempt from H.R. 732  settlement agreements that direct funds to remediate the indirect but  catastrophic effects of unlawful conduct resulting in lead  contamination in public drinking water.   Lead contamination in public drinking water is potentially a national  public health crisis as older cities continue to rely on aging lead  pipes for the delivery of public drinking water.   A report from the American Water Works Association estimates that  this problem could potentially affect millions of water service lines.  For example, Highland Park, located in my district, has been dealing  with issues resulting from aging lead pipes. Just last month, officials  closed public water fountains and fixtures due to unsafe samples of  lead in public drinking water.   The well-publicized Flint water crisis is another painful example of  the disastrous consequences of lead contamination in public drinking  water.  [[Page H8125]]    The director of the pediatric residents at Hurley Children's Hospital  in Flint wrote: ``To understand the contamination of this city, think  about drinking water through a straw coated in lead. As you sip, lead  particles flake off into the water and are ingested. Flint's children  have been drinking water through lead-coated straws.''   The Flint water crisis has generated numerous lawsuits by  individuals, local and State agencies, and public interest  organizations such as the Natural Resources Defense Council and the  American Civil Liberties Union.   While these cases tend to involve numerous victims directly affected  by unlawful conduct, they can also affect the interests of persons who  are not parties to the case or are likely to receive compensation for  unlawful conduct.   Given the systemic nature of lead contamination in drinking water,  settlement agreements resolving civil and criminal liability related to  the Flint water crisis may require setting aside funds for  unidentifiable victims, directing payments to address generalized harm,  or establishing an environmental compliance program to avoid lead  contamination in the future.   Unfortunately, these entirely legitimate forms of indirect  remediation of environmental harms would be prohibited by H.R. 732.   Mr. Chair, accordingly, I urge my colleagues to support the  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
