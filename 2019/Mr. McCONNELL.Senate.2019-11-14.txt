 Madam President, while our Senate Democratic  colleagues continue blocking this body from considering funding for our  Armed Forces, the Senate has taken advantage of the time to confirm  more of President Trump's well-qualified nominees for Federal service,  as well as the judiciary.   Yesterday, we confirmed Chad Wolf to serve at the Department of  Homeland Security. Following President Trump's decision to designate  him Acting Secretary, he is now heading up the Department.   I want to take a moment to thank the outgoing Acting DHS Secretary,  Kevin McAleenan. His tenure leading the Department of Homeland Security  capped off a distinguished career in public service, including nearly  two decades rising through the ranks of the Customs and Border Patrol.   His leadership at DHS saw significant progress in mitigating major  aspects of our border security and humanitarian crisis, a strong focus  on cyber security, and hard work to strengthen the Department all  across the board. So I thank the outgoing Acting Secretary for his  years in public service and, particularly, for his leadership in this  recent chapter.   Now, today, we will vote on the confirmation of Steven Menashi to the  Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. Menashi won majority support on  the Judiciary Committee on the basis of strong academic and legal  qualifications--degrees from Dartmouth and Stanford, clerkships on the  appellate level and the Supreme Court, and experience in both teaching  and practicing law.   I would urge all of our colleagues to vote to confirm this impressive  nominee this afternoon.                            ____________________     Madam President, as my colleagues know, I have no  qualms about spending floor time on the personnel business. Our  Democratic colleagues have made it necessary by subjecting this  President's nominees to unprecedented, systematic delays and  obstruction. The majority has been willing to do things the hard way.  We are giving the American people the government they voted for, as  chosen by the President they elected.   My Republican colleagues and I wish that we could also be spending  floor time on productive, bipartisan legislation that the American  people need to actually become law. We want to pass the USMCA and the  176,000 new American jobs it would create, but Speaker Pelosi continues  to block it. The far left objects to their passing anything--anything-- that the President likes.  [[Page S6580]]    We want to pass a conference report for the NDAA, critical  legislation for our national defense. Congress has passed a bipartisan  NDAA every single year since 1961. Now it is another casualty of the  impeachment obsession.   House Democrats steamrolled Republicans in order to pass a wholly  partisan bill. I believe this may be the first time ever that either  Chamber has passed a purely partisan NDAA. Now they are stalling the  conference committee and jeopardizing the whole process.   We want to pass the defense funding bill that our Democratic  colleagues have now filibustered twice so that our servicemembers and  commanders get what they need. Back in the summer, the Republican and  Democratic leaders in the House and Senate all agreed and all signed  onto an agreement with President Trump--a bicameral, bipartisan  agreement. Everybody signed it. We brokered this deal to make sure the  appropriations process did not--did not--get bogged down with bickering  over policy issues. We all agreed to keep poison pills out so that  government funding could move forward.    But just a few months later, our Democratic colleagues are now  insisting on exactly the kinds of poison pills they foreswore when they  signed onto the agreement this summer. They are holding up funding for  our men and women in uniform because they disagree with the President's  views on border security. They want to chip away at the exact  Presidential authorities that they specifically agreed not to be  touched. Let me say that again. They want to chip away at the exact  Presidential authorities that they specifically agreed not to be  touched. In short, my friends in Democratic leadership smelled an  opportunity to pick a political fight.   Our servicemembers need their funding. American workers and small  businesses need their new trade deal. Our Armed Forces need the  authorizing legislation that has been a bipartisan slam dunk every year  for almost 60 years--60 years.   We cannot cease all legislation just because Democrats would rather  fight with the President. We will not neglect the business of the  American people just because a House committee is holding some public  hearing. If they are going to keep plowing ahead with their impeachment  obsession, they cannot abdicate their basic government responsibilities  at the very same time.                            ____________________     Madam President, now, on another matter, last Tuesday  was election day in dozens of States and localities, including in my  home State of Kentucky. There was one important aspect of election day  that didn't get much attention. Unlike in 2016, last week's elections  were not marred to the same extent by foreign interference from our  Nation's adversaries, and neither were the 2018 midterm elections last  year.   As of now, there are no reports of foreign intrusion into voter  records and no reports of significant and successful disinformation  efforts on social media or anywhere else. By any reasonable standard  and by all available evidence, the past two elections have gone a whole  lot more smoothly than back in 2016.   Now, this wasn't for lack of trying. Russia and our other adversaries  have tried for decades to interfere in our politics and to undermine  the competence of the American people in our democracy, and they will  not likely let up anytime soon. This fight is nowhere near over. But  make no mistake, our defenses are a whole lot stronger.   A massive coordinated effort to confront this threat has brought  together the Congress, the Trump administration, all 50 States, the  private sector, and more than 2,000 local jurisdictions. We have worked  to address the weaknesses Russia sought to exploit during the Obama  administration and have proactively strengthened our defenses.   Last week, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Defense, the Acting  Homeland Security Secretary, the acting DNI, and the heads of the FBI,  the NSA, the U.S. Cyber Command, and the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency issued a statement. Here is what it  said:         Election security is a top priority. . . . In an       unprecedented level of coordination, the U.S. government is       working with all 50 states and U.S. territories, local       officials, and private sector partners to identify threats,       broadly share information, and protect the democratic       process.    Now, I know my colleagues already know about these significant  efforts thanks to the groundwork laid by the Intelligence Committee's  painstaking investigation. We know about it because we have provided  $380 million to help modernize State election systems. Back in  September, I cosponsored an amendment in committee that will bring the  total to more than $600 million.   We know about the progress because we have had a bipartisan, all- Members briefing from administration experts. Senators literally broke  into applause in appreciation for what the administration was doing to  protect our election. The story is not finished. The crucial work  continues, but the progress is undeniable.   No longer is threat intelligence siloed within the Federal  Government. This administration has moved to share vital information  systematically with everyone, from States and localities to social  media companies. No longer is interference cost-free for adversaries.  The administration has sanctioned and prosecuted Russians engaged in  election interference and issued an Executive order that paves the way  for additional sanctions on those who seek to interfere.   The Department of Homeland Security now runs a National Cybersecurity  and Communications Integration Center--a physical war room of sorts--on  election day for sharing information and coordinating action. That is  along with an online platform that 200 jurisdictions reportedly tapped  into last week.   Long before election day, this administration was connecting with all  50 States and more than 2,000 localities to deploy new cyber security  tools, new training for election workers, and to provide threat alerts,  and the list goes on and on.   Our adversaries are still at the door, but for two election days in a  row now, we have benefitted from stronger defenses. Progress like this  should earn bipartisan applause. Like I said, behind closed doors, it  did, but in public our Democratic colleagues have not loudly cheered  the successes. Instead, they are trying to use the very serious issue  of election security to repackage their long-held liberal view that  Washington, DC, needs far more power over elections.   Look, nobody really believes that all the partisan proposals from  Speaker Pelosi and company are some kind of tailored response to  Russian meddling, not when they transparently serve the same goals the  Democrats have wanted since way before 2016.   For goodness' sake, the New York Times was editorializing for  federalizing elections right after election day 2012, even when they  liked the outcome. That was the same election cycle, by the way, in  which President Obama mocked--mocked--his Republican opponent for being  too tough on Russia.   So let's not mistake these long-held liberal policy goals as some  new, targeted response to Russian meddling. Election security is too  important to become a Trojan horse for ideological goals that Democrats  have wanted for many years.   We need to continue the serious work that Federal, State, and local  officials are engaging in every day--work that is already yielding  results--and we need to stay vigilant because our adversaries will not  stop.   So I want to salute the Federal, State, and local professionals who  helped make last week an apparent election security success. I urge  Senate Democrats to stop blocking a bipartisan appropriations process  so that we can secure hundreds of millions of dollars more for the  folks out there on the frontlines.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.
