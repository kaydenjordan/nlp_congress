 Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a  constituent, a trailblazer, a pillar of the Montgomery County  community, a neighbor, and a dear friend: Ms. Marcine D. Goodloe. Ms.  Goodloe has spent over 40 years advocating for the interests of  volunteer firefighters and first responders across Maryland. She has  been a special champion for Montgomery County, the place where I raised  my family and where I still live. It is my honor to recognize her  extraordinary life and dedication to our community and to the safety of  all Americans.   Marcine D. Goodloe has made service her mission. She began her career  as the executive secretary for Montgomery County Fire and Rescue  Services and later served as executive director for the Montgomery  County Fire and Rescue Commission. Over the years, Ms. Goodloe's  commitment to community service moved her up the fire-rescue ranks. At  the height of her career, she oversaw the operations of 19 local  volunteer fire and rescue departments and more than 2,400 fire, rescue,  EMS, administrative, and auxiliary members serving over 1 million  Montgomery County residents.   Following years of exemplary service, Ms. Goodloe made history as the  first woman elected president of the Montgomery County Volunteer Fire- Rescue Association in its century-long history. Her distinguished  tenure lasted 16 years. As president, Ms. Goodloe worked tirelessly to  advance the priorities of the entire association family. She partnered  with community leaders at all levels of government--from the county  council to the U.S. Congress--and delivered real results. At the local  level, she successfully advocated for innovative policy solutions that  helped strengthen physical standards, first responder training, and  drug and alcohol testing. She raised the concerns of the Montgomery  County volunteer fire-rescue community in Washington D.C. too, working  with Members of Congress to secure Federal resources for first  responders. Ms. Goodloe's commitment to service also reached beyond my  State. In 2005, she raised more than $20,000 for a fire department in  Mississippi that was damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Ms. Goodloe has been  a vocal ambassador for first responders everywhere, and her leadership  has been nothing short of inspiring.   Throughout her decades of service, Ms. Goodloe has always brought  dignity, strength, and kindness to her work. She has toiled in the  trenches, working day-in and day-out to ensure that the men and women  who stand guard over our communities get the support they need to do  the job and come home safe. Ms. Goodloe has not only served her  community honorably, but she has also empowered women across the Nation  to enter a career in fire service. Her legacy of good works have earned  her numerous accolades including the Mason Fire Lankford Fire Service  Leadership Award, the Chief Leslie B. Johnson Community Service Award,  and a spot in the Maryland State Firemen Association's Hall of Fame. On  a personal note, I always look forward to meeting with Marcine on her  visits to Capitol Hill to champion Federal programs that support all  firefighters. She always did her homework. No one could say no to  Marcine.   I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our deepest gratitude to  my friend Marcine Goodloe for her outstanding service to Maryland's  Volunteer Fire and Rescue Service and in recognition of all she has  done to keep our communities and our first responders safe.                            ____________________
