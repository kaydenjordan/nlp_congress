 Madam Speaker, the cancel culture train, a/k/a/  H.R. 7573 that passed yesterday, was wrong on a deep level.   I am not going to get on that cancel culture train that says we have  to do away with any mention or remembrance of everybody or everything  that we don't agree with; or that might have said something that we  don't like, didn't like; or that might have stood for something that we  don't stand for, didn't stand for.   The First Amendment was put in the Constitution to prevent exactly  this. I am not going to get on the cancel culture train because the  next thing you know, I will get thrown off for saying something that  somebody didn't like or didn't agree with or, Lord forbid, that I would  do something that somebody didn't like or didn't agree with.   Madam Speaker, if we are going to do this, what happened yesterday,  then the building names, street names, plaques, and all remembrances of  Democrats that Judge Gohmert just read about need to be removed from  every street, every building, anything that honors them.   Madam Speaker, that is a dangerous slope to be on, the cancel culture  train. People better sit up and take notice.                            ____________________
