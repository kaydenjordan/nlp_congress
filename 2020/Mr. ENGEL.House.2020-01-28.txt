 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 752, a  resolution supporting human rights and fundamental freedoms in Iran.  Today, we send a vital message to the protest movement in Iran that--as  they face persecution and violence--the House of Representatives stands  in solidarity with them.   For decades, the Iranian regime has oppressed dissidents. From the  1988 massacre to the 2009 protests to today, people who dared to speak  against the Iranian regime has been subject to torture, arrest,  disappearance and worse. Iran's prisons are some of the most notorious  in the world.   The protests have escalated since the Iranian regime lied to the  world about their responsibility for shooting down the Ukrainian  jetliner. It is unfathomable that for three days, the Iranian regime  sought to hide their culpability.   The United States must do what we can to help support those who fight  for human rights and freedom in Iran. This resolution outlines some  important steps, including expanding internet access for Iranian  dissidents by easing the restrictions on sharing software and hardware  for personal communication devices.   I would also add that if the Trump administration wants to send a  message of solidarity to the Iranian protest movement, they should  repeal the ill-conceived Muslim ban, which has prevented Iranians from  visiting and studying in America.   The American people have no quarrel with the people of Iran. America  should welcome those Iranians who want to see America for themselves.   I'd like to thank Mr. Deutch and Mr. Wilson for spearheading this  important resolution.
