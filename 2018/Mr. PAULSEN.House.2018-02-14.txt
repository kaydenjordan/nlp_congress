 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the service of  [[Page H1170]]  Carver County Sheriff Jim Olson, who recently announced his retirement.   Sheriff Olson began his career with the Carter County Sheriff's  Office 31 years ago. He was elected to his first 4-year term in 2010  and was reelected in 2013.   Olson led law enforcement operations during a time when Carver County  surpassed a population of 100,000 people, making it one of the fastest  growing counties in Minnesota. He oversaw major public safety  operations during the aftermath of Prince's death as well as the Ryder  Cup in 2016.   He is well respected in our community and is involved in community  outreach, raising public awareness of mental health resources,  educating the public about the role of the sheriff's office, and  supporting the Hope House, a youth homeless shelter in Chanhassen.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Sheriff Olson for his many years of service and  dedication to keeping the residents of Carver County safe. We wish him  the best of luck in the future. He will be missed.                            ____________________
