 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a grave day in  Wisconsin's history, the 150th anniversary of the ``Great Peshtigo  Fire.'' On this sesquicentennial anniversary, we remember the great  city of Peshtigo, WI, that was completely destroyed on October 8, 1871,  in the largest fire in U.S. history.   A community surrounded by dense forest, the city of Peshtigo was  first settled in 1838. Located off the western shore of Green Bay in  Marinette County, the area was first inhabited by Menominee and Ho- Chunk Native Americans. Sustained by lumber, shipping, and railroad  interests, by the end of 1871, it was the tenth largest city in  Wisconsin.   Historians and survivors of the fire theorize that the blaze was  started by railroad workers who were cutting trees and burning debris  outside of Peshtigo. A combination of a prolonged drought, a heavy  reliance on wooden buildings, and 100-mph winds aligned to create a  firestorm that reached 3 miles across and 1,000 feet high. Over the  course of the night, the fire scorched over 1.2 million acres and  caused an estimated $169 million in damages. Between 1,200 and 2,500  people lost their lives. The fire's complete destruction of local  records prevented an accurate death toll. An estimated 350 victims lie  in a mass grave in Peshtigo, victims who could not be identified  because they were either burned beyond recognition or because those who  could identify them perished, too.   Although the Great Peshtigo Fire has been well documented, little has  been written about the crucial role Native Americans played in  preventing further loss of life among European settlers. One of the  most compelling stories involves Abraham Place, who traveled on foot to  Wisconsin from Vermont in 1837 to build a homestead in the Sugar Bush  neighborhood just outside of Peshtigo. He married a Menominee woman,  and together with their children, they tended one of the largest farms  in the area. While marrying a Native-American woman was socially  acceptable when Place first settled there, attitudes had changed by  1871, and he was scorned by his fellow settlers.   The Native Americans he regularly welcomed to his home warned him of  the impending danger of fire after months of little to no rain and  helped him create a 3-foot-deep firebreak around his farm. His European  neighbors dismissed his precaution as the actions of a crazy man who  had married a Native American. Mrs. Place's in-laws then spent hours  placing dozens of wet blankets on the roof of their house to prevent  its destruction. Their home was one of the few buildings still standing  on the morning of October 9.   Many of the same neighbors who had ridiculed them ran to their house  or died trying. Survivors found the bodies of 35 residents who never  made it to the farm. The hundred or so refugees who arrived safely at  the Place home found a make-shift hospital where they could nurse their  wounds and recuperate. Some stayed for weeks, their earlier disdain  cured by necessity.   In the days following the Peshtigo fire, survivors emerged from the  Peshtigo River and other safe havens untouched by the flames to look  for missing loved ones and to begin to rebuild their lives. As word of  the devastation spread, donations of food, clothing, and money poured  in from across the State, the Nation, and several foreign countries.  This selfless, unified show of support empowered the people of Peshtigo  to rebuild their homes and restore their community.   Occurring on the same night as the Great Chicago Fire, the Peshtigo  fire has been largely forgotten, even though the Wisconsin death toll  is estimated to be seven times that of the Chicago tragedy. That is why  I join Peshtigo residents in remembering the time when prejudices that  turned neighbors into enemies were set aside in the midst of  unimaginable hardship. And I applaud their efforts to pause this  October 8 to remember this inconceivable catastrophe, commemorate its  victims and honor the resilience of those who worked so hard to rebuild  this city from the ashes of total devastation into the tranquil  community of today.                            ____________________
