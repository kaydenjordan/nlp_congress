 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of every  American who has lost a loved one because of this pandemic. I rise for  those who have lost their jobs or who are struggling to make ends meet  in the wake of this virus. I rise for the doctors, the nurses, the  caregivers, and the first responders who put themselves at risk every  day as they try to save lives.   These folks in my district and across the Nation know that the enemy  is not our neighbors or our political opponents. The enemy is this  virus. And they are counting on us to come together to provide relief.   We must act urgently to provide State and local governments with the  funding they need to maintain essential workers and provide critical  services, including in public safety and education.   We must act so that small businesses don't shutter their doors,  laying off the good people who live and work in our communities.   The American people cannot and should not have to wait any longer. I  urge my colleagues to put their differences aside and treat this  emergency like our lives depend on it--because they do.                            ____________________
