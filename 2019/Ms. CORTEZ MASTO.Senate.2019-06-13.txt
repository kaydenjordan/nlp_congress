 Mr. President, today I would like to  congratulate Bob Coffin on his distinguished career and commend his 37  years of dedicated service to Nevada.   Bob Coffin was first elected to the Nevada Assembly in 1982, where he  served for two terms. He was then elected to the Nevada State Senate,  where he served until 2010. After leaving the State Senate, Coffin  continued his career as a public servant, and since 2011, he has worked  to represent the city of Las Vegas Ward 3 as councilman, a position he  will retire from this June.   Councilman Coffin has deep roots in downtown Las Vegas, having been a  resident in and around Ward 3 for more than 60 years. He has raised his  family less than a mile from his childhood home.   Growing up in Las Vegas, Councilman Coffin developed a passion for  two things--his Mexican-American heritage and the sport of golf. His  family emigrated to Southern California from Mexico, and he saw  firsthand the discrimination his mother faced as a young woman. The  councilman has spent much of his career fighting this type of  injustice. He has traveled to Central America to help children and  families and has been an active member in the Latin Chamber of  Commerce.   As a young man, Councilman Coffin attended Bishop Gorman High School  and the University of Nevada Las Vegas, where he earned an accounting  degree. While concentrating on his studies, he also continued to focus  on his favorite pastime, golf, and was named the Nevada Amateur Golf  Champion at the age of 27. He went on to serve his country in the U.S.  Army and today owns a successful insurance business.  [[Page S3473]]    Councilman Coffin has been repeatedly recognized for his community  service, receiving dozens of awards during his career. Most recently,  he was named Person of the Year by the Southern Nevada Chapter of the  Professional Golfers Association and received the Charles Dick Medal of  Honor Award from the U.S. National Guard. He has twice been honored by  the Latin Chamber of Commerce, receiving the Hispanic Citizen Award and  the Public Service Award.   As a councilman for the city of Las Vegas Ward 3, Bob Coffin  prioritized keeping our communities safe revitalizing older  neighborhoods by building new parks and fostering economic opportunity  and development in our great city.   Today, Bob Coffin continues his commitment to the public by serving  on a number of boards and commissions, including the Board of the Las  Vegas Golf Hall of Fame, Chief Local Elected Officials Consortium,  Commission for the Las Vegas Centennial, Debt Management Commission,  Southern Nevada Regional Planning Coalition, and the Southern Nevada  Water Authority.   Bob Coffin has left his mark on Nevada and his community and has  impacted countless Nevadans through his public service and community  engagement. I am grateful for all of the work he has done for our State  and congratulate him on a well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
