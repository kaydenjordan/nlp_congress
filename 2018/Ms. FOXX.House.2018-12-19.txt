 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank everyone who has worked hard on this legislation.   S. 3530, the Museum and Library Services Act of 2018, is an excellent  opportunity to honor the place of libraries in our diverse communities.   As a girl growing up in the mountains of North Carolina, libraries  were vital to my own education, and that was the case for everyone in  my community. Almost 19 years into the 21st century, libraries continue  to provide lifelines to lifelong learners all across this great  country. They are as vital as ever.   We in the House are happy to do our part in ensuring these local  institutions continue to play the important role they do in educating  Americans of every age and communities of every size.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Indiana for his role in this.
