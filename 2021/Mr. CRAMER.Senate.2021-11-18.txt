 Madam President, for the second time this year, I  have the privilege of congratulating my alma mater, Kindred High  School, on a State championship.   In March, my hometown school celebrated the boys basketball team's  first-ever State championship. Eight months later, on November 12, the  Kindred Vikings football team won the State 11B title at the Dakota  Bowl State Football Tournament. The Vikings defeated longtime rivals,  the No. 1-ranked Hillsboro-Central Valley Burros, by a score of 37 to  14, for the championship. They had earlier won their first three games,  defeating Lisbon, Central Cass, and Bishop Ryan teams.   This was the first State championship for the Vikings since State  playoffs sponsored by the North Dakota High School Activities  Association began in 1975. They had made only one other Dakota Bowl  appearance in 2016. To advance to the tournament this year, the Vikings  defeated the Langdon-Edmore-Munich Cardinals, which had played in every  Dakota Bowl since 2016.   Graduating from Kindred High School in 1979, I lettered for 4 years  in football, basketball and track. I was the starting quarterback my  junior and senior years, and our team was bad, me especially.   Knowing firsthand what it is like to persevere on a losing team,  watching these Kindred Vikings, who ended the season with a 12-1  record, was thrilling. I saw very talented athletes excel by tapping  into the strength of each player. Notably, the impressive skills of  running back Trey Heinrich did not go unnoticed when he was named the  MaxPreps North Dakota Player of the Year.   I want to recognize this year's team members Charles Biewer, Masen  Allmaras, Lukas Klabunde, Izaak Spelhaug, Maxwell McQuillan, Andrew  Trom, Taylor Stefonowicz, Carter Schmitz, Caleb Klabunde, Connor  Rolland, Jack McDonald, Wyatt Briscoe, Graham Glasoe, Jordyn Sunram,  Hayden Cichy, Owen Hoyme, Kylan Swenson, Jorgen Swenson, Camron  Schwartzwalter, Trey Heinrich, Ty Roesler, Tyson Johnson, Chase Miller,  Jeremiah Dockter, Alex Moffet, Jacob Hiatt, Samuel Jenness, Jacob Lund,  Jack Huesman, Blake Houska, Tate Miller, Landon Kottsick, Grant  Spelhaug, Andrew Haley, Colin Lunde, Ethan Fornshell, Mason Nipstad,  Kelby Erdmann, Dilon Filler, Riley Sunram, Jack Packer, Jack Olson,  Hunter Bindas, Maxwell Opgrand, and Ryker Lachowitzer.   I congratulate the team, as well as Coach Matt Crane, his assistants  Brad Ambrosius, Eric Burgad, Joe Harder, Nate Safe, and Ryan Sunram and  all the hometown fans on winning this championship.   I join the rest of North Dakota in thanking the Kindred Vikings for  inspiring all of us to achieve excellence. For the second time this  year, they have demonstrated what can be achieved by combining faith  and passion with determination and teamwork.                            ____________________
