 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Is there a time limit?    Thank you. I know there are others waiting, so I  don't estimate I will take more than 10 or 12 minutes.   I rise in opposition to the nomination of Tom Farr to the Eastern  District of North Carolina. I do so as the ranking member of the  Judiciary Committee.   The vote for Mr. Farr's nomination, as Members know, had been  scheduled for today, but it has been postponed. Mr. Farr's long career  indicates that his history raises serious questions about his ability  to safeguard voting rights for all Americans. In fact, he has a history  involving voter suppression efforts, which leads me to question his  qualifications to even be a Federal judge.   Farr's hostility toward voting rights can be traced back to the 1980s  and 1990s when he worked as a lead attorney for Senator Jesse Helms'  reelection campaign. Media reports indicate that he was not truthful in  his responses to questions for the record about his involvement in  voter suppression efforts that were orchestrated by the Helms campaign  and by the Republican Party of North Carolina.   Here are the facts:   In 1990, Helms was in a tight race with the mayor of Charlotte,  Harvey Gantt, and the campaign implemented a strategy to suppress and  confuse African-American voters. The Helms campaign and the North  Carolina GOP implemented a so-called ballot security program. That  program included sending more than 120,000 postcards almost exclusively  to African-American voters, saying they were required to live in a  precinct for at least 30 days prior to election day and could be  subjected to criminal prosecution.   This information was, in fact, false. In fact, one African-American  voter in the State who received a postcard that informed him that he  could not vote if he had not lived in his voting precinct for at least  30 days had lived at the same address for more than 30 years and had  been registered to vote that entire time. So clearly these postcards  were designed to intimidate African-American voters.   In committee, I asked Mr. Farr about this program and his  participation in it. He told me that he did not provide any counsel and  was not aware of the postcards until after they were sent. Former  Federal prosecutor Gerald Hebert, who had worked on voting rights  issues at the time, contradicted these statements.   To get to the bottom of it, the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee  requested a copy of a Justice Department memo that reportedly detailed  Farr's role in this voter suppression incident, but the Department  would not provide a copy of the memo. The Washington Post has now  obtained the memo, which clearly shows that Farr was, in fact, involved  in these voter intimidation efforts.   I ask unanimous consent that the appropriate parts of the Washington  Post article and a memorandum be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Washington Post, Nov. 27, 2018]   Fate of Divisive Judicial Nominee From North Carolina Uncertain Amid                                 Criticism                     (By Seung Min Kim and John Wagner)         The fate of President Trump's divisive judicial nominee       hung in the balance Tuesday as a Republican senator remained       undecided on whether to confirm Thomas Farr, who previously       worked to defend North Carolina voting laws ruled to have       been discriminatory against African Americans.  [[Page S7204]]         Senate Democrats have been particularly critical of Farr,       an attorney in Raleigh who backed a law that the courts       called ``the most restrictive voting law North Carolina has       seen since the era of Jim Crow.'' All 49 Democrats oppose the       nomination.        Andrew Gillum and Stacey Abrams, two black candidates who       fell short in high-profile gubernatorial races this month,       criticized the nomination in a new statement Tuesday,       underscoring the national fight over Farr's nomination to a       seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of       North Carolina.        ``Thomas Farr's record of hostility and disregard for       fundamental civil rights disqualifies him for a lifetime       appointment that will allow him to codify his discriminatory       ideology into law,'' Gillum and Abrams said in a joint       statement. ``North Carolina's Eastern District--where most of       the state's African Americans live--should be represented by       a Bench that represents its diversity, not one that actively       works to disenfranchise them.''        Senate Republican leaders have been publicly confident that       they will have the votes to confirm Farr, although they will       almost certainly need to summon Vice President Pence to break       a 50-50 tie.        Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) has vowed to oppose all judicial       nominations until the chamber votes on legislation that he is       seeking that would protect special counsel Robert S. Mueller       III. Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) said Tuesday that he had made no       decision on the nomination.        Farr worked on the 1990 campaign of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-      N.C.), which came under scrutiny for distributing postcards       that the Justice Department later said were sent to       intimidate black voters from heading to the polls.        The postcard issue has become one factor in the unusually       bitter nomination fight. In response to questions from       Democrats, Farr has denied any role in drafting the postcards       and said he did not know about them until after the mailers       were sent, saying he was ``appalled'' when he found out about       them.        A 1991 Justice Department document newly obtained by The       Washington Post sheds some light on Helms's campaign and the       state Republican Party's broader ``ballot security'' program,       of which the postcards were one component. Farr served as a       lead lawyer for Helms.        The DOJ document, called a justification memo, elaborates       on a meeting disclosed by Farr in a letter to Sen. Cory       Booker (D-N.J.) last year. In that five-page letter, Farr       said he participated in a ``ballot security'' meeting of the       Helms campaign in October 1990 in which he said there was no       need to do a card mailing because returned cards could no       longer be used to challenge voter legitimacy.        The DOJ document obtained by The Post outlined the basis       for the DOJ complaint against the Helms campaign and the       North Carolina Republican Party for the more than 120,000       postcards sent primarily to black voters that officials said       were an attempt to dissuade them from voting.        At the meeting, Farr told others that there were a limited       number of ballot security initiatives that the groups could       undertake at that point in the race, according to the memo.       He also said because the current Republican governor could       tap a majority of county election officials statewide, the       need for a ballot security program that year was lessened       because ``they would ensure a fair election process for       Republican candidates.''        During the meeting, participants also reviewed the Helms       campaign's 1984 ballot security effort Farr had coordinated       ``with an eye toward the activities that should be undertaken       in 1990,'' the DOJ wrote in the memo. The document did not       say directly whether the controversial postcards were       discussed as part of that effort, and Farr has repeatedly       denied any prior knowledge of those mailers.        Farr was not named in the DOJ complaint against the       Republican entities, and he also signed a consent decree that       effectively settled the issue in early 1992.        Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), one of Farr's most vocal       supporters, had asked a former prosecutor to investigate the       claims that Farr was directly involved with the controversial       postcards. That investigation has turned up no evidence.        ``I'd ask them one simple question: When in the history of       the DOJ have they allowed somebody who was subject to the       investigation negotiate the consent agreement and sign it?''       Tillis said Tuesday. ``Never happens, which is exactly why       these are baseless claims.''        Booker had requested DOJ release the justification memo,       but it declined, citing confidentiality issues. A Justice       Department spokesman declined to comment Tuesday on the memo.       Farr did not return an email requesting a comment; nor did       the White House.        The Senate Judiciary Committee advanced Farr's confirmation       with a party-line vote in January. Republicans in control of       the North Carolina General Assembly hired Farr and others in       his law firm to defend congressional boundaries it approved       in 2011. In 2016, a federal court struck down the map as a       racial gerrymander.        Farr also helped defend a 2013 voter ID law that was       considered one of the strictest in the nation. In addition to       requiring residents to show identification before they could       cast a ballot, the law also eliminated same-day voter       registration, got rid of seven days of early voting and ended       out-of-precinct voting.        A federal court ruled in 2016 that the primary purpose of       North Carolina's law wasn't to stop voter fraud but rather to       disenfranchise minority voters. The judges wrote that the law       targeted African Americans ``with almost surgical       precision,'' in part because the only acceptable forms of       voter identification were ones disproportionately used by       white people.        Farr has a ``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar       Association and was previously nominated to the same post by       President George W. Bush.        Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he       spoke to Gillum and Abrams earlier in the day and that they       ``were hurt by attempts to limit voting rights.'' During a       floor speech, Schumer called Farr the ``chief cook and bottle       washer'' for the contested laws in North Carolina.        ``I don't care what your party is, and I don't care what       your political ideology is,'' Schumer said. ``How can you       have this man in the court?''        The history of the seat Farr would fill also has       contributed to the acrimony over his nomination. President       Barack Obama nominated two African American women for the       post during his tenure, but neither was granted a hearing.       This is the longest current court vacancy nationwide.        Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has been considered a potential       ``no'' voted on Farr because he was prepared earlier this       year to join Scott in voting against another judicial nominee       with a history of racially charged writing. That nomination       was withdrawn.        On Tuesday, however, Rubio--who was briefed by his staff on       the nomination Tuesday evening--was prepared to vote for Farr       barring any new information that may come out about him,       according to a Senate official familiar with his thinking.        Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), another potential swing vote,       also backs Farr.                                   ____        Action Memorandum--Recommended Lawsuit Against North Carolina  Republican Party, Helms Campaign for Senate Committee, et al.

[EXCERPT: PAGE 8-9]       D. The Investigation        Our investigation began on November 1, 1990, the day we       obtained reliable information that the postcards at issue had       been sent primarily to black voters throughout the State. On       that day, we requested that the FBI contact Jack Hawke,       Chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party, and ask Mr.       Hawke, among other things, the method used to select the       voters who were sent postcards and all plans regarding the       use of the returned postcards. Mr. Hawke refused to return       FBI Agent George Dyer's phone calls, and eventually referred       Dyer to his attorney, Thomas Farr, an attorney with Maupin,       Taylor, Ellis and Adams, in Raleigh, who was immediately       advised by Mr. Dyer of the information we sought from the       North Carolina Republican Party.        On Monday, November 5, 1990, after receiving no information       responsive to our request, you contacted Mr. Farr and       insisted that he provide us with the information we requested       by that afternoon. During this conversation, Farr assured you       that no information obtained from the returned cards would be       used as a basis to challenge voters on election day. Late in       the afternoon on November 5, Farr telefaxed to us a list of       precincts, which he orally represented to be the precincts in       which the voters selected to receive the postcards resided.       Although Farr also advised us that Hawke would be made       available that day for an interview with Dyer and myself,       Hawke in fact did not submit to a voluntary interview that       day.        The lack of cooperation which marked the initial stages of       the investigation has persisted during the course of our       investigation. Soon after the election, we contacted the       North Carolina Republican Party, the Jefferson Marketing       Companies, Mr. Ed Locke, and Mr. Doug Davidson, and requested       that they provide us with all information relevant to our       investigation. Mr. Hawke and Ms. Effie Pernell, the Executive       Director of the North Carolina Republican Party, voluntarily       spoke with Dyer on November 9, 1990. In late November, we       received a request from Mr. Michael Carvin, one of the       attorneys representing the North Carolina Republican Party,       for a meeting with Department attorneys to discuss our       investigation. At the time we received this request, we were       on the verge of obtaining voluntary statements from       individuals associated with Jefferson Marketing and from Doug       Davidson. However, the respective counsel chose to delay the       scheduling of any interviews until we responded to Mr.       Carvin's request. Asserting that the requested meeting would       be ``premature,'' we declined the invitation to meet with       Carvin on December 21.                            [EXCERPT: PAGE 11-14]       D. The 1990 ``Ballot Security'' Program        The postcard mailing was one component of the 1990 ``ballot       security'' program financed by the NCGOP. The wheels for the       1990 ``ballot security'' program were set in motion long       before the actual mailing of the postcards. According to Doug       Davidson, of Campaign Management, Inc., ``ballot security''       was discussed at several meetings held during the summer       months of 1990. These meetings were attended by Davidson,       Carter  [[Page S7205]]       Wrenn, a consultant to the Helms Committee, Peter Moore, the       campaign manager for the Helms committee, Jack Hawke,       Chairman of the NCGOP, and Effie Pernell, Executive Director       of the NCGOP. During these meetings, in addition to       discussing general campaign strategy, Davidson recalls that a       consensus was reached that some type of ``ballot security''       effort needed to be undertaken prior to the 1990 general       election. Peter Moore confirmed Davidson's recollections, as       he recalls meetings in which discussions focused upon the       need for a ``ballot security'' program in connection with the       November, 1990 election. At one of these meetings involving       the leadership of the Helms Committee and the NCGOP, the       decision was made to budget $25,000 for the 1990 ``ballot       security'' program and to finance the ``ballot security''       program with NCGOP funds.        In early September, 1990, Ed Locke, a political consultant       from Charlotte who had played a major role in organizing the       1984 ``ballot security'' program for the NCGOP and the 1984       Helms Committee, contacted Tom Farr to offer his services for       coordinating the 1990 ``ballot security'' program.        On October 16th, Davidson and possibly Tom Farr, who had       worked with Ed Locke on the 1984 ``ballot security'' program       for the NCGOP and the Helms Committee, contacted Locke by       telephone in Charlotte and asked Locke if he would be willing       to meet in Raleigh to discuss the 1990 ``ballot security''       program. Apparently Peter Moore and Carter Wrenn had been       consulted concerning contacting Locke for discussions on the       ``ballot security'' program and had given their assent to       pursue such discussions. Locke agreed to meet with the Helms       Committee representatives and flew to Raleigh the next day.        In Raleigh, he met initially with Moore, Davidson, and       Farr. This meeting was held at Farr's law firm, Maupin,       Taylor, Ellis & Adams. At the meeting, the participants       apparently reviewed the 1984 ``ballot security'' program with       an eye toward the activities that should be undertaken in       1990. Davidson stated that by the end of the meeting they had       formulated a tentative outline for the 1990 ``ballot       security'' effort. Davidson recalls that a mailing targeted       at voters who no longer resided in the precinct in which they       are registered was one of the projects suggested for 1990.       They also discussed who would be best suited to coordinate       the ``ballot security'' effort.        According to Farr, he told the attendees of the meeting       that there was only a limited number of ``ballot security''       programs that could be undertaken with only about three weeks       left in the election. Farr also stated that the need for a       ``ballot security'' program was not as compelling as in 1984,       since, unlike in 1984, the state had a Republican governor.       Since the Governor has power to appoint two out of the three       members of each county's board of elections, Farr explained       that the Republican-controlled county election boards       throughout the state would serve effectively as a statewide       ``ballot security'' program, as they would ensure a fair       election process for Republican candidates. He suggested that       contact be made with a Republican board of elections member       in every county to ensure that they will be working on       election day. He also suggested that, to the extent that any       ``ballot security'' programs are undertaken, they should       focus on those precincts with little or no Republican       presence at the polls. To this end, he advised that the Helms       Committee/NCGOP should hire observers to watch the opening       and closing of the polls in such precincts. He suggested that       it may also be helpful to publicize the fact that a ``ballot       security'' program is going to be undertaken.        When the idea of a card mailing was raised, Farr told us       that he explained to Locke and the others that while during       the 1984 election, state law provided that returned postcards       may serve as prima facie evidence that a voter was not       properly registered to vote in that precinct, such procedures       had been altered subsequent to that election so that a       returned mailing could no longer serve to support an election       day challenge of voters. He told the others that in light of       this change, a postcard mailing like the mailing conducted in       1984 would not be particularly useful, except for use as       evidence in post-election challenges.     The memo includes Farr's own retelling of meetings in  which sending postcards to voters was discussed. In fact, Farr told  colleagues that postcards might not be as effective in kicking voters  off the rolls as they had been in 1984. It is impossible, though, to  square this memo with Farr's denial to the Judiciary Committee that he  had any knowledge of these actions.   In addition, since that time, Mr. Farr has remained active in efforts  to depress and dilute African-American voting. In several cases, Farr  defended North Carolina's congressional and legislative districts that  were drawn after the 2010 Census against allegations that the State  legislature drew them to dilute the vote of African Americans. Farr has  defended these districts before North Carolina's State courts, Federal  courts, and the Supreme Court. However, in each instance, his arguments  have been rejected.   In North Carolina v. Covington, a three-judge panel in the Middle  District of North Carolina found that ``race was the predominant factor  motivating the drawing of all challenged [state legislative]  districts.''   In Harris v. McCrory, two of the three Federal judges on a panel held  that the State's congressional redistricting plan violated the 14th  Amendment's equal protection clause.   In 2016, Farr also defended North Carolina's restrictive voter ID law  in the North Carolina State Conference of the NAACP v. McCrory. He had  served as an adviser to the State legislature as it was considering  that legislation. In arguing before the Fourth Circuit, Farr strongly  denied that racial animus toward African Americans was the motivation  for the voter ID law. The court, however, strongly disagreed. In  striking down the law, the court strongly rejected Farr's arguments,  noting that the law's requirements ``target African Americans with  almost surgical precision.'' That is the Fourth Circuit's confirming  that racial animus was part of this.   The Congressional Black Caucus Foundation expressed its strong  opposition to Farr's nomination, writing that ``Farr has amassed a  record that puts him at the forefront of an extended fight to  disenfranchise African-American voters.''   Opposition to Farr's nomination has been compounded by the history of  this particular vacancy, which has been open for a long time--actually,  since 2006. President Obama nominated two highly qualified African- American women to fill the vacancy. Either would have been the first  African American to serve on the court--a long-overdue milestone in a  district in which more than 25 percent of the population is African  American.   The first nominee, Jennifer May-Parker, served as chief of the  Appellate Division at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern  District of North Carolina. By that time, she had served in the U.S.  Attorney's Office for 14 years. Her nomination did not move forward  because she didn't receive a blue slip from the State's Republican  Senator even though he had initially recommended her to the White House  as a potential nominee.   The second nominee, Patricia Timmons-Goodson, served as the vice  chair of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. She had previously served  as an associate justice on the North Carolina Supreme Court and as an  associate judge for the North Carolina Court of Appeals. Again,  Republicans did not allow her nomination to move forward.   While the Republicans have undermined the blue-slip policy to confirm  President Trump's judicial nominees, it is important to know that the  only reason Tom Farr's nomination is under consideration today is that  Republican blue slips were honored by the Democrats during the Obama  administration. In short, the Republicans blocked two highly qualified  African-American women from filling the vacancy in order to hold the  seat open for a White nominee with a history of disenfranchising Black  Americans. I am sorry to say that, but that is the way it was.   It is impossible to see how the people Tom Farr would serve in the  Eastern District of North Carolina would ever believe they would be  getting a fair shot in his courtroom. The Senate should reject this  nominee.   I yield the floor.
