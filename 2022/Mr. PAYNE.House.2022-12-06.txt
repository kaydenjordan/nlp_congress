 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, unfortunately, to address the  horrible anti-American comments made by Donald Trump.   Recently, the prominent Republican posted that it was time to  terminate the Constitution. The Constitution is the foundation of our  country and the backbone of our democracy. It is a brilliant document  that continues to inspire democratic governments worldwide.   If a Democrat or I had made these comments, the person would be  widely condemned and denied any attempt to run for office. But the  Republicans do the opposite. They give weak denunciations of the  comments--if any at all. But they refuse to reject Trump in public.   He rejects our institution, fights to deny our elections, and dines  with racists. Yet, this is the type of person the Republicans believe  to be a viable candidate for our highest office.   It is a disgrace and a national embarrassment.                            ____________________
