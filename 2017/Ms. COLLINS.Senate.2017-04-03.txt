 Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of the Main  Street Fairness Act, which will help to create tax parity for  passthrough companies, the significant majority of which are small  businesses. I was very pleased to be joined by my friend and colleague  from Florida, Senator Nelson, in introducing this bipartisan bill.  [[Page S2173]]    Small businesses are our Nation's job creators. According to the  Small Business Administration, small businesses employ more than half  of all workers and have generated two-out-of-three net new jobs since  the 1970s.   Small businesses also make an outsized contribution to our Nation's  economy, generating half of our Nation's GDP, 54 percent of all U.S.  sales, 41 percent of private sector payroll, and one-third of our  Nation's export value. Their success is critical to the health of our  economy.   Unfortunately, our Nation's small businesses face a higher tax burden  that affects their ability to compete with large firms in the  marketplace. In fact, a recent survey by the National Federation of  Independent Business, NFIB, found that concerns about Federal taxes on  business income ranked third on the list of the top 10 problems facing  small businesses.   Nearly all of our Nation's small businesses are organized as  passthroughs, meaning that their profits are passed on to their owners  and reported on individual income tax returns. This means that small  business income is subject to taxation at individual rates, which can  be as high as 39.6 percent at the Federal level and can exceed 50  percent in some States. If we want our small businesses to grow and  create jobs, we must reduce these high marginal rates.   I believe Congress should undertake comprehensive tax reform to make  our Tax Code simpler, fairer, and more progrowth. As we do so, we must  make sure American businesses of every size are given the opportunity  to compete. Aligning the tax rate for passthroughs with our corporate  tax rate will ensure small businesses are not left behind. That is why  Senator Nelson and I introduced the Main Street Fairness Act, which  will link the tax rates of passthrough entities and large corporations,  to ensure that small businesses never pay a higher tax rate than large  companies.   This simple change will help make sure that small businesses remain  healthy and strong, so they can continue to serve as our Nation's job  creators, as they have for so many years. I would note that the Main  Street Fairness Act has been endorsed by the NFIB, the leading voice  for America's small businesses, and I urge my colleagues to join us in  supporting it.   I ask unanimous consent to have a letter of endorsement from the NFIB  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                              National Federation of                                            Independent Business,                                      Washington, DC, April 3, 2017.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.      Hon. Bill Nelson,      U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Collins and Nelson: On behalf of the National       Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's       leading small business advocacy organization, we write in       strong support of S. 707--The Main Street Fairness Act. This       legislation would reduce taxes on pass-through businesses and       make them more competitive, and ensure that all businesses,       large and small alike, compete on a level playing field going       forward.        The vast majority of small businesses are organized as       pass-through entities, which pay tax on business income at       the individual tax rates, which are currently as high as 39.6       percent, and not at the corporate tax rate, which is       currently as high as 35 percent. Such entities include any       company organized as a sole proprietorship, partnership, LLC,       or S-Corporation. The Main Street Fairness Act would ensure       that those pass-through businesses never pay a higher tax       rate than businesses organized as C-Corporations, and       immediately reduce the tax rate on pass-through businesses       currently paying more than 35 percent.        Small businesses are the major source of growth and job       creation in our economy. In fact, according to the Small       Business Administration (SBA), small businesses account for       64 percent of the net new private sector jobs created in       America and make up 99.7 percent of U.S. employer firms. The       high tax burden currently facing small businesses holds back       investments, growth, hiring, and entrepreneurship. One in       five small businesses struggles with cash-flow, which is       needed to not only run their businesses but also support       their families. Specifically, after-tax income is an       especially important source of capital for small businesses.       High tax rates mean less money that small business owners       have to reinvest back into their business.        Because of this, small businesses strongly support tax       reform that simplifies the tax code, lowers tax rates on       businesses, and promotes economic growth. The Main Street       Fairness Act will help ensure that all businesses, regardless       of how they organize, enjoy the benefits of any reduction in       tax rates that would be included in tax reform. We appreciate       your continued leadership on this key issue and look forward       to working with you as Congress considers tax reform.            Sincerely,                                                 Juanita D. Duggan,                                                   President & CEO.
