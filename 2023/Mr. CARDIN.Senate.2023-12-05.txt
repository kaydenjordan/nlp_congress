 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first, I  want to thank my colleague from Florida for bringing this issue to the  floor. I have spoken frequently about the tragedies of the Maduro  regime, the protracted political, economic, and human rights crisis  that has been caused by the Maduro regime. Seven million Venezuelans  have left their homes. The Maduro regime is under investigation for  crimes against humanity. The list goes on and on and on.   I have the opportunity to chair the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee. This is a resolution that should go through our committee.  Our committee should have an opportunity to review and offer  suggestions as to what should be included and how it is worded. For  that reason alone, I would have concern about how it is moving forward.   But let me add just a few more parts to this. I support the  administration's efforts to pursue diplomatic engagement. By  strategically leveraging U.S. sanctions, the administration has  empowered Venezuela's democratic opposition in its negotiations with  this regime.    We impose sanctions so that we can get changes of actions of those  whom we impose the sanctions against. When we see progress in that  regard, we should be willing to modify or eliminate those sanctions.   On October 17, in Barbados, the Unitary Platform and the Maduro  regime reached an agreement. They created a roadmap for more  competitive Presidential elections next year.   By supporting this agreement, the Biden administration has provided  political space for the political opposition to hold primaries on  October 22. The results were resounding, as my colleague from Florida  has pointed out. Maria Corina Machado won the opposition primaries with  over 90 percent of the vote. That is an impressive victory. This is the  kind of progress that has been desperately needed to help restore  democracy in Venezuela.   Of course, the Maduro regime has sought to undermine the results of  the primary. We are not surprised by that. The Biden administration has  made it clear that if Maduro doesn't allow the candidate to run, they  will reimpose the sanctions. That is how it should work. And if it does  not release the political prisoners or wrongly detained Americans, the  United States will snap back our sanctions. We have made that very  clear. We want our political prisoners and wrongfully detained  Americans released immediately. They should never have been detained.  We want to make sure there is a competitive election in Venezuela, and  if it is not, we will reimpose our sanctions. And I have called for  these competitive elections.   As I pointed out, this resolution has not been considered by the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It comes as negotiations remain  underway and some initial advancements have taken place. It seeks to  dictate actions to the administration as sensitive diplomatic  negotiations are ongoing.   The Biden administration has already stated publicly it will reimpose  sanctions if the Maduro regime does not follow through on their  commitment. We don't trust them--believe me, we don't--and we have the  opportunity to reimpose those sanctions.   We must maintain the diplomatic space needed to advance democratic  elections. That is our objective. Our objective is to get democratic  elections and to secure the release of wrongfully detained Americans  and political prisoners.   So I would suggest to my colleague to submit his resolution for  consideration to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That is why we  have the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Give us a chance for the  input of those of us who have been working on this Venezuelan issue for  a long time. Give us the opportunity for input. That is how the system  is supposed to work.   I give my colleague the assurances--I want to take this up in the  Foreign Relations Committee. I want to see a resolution passed on the  floor of the Senate in regard to what is happening in Venezuela, and I  certainly will work with my colleague in that regard.   For the reasons I have stated, I object.    Mr. President, shortly, we will be voting on Elizabeth  Richard to be the State Department's Coordinator for Counterterrorism,  the motion in regard to invoking cloture. I speak  [[Page S5736]]  in favor of her nomination as the chairman of the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee.   We need someone at the helm of our civilian and diplomatic efforts on  counterterrorism who has the experience of working in some of the most  dangerous and challenging environments. We need someone who is  qualified to direct and successfully implement the Department's  counterterrorism programs and who can work hand in hand with the  Department of Defense on counterterrorism issues. We also need someone  who has proven they will stand up for American values.   The threat from terrorism has not gone away but has changed  dramatically. Not only has terrorism spread across more countries, but  today it takes on a different form.   Protecting our Nation from the evolving counterterrorism threat is  absolutely critical to the security of the United States. That is why  we must have an experienced leader at the helm of the Bureau of  Counterterrorism and why we must confirm Ambassador Richard without  delay.   Ambassador Richard has over three decades of experience in the  Foreign Service. She has served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary in  the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs at the Department of State; as  Deputy Chief of Mission in Yemen; as Border Coordinator in Pakistan;  and as Ambassador to Lebanon--a career diplomat who has served our  Nation. Throughout her tenure, she has led efforts with our partners  and allies to confront the challenges from terrorist groups.   Ambassador Richard's nomination was reported out of the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee by a voice vote. She has overwhelming  endorsements from military and civilian leaders alike, including the  support of some of our most experienced and senior national security  officials, from General Votel, retired four-star general and former  commander of Special Operations Command and Central Command; to General  Nagata, former commander of Special Operations Command Central and  Director of Strategy for the National Counterterrorism Center; to  retired Major General Fontes of U.S. Army Cyber Command.   All endorse her candidacy, as does Jeffrey Feltman, the former  Assistant Secretary General for Political Affairs of the United  Nations, Assistant Secretary for Near East Affairs, and U.S. Special  Envoy for the Horn of Africa; as has Anne Patterson, former U.S.  Ambassador to Pakistan, Egypt, and Colombia, and Assistant Secretary  for Near East Affairs.   I could go on.   Ambassador Richard has earned the support because of her long career.  They all speak highly of her ability and qualifications to lead the  Department's counterterrorism policy. As one of them said, she is  ``among the very finest diplomats our nation has produced.''   I have every confidence she will lead the CT Bureau with distinction.  This is a serious position, and it demands someone with the experience  and caliber that Ms. Richard possesses. She has the skill, knowledge,  and capacity to meet the challenges that lie ahead.   I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

Policy Justification               Australia--AUKUS Training and Training Devices         The Government of Australia has requested to buy articles       and services in support of the Trilateral AUKUS Pillar I       program. Included are training devices, personnel training,       planning, and Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) services;       support equipment; special tools; training software/ and       courseware; design; supply chain and industrial base support;       facilities and construction support; publications and       technical documentation; personnel training and training       equipment; U.S. Government and contractor engineering,       technical, and logistics support services; test and trials       support; studies and surveys; other related elements of       engineering, and repair services for associated equipment and       program support; and other related elements of logistic and       program support. U.S. training of private Australian industry       personnel will occur only after explicitly authorized by the       U.S. Department of State under U.S. law. The estimated total       program cost is $2.0 billion.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States. Australia       is one of our most important allies in the Western Pacific.       The strategic location of this political and economic power       contributes significantly to ensuring peace and economic       stability in the region. It is vital to the U.S. national       interest to assist our ally in developing and maintaining a       strong and ready self-defense capability.        The proposed sale will improve Australia's capability to       meet current and future threats by providing an effective       combatant deterrent capability to protect maritime interests       and infrastructure in support of its strategic mission. The       acquisition will lay the groundwork for the Australia/United       Kingdom/United States (AUKUS) trilateral agreement. Australia       will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment and services       into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractors will be Huntington Ingalls       Industries, Newport News, VA; General Dynamics Electric Boat,       Groton, CT; and Systems Planning Analysis, Alexandria, VA.       There are no known offset agreements in connection with this       potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale requires the       assignment of approximately seventy (70) additional U.S.       Government and contractor representatives to Australia for a       duration of approximately three (3) years to support in-      person training, equipment familiarization, and onsite       engineering and maintenance of simulation and training       devices.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

The proposed sale will improve the Republic of Korea's       capability to meet current and future threats by providing       its fighter fleet with a range of air-to-air and air-to-      ground munitions to deter aggression in the region and ensure       interoperability with U.S. forces. Korea will have no       difficulty absorbing these articles and services into its       armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractors will be Lockheed Martin       Corporation, Ocala, FL; Raytheon Missiles and Defense,       Tucson, AZ; and the Boeing Company, Huntsville, AL. The       purchaser typically requests offsets. Any offset agreement       will be defined in negotiations between the purchaser and the       contractor.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to the Republic of Korea.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 23-81       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AIM-120C-8 Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile       (AMMAM) is a supersonic, air-launched, aerial intercept,       guided missile featuring digital technology and       microminiature, solid-state electronics. AMRAAM capabilities       include look-down/shoot-down, multiple launches against       multiple targets, resistance to electronic countermeasures,       and interception of high- and low-flying and maneuvering       targets. This potential sale will include AMRAAM guidance and       control section spares and containers.        2. Joint Direct-Attack Munitions (JDAM) consist of a bomb       body paired with a warhead-specific tail kit containing an       Inertial Navigation System (INS)/Global Positioning System       (GPS) guidance capability that converts unguided free-fall       bombs into accurate, adverse weather ``smart'' munitions. The       JDAM weapon can be delivered from modest standoff ranges at       high or low altitudes against a variety of land and surface       targets during the day or night. The JDAM can receive target       coordinates via preplanned mission data from the delivery       aircraft, by onboard aircraft sensors (i.e., FLIR, Radar,       etc.) during captive carry, or from a third-party source via       manual or automated aircrew cockpit entry.        a. The GBU-31v1 is a 2,000-pound JDAM, consisting of a KMU-      556 tail kit and BLU-117 or Mk-84 bomb body.        b. The GBU-31v3 is a 2,000-pound JDAM, consisting of a KMU-      557 tail kit and BLU-109 bomb body.        c. The GBU-54 Laser Joint Direct Attack Munition (LJDAM) is       a 500-pound JDAM which incorporates all the capabilities of       the JDAM guidance tail kit and adds a precision laser       guidance set. The LJDAM gives the weapon system an optional       semi-active laser guidance in addition to the INS/GPS       guidance. This provides the optional capability to strike       moving targets. The GBU-54 consists of a DSU-38 laser       guidance set and bomb body with appropriate KMU-5XX tail kit.        3. The Paveway II (PWII) is a maneuverable, free-fall Laser       Guided Bomb (LGB) that guides to laser energy reflected off       the target. The LGB is delivered like a normal general       purpose (GP) warhead, but the semi-active laser guidance       corrects many of the normal errors inherent in any delivery       system. Laser designation for the LGB can be provided by a       variety of laser target markers or designators. The PWII       consists of a non-warhead-specific MAU-209 or MAU-169       Computer  [[Page S5743]]       Control Group (CCG) and a warhead-specific Air Foil Group       (AFG) that attaches to the nose and tail of the GP bomb body.        a. The GBU-12 is a 500-pound GP bomb body fitted with the       MAU-169 Computer Control Group and MXU-650 Air Foil Group to       guide to its laser designated target.        b. The inert GBU-12 uses a BDU-50 inert bomb body, MAU-169       Computer Control Group and MXU-650 Air Foil Group for       training and integration purposes.        4. The GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb Increment 1 (SDB-I) All-      Up-Round (AUR) is a 250-pound GPS-aided inertial navigation       system, small autonomous, day or night, adverse weather,       conventional, air-to-ground precision glide weapon able to       strike fixed and stationary re-locatable non-hardened targets       from standoff ranges. It is intended to provide aircraft with       an ability to carry a high number of bombs. Aircraft are able       to carry four SDBs in place of one 2,000-pound bomb.        (a) The GBU-39/B, Tactical Training Round (TTR), Small       Diameter Bomb (Inert Fuze) is functionally identical to a       live tactical weapon except that the live warhead is replaced       with an inert fill.        5. The GBU-53 Small Diameter Bomb-Increment II (SDB-II)       All-Up-Round (AUR) is a 250-pound class precision-guided,       semiautonomous, conventional, air-to-ground munition used to       defeat targets through adverse weather. The SDB-II has       deployable wings and fins and uses Global Positioning System/      Inertial Navigation System (GPS/INS) guidance, network-      enabled datalink (Link-16 and UHF), and a multi-mode seeker       (millimeter wave radar, imaging infrared, semi-active laser)       to autonomously search, acquire, track, and defeat a variety       of moving or stationary targets, at standoff range in a       variety of attack modes. The SDB-II employs a multieffects       warhead (blast, fragmentation, and shaped-charge) for maximum       lethality against armored and soft targets. The SDB-II weapon       system consists of the tactical AUR weapon, a 4-place common       carriage system, and mission planning system munitions       application program (MAP).        a. The SDB-II Practical Explosive Ordnance Disposal Trainer       (PEST) is an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) training unit       with sections and internal subassemblies which are identical       to, or correlate to, the external hardware, sections and       internal subassemblies of the tactical AUR. The PEST does not       contain energetics, a live fuze, any sensitive components, or       hazardous material. It is not flight certified.        b. The SDB-II Weapon Load Crew Trainer (WLCT) is a mass       mockup of the tactical AUR used for load crew and maintenance       training. It does not contain energetics, a live fuze, any       sensitive components, or hazardous material. It is not flight       certified.        6. The FMU-139 Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) is a multi-      delay, multi-arm and proximity sensor compatible with general       purpose blast, frag and hardened-target penetrator weapons.       The JPF settings are cockpit selectable in flight when used       with numerous precision-guided weapons.        7. Common Munitions Built-In-Test (BIT)/Reprogramming       Equipment (CMIBRE) is support equipment used to interface       with weapon systems to initiate and report BIT results, and       upload/download flight software. CMBRE supports multiple       munitions platforms with a range of applications that perform       preflight checks, periodic maintenance checks, loading of       Operational Flight Program (OFP) data, loading of munitions       mission planning data, loading of Global Positioning System       (GPS) cryptographic keys, and declassification of munitions-      memory.        8. The ADU-891 Adapter Group Test Set provides the physical       and electrical interface between the Common Munitions Built-      in-Test Reprogramming Equipment (CMBRE) and the missile.        9. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        10. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        11. A determination has been made that the Republic of       Korea can provide substantially the same degree of protection       for the sensitive technology being released as the U.S.       Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S.       foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in       the Policy Justification.        12. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Republic of Korea.                            ____________________
