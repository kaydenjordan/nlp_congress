 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.J. Res. 68. For the  next several hours on the House floor, we will not be discussing how to  raise wages for the middle class, debating how to create a regulatory  framework for next-generation artificial intelligence technology, or  strategizing about competing with China in the 21st century. Instead,  we will be debating a handful of resolutions that will provide  immediate sanctions relief for human rights violators, illicit arms  dealers, and terrorists with American blood on their hands.   I am not being hyperbolic, and I am not exaggerating. The resolutions  before us terminate emergencies that were declared for the express  purpose of sanctioning war criminals.   Given that we have several similar resolutions on the floor, it is  worth providing background on how the sanctions process works.   In 1976, Congress passed the National Emergencies Act. This act  formalized how the President can declare a normal emergency, enumerated  certain powers the President can use during such an emergency, and gave  Congress the ability to terminate an emergency via resolution like the  one we have before us today.   A year later, Congress built on this framework with the International  Emergency Economic Powers Act, often referred to as IEEPA, which  further elucidated what actions the President may take to regulate  international commerce in such an emergency. IEEPA is the foundation of  the modern American sanctions regime.   The benefits of IEEPA are very clear. They allow the President to  move quickly to impose sanctions. Though, of course, some time is  needed to jump through appropriate and necessary due process hurdles,  the President is able to impose sanctions without a particular  congressional mandate.   It is my view, likely shared by the sponsor and hopefully many  Members of this body, that the power over sanctions has moved too much  to the executive branch and too far from Congress. Too often,  congressionally mandated sanctions are slow-rolled or minimized while  the executive presses on with its preferred targets.   I do not want to diminish the seriousness and the impressive work  professionals at the State Department, the Treasury Department, and the  National Security Council do on sanctions. They take the work very  seriously and apply thoughtful policies with an attentional detail,  executing their actions in a careful manner.   Members of Congress should not blithely substitute their judgment  about existing national emergencies without conducting a thorough  review of the evidence, obtaining extensive briefings from the  executive branch, and gaining a firm understanding of the consequences  of a termination.   Moreover, each national emergency is reviewed at least annually. The  Bush administration, the Obama administration, the Trump  administration, and now the Biden administration all renewed the  national emergency this resolution seeks to terminate.   Many national emergencies have been terminated. For instance,  President George H.W. Bush terminated the South Africa program after  apartheid ended. President Biden terminated the Burundi program not  less than 2 years ago.   Let's take a quick look at some of the individuals currently  sanctioned under the DRC program. One is Viktor Bout. For decades, Bout  flooded the DRC with illegal weapons. He has bragged about his many  contacts in financial institutions who have helped him evade sanctions,  and Bout likely has significant assets that can easily be unfrozen. If  this body votes to terminate the executive order that imposes sanctions  on Bout, he stands to gain a windfall of cash within mere minutes.   The DRC program currently places sanctions on ISIS-Congo. That is  right, the foreign terrorist organization ISIS. If Congress votes to  pass this resolution, ISIS can set up a brokerage account, trade  stocks, transfer funds, or keep money in a checking account in the  United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, in my humble opinion, ISIS-Congo should not be permitted  to do any of the above, and neither should the numerous war criminals  currently covered under the Congo emergency.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose H.J. Res. 68, and I implore all of my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for the  purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I am not going to be long, but I am sitting here  scratching my head trying to figure out what the gentlewoman from  Colorado is talking about.   This is not money that is taxpayer money that is appropriated by the  people. I don't understand. This is money that these criminals, people  who commit acts of terror, have. It is money that happens to be in some  of our financial institutions that we know about. So we freeze it. They  are sanctioned so that they can't get the money to continue the harm  and damage to people.  [[Page H3662]]    She talks about children. Many of them, these individuals, were  having child soldiers. They were putting children's lives at risk in  war. I don't understand the rationality.   We should sanction ISIS. We should sanction Viktor Bout.   Mr. Speaker, I can't believe that any Member of this august body will  vote for this resolution. Every Member should vote against this, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 70.   For decades, Muammar Qadhafi ruled Libya with an iron fist and with a  corrupt, self-serving economic policy that stunted Libya's development  and, through a security state, engaged in international terrorism,  including the Lockerbie airline bombing that remains the deadliest  event in aviation history.                                time  1430    For the past 12 years, Libya has seen its share of continuous turmoil  and  [[Page H3663]]  chaos. To the extent this resolution is a symptom of frustration about  ongoing problems in Libya, that would be understandable. Any notion  that this resolution will be at all useful for Libya policy is deeply  misguided.   The United States actively supports the U.N.'s efforts to unify the  country and its institutions under a democratically elected government.   These talks are ongoing, and violence has decreased over the last  several years. The economy is doing better in part because U.S.  sanctions have helped decrease oil banditry.   Lifting sanctions on the worst actors in Libya, the individuals who  have perpetuated violence and instability, would send the exact wrong  message to those pursuing economic reform.   Whereas economic pressure and tough diplomacy have brought parties to  the table, a free pass on sanctions would have the exact opposite  impact.   In general, there have been two large batches of sanctions under the  Libya executive order. The Obama administration issued the first  tranche against the Qadhafi family and its fiefdom of business and fake  charities.   The Trump administration issued the second set that sanctioned  individuals who committed grave human rights abuses and prevented the  theft of Libyan oil by pirates and illegal merchants.   It is unclear to me how letting any of these people access American  finance would be beneficial to the United States or to Libya or to the  MENA region.   One of the most notable people currently sanctioned under the program  is Qadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam Qadhafi. When the protests began, Saif  al-Islam went on television and threatened ``rivers of blood'' if the  protestors did not cease.   He has never condemned his father. He has never condemned his  father's despotic rule and is actively seeking to regain power in Libya  as we speak.   The Qadhafi family controlled billions of dollars in assets. If  sanctions are lifted on the remaining members of the Qadhafi family,  the Qadhafis would have access to a windfall of wealth, which they  plundered from the Libyan people. Instead of the frozen funds going to  the Libyan people, they would go to the family that imprisoned and  impoverished them.   I cannot support anything like that outcome, Mr. Speaker. I must  strongly oppose and hope all of the Members of this House opposes H.J.  Res. 70.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I will be brief because, unfortunately, when we are in  this august body, the world is looking at us. As I was scratching my  head on the first resolution, I continue to do that.   Judgments I use in making determinations is: Is this good for  America?   The question is, does this resolution promote America's national  security? The answer to that is no.   Does this resolution support America's economic interests? The answer  to that is no.   Would this resolution undermine America's standing in Libya? The  answer to that is absolutely yes.   Would this resolution undermine our standing in the region? The  answer to that would be absolutely yes.   Mr. Speaker, there is no need for me to continue to stand to debate  this. I strongly oppose, and I believe overwhelmingly the Members of  this Congress oppose this resolution, and we should vote it down.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, and I  yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, we welcome Israel's President Herzog to the  United States of America.   For my entire career of 25 years in the House, and in recent weeks, I  have stood on this floor and spoken on the importance of the State of  Israel. The need for Israel to remain both Jewish and democratic is  without question.   Mr. Speaker, Israel cannot remain both Jewish and democratic unless  we have peace and if it does not live side by side in peace with the  Palestinian people. Both sides have to want peace. That is why I stand  strongly behind a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians.   As the resolution before us states, Israel is not a racist state. I  concur.  [[Page H3671]]    As the resolution before us states, Congress rejects all forms of  anti-Semitism and xenophobia. I concur.   Finally, as the resolution before us states, the United States will  always be a staunch partner and supporter of Israel. I concur.   I look forward to hearing the address of Israel's President Herzog  tomorrow. The President is a rare symbol of unity in a polarized  society and a true asset to Israel. He has been working diligently to  bring all parties in Israel together to find consensus on judicial  reform, something that is necessary to preserve Israel's democratic  character, in my view. I encourage him to keep up this important work  and wish him much success.   Without question, the Democratic Party, my Democratic Party, supports  the long-term viability of the Jewish state and knows its true  character and importance. In fact, I, along with Leader Jeffries and  others, was in Israel recently to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the  Jewish state and was moved by the events we witnessed.   Mr. Speaker, I support wholeheartedly and encourage all of my friends  on both sides of the aisle to support this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Manning).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in the 117th Congress, when I became the chair of  Foreign Affairs Committee, my first stop was in Israel celebrating the  Fourth of July.   I said then what I will say now: Israel and the United States stand  together because we have and share the same values. We believe in  democracy.   We know that Israel is a nation that at its foundation is not only  Jewish but democratic.   Its existence is crucial for the future of the Jewish people. We know  that this Congress will continue to expressly reject all forms of anti- Semitism and xenophobia as this resolution before us states.   We stand together, and I would hope that all Members of this august  body welcome President Herzog tomorrow as we listen and continue to  work with our strongest ally in the Middle East.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Sherman).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from the  great State of Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
