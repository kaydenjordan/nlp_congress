 Madam Speaker, in his 9 years with us, Faris Virani used  his short life to paint a masterpiece.   At 6 years old, he was told he had Ewing sarcoma, a deadly,  aggressive form of childhood cancer. He never complained or asked,  ``Why me?'' He was thankful to God for the gift of life.   When his family and friends felt down, he picked them up with his  trademark line, ``Let's go with the flow.'' Faris and his mom, Asha,  going with the flow.   He knew his short life was going to make this world better, and that  life became the force behind his Ewing Sarcoma Center at Texas  Children's Hospital that bears his name.   He was frustrated that every September Childhood Cancer Awareness  Month and its gold color were largely forgotten by the American people.  He said: ``Mom, when I grow up, I will let there be gold.''   Faris, we hear you and, in unison, we say, ``Let there be gold.''   In closing, Madam Speaker, I will say, in memory of Faris, please,  let there be gold. Celebrate this young man's life.   God bless Faris Virani.                            ____________________
