 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Anne Stordahl of Pondera County for her commitment to  supporting Montana small businesses.   Anne has been a small business owner in Conrad, Montana for 15 years.  When the local candy shop closed in her community, Anne decided to help  boost community morale by taking on a new project and business. She  opened the 2B Sweet Candy shop right next to her hair salon, giving her  customers a chance to grab some candy while waiting for their next  haircut.   Anne enlisted the help of her three children to open a new candy  store that could bring some joy back to their community, especially in  a time of uncertainty when many small businesses were closing their  doors. Her son handled the behind the scenes work of taking inventory  and balancing the books while her daughters handled a variety of tasks  like designing candy bouquets and serving customers.   Anne grew up on a farm and was able to use this experience to teach  her children what a strong Montana work ethic looks like and the  importance of family operations to our communities. At the beginning,  she hoped the store would bring her family closer, and looking back,  she would say this was a sweet success.   It is my honor to recognize Anne and her children for taking the  initiative to successfully launch the 2B Sweet Candy Shop. It is now a  proud part of the Conrad community.                            ____________________
