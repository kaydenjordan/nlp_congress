 Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of the privileges of  the House and offer the resolution that was previously noticed.    Mr. Speaker, Representative Tlaib has repeatedly made  atrocious statements against our ally Israel and in support of Hamas, a  terrorist group responsible for the largest massacre of Jews since the  Holocaust.   Represent Tlaib has levied unbelievable falsehoods about our greatest  ally, Israel, and the attack on October 7. Recently, she even falsely  blamed them for bombing the Al Ahli Arab hospital, but all of our  current intelligence shows that Israel was not responsible.   As stated in my resolution on November 3, Representative Tlaib said:  ``From the river to the sea is an aspirational call for freedom, human  rights, and peaceful coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate. My  work and advocacy is always centered in justice and dignity for all  people no matter faith or ethnicity.''   Mr. Speaker, let me break down the saying, ``From the river to the  sea.'' The river is the Jordan River, and the sea is the Mediterranean  Sea. This is a call for the complete destruction of Israel. It is  disgusting when it is used in this context that was meant.   Representative Tlaib boycotted Israeli President Herzog's address to  Congress, releasing a joint statement with Representative Bush that  said: ``Bestowing President Herzog with the rare honor of a joint  address to Congress while the Israeli apartheid government continues to  enable and directly support racism and brutal settler attacks is a slap  in the face to victims, survivors, and their loved ones. . . .''   This kind of hatred against our ally Israel is unacceptable. Israel  has a right to exist. For thousands of years, the Jewish people resided  in that land and, after being displaced for centuries, returned in 1948  after the Holocaust.   Mr. Speaker, we have seen the effects of the reprehensible rhetoric  of Representative Tlaib across the Nation. At schools and colleges  around the country, Jewish students have been forced to be on alert as  their anti-Semitic peers have engaged in disgusting demonstrations,  chanting anti-Semitic slogans.   At The Cooper Union, a private college in New York, Jewish students  were forced to hide from pro-Hamas protesters in a library where they  feared for their safety.   At George Washington University, just about a half mile from this  building, students broadcast ``Glory to our martyrs,'' and ``Free  Palestine from the river to the sea,'' on the side of a campus  building.   Further, yesterday, in Ventura County, California, Paul Kessler, a  Jewish man protesting for Israel, was killed in an altercation with  pro-Palestinian protesters.   These anti-Semitic incidents are happening right now in America in  2023. Quite frankly, in my entire lifetime, I have never seen anything  like it.   The same Nation that defeated Nazism in World War II must now defeat  an internal rot promoting the same senseless violence and hatred of  Jewish people.   It is a sad fact, but this type of anti-Semitic hate is being  promoted by a small group of Members in this body--chiefly,  Representative Tlaib. We must hold her accountable.   This war in Israel is affecting everyone, whether it is innocent  Palestinians at risk because of Hamas' actions; or our fellow Jewish  Americans, who now have to worry each day about the possibility of an  anti-Semitic attack; or Sergeant Elisheva Rose Ida Lubin, a young  Jewish woman who was a member of the Israeli Border Police and grew up  in Dunwoody, Georgia, and was killed by a Palestinian assailant.   For the safety and security of our Nation, we must continue to  support Israel, a nation fighting for democracy, decency, and Western  values.   Representative Tlaib has undermined U.S. interests with her  statements and must be censured.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Fine speech. You talk about setting precedents. I think there is a  precedent. You guys must have searched really high and far and long to  find the people who voted against censuring Paul Gosar or Marjorie  Taylor Greene. There is a precedent. You are right.   When you talk about freedom of speech and who protects that freedom  of speech, you are talking to a marine, and you are about to talk to a  Navy SEAL, people who would give their lives to defend the freedom of  speech. I understand that probably as well as anybody.   Let me be clear. This is not about a First Amendment issue. Rashida  Tlaib has the right to spew anti-Semitic vitriol and even call for the  destruction of the Jewish state, but the House of Representatives also  has the right to make it clear that her hate speech does not reflect  the opinion of the Chamber. That is what this resolution is about.   When you talk about ``from the river to the sea,'' we talked about  this with the Parliamentarian, and we talked about it with legal  counsel. We talked about precedent. We got the Intel Committee to make  sure the facts are straight. We did our homework on whether there is a  precedent on this.   If this is not worthy of censure, what is? When you can call for the  annihilation of a country and its people, if that is not worthy of  censure, what is?   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Van Orden).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   If this was about calling for a cease-fire, we would not have these  proceedings.   I was wrong, by the way, when I said that it must have taken a long  time to find somebody who hasn't voted for censorship from the other  side of the aisle. You didn't find it. The gentleman from the other  side of the aisle actually did vote for censorship on a First Amendment  right. I find it rather funny. We just researched it. Unless my sources  are wrong, the vast majority of the other side of the aisle actually  voted for censorship based on a First Amendment right.   I also wanted to say that my heart goes out to the Palestinian  people--it truly does--especially those people who were bombed in the  hospital, which my colleague knows wasn't from the Israelis.                                time  1515    Yet the statement is contrary to that, even though our intel was very  clear, as was our President, very clear. That is what this debate is  about.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Bergman), a Marine Corps general.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Van Drew).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Miller), a marine.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Lawler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Fallon).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert this  article from 11 Alive News, titled: ``Metro Atlanta woman killed in  Jerusalem: reports,'' dated November 6, 2023.    Mr. Speaker, I know there is a lot of passion today. I  heard a lot of screaming. I heard a lot of accusations, you could say,  on both sides.   I don't really care what race, religion, or gender orientation you  are. Where I come from in the Marine Corps, we are all shades of green,  and we all bleed red. That is the truth. I just care about the person  who has my back.   When I was student body president at Morehouse School of Medicine, I  was elected by my peers--60 percent females, 80 percent Black, 95  percent liberal. Why? I was elected because I love people. I love  people of all sorts. This isn't about who you are. It is about what you  represent, what this body represents. That is what this debate is  about.   If this is not worthy of censure, I don't know what it is.  Representative Tlaib has stoked anti-Semitism in this Nation and  undermined our national security.  [[Page H5503]]    Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this resolution to show  the world, especially our adversaries, that the United States stands  behind our allies and will not back down to terrorists.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer my amendment No. 61 to H.R.  4820, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations  Act for Fiscal Year 2024.    Mr. Chair, my amendment would prohibit funds from this  act from implementing President Biden's burdensome and misguided  Executive Orders 14037, 14057, and 14096.   Executive Orders 14037 and 14057 set the following goals for the  Biden administration's out-of-touch energy policy regulations: 100  percent of the electricity of the U.S. to be carbon pollution free by  2030 on a net annual basis; 100 percent of vehicles purchased by the  government to be zero emissions by 2035; and that 50 percent of all new  passenger cars and light trucks in the United States be electric  vehicles by 2030.   These economically harmful goals represent Democrats' desire for  central government planning that is not driven by public demand but by  bureaucrats deciding what they think is best for our diverse, vibrant  Nation of over 330 million people.   A prime example of Democratic failed policy initiatives is the story  of the electric bus manufacturer, Proterra, a company that received  extremely high praise from President Biden, as well as other  administration officials.   According to President Biden, Proterra was getting us in the game for  sustainable transportation. Well, after receiving millions upon  millions of dollars in Federal Government funding, on August 7 of this  year, Proterra filed for bankruptcy--this is not the first time this  thing has happened where a government-subsidized company has gone  bankrupt--citing a multitude of reasons, including the 9-figure debt.  That does not sound sustainable to me.   Almost 2 years ago, the Department of Transportation Secretary Pete  Buttigieg said that America should purchase electric vehicles so that  they won't have to worry about gas prices again. Instead, they will  have to worry about supply-chain disruptions and critical mineral  sourcing, not to mention the cost of these vehicles.   Now, I don't know about the average American, but I guarantee you  they don't spend an extra $17,000 per year on gas. The average cost of  an electric vehicle is over $60,000 and on average costs $17,000 more  than a gas vehicle. This does not take into account if the battery goes  bad. It will, and it costs about $17,000 to replace that, too, which  means people are going to be relying on the government for more  subsidies.   These types of statements show just how out of touch the leftwing  officials in the Biden administration can be. Switching to electric  vehicles, or whatever future technology, must come naturally through  free-market forces. Mandating a change is building an entire vehicle  market on an expensive house of cards, and it will eventually come  crashing down, just like Proterra.   Just as concerning is Executive Order 14096 and its crusade for so- called environmental justice. Mr. Chair, instead of simply declaring  what is true and promoting environmental conservation, which most  people would agree is a good thing, the Biden administration makes this  about cultural Marxism, oppressor versus the oppressed. This is toxic  rhetoric.   Instead of tackling economic hardships facing Americans, the fentanyl  crisis in our communities, the crisis along the southern border, and  multiple crises overseas, the Biden administration is creating a  narrative that fits their dark view of American history and executive  policy that negatively affects Americans.                                time  1845    Everyone wants clean air, safe water, and access to the outdoors for  all. Let's not make this about something it is not.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, Congress should not allow valuable  taxpayer dollars to fund these executive orders that do nothing to help  the American people.   Those demanding EV vehicles know the impoverished cannot afford them,  which will cause even more dependence on government. That is the built- in harassment package that liberals have created--regulate people into  dependence on government so they must vote for bigger government that  can never be paid for but will forever be empowered over those who  would otherwise be free to live the full measure of the American Dream.   Mr. Chairman, ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  this commonsense amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
