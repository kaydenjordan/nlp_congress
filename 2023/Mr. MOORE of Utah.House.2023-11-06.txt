 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2717, the  Hershel ``Woody'' Williams National Medal of Honor Monument Location  Act. I thank the chairman and ranking member for their leadership in  prioritizing this important piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, Woody Williams was born on a West Virginia dairy farm in  1923 and was first drawn to the Marine Corps by their trademark  uniforms. At 5-foot-6, Williams was unable to enlist in the Marines due  to height restrictions. After that regulation was changed in 1943,  Woody enlisted and was in the Pacific theater in less than 90 days.   On February 21, 1945, then-Corporal Williams landed on the beach at  Iwo Jima, where he distinguished himself by repeatedly risking the  threat of enemy fire and bayonet charges over several hours while  singlehandedly destroying enemy pillboxes, or concrete trenches, to  make way for American tanks and infantry.                                time  1615    His gallant actions took place on the same day as the famous flag  raising on Mount Suribachi, which he witnessed from about 1,000 yards  away.   After returning home, President Harry Truman awarded Corporal Hershel  Williams the Medal of Honor, our Nation's highest recognition for valor  in combat. He recognized his ``aggressive fighting spirit and valiant  devotion to duty throughout this fiercely contested action,  [sustaining] and [enhancing] the highest traditions of the United  States Naval Service.''   Following his distinguished marine career, Williams continued to  serve others in many capacities. Some of my colleagues may remember  last summer when Hershel Williams lay in state in the U.S. Capitol  rotunda as the last World War II Medal of Honor recipient to pass away.   Since its inception by President Lincoln in 1862, 3,517 brave  soldiers have received the Nation's highest honor for going above and  beyond the call of duty and risking life and limb in selfless service  to their countrymen. This elite class represents less than 0.001  percent of the 40 million brave sons and daughters who have served in  the Armed Forces since the American Civil War.   While a permanent memorial for Medal of Honor recipients has been  discussed for years, it was not until 2021 when President Biden signed  a bill that Congressman Veasey and I introduced to authorize the  creation of a new monument to honor those who have been awarded the  Medal of Honor. Today, we continue this work to authorize the creation  of this monument in the Reserve, also known as the great cross-axis of  The National Mall.   The monument will stand as a testament to those who protect our  Nation's values, such as the nearly half dozen from my home State of  Utah. We envision it as an educational platform for future generations  to learn about what has been required to maintain our Republic.   By siting this monument near the Lincoln Memorial, we can pay fitting  tribute to the President who established the award and embodied its  principles. Our work to form a more perfect Union is unending, and I  find it fitting that a monument honoring our Nation's greatest heroes  will be visible from the memorial honoring one of our greatest martyrs.   Today, our Nation finds itself sharply divided along partisan lines.  This monument will remind our great Nation and its people that there is  far more that unites us than divides us. It is my hope that  constructing this monument in its rightful place will inspire all  Americans and allow us to pay our respects to and learn from these  individuals and these families who, in Lincoln's words, ``have laid so  costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.''   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2717.
