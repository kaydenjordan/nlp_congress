 Madam Speaker, I claim time in opposition.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to  amendment 22. I believe this amendment will undermine our ability to  appropriately deal with human rights abuses and aggressions towards the  United States.   This amendment would require the Secretary of State in coordination  with the Secretary of Energy to submit a report to Congress on how U.S.  sanctions are affecting our ability to adapt to climate change and  promote environmental justice, among other things.   First, let me remind my friends across the aisle that we are meant to  be discussing the competitiveness bill today, not a climate bill. This  bill is meant to address the Chinese Communist Party's growing  aggression and  [[Page H926]]  to ensure the United States remains the world leader in science and  technology.   This amendment doesn't prioritize our competitiveness, and it doesn't  help us face the threat from China. Worst, it could hinder our  abilities to address that threat.   Let's not forget sanctions are for countries that have committed  inexcusable offenses against their own people or the United States.   It seems to me that the purpose of this amendment is to show that our  sanctions against China, who is committing forced labor crimes every  day, are actually hurting progress towards adapting to climate change.   Essentially, this amendment places technological adaptations to  climate change on the same footing as forced labor and genocide. I  fully believe that the United States has the capacity to develop  innovative technologies to continue to reduce our emission and mitigate  the effects of climate change. And I do not accept that to do this, we  need to prioritize China's innovation over their use of forced labor.   Addressing climate change does not require sacrificing American  ideals and standards. We can best address global climate change by  innovating in America and holding China accountable, not by giving them  a pass. I would much rather look at how the United States can encourage  more participation in research and development than drive innovation.   Let's support our research enterprise, our workforce, our access to  domestic critical minerals and, yes, let's actually identify innovative  ways that we can combat global climate change.   Not once has the Department of Energy or the National Science  Foundation come to us to say that our stance against forced labor or  child labor is hindering their ability to research, develop, and  demonstrate clean energy technologies. This is a made-up problem, which  this report is trying to solve with a pre-determined solution.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support your constituents by  putting the United States first and opposing this amendment.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I think my opening statement made the point that this  is actually conflating two issues and shouldn't. And so for that  reason, I strongly oppose the amendment.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Madam Speaker, I claim time in opposition.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, this amendment further expands the existing 80-year- old apprenticeships system to now include apprenticeships in ``media  and entertainment.''   Instead of expanding this program that is already bloated with  bureaucracy, time-consuming paperwork, and overly burdensome  requirements, this bill should be focusing on programs that push  employer-developed apprenticeships that will help our workforce expand  and thrive.   I cannot help but ask: What do apprenticeships in media and  entertainment have to do with competing with the Chinese Communist  Party?   The CCP has dramatically increased its STEM workforce. One report  predicts a 300 percent increase in the number of overall STEM graduates  in China versus a 30 percent increase in the United States.   Instead of focusing on training the next Meryl Streep, we should be  focused on developing America's STEM workforce, especially at the  skilled technical workforce level.   If we can't expand the STEM workforce through initiatives like  innovative apprenticeship models that give  [[Page H927]]  employees the skills they need, we won't be able to maintain the talent  base that supports key sectors of the economy, including agriculture,  energy, healthcare, and defense.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to oppose this amendment and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I would reply to my colleague that in Oklahoma we have  done an incredible job of expanding the media and entertainment  industry within our State without this type of program.   We need to be focusing on STEM innovation and STEM workforce. In  Oklahoma, we could graduate every engineering student from our colleges  and universities and still be 3,000 engineers short, particularly as we  look at our military bases in Oklahoma. Focusing on core industries  like energy and defense are what we should be doing.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition,  although I am not opposed.    Madam Speaker, this amendment would insert the  text of H.R. 4996, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2021, into the  America COMPETES Act.   The bill passed the House under suspension of the rules with 364  bipartisan votes in December, and I was proud to support the  legislation.   The amendment provides expanded authorities to the Federal Maritime  Commission, which regulates ocean shipping to protect and ensure  fairness for U.S. shippers who import and export items to and from the  U.S.   The amendment helps American shippers operate on a level playing  field by increasing protections for U.S. shippers from retaliation by  foreign shippers who file a complaint with the FMC.   It also prohibits foreign ocean carriers from unreasonably denying  the carriage of U.S. export cargo on foreign ocean carriers' vessels if  such cargo is available, can be loaded safely, and is going to a  destination on the ship's schedule.   This provision is important for agricultural producers in Oklahoma  and across the country who will benefit from increased capacity to ship  production across the globe.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Congressmen Garamendi and Johnson for  their support of the underlying bill and this amendment, and I urge its  passage.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from the Mount  Rushmore State of South Dakota (Mr. Johnson).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I claim time in opposition.    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to  this amendment. The amendment is the latest attempt by Progressives to  undermine efforts to keep money out of the hands of a terrorist  organization.   Following the Biden administration's disastrous withdrawal from  Afghanistan and the Taliban's takeover of the country, the U.S. did  freeze nearly $9.5 billion in assets of the Afghan central bank to  prevent the terrorist organization from accessing the funds.   Other international organizations have taken similar actions. This  amendment attacks such protections made by the U.S. and our  international partners. The package already jeopardizes our national  security by signaling to the Communist leadership in China that we are  not taking our economic competitiveness and technological leadership  seriously.   Now, some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are taking  it a step further by attempting to include language that encourages  handing over billions of dollars to a terrorist organization. I am  disappointed an amendment that helps enrich the Taliban is being  considered for inclusion in a so-called international competitiveness  package.   I encourage my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, why this particular amendment  is being put into an America COMPETES Act is beyond me. It is  emboldening and empowering our adversaries across the world and,  certainly, with this particular move, you are allowing for terrorist  organizations to access $9.5 billion.   While I recognize the humanitarian crisis, this administration is  responsible for that, candidly.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Madam Speaker, I rise as the designee of the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim), and I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Speaker, I strongly support this  amendment, and I thank my fellow Science, Space, and Technology  Committee member, Representative Young Kim, for first authoring this  policy.   According to a recent Gallup Poll, 79 percent of Americans expect  inflation  [[Page H934]]  to continue to rise over the next 6 months. Inflation isn't an abstract  concept. Americans across the country are feeling the pinch every day  at the grocery store, the gas pump, and everywhere else as they buy  goods to support their families.   The Consumer Price Index reported earlier this year that inflation  soared to a record level of 7 percent in 2021, and it only continues to  grow with Democrats' wasteful spending sprees.   The underlying bill we are considering today just continues that  dangerous pattern of reckless spending. Instead of focusing on the  targeted bipartisan investments in basic research that would help  America excel in competition against China, the underlying bill is  filled with partisan slush fund spending.   We need to address the inflation crisis, and it should be top of mind  whenever we consider massive spending bills.   This is why I strongly support this amendment, which directs the  National Science Foundation to commission a study on the impacts of  inflation on the American people, our international competitiveness,  our underserved and rural communities, and our future generations.   As the U.S. economy rebounds from COVID-19, with the national debt at  more than $30 trillion, and inflationary risks rising daily, this  straightforward amendment is sensible, necessary, and timely.   I want to thank my colleague for her work on this important  amendment. I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, in closing, I want to reiterate  my thanks to Representative Kim for her work on the amendment. I urge a  ``yes'' vote to my colleagues, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  [[Page H945]]  the city of Shawnee for being named the ``Number 1 City for Women-Owned  Businesses in Oklahoma.'' The data collected by Oklahoma Baptist  University is reflective of the impressive and hardworking women in  Oklahoma's Fifth District.   The percentage of women-owned businesses in Shawnee is almost twice  the statewide average for cities in Oklahoma and 29.5 percent higher  than the national average. In total, 49.4 percent of all Shawnee  Forward businesses are owned and operated by women.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to represent such dynamic women who are an  integral part of Oklahoma's economy through creating jobs and enriching  communities. Their contributions to the financial stability, growth,  and innovation in the State of Oklahoma is invaluable.   I am grateful for the city of Shawnee and Shawnee Forward for their  successful efforts in fostering a positive environment for women  entrepreneurs to start and grow their businesses. This hub of leaders  has ignited Oklahoma's entrepreneurial spirit and will no doubt inspire  young women and girls across our great State for generations to come.                            ____________________
