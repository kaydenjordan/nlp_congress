 Mr. Speaker, since President Biden took office, there have  been 5.2 million illegal crossings of our southern border.   Now, because of President Biden and his administration's failures to  secure our southern border, our schools and children are suffering from  the effects of rampant open borders.   When taxpayer-funded facilities in New York were used to house  illegal immigrants, President Biden was silent. Even when the mayor of  New York City said: ``The President and the White House have failed  this city,'' President Biden was silent.   Well, House Republicans won't remain quiet.  [[Page H3114]]    We denounced this wasteful abuse of our schools by passing H. Res.  461, which condemned the use of public schools and facilities to house  illegal immigrants. We sent a clear and direct message to the American  people and the President that this should never be allowed.                            ____________________
