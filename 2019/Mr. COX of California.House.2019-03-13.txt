 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Equality Act.   Too often in our policy debates, it is our rural communities that are  forgotten and left behind. And for LGBTQ people living in rural  America, this is no different.   If you want to live and work and raise your family in rural America,  you should be able to have that choice, but it is unfortunately the  case today that rural LGBTQ families are denied opportunities in  housing, employment, and healthcare access.   While in California we have comprehensive laws to protect LGBTQ  people and protect them against discrimination, this is not the case  everywhere.   That is why we need bills like the Equality Act.   This bill would take important steps to protect every LGBTQ family  from discrimination in housing, employment, and financing.   It will help ensure that every family that chooses to live in rural  America can fully participate in our society free from fear of  discrimination simply because of who they are or who they love.                            ____________________
