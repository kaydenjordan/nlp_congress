 Madam President, let me read to you a section of the  proposal on infrastructure that has been put out by the White House,  just one section of many sections that are there. This particular  section on national critical infrastructure reads this way:         Funds for schools to reduce or eliminate the use of paper       plates and disposable materials.    I don't know what your definition of ``infrastructure'' is, but I  don't meet a lot of Oklahomans who, when I say ``infrastructure,'' they  think school lunch trays.   We need to work on infrastructure, and I would tell you, I don't meet  a Republican who is not engaged in this issue of infrastructure. And it  is not the first time for any of us to work on infrastructure; we have  had multiple bills. I remind people around my State that every time you  are driving around my State and you see an orange construction zone and  a flashing sign, that is a previous infrastructure bill that was done.  In every direction that you go in my State, you are going to see  infrastructure that is already happening and working because working on  infrastructure is a common part of what we do.   Republicans have stepped to the table and have said: Let's work on  infrastructure together. In fact, it was interesting--President Trump  over and over again talked about working on infrastructure and tried to  be able to get a major infrastructure proposal.   Our definition of ``infrastructure,'' though, doesn't include school  lunch trays. We would like to work on highways. This particular package  that the White House has sent us, we have just raised our hands and  said: We have a few questions before you want to be able to move this  forward.   This particular proposal spends $174 billion for electric vehicles  but only $115 billion for the highways that they will drive on. We just  believe we need to spend more on highways. We don't mind incentivizing  electric vehicles, but, quite frankly, there have been a lot of  incentives out there already.   Every Tesla that you pull up next to, when you turn over and see them  at a stoplight, you should ask for your turn to drive because every one  of those beautiful Tesla vehicles, the Federal taxpayers also kicked in  $7,800 in Federal tax subsidies for that beautiful $60,000 automobile  that someone else is driving.   There have been tax incentives that have been out there for electric  vehicles; we just believe we need to spend more on actually dealing  with our roads and bridges because they have major problems.   So what can we do? For those of us in Oklahoma, we know full well. I- 35, Interstate 44, Interstate 40 all cross in my beautiful State. We  are the center of the country in trucking. We are the center of the  country in railways. We have the farthest, northernmost inland port  that is actually in Oklahoma, where a lot of wheat and fertilizer move  through our State, coming from the north to get into the ports to be  able to get out.   We understand the significance of what it means to be able to work on  our ports, our waterways, our highways, our bridges; to deal with clean  water, to deal with sewage water; to be able to deal with even  broadband. All those things are essential for every farm to be able to  operate and for every section of our economy to be able to function.   Let's work on this together. Let's find a way that we can actually  hit common ground and agree that working on airports and working on  highways and working on bridges is vital to us, and then let's talk  about the rest of the other things on this because we have a lot of  debt as a country, and adding another $2.5 trillion and having a debate  about a corporate tax change that--quite frankly, in 2017, when we made  that corporate tax change, 70 percent of the difference in those  companies went to employees' wages. Now to go back and to raise that  corporate tax again, we know exactly what that is going to mean for  employees of those companies and future raises that they may or may not  get.   So let's actually talk about this, and let's work on infrastructure  together, but let's actually work on what is truly infrastructure.   I yield the floor.
