SEC. 3. FUNDING.         The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall provide       for the transfer, from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust       Fund established under section 1817 of the Social Security       Act (42 U.S.C. 1395i) and the Federal Supplementary Medical       Insurance Trust Fund established under section 1841 of such       Act (42 U.S.C. 1395t) (in such proportion as determined       appropriate by the Secretary) to the Centers for Medicare &       Medicaid Services Program Management Account, of $25,000,000       for fiscal year 2022, to remain available until expended, for       purposes of carrying out the amendments made by this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, more than 28 million seniors get healthcare through  Medicare Advantage, including 600,000 in Washington State.   For these seniors and the physicians that care for them, we must  deliver a quality product that allows providers to keep our seniors as  healthy as possible while reducing wait times, paperwork, and hassle.   Unfortunately, the cumbersome and antiquated prior authorization  process that many Medicare Advantage plans utilize often gets in the  way. This involves multiple phone calls and faxing documents to  insurance companies. It is 2022, and even Congress has moved beyond  faxing.   The HHS Inspector General recently reported that prior authorization  is responsible for delaying and even denying medically necessary care.  That mirrors reports that we have heard from providers for years now.   In one case, the inspector general found that, due to prior  authorization, a 76-year-old Medicare beneficiary with post-polio  syndrome was denied a request for a walker.   In another case, a Washington State resident and professional  fisherman had to miss this past summer's fishing season in Alaska  because his hip surgery was delayed for months.   According to the American Medical Association, one out of every four  physicians report that prior authorization has led to a patient being  hospitalized. Prior authorization is also a burden on providers, who  spend 13 hours a week completing prior authorization paperwork, often  for procedures that are approved over 95 percent of the time. That is  time they could be spending with patients.   Today, the House of Representatives will take a major step forward in  resolving this problem. The Improving Seniors' Timely Access to Care  Act will make commonsense changes to prior authorization to ensure our  seniors are getting the care they need when they need it.   First, the bill would require all plans to use an electronic prior  authorization system. That means no more phone calls, no more faxes,  and no more wondering what information is needed to submit to insurance  plans when requesting prior authorization.   Second, we establish a process for real-time decisionmaking. It  doesn't make sense that services in line with standard clinical  practice guidelines or services that are approved more than 95 percent  of the time are subject to prior authorization.   We also know that delayed approvals can result in patients falling  through the cracks and missing out on care. Real-time decisions will  help stop that.   Finally, this bill requires reporting on the number of prior  authorization requests, the rates of approvals and denials, and the  rates of successful appeals to increase transparency.   Collectively, this bill will help providers spend more time with  patients and less time with paperwork.   Today's vote and the teamwork that brought this legislation to this  moment is a bipartisan success story that shows that Congress can come  together and put the needs of the American people before the gridlock  that we all know too well.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative   Mike Kelly, our Republican  lead, for his tireless work on this for years, also our co-leads, Dr.  Ami Bera and Larry Bucshon, as well as Senator Roger Marshall, who  worked with us when he was in the House in the 116th Congress and has  continued this effort in the Senate.   I thank the over 300 of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who  have cosponsored this bill. The support for this legislation has been  overwhelming and it has been endorsed by over 500 healthcare  organizations.   I particularly thank the Regulatory Relief Coalition and the American  Medical Association that helped develop a quality bill and build  support for it.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a list of endorsements and the  letters  [[Page H7799]]  of support from the Regulatory Relief Coalition and the American  Medical Association.

Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: Members of the       Regulatory Relief Coalition (RRC)--a group of national       physician specialty organizations advocating for reduced       regulatory burdens that interfere with patient care--thank       you for scheduling a House floor vote on the Improving       Seniors' Timely Access to Care Act on September 14, 2022.        This bipartisan bill is supported by more than 310 House       co-sponsors and over 500 endorsing organizations representing       patients, health care providers, medical technology and       biopharmaceutical industry, health plans and others. The       RRC's goal is to ensure that bureaucratic hurdles do not       stand in the way of physicians providing medically necessary       patient care.        The Improving Seniors' Timely Access to Care Act would       improve prior authorization in the Medicare Advantage (MA)       program by:        Establishing an electronic prior authorization (ePA)       program;        Standardizing and streamlining the prior authorization       process for routinely approved services, including       establishing a list of services eligible for real-time prior       authorization decisions;        Ensuring prior authorization requests are reviewed by       qualified medical personnel; and  [[Page H7801]]         Increasing transparency on MA prior authorization       requirements and their use.        The RRC, which served as a lead stakeholder and key       negotiator of the legislation, especially appreciates the       tireless work of Reps. Suzan DelBene (D-WA), Mike Kelly (R-      PA), Ami Bera, MD (D-CA) and Larry Bucshon, MD (R-IN) for       their efforts leading up to this vote.        We urge the House to vote in favor of this critical       legislation.        If you have any questions, please contact Peggy Tighe.        Thank you.

Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Ranking Member McCarthy: On behalf       of the physician and medical student members of the American       Medical Association (AMA), I write in strong support of H.R.       3173, the ``Improving Seniors' Timely Access to Care Act of       2022.'' This legislation, as originally introduced, garnered       more than 300 bipartisan House cosponsors and the support of       approximately 500 physician, hospital, patient, and insurer       organizations. We greatly appreciate the House of       Representatives scheduling a vote on this bipartisan       legislation, which was favorably reported out of the Ways and       Means Committee in July, and strongly urge swift passage to       help streamline, simplify, and standardize prior       authorization processes within Medicare Advantage (MA) plans.        Prior authorization, which is the practice by insurance       companies of reviewing and potentially denying medical       services and pharmaceuticals prior to treatment, remains a       principal frustration for patients and physicians. This       utilization management policy is overused, costly, opaque,       burdensome to physicians, and harmful to patients due to       delays in care.        AMA data compiled from annual surveys of more than l,000       practicing physicians continue to illustrate the negative       impact of prior authorization policies. In fact, 34 percent       of physicians who participated in a 2021 AMA survey reported       that prior authorization led to a serious adverse event, such       as hospitalization, disability, permanent bodily damage, or       even death, for a patient in their care. The 2021 survey also       highlights that 93 percent of physicians reported care delays       associated with prior authorization, while 82 percent of       respondents cited that these requirements can at least       sometimes lead to patients abandoning treatments.        In addition, research from the federal government       demonstrates that prior authorization leads to delays in       patient care and inappropriate denials of medically necessary       services. A 2018 report from the Department of Health and       Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG)       concluded that, between 2014 and 2016, MA plans overturned 75       percent oftheir own prior authorization and payment denials       when appealed by providers and beneficiaries. An April 2022       HHS OIG report also found that 13 percent of prior       authorization requests denied by MA plans met Medicare       coverage rules, and 18 percent of payment request denials met       Medicare and MA billing rules.        We commend the House of Representatives for working in a       bipartisan fashion to develop an amended version of the       Improving Seniors' Timely Access to Care Act. The modified       legislation retains the crux of the original bill, the       ``Improving Seniors' Timely Access to Care Act of 2021,''       including mandating that MA plans implement electronic prior       authorization programs that adhere to new standards adopted       by the federal government. This will help ensure that       physicians are no longer forced to resort to faxes and e-      forms, or even disparate, proprietary portals that fail to       comply with these newly developed standards, when seeking to       complete prior authorization requests. In addition, the       provisions requiring robust data reporting, such as the       number and percentage of prior authorization requests       approved, denied, or approved upon appeal, will bring much       needed transparency to ensure MA prior authorization programs       are not inappropriately denying medically necessary care to       patients and overburdening physicians with unnecessary       requirements.        Most importantly, the additional sections of the       legislation mandating MA plans to issue faster prior       authorization decisions are crucial policy improvements that       will ensure more timely access to care and, as a result,       improve patient health care outcomes and better stewardship       of scarce Medicare resources. The AMA supports the       requirements for health plans to provide real-time prior       authorization decisions for routinely approved services, as       defined in implementing regulations. We also appreciate that       the bill directs MA plans unable to meet the real-time       processing requirement in the event of ``extenuating       circumstances'' to issue final prior authorization decisions       within a 72-hour and 24-hour timeline for regular and       emergent services, respectively. Notably, the legislation       requires MA plans to report the number of prior       authorizations subject to this exception, providing the       transparency needed to deter abuse of this provision.        In addition, we sincerely appreciate the inclusion of       provisions pertaining to more timely prior authorization       decisions for all other services within Medicare Part C.       Requiring MA plans to issue final decisions within 24 hours       for emergent services and no later than seven days after       receipt of regular prior authorization requests is a vast       improvement over current MA program practices. The expedited       timelines for MA plans to issue final prior authorization       decisions, both for routinely approved care and all other       services, will undoubtedly lessen the burden on physicians,       and, most significantly, ensure timely patient care and       improved health outcomes.        The AMA is proud to support the Improving Seniors' Timely       Access to Care Act. We commend the House of Representatives       for voting on this legislation and stand ready to work to       ensure bipartisan passage by the Senate.            Sincerely,                                               James L. Madara, MD.     Mr. Speaker, I also thank the staff from the personal  offices and from the committee and leadership offices that have spent  countless hours researching this issue and working with stakeholders to  develop this legislation.   In particular, I thank my former legislative director, Kyle Hill, who  was truly integral in developing and advancing this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Chu), my colleague on the Ways and Means Committee,  another leader of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, it is so important that we work with  experts in the medical community to develop strong legislation, and we  are incredibly fortunate to have as one of our co-leads on this bill  one of our doctors in Congress, so I want to thank him for all of his  incredible work getting us to where we are today.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Bera).    Mr. Speaker, I think it is past time for us to help our  seniors get timely care. It is past time to help our medical  professionals, our doctors, our nurses, and others who are burdened  with undue paperwork, to help them spend more time providing care. It  is past time for us to move a strong piece of legislation that has  strong bipartisan support.   I thank Chairman Neal and everyone who has helped bring this  legislation forward, folks on the Ways and Means Committee, including  my colleague Mr. Kelly.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation,  an incredible piece of work.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                      Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                 Washington, DC, September 14, 2022.        Mr. Blumenauer: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this       important legislation to protect seniors' access to care in       the Medicare Advantage program.        As many of you know, I have been a longtime champion of       Medicare Advantage, and it's enjoyed tremendous popularity in       Oregon. I believe that the way traditional fee-for-service       Medicare operates is not sustainable and that Medicare       Advantage is one of the tools we can use to demonstrate how       we can incentivize value.        But this is only possible when the program operates as       intended. I have been deeply concerned about the reports of       delays in care, not only from the Inspector General, but from       the constituents that come into my office. For patients and       their families, being told that you need to wait longer for       care that your doctor tells you that you need is incredibly       frustrating and frightening. There's no comfort to be found       in the fact that your insurance company needs time to decide       if your doctor is right. For providers, the burden of prior       authorization is immense. And at a time where we consistently       hear that our health care workers are facing incredible       burnout and are leaving the profession in alarming rates,       it's critical that we remove unnecessary processes.        There is no reason that patients should be waiting for       medically appropriate care especially when we know that this       can lead to worse outcomes. The fundamental promise of       Medicare Advantage is undermined when people are delaying       care, getting sicker, and ultimately costing Medicare more       money.        The legislation we are taking up today is commonsense       policy that moves us towards the goals of the program and       protects our patients and providers from unnecessary       roadblocks to care. I want to commend Congresswoman DelBene       for her leadership on this issue and I look forward to       supporting this bipartisan legislation.
