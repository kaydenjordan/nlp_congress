 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul, and I certainly thank  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mast) for offering this important bill,  H.R. 340, the Hamas International Financing Prevention Act.   In addition to my work on the Foreign Affairs Committee, I serve on  the  [[Page H5193]]  House Financial Services Committee. Over the years that I have been in  Congress, I have been on the Task Force to Investigate Terrorism  Financing and the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Illicit Finance. Today,  once again, we come to this House floor to tackle a new form of illicit  finance.   It was shocking to a lot of people in America to read in The Wall  Street Journal that Hamas is now using digital assets in order to raise  funds and move money around. Just as we tackle illicit charitable use,  illicit cash use, illicit bank use, this committee is dedicated to  tackling this new form of escaping our anti-money laundering Bank  Secrecy Act laws in order to fund terror.                                time  1445    I expect all of my colleagues to be together, working together to  pass this bill and, in fact, standing up against this new form of  terror finance by using digital assets.   We look forward to working on that issue in both the Financial  Services Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee, and I  congratulate the gentleman from Florida for his leadership.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New York for managing  the time and my friend from Illinois on this very important bill.   I am so glad to see that it is a bipartisan effort on H.R. 3774, the  SHIP Act, because this bill is critical to countering the long record  of continued mistakes by President Biden of appeasing the regime in  Iran.   The Biden administration continues a foreign policy offering carrots  to the world's number one state sponsor of terrorism and getting  nothing to show for it in return. Due to this administration's  appeasement through sanctions relief, Iran's oil production is now  backed up at a 5-year high and is estimated to be producing 1.5 million  barrels a day, and that is worth, Mr. Speaker, $40 billion annualized.   Now, nearly all of that is being sold to China, completely as a  counter to the rest of the world's effort to cut off money going to  Russia directly through Russian oil and indirectly through Iran backing  Russia--these are leaked; Iran backing Hezbollah in Lebanon; Iran  backing Syria and Assad; Iran backing Hamas in the Gaza.   Are you getting the picture?   Iran is the problem here, Mr. Speaker--a partner to Russia fighting  Ukraine, a partner in defeating Israel through Gaza. It is because they  are selling oil on the market against global sanctions.   This bill is important. It goes far beyond the administration's $6  billion of sanction relief to return Americans.   Secondary sanctions are essential, and America's diplomacy, as Mr.  Schneider from Illinois said, to get Europe on board with secondary  sanctions is important too, because it is about defeating this global  network of evil: Russia, Iran, and China.   I encourage all of my colleagues to support this important bill.
