 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the topic of our Special Order.    Madam Speaker, our servicemen and-women have sacrificed  so much in their courageous fight for our exceptional Nation and our  freedoms. Unfortunately, when our veterans return home from the  battlefield, too often they find that their fight has just begun.   My home county in New York, Suffolk, boasts one of the highest  concentrations of veterans in the country, and we pride ourselves on  our rich history and commitment to serving our Nation's veterans.   The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that approximately 20  veterans per day take their own life, oftentimes plagued with post- traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury.   One of those suffering was PFC Joseph Dwyer, an Iraq war veteran from  Mount Sinai, New York. As an Army combat medic, PFC Dwyer was the face  of the Iraq war. In 2003, this photo next to me was taken of Joe  carrying an injured Iraqi child to safety, and it went viral worldwide.   Unfortunately, when he came back home to Long Island he returned with  the mental wounds of war, and after years of struggling, he lost his  battle with PTSD in 2008. It is important to note that Joe didn't  commit suicide. He was seeking temporary relief from his pain, and his  last words were: I don't want to die.   Understanding that PFC Dwyer was just one of the local veterans  struggling, I created the PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Veteran Peer Support  Program as a New York State senator in 2012. The Dwyer program is  modeled as a peer-to-peer support program for veterans struggling with  PTSD and TBI.   This model provides a safe, confidential, and educational platform  where all veterans are welcome to meet with other veterans in support  of each other's successful transition to post-service life and seeks to  build vet-to-vet relationships that enhance positive change.   The Dwyer program also incorporates a variety of therapeutic  activities, such as horse training and fishing that provide for common  experiences, learning, and personal growth.   Suffolk County served as one of four test counties in New York, and  since then, with the dedication and hard work of so many exceptional  men and women, the program has successfully expanded to more than 25  counties across New York, saving lives and assisting tens of thousands  of New York veterans battling PTSD and TBI.   The program has been so successful that the New York State budget for  fiscal year 2022 included a 22 percent increase in funding for the  Dwyer program. The way the program is organized, by providing grants to  localities, it has allowed each county to customize its individual  program to fit individual needs and resources they have available while  running an efficient and effective program.   Each county only receives between $100,000 and $300,000 from the  State, and what they manage to do with that money is incredible.   Its continued track record of success is why I introduced bipartisan  legislation, H.R. 1476, the PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Peer Support Program  Act, to expand the Dwyer program nationally by authorizing the VA  Secretary to make grants available to State and local entities, to  carry out peer-to-peer mental health programs all across our Nation and  help ensure that all of our Nation's veterans have access to the  support they need.   This important legislation has earned the support of 14 veteran  advocacy organizations, including: The American Legion, Military  Veterans Advocacy, Blinded Veterans Association, Military Order of the  Purple  [[Page H5913]]  Heart, American Ex-Prisoners of War, Paralyzed Veterans of America,  Catholic War Veterans, New York City Veterans Alliance, Jewish War  Veterans, the Fleet Reserve Association, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans  of America, Wounded Warrior Project, AMVETS, and the American  Foundation for Suicide Prevention.   It has also been cosponsored by 36 of my colleagues, both Republicans  and Democrats, some of whom we will hear from this evening about the  importance of this legislation and improving the resources and care we  provide to our Nation's heroes as they make the difficult transition to  civilian life.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Costa),  who is a leader in this effort fighting for our veterans and is a  cosponsor of H.R. 1476.                                time  1615     Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Costa so much for his  leadership and advocacy. It is so important that from coast to coast  every veteran in the United States of America knows that there are  people in their community who would drop everything at a moment's  notice in the middle of the night to provide that love and support to  get them through their difficult times. Every veteran should have  access to a program like this, and I appreciate the gentleman's  leadership.    Madam Speaker, Congressman  Mike Garcia is another  cosponsor of H.R. 1476. He was a Navy fighter pilot. We are not going  to hold that against him. We are still just getting close here to an  Army-Navy game.   But what we find is that different generations serving in different  branches and different conflicts, whether it is in peacetime or  wartime, we have so many veterans who have stepped up. Congressman   Mike Garcia sure has done his part. It is an honor to serve with him  now here in the House.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Garcia),  who is a cosponsor of H.R. 1476.    Madam Speaker, the gentleman just said something that  [[Page H5914]]  really struck with me as he reflects on people he served with who lost  their lives due to PTSD.   I have actually known more people in the military who have lost their  lives due to PTSD than have lost their lives in combat. When we were  deciding whether or not to create a program like this and we created a  veterans' advisory panel to design the proposal, one of the members was  someone named John Jennings. Right before we had our first meeting,  John lost his battle due to PTSD, and we named it the John P. Jennings  Veterans' Advisory Panel. But these stories for many post-9/11  veterans--and it was called something else in decades and generations  past, it seems like each time there has been a conflict it has had a  different name--so many veterans have been impacted actually losing  more friends due to PTSD than in combat.   My colleague from New York, Chris Jacobs, who is a cosponsor of H.R.  1476, comes from a part of the State that I actually had just visited.  They have successful Dwyer models now in his region, too. Veterans of  all generations and proud veteran supporters all throughout Chris  Jacobs' district are looking to find ways to tell the story of how the  Dwyer program is working for them and in other areas looking for ways  to expand it to go further. Every minute since he has been here, Chris  Jacobs has been an outstanding leader for our veterans and our veteran  community. Of course, he is cosponsoring this legislation because he  doesn't waste any opportunity to do everything in his power to help  fight for vets.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jacobs).    Madam Speaker, Congressman Jacobs, as he mentioned, was a  member of the New York State Senate, and every single year it was a  budget battle to get this money in that final budget. Thanks to Chris'  efforts working on both sides of the aisle in both the New York State  Senate and New York State Assembly, it didn't just continue to get  funded but it expanded, and it is now in his region very successfully.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for being here and for his  cosponsorship.   Congressman Madison Cawthorn with North Carolina's 11th District is a  member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. He is a cosponsor of  H.R. 1476. He is all in on that committee to fight for our veterans to  make sure that the Department of Veterans Affairs is being run as  effectively and efficiently as possible and there are a whole lot of  Americans all across this country who know that as Madison Cawthorn has  their back as a member of this committee. We are all proud of him and  glad he is here in the House with us. We are honored to have him as a  cosponsor.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Cawthorn).    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Cawthorn, and I am not  surprised that he is a cosponsor of this bill. He very eloquently  stated the need to think outside the box.   People go for help, and there are some people who just always  thought, Congressman Rutherford, that the answer is just to provide a  medication. They weren't thinking outside the box.   I remember people were showing up sick to PT. They would go to the  infirmary complaining, and they were diagnosing Tylenol and codeine.  You have a headache, Tylenol and codeine. You need knee surgery? Well,  here is Tylenol and codeine. Whatever it was, it was just all over the  base. It was the instinctive response.   I think, for a while, the Department of Veterans Affairs thought that  that was the only answer.   We have a county sheriff who, in many ways, I look to him as the  sheriff here in the House. He is also a cosponsor of H.R. 1476. He is  someone who knows his purpose here in the House, a principled man, a  fighter. His constituents are very lucky to have him in Florida's  Fourth Congressional District. And he gets it.  [[Page H5915]]    That is why he has been all in fighting for veterans every day that  he has been here.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Rutherford).    Madam Speaker, here, in the Halls of Congress, you hear  millions, billions, trillions get thrown around, big dollar numbers.  What has been so amazing is that a county gets $180,000, saving  countless lives, seeing families staying together, people being able to  stay in their jobs, and communities are stronger.   It is so efficient, and that, I think, is one of the keys of success  because there are people in our communities who want to volunteer their  specialties. There is a social worker, psychologist, psychiatrist.  There is someone who wants to provide food to that barbecue, a venue  for a meeting. They want to give back.   There are a lot of people I come across all the time who say that  their only regret in life is that they never served. They wanted to  serve and didn't do it, and that is their biggest regret in life. They  are finding ways to serve.   The gentleman is stepping up in a huge way, and it is something that  I would be excited to see in his congressional district in Florida.    Madam Speaker, I have seen that, too. There is a spouse  out there who is seeing their loved one struggling with post-traumatic  stress, and they don't know what to do to help. They are reaching out  to the local veterans service office. They are reaching out to their  local Dwyer program because they want to help their loved one. They  want to keep their marriage together. They don't want everything to  fall apart.   The specialty, the expertise here, is not just about providing that  support and help to the servicemember. When one person serves in the  military, just like you were a sheriff, when one person serves in law  enforcement, the whole family serves. You come home with the mental  wounds of war, and really, in a way, the whole family is experiencing  the mental wounds of war.    Madam Speaker, I remember when I first got here to the  House, and there was somebody with a national veterans service office  who was advocating for peer-to-peer support. I asked this national  commander what he had in mind, what he envisioned, what his model was  for how to provide peer-to-peer support.   I wasn't trying to ask it as some type of a trick question, a gotcha  question, but I realized, in his answer, he didn't really know. He knew  that he was supposed to advocate for peer-to-peer support, but he  didn't know exactly what that model was going to look like.   Then, over the course of these last few years, more of these national  veterans service organizations have been looking at what is going on in  New York. Now they come to the Halls of Congress and are testifying in  front of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. They talk about peer support,  and they specifically are citing the Dwyer program as that model.   I saw, at a place called the Warrior Ranch in Suffolk County, a  veteran who is struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder be placed  in this area with a wild horse that was just rescued. He had never  interacted with horses before. Within minutes--he had some training as  to how to understand what the horse is thinking, how to take charge,  realizing that the horse is going to be testing you out a little bit as  to who is in charge. He took charge of that situation, and he  immediately developed this bond with this horse.   I was speaking to someone who barely survived his own struggle with  post-traumatic stress. He is upstate New York. Through a similar  program, he developed a bond with a horse, and it was so strong that  the owner of this ranch would allow him to come in the middle of the  night if he was having a bad night and spend some time with this horse.  That was how he got through his tough time.   I mean, he is healthy. He is doing great. He is a leader in his  community, with the veterans community specifically. And he credits  that interaction he had with a horse.   Others, it is fly-fishing. Others, it is having access to a companion  animal.   The answer is not just to medicate a person with mental health  issues. You need to find other alternative ways to try to assist these  men and women in need.   It is not just veterans, although here we are specifically talking  about veterans with the mental wounds of war. A lot of the examples  that could be provided of success with the Dwyer program can be  replicated for others who are nonveterans who have mental health  challenges in this country.   The Dwyer program has made a lifesaving impact in our State. I have  received a few testimonials.   Danielle is an Army veteran enrolled in the Suffolk County Dwyer  program. She stated:         I started the Dwyer program back in April 2020 because the       internship program I was in was no longer an option during       COVID-19. I was a single mother who was furloughed and       attempting graduate school through virtual means, which was       extremely taxing on my mental health.        The support group grew into a sisterhood of not only       emotional and spiritual support but guidance and education on       the resources available to us and that female veterans  [[Page H5916]]       must continue to fight for their needs as a special       population.        I owe everything to this magnetic group for being the       positive guidance I needed to continue my service, complete       my educational goals, and become employed at an agency that       truly cares about veterans' special needs.    In Suffolk, that program is led by Thomas Ronayne and Marcelle Leis  and a number of others. They are all in. They have dedicated their  lives toward making it a huge success. They certainly impacted  Danielle's life.   They also impacted Robert's life. He is a Navy veteran and a Suffolk  County Dwyer program participant who said:         I was struggling with both substance abuse and use and       thoughts of self-harm, as well as a suicide attempt.        This program, and those involved, helped me battle all       this, and I now have over 5 years sober, a family, two       degrees, and a new career.    Roger is a Marine Corps veteran, a Purple Heart recipient, and a  Suffolk County Dwyer program participant. He said:         You have to be mentally ready to say to yourself, I need       something. I need to reach out to somebody somewhere, because       even though it takes a tremendous amount of courage and       dedication to join the military, it takes just as much       courage and dedication to be able to express that you have an       issue with your life because of your experiences through the       military. I am really happy for the Dwyer program because it       gives us the outlet we need, because veterans only relate to       other veterans.    Judy is from Suffolk County. She said:         I am a psychiatric RN with 33 years clinical experience.       During that time, I have treated veterans with PTSD and       traumatic brain injury. As these issues are long term, the       problem has always been providing support after       hospitalization. There have been no resources in the       community until Dwyer came along.        Now there is a strong helping hand to support these heroes.       But it needs to be expanded to accomplish more. Without it,       veterans face repeated hospitalizations, resulting in       premature and unnecessary deaths.    Arthur is a Vietnam veteran from Suffolk County. He said:         As a combat vet of the Vietnam war, I can relate to the       need for the Dwyer program. When I returned home from       Vietnam, there were no support services that I was aware of.       I went from my duty station in Vietnam to CONUS in 3 days, no       adjustment.        I am not alone, as there are many Vietnam vets that are       suffering even today. I believe that not adjusting to       civilian life sets back an individual's progress and       assimilation back into society.                                time  1645    I will give you one last testimonial, and I would like to be able to  introduce my friend, Buddy Carter from Georgia.   Anthony is a Suffolk County Dwyer program participant. He said: I  have personally seen how veterans, myself being a disabled veteran  included, show up to a meeting, and they are provided with food,  drinks, and a safe and secure environment to share veteran-related  issues with other veterans and receive positive, supportive feedback  that significantly improves their quality of life. I am happy to  support this program and be involved in any way possible.   Congressman Buddy Carter and I were elected in 2014. He is a friend.  He is a great public servant. He has a number of specialties that bring  diversity here to our Chamber. A number of times, based off of his  civilian experiences in life, he has made letters, requests, and  legislation all better and stronger when he has weighed in.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter),  who is my friend and a cosponsor of H.R. 1476.    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Buddy Carter of  Georgia for being here and for cosponsoring this bipartisan bill. There  are a lot of people on both sides of the aisle who have signed on,  on this effort.    Congressman Carter has the expertise to understand what has been a  [[Page H5917]]  longtime, conventional treatment, where doctors would just be  prescribing a medication. The value of thinking outside the box has  just saved so many lives. To be able to bring this program to Georgia,  to Florida, to California, all across our entire Nation, would be  enormous.   I want to thank all my colleagues who joined me here today in sharing  stories of veterans they represent or served with during their time in  the military, and some of their own experiences. I look forward to  continuing to work with each of them to expand and improve access to  lifesaving mental health resources for our veterans suffering from PTSD  and TBI.   We are less than 2 months removed from the 20th anniversary of the 9/ 11 terror attacks and less than 3 months since the withdrawal of  Afghanistan. The tragic events that unfolded in Afghanistan were hard  for Americans to watch, including many Afghanistan vets who are  speaking out.   What was interesting to note, and not surprising for many, as we are  having our individual conversations, especially with the Afghan vets,  the calls rose to the Veterans Crisis Line, online chats with the  crisis line staff were up almost 40 percent, and texts to the crisis  line rose by 98 percent.   For me, my life could be separated into two parts. I am 41 years old.  Half of my life was before September 11, 2001; half of my life was  after September 11, 2001. But what is so amazing about those who are  currently serving, so many of them, and those who are contacting our  offices looking for congressional nominations to go to a service  academy, all they know is life post-September 11, 2001. They either  weren't born yet or they are just too young to remember.   Everyone who is here in this Chamber now, every one of us probably  vividly remembers exactly where we were on September 11, 2001. For  these people who are signing up right now, to think that their whole  life is everything we have seen post-9/11 and they still raise their  hand and answer the call. We have a duty to look out for them, in some  way to try to give back, because they are willing to give it all up in  defense of us.   I want to thank all 14 of the veteran service organizations who have  stepped up, the national commanders who come here to the Halls of  Congress to talk about the PFC Joseph P. Dwyer program.   If you go back and look at the American Legion National Commander's  testimony earlier this year in front of the House and Senate VA  committees, he was advocating for the Dwyer program to be expanded  nationally.   It is our duty to give back, to look out for our vets and our veteran  families. PFC Joseph P. Dwyer left behind a young widow, a 2-year-old  daughter, a proud family, and forever they should know that this  country will never forget Joseph Dwyer's service and sacrifice. We are  trying to turn it into as much of a positive as possible.   For anyone who is out there, any veteran in need, there is the  Veterans Crisis Line to call and there are online chats. There are ways  to reach out in your local community and nationally. Please reach out  to your local Department of VA, at the very least, if you don't know of  any other opportunities or resources available in your community.   There are people who live around the block from you who will drop  everything in the middle of the night to help you, as I mentioned  earlier. Don't give up. We have your back. We are so grateful for your  service to our country. This is a great world, a great country that is  worth fighting to protect and defend, and a life worth living.   Madam Speaker, I thank all of the cosponsors, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
