The estimated program value is       $110 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a NATO Ally which is an important       force for political stability and economic progress in       Europe.        This potential sale will continue to improve the Royal       Netherlands Air Force's (RNLAF) ability to develop mission-      ready and experienced pilots to support its F-16 aircraft       inventory. The well-established pilot proficiency training       program at Tucson Air National Guard Base will train pilots       in F-16 operations, tactics, techniques, and procedures. This       training will enhance the RNLAF's ability to continue       contributions to Overseas Contingency Operations and to NATO       air policing operations, as well as, to possible future       coalitions operations. The Netherlands will have no       difficulty absorbing this training.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        There is no prime contractor involved in this proposed       sale. The Tucson Air National Guard will provide instruction,       flight operations, and maintenance support and facilities       with defense articles anticipated to come from U.S. stocks,       as needed. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       connection with this potential sale.  [[Page S2382]]         Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government personnel or       contractor representatives to the Netherlands.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                                   ____                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION                  Netherlands--M1156 Precision Guided Kits         The Netherlands has requested to buy three thousand five       hundred (3,500) M1156 Precision Guided Kits. Also included       are six (6) PGK settable trainers; two (2) PGK cut away       models; one hundred (100) M76 PGK fuze wrenches; ten (10)       Extended Length Artillery Projectile Extractors (ELAPEs); PGK       technical data and publications; U.S. Government engineering       and technical support services; and other related elements of       logistics and program support. The estimated total cost is       $70 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by helping       to improve the security of the Netherlands which is an       important force for political stability and economic progress       in Europe. It is important to the U.S. national interests to       assist the Netherlands to develop and maintain a strong and       ready self-defense capability. The Netherlands has been a       consistent coalition partner supporting the United States in       various coalition combat operations to include counter-ISIS,       Stabilization Force in Iraq, and Afghanistan.        The proposed sale of PGK will provide a precision guided       capability to 155mm artillery projectiles and improve       Netherlands's capability to meet current and future enemy       threats. The Netherlands will use the enhanced capability to       strengthen its homeland defenses, deter regional threats, and       provide direct support to coalition and security cooperation       efforts. The Netherlands will have no difficulty absorbing       this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment will not impact the       basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Orbital ATK. There are no       known offset agreements proposed in connection with this       potential sale. The purchaser typically requests offsets. Any       offset agreement will be defined in negotiations between the       purchaser and the contractor.        Implementation of this sale will not require the assignment       of any additional U.S. or contractor representatives to the       Netherlands.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 18-12       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as           amended                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The M1156 Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) is a Global       Positioning System (GPS) Precise Positioning Service (PPS)       guided 155mm artillery projectile fuze. This effort includes       the qualification of PGK on the Assegai M1711 Insensitive       High Explosive (IHE) Base Bleed (BB) projectile with modular       charges DM92 Charge 6 and PGK on the Assegai M1712 IHE Boat       Tail (BT) projectile with modular charges DM92 Charges 5 and       6, both fired from the Netherlands' PzH 2000 self-propelled       howitzer.        2. The M1156 utilizes the Enhanced Portable Electronic Fuze       Setter (EPEFS) to set the PGK and the Portable Electronic       Fire Control System (PEFCS) both purchased previously under a       previous Excalibur FMS case. The PEFCS contain an Improved       Platform Integration Kit (MK) to load GPS coordinates. Both       the PGK and PEFCS contain the Selective Availability Anti-      Spoofing Module (SAASM). The PGK has 90% commonality with the       Army's XM395 Accelerated Precision Mortar Initiative (APMI).       The PGK (the end-item) is unclassified. Transfer of the PGK       may reveal information up to SECRET.        3. The M1156 utilizes the Army's M782 Multi-Option for       Artillery (MOFA) Proximity Height of Burst (HOB) Technology.       The HOB sensor is comprised of components with technologies       deemed as state of the art, requiring specialized production       skills. The sensitive/critical technology is primarily in the       design, development, production and manufacturing of the       components (integrated circuits and assembly), and the       integration methodology required to integrate those       components onto an assembly to process embedded (the       software-algorithm-working parameters). The HOB technology is       classified SECRET.        4. Disclosure of this technology could result in an       adversary developing countermeasures, thus lessening the       effect of the projectile. Disclosure of test data,       countermeasures, vulnerability/susceptibility analyses and       threat definition could all aid reverse engineering and could       be used by an adversary for possible use against U.S. and       Coalition forces. Compromise could jeopardize the U.S. forces       inventory through jammer development by adversaries. The risk       of compromise has been accessed as moderate. Risk is reduced       for fuze/munitions if adequately controlled and protected in       storage and on the battlefield. Risk is mitigated by the       prevention of disclosure of sensitive classified information       (the know-how, software, and associated documentation).        5. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures which       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        6. A determination has been made that the Netherlands can       provide the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        7. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Netherlands.                            ____________________
