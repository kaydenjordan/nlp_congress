 Mr. President, I rise tonight to talk about the Inflation  Reduction Act. I am limited on time. I will try to keep within my 5  minutes.   I wanted to start by just kind of providing a brief summary. This is  legislation that will do a number of things, all of which are helpful  to American families and the American economy.   First of all, it will lower the cost of prescription drugs for  seniors. It will, in fact, lower the cost of energy, the prices people  pay for energy.   On the prescription drug front, we talk about lowering costs and  empowering Medicare, for the first time, to begin to negotiate for  lower prices. It also caps the out-of-pocket costs that Medicare  beneficiaries pay at $2,000. In Pennsylvania, the estimate is that  there are more than 73,000 Pennsylvanians that pay more than $2,000 a  year for prescription drugs. Every one of those 73,000-plus  Pennsylvanians and more will benefit from capping out-of-pocket costs.   It lowers costs for families, but it also reduces the threat of  climate change and reduces the deficit at the same time--all of that  while reducing emissions between now and 2030 by some 40 percent. And  this may be the very last time--the very last time--that we have an  opportunity to take action in a substantial way against the threat of  climate change. The Presiding Officer has worked on this issue for  years. He knows of what I speak better than anyone. This may be the  last chance to take action on climate change.   Thirdly, and not by way of a complete summary, it extends the  Affordable Care Act subsidies--the subsidies that were provided in the  American Rescue Plan, the enhanced subsidies and premium tax credits.  Those subsidies will be extended to 2025.   Again, I will personalize it to Pennsylvania. This directly affects  at least 100,000 people. Sixty thousand people in our State will lose  all of their insurance coverage if we don't pass this bill; another  40,000 will have their subsidies taken away; and several hundred  thousand will have their premiums go up. It affects 100,000 people  directly and several hundred thousand people directly or indirectly.   Then, of course, this bill creates millions and millions of jobs over  the 10 years that the bill has been measured.   After we pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which will reduce  inflation--that is what we are told by some 126 economists. Larry  Summers and others have said the same thing. It will fight inflation in  the ways that have already been spoken about. But after we pass this  bill, this strong bill for the American economy and for American  families, we have more work to do. We have to continue our work to pass  legislation to invest in home- and community-based services for seniors  and people with disabilities. We have to invest in childcare and  institute again what we did in the American Rescue Plan when we put  dollars in the pockets of American families raising children by taking  the Child Tax Credit and enhancing that Child Tax Credit.   We have to invest in prekindergarten education and paid family leave.  We have to invest and protect the Medicaid program and extend it.   We have so much more to do.   I will just spend my remaining minutes talking about one issue, the  issue I started with on that list, the home- and community-based  services issue. This is an issue that people across the country have  come to talk to us about--about a senior or loved one that they want to  have home care and can't get it because they are on the waiting list as  it is approaching a million people or a person with a disability who  wants that same kind of care in the home or in the community.   I met a lot of people and listened to them and listened to their  stories. Two come to mind in particular: Someone who needs that care-- his name is Brandon Kingsmore--and his caregiver Lynn Weidner.   I visited Brandon's home with Lynn there and learned firsthand what  they are up against every single day in that home. Some months later,  Brandon had the chance to meet with the President in my hometown of  Scranton. One thing that he said about Lynn as a caregiver and  caregivers overall--he said the following. He said:         I would not be able to have the life that I have without       Lynn's help.        [Caregivers] give us a substantial life.    That is what one Pennsylvanian said about the care he receives. Every  family should have that opportunity to have care in the home or in the  community, and they can't get that under current law. The only option  for most families is care in a nursing home or other institutional  care. If someone wants that care, that is great. A lot of those nursing  homes do really good work.   But here is the problem. So many Americans should have the right to  have care in their home, and they don't have that opportunity today. We  have to pass legislation to do that. The Better Care Better Jobs bill  does that. Jobs for home care workers--we have to get that pay up. We  can't be a Nation that claims to be the greatest country in the world  and pay home care workers just $12 an hour. That is not going to  provide the care that our families need. This bill is about jobs for  home care workers; care, obviously, for seniors and people with  disabilities; and support for family caregivers. More than 50 million  Americans--more than 50 million Americans--are providing care to a  loved one. They are saving us money by doing that--saving the Nation  money--but they are caring for a family member out of an act of love.  We have to help them a lot more than we do.   The last two more points I will make are: We can decide to go forward  and just say your only option as a senior or a person with disability  is to go to a nursing home or an institutional setting. If we continue  to do that, the cost of that is $90,000 per person; or we can invest in  home- and community-based services and not pay $90,000 per person, but  we can pay just $26,000 per American for that kind of care. So it has a  huge cost benefit as well as the compelling moral argument that we  should provide these opportunities.   This bill we are going to pass tonight or tomorrow morning or  whenever we pass it is a good bill for families--lowering costs,  helping seniors with prescription drugs, and really moving forward on  action against climate change. After it has passed, we are going to  continue to work on these other issues.   I want to end with this. I want to thank members of my staff who have  particularly worked so hard the last 18 months on a range of issues  but, in particular, the ones who work on home- and community-based  services and will continue that fight with us: Stacy Sanders, Michael  Gamel-McCormick, Narda Ipakchi, Josh Kramer, and so many others who  have done good work, just like so many members of staffs of so many  Senators here tonight.   But let's get the Inflation Reduction Act passed tonight, and let's  move forward on these other issues in the months ahead.   I yield the floor.
