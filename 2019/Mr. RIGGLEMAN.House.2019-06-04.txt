 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the sacrifice  made by our brave men in uniform on the shores of France 75 years ago  this week.   As the dawn hours rose on June 6, 1944, the choppy waters of the  English Channel were filled with American and Allied soldiers. Thirty  of those brave men were from the town of Bedford, Virginia, a small  hamlet nestled in the southern part of my district. These boys, who  competed for the honor of being the first to reach Omaha Beach, etched  their hometown into history as one with the highest per capita loss of  life.   By the end of that fateful day, when the sun had set on Omaha Beach,  19 Bedford soldiers were dead. Four more died in the Normandy campaign.  Every one of them was a hero.   Seventy-five years have passed, and yet, their heroism stands the  test of time.                            ____________________
