 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak against H.R. 23. The funding  provided through the Inflation Reduction Act is an important step to  address the lack of resources for the IRS so that they could do their  job.   How many of us have called the IRS and been on the phone waiting for  hours only to be told that you were being transferred to yet another  department and also continue to be waiting?   Over the past year, the IRS has already been cut by 15 percent, and  more cuts means more delays and lack of services for our constituents.  As Representative Neal said, the IRS failed to collect over $500  trillion last year alone because of lack of resources, lack of  [[Page H88]]  compliance, and the targeting of those people who are less fortunate  through the EITC compliance. They have been hurt.   Mr. Speaker, this is about tax compliance. This is also about racial  equity and fairness. Historically, African Americans have been  disproportionately audited by the IRS due to their claims of EITC. I  ask for fairness and equity and ask for my colleagues to vote ``no''  against this bill.
