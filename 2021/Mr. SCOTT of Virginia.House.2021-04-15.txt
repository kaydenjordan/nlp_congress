 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 303,  I call up the bill (H.R. 7) to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of  1938 to provide more effective remedies to victims of discrimination in  the payment of wages on the basis of sex, and for other purposes, and  ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous materials on H.R. 7, the Paycheck  Fairness Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness Act.   When President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act in 1963, our country  codified the basic idea that all workers should earn equal pay for  equal work, regardless of sex. Regrettably, more than five decades  later and after the passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, that  promise remains unfulfilled.   Today, women continue to be paid, on average, 82 cents on the dollar  compared to men. This wage disparity is far worse for women of color,  who make less than White men and White women. It exists across every  sector, regardless of education, experience, occupation, industry or  job title. A recent Census Bureau study found that 38 to 70 percent of  the gender wage gap is unexplained and likely due to discrimination.   Drawn out over a lifetime, the persistent wage gap could cost a woman  anywhere from $400,000 to $2 million. This impacts both workers and  their families, often meaning the difference between financial  stability and perpetual hardship.   The Paycheck Fairness Act offers an opportunity to finally secure  equal pay for equal work. The bill strengthens the Equal Pay Act by  bolstering workers' rights to discuss their wages with coworkers and  making it easier for workers to join class action lawsuits; enhancing  the enforcement tools available to the Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission and the Labor Department; and, more importantly, by  [[Page H1802]]  closing loopholes for employer defenses and requiring employers to  prove pay disparities exist for legitimate, job-related reasons.   The Biden administration has issued a Statement of Administration  Policy in support of this bill. It states: ``Ensuring equal pay is  essential to advancing American values of fairness and equity.''   Then it adds: ``The Paycheck Fairness Act is commonsense legislation  that would strengthen the Equal Pay Act and give workers more tools to  fight sex-based pay discrimination.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of Administration  Policy of H.R. 7.                     Statement of Administration Policy    H.R. 7--Paycheck Fairness Act--Rep. DeLauro, D-CT, and 225 cosponsors         The Administration strongly supports House passage of H.R.       7, the Paycheck Fairness Act. Ensuring equal pay is essential       to advancing American values of fairness and equity. Women       lose thousands of dollars each year, and hundreds of       thousands over a lifetime, because of the gender and racial       wage gap. Women working full-time, year-round in 2019 earned       82 cents for every dollar earned by men working full-time;       year-round, and these disparities are greater for women of       color. Pay inequity also impacts individuals who face       intersecting forms of discrimination based on sexual       orientation and gender identity, including LGBTQ+       individuals.        Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of women have       dropped out of the labor force, partly reflecting the       increased domestic labor demands on women. Caregiving demands       often fall disproportionately on women, which leads to many       women having to reduce their hours, resulting in lower       earnings. As more and more American families rely on women's       income, the pay gap hurts not only women, but also the       families who depend on them. The cumulative impact of wage       gaps adds up to financial insecurity over the course of a       career for women and their families and for generations who       follow.        The Paycheck Fairness Act is commonsense legislation that       would strengthen the Equal Pay Act and give workers more       tools to fight sex-based pay discrimination. It would also       take major steps toward increasing pay transparency, an       essential provision to advance equality in the workplace, by       explicitly protecting workers from retaliation for simply       discussing their compensation with their colleagues. The bill       would also expand opportunities for workers to receive       training on effective negotiation skills. The bill would also       limit an employer's ability to rely on salary history during       the hiring process to set pay, or when determining wages for       a promotion. H.R. 7 would hold employers accountable by       closing judicially created loopholes for employer defenses       and by adding a class action option under the Federal Rules       of Civil Procedure. The bill would require the collection of       pay data to enable better enforcement of laws prohibiting pay       discrimination.        The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with       the Congress to address pay equity and urges quick action on       this landmark bill.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me  in voting for this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), who is the Assistant  Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the sponsor of the bill, a  champion for equal pay, and the chair of the House Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams), chair of the Subcommittee  on Workforce Protections.    Mr. Speaker, this bill will prohibit paying  all the men a bonus and none of the women a bonus, although they have  produced equally for the business.   I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath), a  distinguished member of the Committee on Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Espaillat), a distinguished member of the Committee  on Education and Labor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Speier), the co-chair of the  Democratic Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), the previous  head of the EEOC.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Green).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, could you advise us how much time  is available on each side?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), the chair of the Subcommittee  on Civil Rights and Human Services.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of  the United States House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader  of the United States House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time  remaining on both sides, please?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence), a co-chair of the Democratic  Women's Caucus.                                time  1345     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Ross).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Ms. Bush).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, this is a critical time to secure equal pay for equal  work. Over the past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has driven over 2  million women out of the workforce. As women return to the workplace,  failure to strengthen the equal pay protections will exacerbate and  entrench the gender wage gap for years to come.   Mr. Speaker, we all know that discrimination exists. The Paycheck  Fairness Act will allow victims the tools they need to combat and also  close loopholes that allows employers to escape liability for  discriminatory pay differences.   Today, we are talking about financial security for millions of  families. Sixty-four percent of mothers are either the sole family  breadwinner or co-breadwinner. We cannot continue to allow gender-based  pay inequity to rob half of all workers and their families the wages  they deserve.   The Paycheck Fairness Act is our chance to finally help close the  gender wage gap by reinforcing the Equal Pay Act and strengthening  protections for working women. The bill would ensure that gender  equality on the job is not an aspiration but a reality.   Madam Speaker, I ask our colleagues to support the legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of House  Resolution 303, I rise to offer amendments en bloc.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Madam Speaker, these amendments will: require the EEOC to provide for  the collection of annual compensation data for employees disaggregated  by race, sex, and national origin; add a requirement that employers  post notices and distribute information electronically informing  employees of their rights under this act; direct the Department of  Labor establish a program to award grants to employers to engage in  training and conduct self-audits to identify and reduce bias in pay  practices; direct the Secretary of Labor to conduct a study and a  research literature review of gender wage gap in the teenage workforce;  and reestablish the National Equal Pay Equity Task Force that had been  set up under the Obama administration to coordinate efforts between the  Department of Labor, the Department of Justice, and the Office of  Personnel Management.   These amendments will make meaningful improvements to the bill, and I  urge a ``yes'' vote on the en bloc amendments. I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Madam Speaker, I have two additional speakers.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois  (Ms. Newman).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. Williams).    Madam Speaker, I hope we would adopt these  three good amendments en bloc, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Mrs. Hayes).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), who is the sponsor of the  underlying legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   I would hope we would defeat the amendment. This just recreates the  loopholes that we are trying to close. You have to start with the idea  that there is a differential in pay. And what we are trying to do is-- if you can explain this in any kind of way that is business-related,  then they get away with it.   The Fair Pay Act says it has to be bona fide and required by the job.  If it is not required by the job, why do you have a differential in  pay?   We can do better than this, and I hope we defeat the amendment.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
