 Madam President, my colleagues, first, I thank the  leadership on both sides for this opportunity to give a Pat Roberts  ``adios, amigos'' speech.   The story of how I got into politics is a pretty straight family  path. As a fourth-generation Kansan, my great-grandfathers on both  sides of the Roberts-Patrick family were pioneer newspaper editors who  came to Kansas as crusading abolitionists. To say I bleed fourth- generation printer's ink would be very close to the truth.   However, the main influence that drew me to public service was my  dad, Wes Roberts, who was a newspaper man. And soon journalism led to  politics. He served as chief of staff and adviser for several Kansas  Governors, becoming then the State Republican chairman.   In 1952, my dad was asked to head up the Citizens for Ike campaign,  which was a genuine army of volunteers made up of legions of veterans,  women's groups, and mostly Republicans who wanted a candidate who could  win. Plus, they really liked Ike.   At 16, in my dad's tow, I was the sergeant at arms at the 1952  convention, back when conventions actually chose the nominee for  President. I vividly remember two lasting experiences: The renowned  Senator from Illinois, Everett Dirksen, was a key leader in the Bob  Taft campaign. Senator Dirksen, known for his long, eloquent speeches,  was in the midst of his convention remarks when the entire New York  delegation, led by former Governor and Presidential candidate Tom  Dewey, marched in, and with considerable noise they took their seats.   Dirksen paused and, pointing directly at Dewey and with his booming  voice, said this: You, sir, have led this party--this Republican  Party--down to defeat in 1944 and again in 1948. Don't do it again.   Whereupon, the entire New York delegation stood up and gave Dirksen  the raspberry, and I thought: This is what adults do at a convention?   (Laughter.)   One morning I was in a meeting with my dad with the top Ike campaign  brass--Dewey, Lodge, Brownell, and other GOP movers and shakers. He  told me to sit and be quiet. He was in the midst of suggesting the  ``fair play'' amendment, given that the new Ike delegates from the  solid South had surprised the old guard and won delegate seats at the  State convention, only to be replaced by the old guard at later  surprise conventions. Unlike MacArthur, old guards never die or fade  away.   My dad said there was no downside if they lost, and he believed they  could win a majority of delegates. The ``fair play'' amendment passed,  and Ike won on the first ballot. I thought to myself: Wow. My dad  actually helped Ike win.   I met the general. I shook his hand--and then again at the 1953  inaugural ceremonies when my dad became the Republican national  chairman.   It was these reflections, told to my great friend and Medal of Honor  recipient Senator Danny Inouye, that prompted him to say: Pat, I fought  for Ike. You met him. It is up to you to get this memorial done.   And after a 21-year effort, we did just that, with help from Bob  Dole, Jim Baker, Susan Eisenhower, the Eisenhower family, and Senator  Lisa Murkowski, who kept the Ike commission going through these tough  years. Finally, we now have an appropriate, if not stunning, memorial  to the Kansan who saved Western democracy and World War II and led  America onto the world stage.  [[Page S7383]]    With the final dedication of the Dwight David Eisenhower Memorial at  the end of my Senate career, it is a full family-circle accomplishment.  If my dad helped elect Ike, then the least I could do was to lead the  effort to make the memorial on the Mall to a great general and  President a reality.   In a homecoming address, Eisenhower famously said: ``The proudest  thing I can claim is that I am from Abilene.'' He was a small-town  Kansas boy who saved Western democracy and led the Nation for 8 years  with peace and prosperity.   Well, I too come from a small town in Kansas. So how did this boy  from Holton, KS, become the longest serving Member of Congress in  Kansas history? Like father, like son. I graduated from K-State with a  degree in journalism. My father joined the Marines in World War II and  saw action in both Okinawa and Iwo Jima. I joined in peacetime and  served in Okinawa and was part of the first Marine contingent to return  to Iwo Jima on the 15th anniversary of that battle.   So from Marine captain to newspaper editor and news director of a  radio station in Arizona, I dropped everything and drove to Washington  when Senator Frank Carlson asked me to come and work for him. Within  weeks of leaving Phoenix, I was the chief of staff for Senator Frank  Carlson, a venerable and highly respected Senator who made his mark on  Kansas history as the only person to serve our State as Congressman,  Governor, Senator, UN delegate, and the founder of the National Prayer  Breakfast   Life changed dramatically at that time. I always thought a bachelor  was a man who did not make the same mistake once.   (Laughter.)   Then into my life came a tall, blonde, blue-eyed magnolia blossom  from South Carolina. Franki and I have been married for 51 years and  have been blessed with three children and eight grandchildren. I am who  I am because Franki is my wife and we are parents to David, Ashleigh,  Ann Wesley; Papa Pat to Lorena, Patrick, Sayaka, Lilly, Charlie-- Charlie bear--Miles, Oliver, and Graham.   My family is my crowning--my crowning--achievement.   Senator Frank was a great mentor. He always said: There are no self- made men or women in public office; it is your friends and family who  make you what you are.   He taught me a great lesson: Your true friends stand behind you when  you are taking the bows and beside you when there are any boos.   Following the 2-year stint with the Senator, I was privileged to work  12 years for the newly elected Congressman from the big First District  of Kansas as his chief of staff.   Keith Sebelius was a wonderful man, a leader on the House Agriculture  Committee and the Interior Committee, especially with regard to  improvements and restoration of our national parks. Upon Keith's  retirement, a group of party stalwarts encouraged me to run. I thought  about it, talked to Franki. Franki simply said: Well, this is what you  always wanted to do. Let's do it.   So for 9 months, with no paycheck or health insurance and limited  savings, with three young children, Dodge City became our home. Most  sane candidates would not attempt to go door-to-door in a district  larger than most States; however, with a lot of help, we won a tough  primary and a not-so-tough general election--the first of 24 straight  victories.   I was ranking to Chairman Kika de la Garza when the 1994 revolution  put Republicans in the majority after being in the wilderness for over  40 years. Suddenly I was chairman.   In 1996, we achieved a major farm policy reform, changing 40 years of  farm bill policy. To this day, farmers still have the freedom to farm  what they want.   I have had the honor and privilege of representing Kansas for 16  years in the House and now 24 in the Senate. The Pat Roberts of 1980  was fighting for Kansas values and for the issues that affected the  daily lives and pocketbooks of all Kansans.   As the Pat Roberts of 1996, I promised that if elected to the Senate,  when Kansas spoke, Washington would listen.   I have held six gavels in the House and Senate, and that in and of  itself might be a record, but it is what happened during my tenures as  chairman that I believe I have had the most lasting effects. It is not  just having the gavel; it is what you do with it.   Taking part and leading eight farm bills in the House and the Senate,  I have touched and improved many lives, and I have always been mindful  of what farm families do for our Nation and a troubled and hungry world  as we crafted each bill.   I was fortunate that my first committee assignments were to serve on  the Armed Services Committee as well as Agriculture. Strom Thurmond was  the very senior chairman who, as the country song goes, never even  called me by my name. I was recognized as ``the Senator who had the  good sense to marry a fine, beautiful, South Carolina girl.''   (Laughter.)   My role on the Armed Services Committee was simple. It was to collect  the small change left by the Air Force to enable the Marine Corps to  continue to be our Nation's force in readiness, not to mention the new  Warfighting Lab.   I also had the privilege of being the Senate Intelligence Committee  chairman for 4 years during the Iraq war and led the committee's  investigation that exposed a worldwide intelligence failure--and it  resulted in a blueprint of the 9/11 Commission and a better  intelligence community that did keep our country safe.   As chairman of the brandnew Emerging Threat Subcommittee within the  Armed Services Committee, I traveled to cities within what remained of  the former Soviet Union. In one of the Soviet Union secret cities, we  discovered a lab that had developed strains of pathogens that could do  irreparable harm to our Nation's food supply. Talk about an evil  empire. I caution my colleagues: That threat still exists, even as we  endeavor to continue the worldwide fight against COVID-19.   It has taken over 20 years to respond to this threat with a  biological containment and research lab, and we are still not done. I  have put a lifetime of work into NBADF, the National Bio and  Agriculture Defense Facility--Paws from Manhattan, KS--home of Kansas  State University with the ever optimistic Wildcats, Manhattan, KS. It  will soon serve as the first line of defense to protect American  agriculture and the world's food supply.   I have also been privileged to serve on the HELP Committee. Thank you  to Lamar Alexander and to Patty Murray for supporting my amendments,  especially with regard to rural healthcare.   And, finally, I have chaired the Senate Ethics Committee for 24  years. I have tried to resign twice. I don't know what I have done  wrong, but I have been a member of that committee for what I am sure is  a record 24 years. I think they just want somebody there to say: Wait a  minute. Fifteen years ago, we tried that, and it didn't work. Maybe we  ought to start over.   As I move out of my office--formerly a veritable museum of pictures,  awards, and stuff that we all collect--all that remains are the barren  beige walls, full of memories and stories--all of which, of course, are  classified. However, I still have my Marine Corps bumper sticker: ``To  err is human, to forgive is divine.'' Neither is Marine Corps policy.  Marines never give up. We take the hill. The discipline and focus I  learned in the Marine Corps never failed me in my toughest battles here  in the Senate. Semper fi. Semper fi, Dan. And still in the office, of  course, is a framed statement with the advice of LBJ, Lyndon Baines  Johnson: ``Sometimes you just have to hunker down like a jackass in a  hailstorm and just take it.''   On that note, if you want to avoid a hailstorm, get a good staff. You  are only as good as your staff--and I have the best staff in  Washington. I know everybody thinks that, but I really do because they  always--they always took the hill.   My chiefs of staff, Leroy Towns, Jackie Cottrell, and Chad Tennpenny;  my DC deputy chief of staff, Amber Kirchhoefer; and my Ag Committee  staff directors, Mike Seyfert, Joel Leftwich, and James Glueck--they  led the posse. And they always checked to make sure that the herd was  still there and we didn't ride into any boxed canyons.   To the staff currently in this Chamber with me, and those watching on  C-  [[Page S7384]]  SPAN, thank you. It has been an absolute privilege and an honor to have  you call me boss. Always remember you are a family. I couldn't have  asked for a more loyal and dedicated or talented staff.   To be a Member of this U.S. Senate is a true privilege--a working  family. It is the greatest deliberative body in the world. But today as  compared to when I first came to the Senate, it is the deliberative  part that gives me great concern. I regret the loss of comity--the  ability to work together or just to get along. Sadly, gridlock appears  to be the new normal. However, it doesn't have to be this way.   I am very proud, I have had the privilege of being chairman of a  committee that does get along, and we do get things done--the Senate  Agriculture Committee. And it is really not that hard. First, we  represent the best of our Nation--farmers, ranchers, growers, and the  entire food value chain. We know that we have a collective job to do on  their behalf--and we do just that. Second, we convene in a small  hearing room--in pre-COVID times--right across the table from each  other. Third, for the most part, we actually know one another.   I used to be the ranking Republican when Senator Stabenow was the  chairperson. We worked together on the 2014 farm bill. In 2018, this  wasn't our first rodeo. We knew, regardless of what each of us wanted,  passing a farm bill was paramount. We had an agreement--no surprises,  no press the other one did not know about. And we held hearings  together, all over the country. I went to the campus of Michigan State  and wore green and white; Deborah came to Kansas State and wore purple.  We not only agreed to work together, we gave staff marching orders to  do the same. We also became friends. I protected her and she protected  me in conference. And we got 87 votes, setting a record for a farm  bill--standing right there now where our leader is now sitting. I was  trying for 90. He said: What do you want? I said: I want justice. He  said: No, you want blood.   Now, ordinarily, we do not vote alike--Senator Stabenow and myself-- but we remain friends. And that is the way it should be. Friendship and  comity is the norm for the Ag Committee. It could be for the whole  Senate. Though, things in this great country are rocky, I have a news  flash: These really are not the worst of times.   When I first came to Washington in early 1967, our Nation experienced  the tragedy of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King. Within  hours, Washington was on fire, marines on the Capitol steps with  sandbags, automatic weapons with live ammunition. Advised to leave the  beltway, I mistakenly thought I could get to my parents' apartment  house. This was BF, before Franki. I wanted to take the Rock Creek  Parkway. No traffic was moving, tear gas in the air, random gunshots. I  decided to jump the curb and drive on the sidewalks and eventually on  the Mall itself. I was in a little Volkswagen. The police told me the  parkway was closed. When they focused on the next drivers, I jumped the  curb, and I took off on the parkway.    As bad as that period of time was, it was not as bad as the military  march on thousands of World War I veterans demonstrating on the Mall  and setting up camp in the mid-1930s and demanding bonuses. President  Hoover ordered them removed by the military--led by none other than  Douglas MacArthur, complete with a tank, horse cavalry--with swords-- and armed troops. The ``bonus'' vets were quickly dispersed and rounded  up.   Fast forward, the 1968 Chicago riots, Kent State and the horrible  shooting of students by untrained guardsmen.   Senator Bobby Kennedy, running for President, only suffered the same  fate as his brother.   And then came Watergate. Those days were tough. It was almost  impossible not to face the bitter splits over our political parties and  even families.   Today, we are in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, and even that has  fallen into politics. But it doesn't have to be. At home, Kansas has  been dealt its fair share of hardships, but in Kansas--as Jerry Moran  knows--we don't let disasters define us. We grab our bootstraps and get  to work. That is our normal. Jerry will remember multiple prairie fires  that have ravaged Kansas farms and ranches: the Anderson Creek fire in  2016, the Starbuck fire in 2017. Folks, these flames were 60 feet high  and moving 60 miles an hour. Those folks have learned to adapt and  build back with the help of USDA disaster programs.   Then we had the tale of Treece, KS--once a boom town, turned toxic  waste dump. It was an extremely unsafe and unhealthy place for folks to  live. We worked with the Obama administration and its EPA. I mean,  really. No less, we relocated them to safer places, literally, and  greener pastures because working across party lines is what we do in  Kansas.   Let's not forget about the EF tornado in 2007 that completely  destroyed, wiped out the community of Greensburg, KS. I immediately  called President Bush. He was up at Camp David. I called from a  McDonald's in the next town and asked for help. When I hung up, there  were 25 people gathered around me listening.   One old-timer, in his bib overalls, said to me: Pat, was that the  President of the United States?   I said: You bet.   He turned to his wife and said: Mother, I told you. I told you Pat  was a talking to the President, and we would get help.   And FEMA was there the next day.   In a FEMA-issued tent, I talked to the graduating senior class, whose  school and homes were but a pile of debris, and told them: You are the  class of hope and destiny. The following year, President George W. Bush  spoke at graduation in Greensburg. The size of that audience matched  the size of hope that Kansans had for their future and the rebuilding  of their lives.   I am reminded of the optimism of those speeches and the optimism that  I have for our country. We endured these hardships. We came out on the  other side. We did it by changing the old normal and creating a new  normal.   Here in the Senate, only we can decide what our new normal is, and we  ought to get to know one another. We don't know one another. We don't  have to let the apparent gravitational pull of more and more politics  and pursuit of power to change what our Founders gave us--the creation  of a nation, of liberty and freedom, the envy of the world, and to  literally move the U.S. Senate from the moorings of its historic and  great past to simply be a rubberstamp for radical change.   The beauty is that we can decide what our normal is. We don't have to  let circumstances dictate our future. Let us, once again, become a body  of respect, humility, cooperation, achievement, and, yes, friendship.  That can and should be our new normal. The entire country could use a  little bit of what we say in Kansas: ad astra per aspera; to the stars  through difficulty.   So as my time in the Senate draws to a close, I have done my best to  improve the lives of Kansans and all Americans, for decades, to  accomplish big and small things so that this generation and future  generations might live and achieve the American dream.   To Kansas, I say a humble thank you. Thank you for the privilege of  representing you in this great body.   To my colleagues, thank you for fighting on behalf of our great  Nation and alongside me to preserve this Chamber. It has been such a  privilege. As I ride off into the sunset to create a new normal for  Franki and me, I will be cheering for the Senate to rebuild the bridges  of comity that will create a new normal.   My colleagues, my time is up. Thank you for yours.   I yield the floor.   (Applause.)    Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the  distinguished chairman of the Senate Rules Committee and the senior  Senator from Texas with regard to a commitment made between all of us  here.   This commitment is related to the [consideration] of H.R. 2420,  National Museum of the American Latino Act, previously reported out of  the Rules Committee on December 3, and championed by Senator Cornyn.   As chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition. and  Forestry and having spearheaded the effort to design and build the  Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial, I appreciate the goal of this  legislation, but also the challenges getting the effort across the goal  line.   H.R. 2420 has an honorable cause: to build a museum that focuses on  the legacy of the Latino people, one that is embedded in the history of  the United States. The purpose of the National Museum of the American  Latino is to serve as the premier location for people to learn about  Latino contributions to life, art, history, and culture in the United  States.   I support such an effort. However, I raise one issue with the  legislation, that the U.S. Department of Agriculture's historic main  headquarters building is specified in the bill as a potential location  for the museum.   USDA has been headquartered at the location on the National Mall  since 1868. The main building was renamed in 1995 in honor of one of  the longest serving members of Congress, Jaime L. Whitten of  Mississippi. I had the pleasure to serve with Chairman Whitten in the  House.   USDA provides leadership on issues related to food, agriculture,  rural development, and nutrition. The work of the Department benefits  residents in our rural communities and supports agriculture production  that feeds hundreds of millions of Americans and others throughout  theworld.   The legacy of the Latino people is intertwined with the communities  that USDA serves in rural and urban America.   I appreciate the efforts of the Commission to Study the Potential  Creation of a National Museum of the American Latino. Having recently  completed the decades-long endeavor to establish Ike's memorial, I am  sympathetic to the desire to establish a tribute in our Nation's  Capitol. It is not an easy process, and there will undoubtedly be  challenges along the way.   Attempting to relocate the historic headquarters of one of the  largest Federal agencies which serves all Americans is a hurdle that  can be avoided.   So I encourage the board of trustees of the National Museum of the  American Latino and the board of regents of the Smithsonian  Institution, who are responsible for choosing the site location of the  museum, to work through their processes as they finalize a location.  And as they do so, I encourage them to appreciate USDA's mission and  constituency when they make hard decisions and consider the expense of  relocating USDA.   I am pleased that we have come to a compact with regard to the  location for this museum, that we agree here to encourage the board of  trustees and the board regents to break ground on a fresh location,  rather than a historic site of a Department that has served and will  continue to serve our Nation's farmers, ranchers, growers, and other  rural stakeholders.   I now yield to my friend, Mr. Blunt, the senior Senator from Missouri  and chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, to offer his perspective.    Mr. President, I appreciate the work of my colleagues  for raising the issue of the site of National Museum of the American  Latino and for helping to find agreement.   I thank Chairman Blunt and Senator Cornyn for their commitment. I  also thank many of our colleagues who helped us reach this solution  today.                            ____________________
