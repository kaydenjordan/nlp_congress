 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about supply  chain issues, but before I do, I wanted to say a word about March  Madness.   I am pretty sure that most of my colleagues who know me think the  next words out of my mouth are going to be something about a small  Jesuit school in the eastern part of our State, but it is not. What I  am going to talk about is congratulating the Western Washington  University Vikings Women's Basketball team Division II final  championship game players.   The Vikings will be playing in the NCAA Division II Championship  after defeating North Georgia last night with a score of 74 to 68. It  was an outstanding performance by Brooke Walling, Emma Duff, and the  entire team that represents people from all over our State--Everson,  Tumwater, Monroe, Vancouver, Arlington, Marysville, Napavine, Ferndale,  and various other places.   I also want to congratulate Head Coach Carmen Dolfo, who is in, I  think, her 31st season leading the Vikings, and the fact that this is  such a great accomplishment for the women of Western Washington.   I hope that we will continue to figure out ways to promote women's  basketball in the NCAA tournament. I watched this game last night and  saw a few people from our State who had made it there to cheer on the  Vikings, but the actual pavilion looked pretty empty. Yet I guarantee  you it was great basketball.   We need to continue to encourage the NCAA to figure out ways to  promote women's NCAA March Madness. They are great players, they are  great teams, and they deserve to have the same kind of attention. So we  look forward to cheering them on in that final NCAA tournament Division  II game.                                  H.R. 4521    Now, Mr. President, I would like to come to the floor and talk about  a continuation of our supply chain challenges that we are facing in the  United States of America, particularly around the issues facing us in  the high cost of cars, electronics, and appliances. Actually, you can  say that our chip supply chain issues actually impact just about  [[Page S1762]]  everything because, yesterday, we had a hearing with major producers of  chip semiconductors in the United States and also talked with one of  the witnesses who happens to be in the freight business, because they  produce trucks that are moving freight throughout the United States of  America.   They said the fact that they can't get these new generation trucks  out the door because of the semiconductor shortage means that it is  even impacting the cost of freight of every product.   So I implore my colleagues to come to the floor and support sending  the bill back to the House, telling them that we want to go to  conference, and get into conference as soon as possible.   Those who want to delay this are just delaying the United States in  our competition with the world in producing and manufacturing great  product. If you don't have the best chips, if you don't have the  manufacturing, you are not going to lead.   We already know that in 2021, we needed 1.2 trillion chips per year.  In 2031, that is going to be 2 trillion chips per year. So we know that  this shortage is going to continue far into the future unless we act.   Why is this so important? Obviously, there are sectors like energy,  transportation, high-tech, communications, national security--they all  depend on us acting. But believe it or not, there are companies all  throughout the United States right now that are looking at this issue  on supply chain and saying: Are we going to make moves to take the  supply chain back into the United States right now?   I am saying, they are making these decisions this month. They are  making these decisions next month. But there are some  here who think  that we can dillydally along and maybe take months and months and  months to reconcile these two bills. They are absolutely wrong.    I guarantee you, the Europeans are not waiting. The Europeans have  decided they are going to fund this investment. They are going to  continue to move faster than the United States of America to decide to  do the next level of investment in semiconductors.   So are we just basically saying to those U.S. manufacturers and other  companies that have products: Well, if you want the next generation  chips, maybe you should locate in Europe?   Do not think this is an idle issue; it is not. There is great  competition for the demand for these semiconductors, but some here want  to wait months and months and months before we get to the resolution of  this issue.   We need to send a signal to the market that the United States is  determined to be a leader in this area, that we are determined for our  national security and manufacturing competitiveness, and that we are  going to build the best chips in the world. And for the supply chain,  we want that supply chain here in the United States of America.   But, again, some of our colleagues here would like to wait months and  months and months to have that debate. We have already waited 286 days  since the Senate passed, in a bipartisan measure, this particular  proposal. And now, again, people want to hold up this process because  they don't quite understand the pain at the pump.   This is the demand increase that we are going to see in  semiconductors, as I said, by 2030. There is a demand increase of 200  percent. There is a demand increase in the wireless sector, 60 percent  by 2030; consumer electronics, 80 percent by 2030. What are we waiting  for? What are we waiting for?   We know there is demand. We know that we can make these chips. We  know, as one of my colleagues said, if something happened with Taiwan,  where they are making a lot of the leading-edge chips, the table is  going to be turned on the United States. What would we do then? It is  not like a little situation, like we are talking about now with  shortages and huge price increases. What would we do if the major  supply coming out of Taiwan was affected?   We have to get busy here and work on this legislation and start  focusing on the fact that it is affecting our consumers right now.   The price increase for our consumers is a 41-percent increase in the  cost of a car, for a used car today. If you think about it, we  estimated that a used car or truck that cost $5,000 a year ago now  costs $7,000--so a 41-percent increase. That is $2,000 that a young  family that could be going on a vacation or taking care of something in  the house or maybe making a downpayment on a home or buying groceries  or taking care of rent, now, they have an extra $2,000 if they just  want to get a car to get them to and from work.   That is what we are talking about. We are talking about real impacts  that are happening in real people's lives today, and some here are  cavalier about these costs. They think this is all about how long are  they going to wait until they give the President of the United States  another victory, and that is a wrong approach. The approach should be:  What are we going to do to deal with the high cost of products that we  now don't have because of supply chain disruptions, and what are we  going to do to resolve these issues?   I will debate anybody on either side of the aisle who does not want  to move forward on this bill because they don't like the approach.  Maybe they don't like the concept of the United States making an  investment here. But I will tell you, it is very clear that the United  States has fallen behind. It is very clear that we went from 36 percent  of the market down to 12. And if we do nothing, we are going to fall  even worse, and we won't have any of the supply chain here. It will be  located in other places.   I know the American people get this in an intuitive fashion. The  information age is run by semiconductors that increase their capacity  to translate more, to translate in the automobile the voice-activated  commands, to do the intricacies of communications, as I know the  Presiding Officer knows, on the issues of communication and national  security. We have to depend on these for our national security.   We need to quit wasting our time here. These issues are, and my  colleagues know well--come and make your vote. Make your vote, but quit  holding up a bipartisan discussion by both Houses on facing a supply  chain shortage that is affecting Americans every single day.   If you do nothing, this demand is going to continue to increase, and  we are going to continually be falling behind.   So I plead with my colleagues: Put this aside and vote the way you  want to vote, but let's get to conference.   Let's show the American people that we can collaborate on solving our  supply chain problems, on trying to be serious about sending signals to  the automotive industry, to the communications sector, to the national  security sector. Bring the supply chain back, put it here in the United  States of America, and let's get busy doing what we know how to do  best, and that is innovate and make America competitive.   I yield the floor.
