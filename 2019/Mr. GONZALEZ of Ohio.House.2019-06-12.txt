 Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition,  although I do not oppose the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in support of this  amendment, and I am proud to work with my colleague, Representative  Khanna, in the effort to increase research funding for food allergies.   When my colleague asked me to join his efforts, I could not help but  think of my 1-year-old son and his probability of developing an allergy  later in life.   The CDC reports the prevalence of food allergies in children  increased by 50 percent between 1997 and 2011. In recent years, we have  seen the prevalence of peanut or tree nut allergies more than triple in  American children.   Food Allergy Research and Education, also known as FARE, estimates 5  million children and more than 32 million Americans have food allergies  in the U.S. Furthermore, State by State data shows that in my State of  Ohio, food allergies and anaphylaxis increased by 169 percent from 2009  to 2016.   Major foods causing anaphylaxis in Ohio were eggs, peanuts,  shellfish, and tree nuts. About half of the food allergies occurred in  kids under 13.   Clearly, we need to do more to find the scientific causes for this  spike in allergies.  [[Page H4575]]    Madam Chair, our amendment is a step in the right direction.   Last year, a local foundation, the Allison Rose Foundation in  northeast Ohio, was launched to educate the public about the real risk  that food allergies can pose to individuals who suffer from it. The  foundation was established in the name of Allison Rose, a young college  student who died as a result of a reaction due to her peanut allergy.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment to increase  research for food allergies and help us prevent future tragedies like  Allison Rose.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
