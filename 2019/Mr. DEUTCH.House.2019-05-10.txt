 Madam Speaker, do you remember when you graduated from  high school?   Do you remember how big the world felt?   Do you remember your dreams, what you wanted to learn, whom you  wanted to meet, and how you wanted to change the world?   You had those dreams, right?   Kendrick Castillo and Riley Howell had those dreams, too. But for  them, they will only be dreams because 18-year-old Kendrick Castillo  led a charge to disarm the gunman who stormed into his classroom just  days before graduating from the STEM School in Highlands Ranch,  Colorado. Together with Brendan Bialy and Joshua Jones, Kendrick saved  the hopes and dreams of his classmates, even as he gave up his own.   Just 1 week earlier, 21-year-old Riley Howell was killed as he, too,  charged a gunman inside his classroom at the University of North  Carolina at Charlotte. Riley yelled to his classmates, ``Go, go, go,''  as he body-slammed his killer to end the shooting that killed one  student and wounded four more.   Kendrick and Riley are heroes for giving up their dreams.   But we shouldn't be demanding such profound sacrifices from American  students. Instead, we must demand basic decency from this Congress.  This House has passed historic gun safety legislation.   Madam Speaker, how many more of these heroes will we need? How many  more lives lost before the Senate finally acts to help save lives?                            ____________________
