 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Brenda  Torpy, who is retiring this month after decades of service at Champlain  Housing Trust. Brenda is not only a leader and ally in the fight for  affordable housing, she is a longtime friend.   When I was elected mayor of Burlington, VT, in 1981, I knew I had a  unique opportunity to change the way things were done, and to serve  working families and others who had been left behind by past  administrations. My vision was for a municipal government that worked  for every one and increased fairness and equity so that all Burlington  residents could get ahead. At the time, far too many residents were  struggling to keep up with rising housing costs due to gentrification  and development, and owning their own home--a hallmark of the American  dream--felt like an impossible goal. I wanted to change that.   My vision for housing in Burlington could never have become a reality  without Brenda and her work to establish a community land trust in  Vermont. Brenda served as the city's first housing director in the  newly created Community and Economic Development Office--CEDO--a role  in which she demonstrated remarkable talent and dedication. It was  Brenda and her colleagues who proposed the idea of a community land  trust, which was a novel idea at the time. Thanks to their work with  the Institute for Community Economics and their successful engagement  with the community, this innovative model for affordable housing came  to the city of Burlington and was established as the Burlington  Community Land Trust, now the Champlain Housing Trust. The trust did  something truly transformative: Through shared equity, it gave low- income people access to homeownership that was never possible before.  Because the land trust remains affordable in perpetuity, the homes are  still affordable today and will remain so long into the future.   From her role at CEDO, Brenda went on to play a pivotal role in the  Champlain Housing Trust's growth and success. She served as the first  board president and, in 1991, became the executive director. Nearly 30  years later, the Champlain Housing Trust is the world's largest  community land trust, with 2,600 affordable homes, including 566  designated for shared equity ownership; more than 6,000 members; and  nearly $300 million in assets. The Champlain Housing Trust has not only  benefited Burlington area residents and Vermonters. Brenda has used her  talent and dedication to assist countless communities around the  country interested in starting their own programs, making the work of  the trust a national and international model, now established in it at  least 23 States and 8 countries. Additionally, as an active member of  the Neighborworks Alliance of Vermont, Brenda partnered with other  housing organizations to assist Vermonters all across our State.   I am extremely pleased to see community land trusts serving people  worldwide, and remain incredibly proud that the model was spearheaded  in my hometown of Burlington, VT. While much work remains to achieve  our shared goal of making affordable housing a human right, I am  enormously grateful to Brenda for her career-long dedication to  achieving this vision. With Brenda's retirement at the end of this  year, we will lose an exceptional leader in the housing community, but  I am confident that her contributions will not be forgotten. The  Champlain Housing Trust and its portfolio represent an impressive  legacy, but perhaps even more impressive is the enduring positive  impact her work has had on the countless lives changed thanks to  affordable housing. Because of Brenda, older Vermonters on fixed  incomes are able to stay in their homes; New Americans and refugees can  provide stability for their families as they adapted to a new culture  and community; single parents can rely on a safe, consistent home in  which to raise their children; and young homeowners can break the cycle  of poverty by purchasing an asset that will grow in value over time.  Quite simply, Vermont and Vermonters are better off today because of  Brenda.   Becoming executive director of the Trust the same year I arrived in  Washington, it is no exaggeration to say Brenda lent her expertise to  me generously throughout my time in Congress. There was never an  instance when my staff and I could not rely on Brenda to provide expert  insights on the housing challenges we still face, and to put a human  face on what can seem like abstract and intractable problems. She also  brought great energy and innovation to this work, and her bold  thinking--one of the qualities that made her indispensable in my  municipal administration--will also be sorely missed. I count Brenda  among my closest allies in affordable housing, and I have greatly  appreciated working alongside her for nearly four decades. She has been  a tremendous colleague and friend. I wish her all the best in her well- deserved retirement.                            ____________________
