 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the DETERRENT Act, H.R. 5933.  The Republican transparency and accountability agenda is on the march,  and the Committee on Education and the Workforce has set its sights on  postsecondary education.   We delivered the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, a bill  to ensure Title IX funding doesn't go to athletic programs which  disadvantage young women.   Just yesterday, we conducted oversight of anti-Semitism on campus  during a contentious hearing with Ivy League presidents.   Now, we are considering the DETERRENT Act, a bill that restores  transparency and accountability in foreign donations to American  universities.   The DETERRENT Act strengthens section 117 of the Higher Education  Act, which was intended to protect American universities from nefarious  foreign donations.   Unfortunately, many schools failed to report these foreign gifts and  funding, leaving foreign actors with a stranglehold on U.S. academic  institutions.   A 2019 Senate report found that up to 70 percent of universities fail  to comply with the law, and outside experts uncovered nearly $13  billion in previously undisclosed foreign funds.   Of course, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Without transparency,  we have no idea the true amount of foreign funds at our universities.   This legislation safeguards our national security in five key ways.  First, this bill lowers the minimum foreign gift reporting threshold to  $50,000 from its current $250,000. For countries of concern, every  penny must be reported.   Second, the bill closes loopholes that allow foreign entities to hide  the true origin or purpose of their gifts.   Every disclosure must include the intended purposes, dates, and  person at the institution responsible for accepting the gift.   Third, the DETERRENT Act requires that research faculty at our  largest research universities disclose foreign gifts and contracts  publicly so the American people can see if academic work is  compromised.   Fourth, it reveals foreign investments by the endowments of our  largest private universities.   Finally, it sets real, meaningful penalties for universities that  fail to comply. Foreign influence is not something our schools should  take lightly.   I am proud of my Republican colleague, Representative Michelle Steel,  for introducing this fantastic piece of legislation, and the Committee  on Education and the Workforce is proud to deliver yet another win for  transparency, for accountability, and for the American people.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Steel).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Bean).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. Owens).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Utah.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   As we all know, public confidence in American universities is in a  free fall. According to Gallup, it has dropped almost 3 percentage  points a year, on average, over the last 8 years.   The crisis of confidence is multifaceted: part tuition cost, sinking  return on investment, and soaring debt. To each of the issues plaguing  modern universities, the answer is restoring the principles of  transparency and accountability.   Yes, passing this legislation would send a strong message to our  foreign  [[Page H6171]]  adversaries, but more importantly, it will send a strong message to our  constituents: We are good stewards of your votes.   While I know we cannot restore public trust in the university system  overnight, requiring a basic level of transparency in foreign donations  and accountability from universities is a great first step.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the DETERRENT Act, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment makes technical edits to the  underlying bill while also clarifying certain language on gifts,  enforcement, and the timeline for the subsequent Government  Accountability Office study.   The DETERRENT Act includes commonsense disclosure exemptions for  industrial and intellectual property rights, except when they involve  national security. My amendment clarifies the definition for  intellectual property of national security concern by citing the  existing Commerce Control List, which includes categories such as  chemicals, avionics, and aerospace. If a transaction with foreign  nations involves these sensitive industries, it should be disclosed.   Chronic noncompliance of section 117 is the central motivation for  this bill, so my amendment also includes language to ensure the  Secretary follows the law and brings civil action against noncompliant  entities. This means even a recalcitrant administration, like the Biden  administration, would have to treat noncompliance with the seriousness  it deserves.   Lastly, my amendment adds language requested by the GAO to help it  effectively measure the implementation and interagency coordination of  provisions in the DETERRENT Act. Communication is key to combating  malign foreign influence, and the GAO study will identify ways to  improve that communication and coordination.   Mr. Chair, with this amendment's simplistic nature, I hope for its  easy passage, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding and  supporting this very technical amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise to speak in opposition to the amendment  in the nature of a substitute from Mr. Scott.   Instead of taking the threat of foreign influence seriously, this  amendment is a mere slap on the wrist for campuses and includes gaping  disclosure loopholes. This is insufficient to protect our students and  institutions from our worst adversaries.   The amendment first makes it easier for foreign sources to be  undetected, doubling the threshold for contracts to $100,000 and  allowing gifts under $250,000 over a 3-year span to go unreported.   Bad actors will seek any possible way to avoid transparency about  their attempts to harm America through their influence over American  postsecondary education, and a strict threshold is essential to stop  that from happening.   The annual thresholds in the DETERRENT Act are simple and align with  other requirements in existing Federal law.   Shockingly, this amendment includes no differences for America's  biggest enemies: countries of concern and entities of concern. In my  colleagues' minds, gifts from Russia and Iran are the same as gifts  from England.   I find it alarming that my colleagues are trying to make it easier  for countries of concern to find ways to influence our universities.   The DETERRENT Act uses a tailored list of countries and individuals,  pulled from existing law, that have a proven track record of being  security threats and actively working against the United States.   The Democratic amendment in the nature of a substitute also has  terrible carve-outs that provide gaping loopholes for cunning  adversaries. The amendment prevents disclosure of the names of foreign  sources and who at the institution is responsible for receiving the  gift.   These loopholes will make it easier for foreign sources to conceal  their relationships and schools to feign ignorance, rendering  disclosures all but useless.   Finally, the Democrats provide no real incentive for schools to  comply. Their fines for violations go as low as $250. After three  consecutive years of violations, the Democrats' fine only goes up to  the full amount of the gift.   This is a laughable drop in the bucket compared to the billions in  foreign contributions. Money talks, and institutions need to know  section 117 cannot be ignored. We have already seen institutions fail  to disclose billions in the past, and this paltry fine has no real  consequences.   Mr. Chair, it is time to take foreign influence seriously. I stand  against this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, my friend from Virginia and I have been doing  really very well in working in a bipartisan manner recently, and I hate  for things to come between us, but his amendment in the nature of a  substitute really does do a lot of damage to the underlying bill.   There is no enforcement mechanism. There is no difference for malign  actors. We have evidence to show that these foreign gifts are having an  impact on the number of anti-Semitic demonstrations on the campuses. We  know that foreigners are doing a lot to undermine our beliefs and  values in this country.   We need to be aware of where money is coming from, from other  countries and particularly from those countries that we know want to  destroy us.   Mr. Chair, I have to very strongly oppose the amendment in the nature  of a substitute, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on it.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Perry) having assumed the chair, Mr. Moylan, Chair of the Committee of  the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that  Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 5933) to amend  the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require additional information in  disclosures of foreign gifts and contracts from foreign sources,  restrict contracts with certain foreign entities and foreign countries  of concern, require certain staff and faculty to report foreign gifts  and contracts, and require disclosure of certain foreign investments  within endowments, had come to no resolution thereon.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 5933.
