 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the  grand opening of the Wichita Advanced Learning Library on June 16,  2018.   The Wichita Advanced Learning Library has been a central project for  Kansas' largest city since 2006.   After breaking ground on the project 2 years ago, it will be an honor  to attend the grand opening of the library this Saturday.   The old library was built more than 50 years ago. At that time, there  was no such thing as a personal computer, phones were simply used for  making phone calls, and Wichita had a population of less than 250,000.   With the opening of the new library, Wichita and the surrounding  region will now have a state-of-the-art facility ready to handle our  growing population and advances in digital technology.   These advances will provide students with enrichment opportunities in  all areas, including STEM, which is increasingly important for the  workforce of the future.   As a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, I  understand the importance of education, and I am proud of the city of  Wichita for moving forward with the Advanced Learning Library, allowing  our students and community members of all ages to continue the pathway  to a lifetime of learning.                            ____________________
