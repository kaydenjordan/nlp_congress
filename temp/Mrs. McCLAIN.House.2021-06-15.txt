 Mr. Speaker, I am that woman, and I am back to talk  about the Democratic double standards once again.   Democrats love to jump on the Republican outrage train. But when we  see the blatant anti-Semitism from one of their own, all you see are  timid, fake, pandering, and watered-down responses.   For those of you who struggle to keep up with the latest anti-Semitic  rhetoric from a Democrat, I am referring to the Congresswoman from this  Chamber comparing the United States and Israel to real terrorist  organizations.   The Speaker and her leadership team issued a weak and embarrassing  press release thanking her for her clarification and walking back her  remarks. But, of course, Democrats are not serious in disciplining  anti-Semitism, or even anti-American remarks, within their ranks.   This photo of the Speaker smiling next to the Congresswoman from  Minnesota was on the cover of the March 2019 edition of Rolling Stone.  This came after the Congresswoman from Minnesota had tweeted, and then  defended, that ``Israel has hypnotized the world'' and implied that the  Jewish people were buying political support by tweeting: ``It's all  about the Benjamins baby.''   The cover of the magazine says: ``Women Shaping the Future: Nancy  Pelosi and the New Voices of the House.''   Is this really the voice of the Democratic Party, Madam Speaker?   Can you imagine, for one moment, the Democratic outrage if this were  the Republican leader and the Congresswoman from Georgia? There would  be demands for resignations, and Republican office phones would be  ringing off the hook from leftwing, liberal activists.   I ask the Speaker, are you truly proud of this photo?   I can't wait to hear her answer. I just hope she won't be as  demeaning as the last time she spoke about ``that woman.''    Mr. Speaker, on roll call No. 160, I mistakenly voted  ``yes'' when I intended to vote ``No.''       Members Recorded Pursuant to House Resolution 8, 117th Congress       Barragan (Gallego)      Cardenas (Gomez)      DeSaulnier (Thompson (CA))      Fleischmann (Bilirakis)      Gaetz (Greene (GA))      Grijalva (Garcia (IL))      Hoyer (Brown)      Johnson (TX) (Jeffries)      Kirkpatrick (Stanton)      Langevin (Courtney)      Lawson (FL) (Evans)      Lieu (Raskin)      Lowenthal (Beyer)      Meng (Clark (MA))      Mfume (Evans)      Mullin (Lucas)      Napolitano (Correa)      Payne (Pallone)      Porter (Wexton)      Roybal-Allard (Escobar)      Ruiz (Aguilar)      Rush (Underwood)      Sewell (DelBene)      Sherrill (Pallone)      Van Drew (Norman)      Velazquez (Clarke (NY))      Wilson (FL) (Hayes)  [[Page H2800]]                                 ____________________
