 Mr. President, I am prepared to deliver remarks, but  I see that the majority leader is on the floor, and I do not want to  intrude on his desire to take the floor if he wishes.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Rhode  Island. I will not occupy the Senate floor for very long.                      Recognition of the Majority Leader    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.                     Marshall County High School Shooting    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the community of Benton, KY, is  continuing to pick up the pieces after last week's harrowing shooting.   I wish, once again, to thank our law enforcement and first responders  for their heroism, and I would also like to recognize Marshall County  Judge-Executive Kevin Neal for his leadership when his community needed  it the most.   For most of us, this tragedy is barely even conceivable, but to the  parents of Bailey Holt and Preston Cope, it is now a painful reality.  Bailey Holt was 15 years old, and her mother said that she had a  ``perfect, sweet soul.'' She has been described as compassionate,  confident, and comfortable being herself. When she wasn't busy cheering  for the University of Louisville Cardinals, Bailey was always ready  with a kind word or a friendly gesture for those who needed it.   On social media, her family and friends are using the expression ``Be  Like Bailey,'' encouraging everyone who sees it to act with charity.   Preston Cope, who was also 15, was known for being kind, soft-spoken,  and a quick learner. He loved reading about history and playing  baseball for Marshall County High School and the Calvert City Sluggers.  Preston's friends remember his ability to inspire them and to make them  laugh.   One of Bailey and Preston's classmates called them ``the nicest  people I ever met. They never had anything negative to say. They always  had a smile on their face.''   This weekend, friends and family gathered at the high school gym by  the hundreds to remember Bailey and Preston and to comfort one another.   As the other injured students fight to recover and the entire  Marshall County community continues to grieve and heal, they will have  Bailey and Preston's example to draw on and they will have the prayers  of their fellow Kentuckians, of us here in the Senate, and of the  entire country.                              Work of the Senate    Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, a great deal of work  remains in the Senate in the coming days. Bipartisan discussions  continue on a variety of important issues, including immigration,  border security, disaster relief, healthcare, and funding for our Armed  Forces. With our February 8 deadline fast approaching, it is vital that  we continue these serious and constructive talks.   Last week, the administration provided its framework for immigration  legislation. As I noted, it builds upon the four pillars for reform  that the President has consistently put forth and indicates what is  necessary for him to sign a bill into law. As discussions continue in  the Senate on the subject of immigration, Members on both sides of the  aisle should look to this framework as they work toward an agreement.   The President's proposal has received praise as a serious effort to  solve some of the problems with our broken immigration system. Not  surprisingly with a subject this complicated, it has also received  criticism from both the right and the left. Constructive critiques are  one thing, but the type of irresponsible racial invective used yet  again on this subject by the Democratic leader of the House is  decidedly unhelpful.   These comments are precisely the kind of divisive partisanship that  dim the prospects that a bipartisan compromise could become law. The  American people elected us to legislate, not to trade insults. To  resolve President Obama's unlawfully established DACA Program and other  important issues in immigration, I would urge my Democratic colleagues  to put serious, good-faith discussions ahead of cheap, partisan point  scoring.                          Nomination of David Stras    Mr. President, now on another matter. These negotiations aren't the  only important business before us this week. We will also consider  another of President Trump's well-qualified judicial nominees, David  Stras, of Minnesota, to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  Eighth Circuit. Judge Stras serves as an associate justice of the  Minnesota Supreme Court. Three of his former colleagues on that court,  now retired, praised him in an open letter last year for his sterling  academic record, his considerable experience, and his ability to hear  cases ``with objectivity and an open mind.''   Their testimony confirmed Judge Stras's well-known reputation for  thoughtfulness, fairness, and intellectual excellence. I look forward  to voting to advance his nomination and to send this capable jurist to  the Federal bench.   Mr. President, the Senate will vote to take up a measure to ensure  that the most vulnerable in our society are granted the protection they  deserve under law. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act  reflects a growing mainstream consensus--mainstream consensus--that  unborn children should not be subjected to elective abortion after 20  weeks.   There are only seven countries left in the world that permit this,  including,  [[Page S531]]  unfortunately, the United States, along with China and North Korea. It  is long past time that we heeded both science and commonsense morality  and remove ourselves from this very undistinguished list.   Some refer to this legislation as Micah's Law in honor of a little  boy who was born premature at just 22 weeks. Today, Micah Pickering is  a healthy 5-year-old boy. He shows what can happen when we give life a  chance.   This afternoon, every one of us will go on record on this issue. On  the commonsense side of this issue are 63 percent of Americans,  according to a recent survey, and every other country in the world,  save seven. There is no reason why this should be a partisan issue. I  hope our Democratic colleagues will not obstruct the Senate from taking  up this bill.   I urge every one of my colleagues to join me in voting to advance it  this afternoon.                          State of the Union Address    Mr. President, now, on a final matter, the President delivers his  first State of the Union Address tomorrow. I am especially looking  forward to his remarks on tax reform and the state of our economy.  Already hundreds of businesses have announced significant bonuses, pay  increases, new jobs, and expanded benefits. Just last week, we learned  that Verst Logistics, which is based in Walton, KY, and employs nearly  1,600, has distributed bonuses to full-time employees. The company's  CEO told workers: ``I want to be sure that you and your families share  in the benefits of your accomplishments and the new tax reform  legislation.''   When I hear my Democratic colleagues denigrate tax reform bonuses as  ``crumbs,'' I think about workers like these. I think about the Verst  worker who came to her boss with tears in her eyes when she received  word of her bonus. It was Christmas. She and her husband had recently  had their fifth child. Money was tight. Mom and dad had enough saved up  to buy gifts for the kids but were planning to skip presents for each  other, but tax reform changed that. Thanks to the tax reform bonus she  earned, this employee and her husband could go out to a nice dinner and  buy each other Christmas gifts after all. The CEO says he has never  been hugged so hard in his life.   It is a shame that none of my Democratic colleagues voted for tax  reform--not a single one of them--and it is jarring to hear some of  them now denigrate the pay increases and the benefits that only wealthy  people could deem insignificant. Maybe in San Francisco or New York an  extra $500 or $1,000 is no big deal, but try telling that to families  in North Dakota, Missouri, and Montana. Try telling that to that mother  of five. I suspect you would get an earful.   Tomorrow evening when the President describes tax reform's impact for  middle-class Americans, every one of us should stand and applaud.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.                        EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt     Mr. President, tomorrow the Environment and Public  Works Committee will have an opportunity to question Environmental  Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt at an oversight hearing.  Oversight of the executive branch is one of the Senate's great  responsibilities. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership of this body  has shown little interest in holding the Trump administration  accountable, despite the fact that this administration is more  ethically challenged, more riven by conflicts of interest, more  captured by special interests, more defined by cronyism than any other.   After a year of Pruitt at the helm of EPA--a tenure that has been  marked by mass staff departures, a slowdown in enforcement actions,  questionable travel and other personal spending, rolling back critical  clean air and clean water protections, a purge of scientists, an influx  of industry insiders, a smorgasbord of meetings with industry bigwigs,  many of whom coincidentally also bankrolled his political career back  in Oklahoma, an obsession with secrecy, and heaps and heaps and heaps  of climate denial--Pruitt will finally be appearing before our  committee. I urge my Republican colleagues on EPW to bring some good  questions to tomorrow's hearing.   Judging by Pruitt's first year, he is running dangerously amok. He  has turned EPA into perhaps the swampiest Agency in a very swampy  administration. Pruitt's record at EPA demands the sort of oversight  this body used to exercise. If you don't believe this about Pruitt's  record, just take a look at what some distinguished Republicans have to  say. William Ruckelshaus, who under both Presidents Richard Nixon and  Ronald Reagan ran the EPA, has criticized Pruitt's penchant for secrecy  in this Washington Post op-ed contrasting it with his own more  transparent management style. He said:         We release[d] my full schedule and the publication of       written communications on a daily basis . . . Scott Pruitt is       taking the absolute opposite approach. Pruitt operates in       secrecy.    In an interview with HuffPost, former New Jersey Governor and  chairman of the 9/11 Commission, Tom Kean, is also troubled by Pruitt's  fixation with secrecy. I think this New York Times op-ed makes his  opinion clear. He writes:         [T]o satisfy his penchant for secrecy, [Pruitt] is       installing--at a cost of nearly $25,000 to taxpayers--a       secure phone booth in his Washington office to keep people,       including staff members, in the dark.    Imagine that. While demanding massive cuts to EPA's budget, Pruitt is  spending thousands of dollars to build himself, like Maxwell Smart, a  cone of silence. He doesn't run the CIA. He doesn't run the FBI. He  doesn't even run the State Department. What possible purpose could this  very expensive, secure phone booth have at the Environmental Protection  Agency?   Governor Kean believes Pruitt is doing this to keep his own staff  members in the dark, which begs the question: What does Pruitt have to  hide from his own staff? It sounds like a question my Republican  colleagues on EPW should ask him tomorrow.   Pruitt's wasteful spending isn't just limited to his cone of silence.  As Governor Kean points out, Pruitt has used private jets costing  taxpayers another $58,000. His princely habits have even prompted  questions from Senator Grassley. So I ask my EPW Republican colleagues:  If Senator Grassley is troubled by Pruitt's wasteful spending of  taxpayers' money on personal luxuries, shouldn't you ask him about it  at tomorrow's hearing?   Pruitt's penchant for secrecy goes well beyond the expensive cone of  silence that was designed to keep his own staff in the dark. It also  extends to his schedule, where he tries to keep the American people in  the dark. Unlike Ruckelshaus and previous EPA Administrators, Pruitt  will not even disclose whom he is meeting or when he is traveling. As  Governor Kean notes, our only idea of the folks he is meeting comes  from the Freedom of Information Act. Once EPA finally released the  first few months of Pruitt's calendars in response to a FOIA request,  that is when we learned he was meeting with scores of industry fat cats  and almost no environmental groups.    As for his travels, we only find out about them after the fact, which  of course prevents the press from covering Pruitt, say, when he jets  off to Morocco to lobby for American natural gas producers. One of my  Republican colleagues on EPW might want to ask Pruitt why he is jetting  around the world playing Commerce Secretary for the fossil fuel  industry when he should be working here at home in America to protect  people's health and their environment.   What does Governor Kean have to say about Pruitt's industry ties?  ``He has elevated cronyism to new heights.'' Those are Governor's  Kean's words, not mine.   In an interview with HuffPost just this past Friday, Mr. Ruckelshaus  echoed this concern that Pruitt cares more about his political ties  than protecting the environment. ``He's just like Trump,'' Ruckelshaus  said. ``He's got an ideological approach to it, an approach that  affects the large contributors in his party in Oklahoma.''   Here again, Republican colleagues on EPW might want to ask Pruitt  about his close ties with industry and whether he is working for the  fossil fuel interests that donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to  his political activities back in Oklahoma or working for the American  people. Governor Kean goes on to say that Pruitt ``built his  [[Page S532]]  political career by attacking clean-air and clean-water rules'' and  that he is ``blocking scientific input,'' which brings us to science.   Science, of course, gives society its headlights to look ahead and  see oncoming hazards. Without science, if we ignore it or block it, as  Governor Kean says Pruitt is doing, the decisions we make are simply  uninformed and irrational, and Governor Kean and I aren't the only ones  who think this.   Yet another high-profile Republican, the former New Jersey Governor  and George W. Bush EPA Administrator, Christine Todd Whitman, agrees.  Pruitt claims he will pursue so-called ``red team/blue team'' exercises  instead of the long-established gold standard peer review process for  rigorously evaluating science. Governor Whitman sees right through  that.         [D]ecisions must be based on reliable science. The red team       begins with his politically preferred conclusion that climate       change isn't a problem, and it will seek evidence to justify       that position. That's the opposite of how science works.    Pruitt doesn't want to follow the scientific method, at least not  when it comes to climate science or any other science, for that matter,  that his industry backers object to. He wants to fabricate a case for  his industry backers' politically preferred hypothesis. This isn't  science. This is a counterfeit of science. As Governor Whitman writes,  ``True science follows the evidence. . . . Government bases policy on  those results. This applies to liberals and conservatives alike,'' or  at least that is the way it used to be before Scott Pruitt turned the  keys over to polluting industries.   So, EPW Republicans, there is another question for you to ask Pruitt  tomorrow: How does he justify throwing out the real scientists and the  real science in order to arrive so predictably at the fossil fuel  industry's preferred conclusions?   Governor Whitman calls Pruitt's climate denial scheming ``a waste of  the government's time, energy, and resources, and a slap in the face to  fiscal responsibility and responsible governance.'' It is, in her  words, ``shameful,'' ``unjustifiable,'' and a ``wild goose chase.'' It  sounds like more great questions for EPW Republicans to ask Pruitt  tomorrow: How does he justify spending taxpayers' money on his backers'  climate denial schemes.   This question is particularly relevant in light of Pruitt's campaign  to radically cut EPA's budget and staff. Under his tenure, EPA staff  has been reduced to the lowest level in more than 30 years. EPW  Republicans, take note because here is another question you can ask  Pruitt tomorrow: How can he justify spending taxpayer money on  frivolities like his Maxwell Smart cone of silence or personal luxuries  like exorbitant private travel or crazy climate denial schemes all  while demanding drastic cuts to the people who do the real work of  protecting the public at his Agency?   In an interview, Governor Whitman said she ``would like to see  [EPA's] budget have enough in it to ensure we are enforcing the  regulations we have in place,'' a fairly conservative notion. As she  notes, EPA enforcement actions are slowing down ``in some instances  fairly dramatically because they've cut the budget for the number of  enforcement agents.'' You can't do cleanups or police polluters without  money and people, both of which Pruitt is looking to cut. Simply put,  Pruitt's so-called back-to-basics campaign is a smokescreen to hide his  attempts to gut the Agency he is supposed to lead because it will make  his industry backers happy.   Once again, I ask my EPW Republican colleagues: Will you confront  Pruitt about his sham promises to get back to basics while he is really  just cutting staff and resources and reducing enforcement?   Governor Kean speaks for many Americans when he writes, ``For the  sake of our children's health, it's time for Scott Pruitt to go.'' When  you are hearing that from the Republican side, it is worth listening.   Pruitt's tenure at the EPA has been an unmitigated disaster for  public health, for the environment, and for the future of the planet we  call home. Its only value is if you have some peculiar connoisseur  interest in government corruption to watch all the many ways in which  industry can work its will within its supposed regulator.   Tomorrow, those of us who sit on the Environment and Public Works  Committee have an important opportunity to put the Senate's oversight  authority to good use and expose how badly Pruitt is in the pocket of  the polluters he is supposed to police. I sincerely hope that my  Republican colleagues on EPW will seize the opportunity. You can be  sure that my Democratic colleagues and I will.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
