 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Brian McDonald and his  entire team at the Small Business Administration's Minnesota District  Office.   In May 2020, at the height of the COVID pandemic, Brian took on an  enormous challenge when he rose to the role of district director for  the SBA's Minnesota region.   Brian and his team were charged with supporting Minnesota's 500,000  small businesses and their 1.3 million employees through one of the  most challenging economic crises in our Nation's history. Under Brian's  leadership, the SBA's Minnesota district office team facilitated  critical loans, provided valuable training, and served as true warrior  advocates for businesses of all sizes during this difficult time.   At the outset of the COVID-19 outbreak, Brian and I hosted a joint  town hall where he helped my constituents understand how they could  keep their small businesses afloat. Brian's participation was crucial,  and his willingness to offer guidance and expertise is characteristic  of his office's impressive work throughout the crisis.   Brian and his team in the SBA's Minnesota district office continue to  work around the clock to help businesses in our State survive. We are  grateful for all of their work, and we are fortunate to have such a  dedicated SBA district presence in our State. I thank them for all they  do.       Congratulating Minnesota Assistant Principal of the Year Angie                              Charboneau-Folch     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Angie  Charboneau-Folch, assistant principal at Big Lake High School.   In April, Angie was named this year's Minnesota Assistant Principal  of the Year by the Central Minnesota Association of Secondary School  Principals. She received this honor after 15 years of service as a  school administrator, including a decade at Big Lake.   Angie has been a longtime advocate for both students and educators  during her tenure. As leader of Big Lake High School's Student Targeted  Instruction and Goals program, better known as STING, she has ensured  that students receive the additional instruction time and support they  need. She has also worked to open the channels of communication between  teachers and families through her Being Your Own Champion initiative.   I congratulate Angie on this remarkable achievement. I thank her for  her years of dedication to the Big Lake community, and I know Minnesota  students are better off because of her support.           Honoring the Work and Bravery of HALO Trust Afghanistan     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the bravery  and sacrifice of the HALO Trust employees who were recently attacked in  Afghanistan. Earlier this month, 110 demining workers in the  northeastern Afghanistan province of Baghlan were attacked. Ten HALO  Trust workers lost their lives and 16 more were injured.   HALO Trust staff is comprised of locals who work alongside American  citizens around the world to clear the debris of war, especially  landmines. Their work is vital in Afghanistan, where nearly 40 years of  conflict has left the land littered with explosives and citizens living  under constant threat of detonation. This forces locals to make an  unimaginable choice: either let their families starve or risk their  lives to farm dangerous land.   Thanks to the work of HALO Trust and the entire demining community,  war-torn nations across the globe are being revitalized. Within the  Herat province alone, HALO Trust workers have cleared over 600  minefields and provided steady employment to 2,600 Afghan locals.   This devastating attack was an act of cowardice from an organization  that feeds off instability and fear. I commend the profound bravery of  the workers who face down death to rebuild their communities. I hope  everyone will join me in recognition of their sacrifice.                  Thanking Tammy Biery and Career Solutions     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Tammy Biery, the  executive director of the employment agency Career Solutions.   Electrolux had a long legacy in our home State, employing Minnesotans  since 1946. In 1998, the plant produced 75 percent of all freezers sold  in the United States.   In 2018, the business was St. Cloud's eighth largest employer, with  nearly 900 employees. However, a year later, Electrolux consolidated  their freezer production to South Carolina. Despite our efforts and the  efforts of the community urging Electrolux to reconsider, approximately  760 employees faced layoffs.   To support these workers who faced separation from employment, Tammy  and her employment agency, Career Solutions, went to work. After  receiving an award from the State Dislocated Worker program, Career  Solutions offered career counseling, on-the-job training, and interview  coaching to 513 former Electrolux employees. By the end of 2020, 159 of  those trainees were gainfully employed.   Thanks to the work of Tammy and the Career Solutions team, St. Cloud  was able to weather the largest layoff in our history. I thank Tammy  for that.                      Teresa Bohnen: A Career of Service     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of  Teresa Bohnen. Teresa is retiring this year as president of the St.  Cloud Area Chamber of Commerce.   Teresa led the chamber for the past 23 years. During that time, she  has been a staunch advocate for small business.   Under Teresa's leadership, the St. Cloud Area Chamber earned a five- star accreditation from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce the first year it  became eligible and has maintained that rating ever since.   I thank Teresa for her service to St. Cloud, and she should enjoy her  well-earned retirement.                            ____________________
