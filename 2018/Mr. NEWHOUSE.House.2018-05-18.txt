 Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of the brave men and women  in blue who serve and protect us each and every day.   This week is National Police Week, but we owe constant gratitude to  these individuals who risk their lives to enforce the law and protect  families across the United States. Law enforcement officers take time  away from their families and their loved ones, often without the thanks  they deserve and often putting themselves in harm's way.   This week, we remember the officers who are currently serving, like  Aaron Trombley from the Tri-Cities in my district, who was selected as  the Washington State Trooper of the Year. We also remember those who  have lost their lives in the line of duty.   In January of this year, Deputy Daniel McCartney of the Pierce County  Sheriff's Department in Washington was shot and killed after responding  to a burglary, leaving behind a wife and three young children. Deputy  McCartney and all of the other fallen officers will not be forgotten  for their sacrifice.   I want to personally thank the police and sheriffs' departments,  Washington State Patrol, and all the Federal officers who keep central  Washington's communities safe. This week and every day, we offer our  appreciation and respect for law enforcement officers across the  Nation.                            ____________________
