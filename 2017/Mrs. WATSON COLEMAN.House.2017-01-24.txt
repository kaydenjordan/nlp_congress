 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   H.R. 7 will make permanent the harmful and discriminatory Hyde  amendment, penalizing small businesses who want to provide  comprehensive health coverage to their employees and, once again,  trampling on the District of Columbia by prohibiting the District from  spending its own local funds for abortion coverage.    Yet again, the GOP has put our bodies and the choices we should get  to make about them in the middle of a political firestorm. With every  exhaustingly repetitive argument about when, how, and where a woman  should be able to make those decisions, our country suffers.   If my Republican colleagues are so concerned about the life of a  child, why isn't there priority to put forth a plan for public  education? Why haven't we seen a comprehensive plan to continue the job  growth that President Barack Obama started?   Their motives are transparent and I refuse to let this White House or  any elected official play politics with women's bodies. As we continue  down this dangerous road, today, tomorrow, and every day thereafter  will be a day of resistance.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
