 Madam Speaker, today I stand here opposing the GOP's  hateful resolution to condemn the use of schools as shelter for  immigrants. For years, schools have sheltered people during  emergencies, and we know people in our own districts who have had to go  into these places because of climate crisis, hurricanes, tornadoes, and  the list goes on.   Well, sanctuary cities like Chicago and New York are in emergencies  created by Republican Governors who continue to dehumanize asylum  seekers and cruelly bus them to sanctuary cities like Chicago.   This resolution does nothing to solve the crisis, and it certainly  isn't protecting our children's education. It is just another way to  criminalize asylum seekers.   Now, I believe to my core that seeking asylum is not a crime. In  fact, welcoming them into our arms, regardless of their origin or their  status, is a biblical teaching, a humane act, and it is part of our  Nation's fabric and our Nation's values.   How can we say we care about families or that you are the party of  families and values? How can you say you care about children and then  threaten to cut funding for their schools if they dare to shelter  children who are seeking asylum?   That is hypocritical. There is dissidence there, and we should look  up that description in the dictionary. It is time we end this senseless  war against immigrants and stand up for what is right and for what is  just.   Madam Speaker, I will absolutely be voting ``no'' on this resolution,  and I urge all my colleagues to do the same.                                time  1215
