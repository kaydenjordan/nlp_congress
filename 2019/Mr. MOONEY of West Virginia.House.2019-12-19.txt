 Mr. Speaker, for the first time in  recent American history, the President of the United States was  impeached with only Members of one party voting for it. This has been a  shameful, partisan exercise in the U.S. House from start to finish.   Speaker Nancy Pelosi's actions yesterday contradicted her previous  statements that impeachment should only happen if it has bipartisan  support.   Since the moment President Trump was sworn into office, Democrats in  Congress had made it their mission to remove him and overturn the  results of the 2016 election. On January 20, 2017, The Washington Post  wrote that the effort to impeach President Donald John Trump is  underway--and indeed it was.   President Trump did nothing wrong, and these Articles of Impeachment  were totally meritless. The American  [[Page H12288]]  people and folks across West Virginia have been able to witness this  unjust and unfair process.   Despite a rigged investigation and process, Democrats could still not  find any real evidence of an actual crime. I will continue to stand  with President Donald Trump as he fights back against this baseless  impeachment.   I look forward to a fair trial in the U.S. Senate.                            ____________________
