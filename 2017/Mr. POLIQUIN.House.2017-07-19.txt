 Mr. Speaker, sadly, rural Maine is ground zero for the  opioid epidemic in America.   Every day, on average, Mr. Speaker, one fellow Mainer dies from an  overdose. Sixty percent of our families are impacted one way or another  from this scourge.   For years, Mr. Speaker, law enforcement officials in Maine have found  electronic benefit transfer cards, or EBT cards, at drug busts. Every  month, these EBT cards are replenished with food stamps and other  welfare benefits intended to help disadvantaged families. But too often  these valuable cards are used to buy drugs.   Mr. Speaker, this has got to stop. I have found a commonsense way to  do that. My Food Stamp Integrity Act permanently disqualifies anyone  convicted of drug trafficking from receiving food stamps. This will  help make sure limited welfare benefits are saved to compassionately  help moms and dads put food on the table for hungry kids.   Additionally, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3151 will require able-bodied adults  without dependents, between the ages of 18 and 50, work at least 20  hours per week, job train, or perform community service in order for  taxpayers to help them out with food assistance.   Mr. Speaker, similar reforms in Maine have helped lift thousands out  of poverty and into independence and better lives through employment.  We have plenty of jobs available.   My bill will help save precious welfare dollars for the disabled,  elderly, sick, and the poor. It will also help stop deadly drug  trafficking and treat taxpayers better.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3151 is a Maine commonsense solution to a national  problem. I ask everyone in this Chamber, Republicans and Democrats, to  vote for it.                            ____________________
