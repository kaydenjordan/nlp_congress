 Madam Speaker, with the Biden surrender  to terrorists in Afghanistan claiming the war is over, events sadly  reveal this is not true.   As Biden disgracefully left Americans behind in Afghanistan while 13  Marines were murdered, there have been further attacks. In New Zealand,  a jihadist stabbed six shoppers. In Norway, with bow and arrow, a  terrorist killed five people and injured three. In the U.K.,  Parliamentarian David Amess was assassinated. Across Afghanistan,  mosques were bombed, killing and wounding hundreds as the terrorists  practice to bomb houses of worship in America.   Sadly, the biased establishment media covered for Biden and concealed  the ISIS bomb attack in Uganda on October 24, killing a waitress in  Kampala. Shamefully, the media intentionally ignore the atrocities  across Afghanistan and fail to report terrorist attacks worldwide as  American families are at risk of suicide bombers.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from Afghanistan to America.                            ____________________
