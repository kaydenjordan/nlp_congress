 Madam Speaker, Portland Metro Councilor Bob Stacey  announced he is going to retire next month. To say Bob is an unsung  hero is true only for those who were never privileged to work with Bob  or watch him in action. He is a hero in every sense of the word and the  quintessential champion for livability in our community--and not just  for Oregon--because his long and distinguished career earned him a  national reputation.   I have had the special privilege to work with Bob in every facet of  his distinguished career. As a young legislator, he worked to enact  Oregon's landmark land use legislation; and Bob, as a young attorney  for the One Thousand Friends of Oregon, fought to establish and protect  Oregon's iconic land use legislation with pioneers like Henry Richmond,  Dick Benner, and Richard Whitman--true Oregon pioneers. His work put  him into direct conflict with the cult, the Rajneeshees, who at that  point had taken over the central Oregon town of Antelope. They actually  tried to poison him as he had the courage to stand up for the integrity  of local government and land use planning.   When I was elected to the Portland City Council and became the  commissioner of public works, Bob was my chief of staff helping to  manage a diverse portfolio of critical bureaus including planning,  transportation, and environmental services. He was director of the  Portland Planning Bureau for over 5 years with landmark achievements  including the Central City Plan and the Albina Community Plan during a  very challenging time for the city financially. And Bob was respected  and beloved by the planning bureau staff. He was tireless and creative.   He spent a period of time in private practice I think just to figure  out what it was like. He served as a special adviser to Governor  Barbara Roberts. He was executive director at our regional  transportation agency TriMet, director of planning and policy, and then  he was executive director of the One Thousand Friends of Oregon, the  watchdog group committed to protecting the integrity of our land use.   He barely lost a race for the metro council president but then went  on to serve three terms as a councilor where he was insightful and  influential for our entire region. He has been a thought leader in all  things that matter--environmental protection, land use, climate,  traffic congestion, affordable housing, air quality, and economic  development. He was always clear-eyed and visionary, but thoughtful,  all while being one of the nicest people, Madam Speaker, you would ever  want to meet.   He is stepping down in a few days to deal with some health issues,  and while I will miss him, it is important that he take care of  himself.   Oregon thanks Bob for an exemplary achievement in public service in  his own quiet, thoughtful way. He has been a key part of all the  important issues in our region for almost half a century, and I thank  him for his lifetime of public service.                            ____________________     Let me express my deep appreciation to the committee  and staff for helping us zero in on a couple of things that are  longstanding interests of mine.   One is an amendment requiring the Department of Defense to have a  cost estimate and program evaluation for unexpected cost increases for  the W80-40 nuclear warhead life extension program. I appreciate this  giving us a little more information.  [[Page H4932]]    But I would like to focus on one particular area that has been deeply  troubling me for years. I have, in the middle of the city of Portland,  a Superfund site that people have been working on cleaning up the toxic  residue of years. And one party has not been a part of this effort, the  Department of Defense.   The Department of Defense built and decommissioned battleships for  World War I, World War II, and the Korean war in the heart of the city.  We have been working on a hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars cleanup  working with the private sector, working with individuals, with  utilities, and local governments. The Federal Government has been  missing in action.   We found this last summer as we were starting some of the remedial  cleanup. Over 400 shells were dug up, and still, the Department of  Defense is missing in action, not taking responsibility for cleaning up  the toxic legacy of military activities in my community and around the  country.   I have worked on this for years. I have been extraordinarily  frustrated that the Department of Defense pushes this responsibility  off. It is time to change. I appreciate what the committee has done. I  hope this is a new era.
