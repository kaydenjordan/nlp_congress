 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in his State of the Union Address last  month, the President expressed an encouraging desire for  bipartisanship. But I said, at the time, that I hoped his words would  be matched by his actions. After all, the President spoke about being a  President for all Americans in his inaugural address. But his first 2  years in office were not exactly distinguished by bipartisanship.   So while I was encouraged by the President's words in his State of  the Union Address, as I said, I am looking for them to be matched by  his actions, and renominating a slew of extreme nominees, as the  President has done so far this year, is no way to start.   So far this year, the President has renominated at least 16  individuals who were unable to get any bipartisan support in the last  Congress. They include an individual with serious unanswered questions  about his possible role in a movement to push out senior career  officials at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in favor of Biden  loyalists, multiple individuals aligned with Democrats' radical Green  New Deal agenda, a nominee who has repeatedly embraced anti-police  rhetoric, multiple abortion extremists, a leftist litigator who has  called the U.S. Senate and the electoral college anti-democratic  institutions and who has admitted that he is motivated by his hatred of  conservatives, and the list goes on.   And then, of course, there is the nominee who recently appeared in  front of the Senate Commerce Committee for the third time: Gigi Sohn.  This is Ms. Sohn's third nomination to the Federal Communications  Commission during the Biden administration. Her previous two  nominations stalled thanks to her inability to garner any bipartisan  support, and with good reason, because Gigi Sohn has to be the poster  child for terrible Presidential nominees, although I suppose the Biden  judicial nominee who couldn't explain article II of the Constitution  should also be in the running for that title of worst Presidential  nominee.   I have serious policy disagreements with Ms. Sohn on multiple issues.  She not only wants to bring back the heavy-handed internet regulation  of the Obama administration, but she wants to go further and have the  FCC regulate broadband rates and set data caps. This would discourage  broadband investment and threaten U.S. leadership in 5G, as well as  diminish internet access opportunities for Americans outside of major  urban and suburban areas.   As a resident of a rural State, I also have serious concerns about  Ms. Sohn's position on rural broadband. She has been publicly hostile  to the efforts of rural broadband companies to expand reliable internet  access to rural areas, while at the same time she supported the use of  scarce government dollars to overbuild networks in already well-served  areas.   Her hostility to rural broadband led one former Democrat Senator to  ask how Democrats can ``support rural broadband expansion and also  support Gigi Sohn.''   But my concerns with Ms. Sohn don't end there. I not only have  serious policy disagreements with Ms. Sohn. I have serious questions  about her character and fitness for the office for which she is  nominated.   The Federal Communications Commission has jurisdiction over radio,  TV, and the internet, which means that it deals with a number of  sensitive issues--notably, free speech issues. And, for that reason, it  calls for Commissioners who are thoughtful, fair, and impartial.   Ms. Sohn is none of these. She is a virulent and unapologetic  partisan known for speaking disparagingly of conservative media  outlets--the same outlets, I would add, that she would be regulating-- and the politicians who disagree with her.   Her nomination is opposed by a wide range of organizations, including  the left-of-center Progressive Policy Institute, which opposes her due  to a ``pattern of illiberal intolerance for voices on the left who  dissent from her hard left orthodoxies.''   Ms. Sohn is the very opposite of fair and impartial, and I can think  of few  [[Page S543]]  candidates who would be more detrimental to the fair and impartial  adjudication of media issues and the protection of free speech on  public airwaves.   But the problems with her nomination don't even end there. Ms. Sohn  has raised serious ethics questions recently with her political  donations to several Democrat Senators at the same time that her  nomination was before the U.S. Senate.   One of those donations was actually given to a member of the Commerce  Committee, which, of course, is the committee considering her  nomination.   Ms. Sohn may not have intended to influence Senators considering her  nomination, but, at the very least, her decision to donate to these  Senators while her nomination is before Congress gives the appearance  of impropriety and raises serious questions about her judgment.   But her ethical issues don't end there.   She was less than forthcoming with the Commerce Committee about her  time on the board of a company that was found to be operating in  violation of copyright laws.   And questions remain about how she got the substantial settlement  against her company drastically reduced.   Ms. Sohn has volunteered to recuse herself, if she is confirmed, on a  variety of issues related to broadcasting and copyright violations  because of her involvement with this company and the settlement.   But I am hard-pressed to understand why we would choose a  Commissioner who would have to recuse herself from participating in  substantial parts of the FCC's work.   Unfortunately, there is a lot more I could say about the problems  with Ms. Sohn's nomination, but I will stop here.   Suffice it to say that I cannot think of a less appropriate candidate  for this position.   Instead of continuing to attempt to place a virulent partisan like  Ms. Sohn at the FCC, the President should nominate a qualified  candidate who will do his or her job in a fair and impartial manner.   And as I said at the beginning, if the President truly wants to usher  in an era of bipartisanship in this period of divided government, he  could start by rethinking some of the highly partisan renominations he  has made in this Congress and consider nominating individuals who are  able to gain at least some bipartisan support.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Idaho (Mr. Crapo).   (Mr. HICKENLOOPER assumed the Chair.)
