 Mr. Chairman, Democrats are putting  politics over progress by advancing a socialist drug pricing scheme  that will hurt the development of money-saving treatments and, more  importantly, people's lives.   Sadly, workers and families are being let down by Democrats. That is  why I am proud to sponsor and support H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More  Cures Act. This legislation includes 40 provisions backed by Democrats  and Republicans, and it can go to the President's desk today.                                time  1100    Unlike H.R. 3, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office  predicts will result in 38 fewer cures, H.R. 19 protects access to new  medicines and cures. It also lowers out-of-pocket spending, strengthens  transparency and accountability, and champions competition.   Mr. Chair, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act is policy that acts in the  interests of hardworking Americans. I urge my colleagues to support  this bipartisan, commonsense amendment.
