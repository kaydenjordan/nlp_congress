 Mr. Speaker, as I have reminded my colleagues many  times, there is not a congressional district in America that is hunger  free. Hunger in America defies stereotypes. Many families that grapple  with food insecurity are working but still don't make enough money to  buy sufficient food after all the bills are paid.   That is why, on the Monday and Tuesday before Thanksgiving, I  participated in the ninth annual Monte's March, a 43-mile walk to raise  awareness about hunger in our community and to raise money for the Food  Bank of Western Massachusetts.   The leader was Monte Belmonte, a well-known radio personality and a  committed activist on behalf of those who are vulnerable. I was so  proud to join him again this year to walk the 43 miles. I am even more  proud that he raised nearly $300,000. This translates into nearly 3  million meals for people struggling with food insecurity.   Mr. Speaker, I was so impressed by the incredible generosity of our  community. It was inspiring.   While food banks, food pantries, and charitable organizations are  vital in our efforts to combat hunger, they cannot do it alone. We need  a strong commitment by our government to do its part.   Indeed, I would argue that we have fallen short of doing what is  needed. Those who I had the pleasure of marching alongside during  Monte's March understand that, and they understand what it means to be  part of a community. Today, I would like to thank them for their work.   First and foremost, to Monte Belmonte and all the people at WRSI, The  River--Mark Lattanzi, Joan Holliday, Kaliis Smith, Kelly Sykes, Betsy  Cortis, Matt Peterson, and Steve Trumpy--thank you so very much. You  are all wonderful.   I would like to thank Andrew Morehouse, the executive director of the  Food Bank of Western Massachusetts, and everyone at the food bank for  all the incredible work that they do.   I would like to thank Sean Barry from Four Seasons Liquor in Hadley,  who was Monte's right-hand man for 2 days.   I would like to thank all the elected officials who joined part of  the march, including Congressman Joe Kennedy; State Representative  Aaron Vega; State Senator-elect Jo Comerford; and State  Representatives-elect Natalie Blais, Mindy Domb, Dan Carey, and Lindsay  Sabadosa. And, of course, I would like to thank Northwestern District  Attorney David Sullivan.   I would like to thank Easthampton Mayor Nicole LaChapelle,  Northampton Mayor David Narkewicz, and Chicopee Mayor Richard Kos, who  have always been key partners in the fight to end hunger.   I want to thank Tim Garvin of the United Way of Central  Massachusetts; Ronn Johnson, CEO of the Martin Luther King Jr. Family  Services in Springfield; Ruben Reyes, operations manager at Lorraine's  Soup Kitchen in Chicopee; and Jasmin Colon, Kate's Kitchen in Holyoke.  Each of them has done so much to help those who are struggling with  hunger.   A special thank you to the sheriff's departments in Hampden,  Hampshire, and Franklin Counties, as well as the Deerfield Police, who  provided escorts for us during all 43 miles. We are so grateful for all  they do to keep us safe every day.   Thank you to the Expandable Brass Band, the drum corps from Franklin  County Technical School, and performers from Double Edge Theatre in  Ashfield for keeping us jazzed up during the entire march.    I want to thank everyone who gave us space to rest and good food  along the way: The Bistro at Gateway City Arts in Holyoke, Sierra  Grille, BridgeSide Grille, Berkshire Brewing Company, Ben Clark of  Clarkdale Fruit Farms, Tea Guys, Stone Soup Cafe, and the Hope & Olive  and Magpie in Greenfield.   Thank you to the schoolchildren who greeted us and raised funds to  support our cause, including Nurse Meg and her team of marchers from  Conway Grammar School, Steph Barry and Erving Elementary, and Mr.  Brooks and Smith Voc-Tech for their help with the carts we used to  march.   I want to, of course, thank my son, Patrick, who marched with me the  entire second day.   Finally, to our VIP marchers--Chia Collins; Steve the Hippie; Rick  and Georgiann Kristek; Andrea Ayvazian; Marina Goldman; Leigh Rae;  Kristen Elechko and her baby, Elizabeth Dunaway; Marianne Mahoney;  Michelle Spaziani; Amy Proietti; Neftali Duran; Margot Wise; and Terry  Wise--we simply could not have done this without you. Thank you, thank  you, thank you, from the bottom of my heart.   Mr. Speaker, I was glad to be part of this, but I close by expressing  my deep concern about the future. With so many people in need of  assistance, any cuts to SNAP would be devastating for families across  this country.   This next Congress needs to stand firm against any more cuts to SNAP.  We ought to stand firm against any structural changes to the program  and any more burdensome requirements. We must protect this program and  other programs that provide people nutrition.   Food ought to be a fundamental right for everybody in this country.  We live in the richest country in the history of the world. Nobody  should be hungry.   In the spirit of all those who took part in Monte's March, we in this  Congress can and will do better. We must end hunger now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Arizona  (Mr. Grijalva), my good friend, for yielding time and for his  leadership on this and so many other important issues.   Mr. Speaker, I have no concerns with the underlying bill before us  today, and I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), whom I have  the great honor to serve with on the House Rules Committee, for his  efforts on this bill.   However, I am very concerned--and I can't stress that enough, very  concerned and disappointed--that this majority has refused to allow an  important bipartisan bill affecting a Tribe in my home State of  Massachusetts from coming to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation for all the hard work  my fellow Massachusetts delegation members Joe Kennedy and Bill Keating  have done to advance that bill.   The Federal Government formally recognized the Mashpee Wampanoag in  2010. In 2015, the previous administration agreed to hold several  hundred acres of land in trust. Yet, despite these actions, the status  of the Native American Tribe that greeted the Pilgrims landing on  Plymouth Rock nearly 400 years ago is in question.   In September, the Department of the Interior unjustly reversed its  prior decision to hold the Mashpee land in trust.   The review of the Department's prior decision came due to a quirk in  a 1934 Federal law, but that minor quirk could have major implications  for this Tribal community. Schools could be shuttered, healthcare  access could be restricted, and its economic sovereignty could be  limited.   H.R. 5244, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe Reservation Reaffirmation Act,  was introduced by my good friend Bill Keating. This bill would reaffirm  the Mashpee land as being held in trust in Massachusetts, effectively  overturning this unjust decision by the Department of the Interior.   Mr. Speaker, Congress has acted time and again to correct unjust  actions taken by our government with respect to Native American Tribes  across the country. We must do so again to protect the Mashpee  Wampanoag Tribe, and I urge my colleagues to bring this legislation  that will do just that to the House floor for a vote as soon as  possible.   Now, if that doesn't happen in the remaining hours of this Congress,  I will look forward to working with the distinguished incoming chair of  the Natural Resources Committee to make this bill a reality. This is  the right thing to do, and, quite frankly, it is just inexcusable that  this House hasn't moved this issue forward.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding the time.
