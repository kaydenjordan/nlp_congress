 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Clean Energy  Week, an opportunity to celebrate bipartisan support for the wide  variety of clean energy sources strengthening America's national  security while also preserving our environment for future generations.   The environment is, and should be, a bipartisan issue. That is why I  am proud to lead, with my friend Congressman Lowenthal of California, a  bipartisan resolution in support of Clean Energy Week.   In fact, my legislation was introduced by 71 original cosponsors,  divided almost evenly between Republicans and Democrats. This goes to  show that we can and must work across the aisle to be better caretakers  of our planet, and I plan to continue the pursuit of these positive  bipartisan policies while in Congress.                            ____________________
