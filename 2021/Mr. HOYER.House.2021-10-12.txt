 I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, this is our debt. It is America's debt.   Now, I agree with the chairman of the Rules Committee that some of  this debt clearly accumulates from tax cuts, cutting our revenue before  we cut our spending. And some of it relates to greater spending  promoted by both sides of the aisle.    For any one of us to get up and say it is your debt--it is America's  debt, and America pays its bills.   Mr. Speaker, as a Member of Congress, I have faced this question of  raising or suspending the debt limit 49 times. This will be the 50th  time since I was first asked to vote on this question when Ronald  Reagan was President of the United States.   Now, the gentlewoman is talking, Mr. Speaker, to her staff, but I  want to say that the argument that she offered with references to why  it is our debt is specious, and I emphatically deny that assertion.   It is our debt. We have different priorities, different perspectives,  different mandates. But every time we cut revenues or we approve  spending, we raise the debt limit.   And by the way, the gentlewoman was not here in the last Congress,  but we accumulated $5.4 trillion in debt. And the gentlewoman may be  reminded that they were passed in a bipartisan way to meet a crisis  that we thought justified those expenditures.   Mr. Speaker, my Republican friends across the aisle have been asked  to take this same vote many times as well, and they have voted ``yes''  on some of those occasions and ``no'' on others.   Nobody has clean hands when it comes to the debt limit. We all tend  to rationalize that it is somebody else's debt. Let me repeat: It is  our debt, America's debt.   And I will tell you this: I would hope that if only one of us of our  435, if only one of us had the decision to make as to whether we  increase the debt limit or not, I hope that not a single one of us  would say no.                                time  1630    Now, collectively, we apparently can rationalize saying no because  somebody else will get it done. Somebody else will take the  responsibility. Somebody else will act responsibly.   Mr. Speaker, the previous Speakers, I am sure although not here,  perhaps have followed politics relatively closely. I have been here for  a number of administrations. Ronald Reagan asked us to increase the  debt. George H.W. Bush asked us to increase the debt. Bill Clinton  asked us to increase the debt. George W. Bush asked us to increase the  debt. Barack Obama asked us to increase the debt. Donald Trump asked us  to increase the debt.   And now Joe Biden asks us to do the same. Why? Because the  catastrophic alternative is unacceptable. Perhaps nobody is listening.  But every Secretary of the Treasury, Republican and Democrat, has risen  to the Congress of the United States and the American people and said:  You must raise the debt or we will invite recession or perhaps  depression and global chaos in the fiscal marketplace.   I don't see any animation from those who listened to that number or  that assertion, and I am glad to have any one of them get up and try to  deny that every President over the last 40 years that I have been here  has asked us not to put the full faith and credit of the United States  at risk.   Fifty times in 40 years. Every time we have made a determination,  every time--Democrats and Republicans often together in common cause-- that the full faith and credit of the United States must never even be  questioned. The 14th Amendment says that, Mr. Speaker. It has been our  shared determination as responsible parties loyal to Constitution and  country that the costs we have incurred on behalf of the American  people must be paid.   And so many of the Republicans will vote today not to do that. And  they will use some rationalization that they don't like the rest of the  rule or this bill or that bill. Vote against them. But don't vote  against your country's full faith and credit. Don't vote against your  country's credit.   Preventing a default was the obligation of Members from both parties  together. That is what all the Secretaries of Treasury have said.  Sometimes a number of us on one side or the other would vote against it  to lodge our concerns about fiscal policies of the day as long as it  was clear that somebody else would get it done.   Together, Democrats and Republicans would make sure the debt limit  was raised or suspended when needed and that default was never a  possibility.   I want to thank Representative Foster and Representative Boyle and  others who have introduced legislation  [[Page H5617]]  that would eliminate the debt ceiling altogether. It is a phony issue.  It is a fraud. It is fake news. And to think otherwise is  intellectually not correct.   We ought to think about eliminating this debt limit because all it  does is have a threat to global instability; something we ought to  consider very seriously given how the debt limit has in recent years  been dangerously weaponized by one party to hold the country hostage.   Republicans first did that in 2011, even though they were in the  House majority, and the result was the first-ever downgrade of  America's credit rating. Of course, that same party sang a very  different tune when it was in the White House. When Donald Trump sat in  the Oval Office, Democrats were asked three times by your party to help  not default on the debt, and three times Democrats overwhelmingly  responded.   Now President Biden has asked us to do the same thing, take action on  the debt limit to ensure that a default does not happen in the coming  months.   I don't like this deal that the Senate sent us. If I were voting on  the merits of this deal, I would vote ``no.'' It is a lousy deal. It  holds hostage the debt and credit of the United States for another 2  months, and then we are going to play this game one more time; a  despicable and irresponsible act for adults who know better.   While it is a relief to so many American business workers that the  threat of default has now been pushed back just a little bit, that  relief will surely be short-lived because we will find ourselves here  again in a month's time faced with the same situation in which we found  ourselves these past weeks.   That did not happen during the Trump administration because this side  of the aisle was responsible. This side of the aisle knew the truth.  This side of the aisle was not very happy with the President of the  United States, but happy with America's creditworthiness. One party has  played partisan games with the full faith and credit of our country,  refusing to act responsibly as we all have so many, many times before.   Mr. Speaker, between now and December 3, America will be watching  Leaders McCarthy and McConnell to see if they will lead their party  down the responsible path or continue to play the game that has already  pushed us to the brink of default. Let me be clear, I will urge my  colleagues on my side of the aisle not to play that game in this  administration or future administrations.   This is not about politics. This is about responsibility. This is  about our country. This is, indeed, about the global fiscal health. We  will continue to do the responsible thing and urge a longer term  suspension of the debt limit so that we can get our country through the  pandemic's economic crisis and build back better.   Even the possibility of a default, Mr. Speaker, risks harming our  economic recovery. 194 sitting Democratic Members of this House, myself  included, answered the call to help suspend the debt limit under  President Trump. Apparently, you don't care about that. You think,  well, yes, that was the responsible thing to do because we had a  Republican President, but not now when we have a Democratic President.  I hope the voters of America think that hypocrisy is not acceptable.   Others in our caucus who were not here at the time to take those  votes, surely would have acted the same under the circumstances. 194 of  us, not some few of us, but 194 of us voted for it.   The roll is going to be called, and not up yonder, but here. And I  hope so many of you are there when that roll is called. Leader  McConnell knows it is the right thing to do. These are Senator  McConnell's words: ``Let me make it perfectly clear.''   Hear me, my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, and hopefully our people, Mr.  McConnell, the minority leader in the United States Senate, the  Republican leader: ``Let me make it perfectly clear,'' he said, ``the  country must never default. The debt ceiling will need to be raised.''  He didn't say unless you stop pushing your policies, Democrats, that  you ran on to help people, to help children, to help businesses. He  didn't say that. He said, the debt limit must be raised.   In 2015 when Republicans were in the majority and asked Democrats to  join them in voting to address the debt limit, he tweeted again--this  is Senator McConnell, the leader of the Republican Party on the Senate  side, ``When the United States makes promises, it keeps them, which is  why the House voted today to avoid the threat of a debt default,'' with  the overwhelming majority of us joining in that responsible action.   I hope Leaders McCarthy and McConnell and their House and Senate  Republican colleagues will reject hypocrisy and embrace responsibility  by joining with Democrats before December 3 to eliminate the threat of  default this time and before December 3, after this bill passes, to  ensure that our country pays for what it has already bought.   Now, I would simply add to the observations of the Rules Committee  chairman, for whom I have not only respect but affection, I say to Mr.  Chairman: We both went into that restaurant. We both got a steak.  Neither one of us ought to leave without paying the bill. It wasn't  just you that went and got the steak. We got a steak, too. And we both  have the responsibility to pay for that steak. That is what this vote  is about.   Do not hide behind some differences you may have on the three bills,  as the gentlewoman, Mr. Speaker, referred us to. Don't hide behind  that. This is about whether or not we are going to be fiscally  responsible or not. And you can vote against those bills when they come  to the floor--and I am going to bring all three of them to the floor. I  will tell you that--and you can vote against them.   But do not vote against the good faith and credit of the United  States of America, our country. Don't hide behind some facade that  somehow we created the debt and you had no responsibility. Don't hide  behind some facade that somehow we are going to offer something that  has a whole lot of money coming to it because, very frankly, if that  had been the case, Democrats would not have joined you under Donald  Trump and raising the debt limit so we did not default.   Vote as an American; not as a Republican or Democrat. Vote as a  responsible human being sent here by your neighbors and friends to do  the right thing. You know in your hearts the right thing is to not  allow this country's full faith and credit to be compromised in any  way.
