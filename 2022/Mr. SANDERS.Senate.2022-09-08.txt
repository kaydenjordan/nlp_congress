 Mr. President, I rise this morning to express my strong  opposition to the so-called side deal that the fossil fuel industry is  pushing to make it easier for them to pollute the environment and  destroy our planet.   But, before I do, let me put my opposition to this disastrous side  deal into a broader context.   As the father of four kids and the grandfather of seven, I very much  wish that I did not have to say what I am going to say, but the most  serious challenge facing our country and the entire world, far and  away, is, in fact, the existential threat of climate change. That is  not the opinion of Bernie Sanders, who failed physics in college. That  is what the scientific community is telling us in a virtually unanimous  voice.   The latest report from the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change, the IPCC, is very clear, and it is very foreboding. If  the United States, China, Russia, and the rest of the world do not act  extremely aggressively in cutting carbon emissions, our planet will  face enormous and irreversible damage. In fact, the world that we will  be leaving to our kids and to future generations will become  increasingly unhealthy and uninhabitable. That is not Bernie Sanders.  That is the virtually unanimous conclusion of the scientists who study  this issue.   The truth is that we don't need the scientists or another study to  tell us what is happening. We see it with our own eyes here in the  United States and all over the world. The American people, today, and  people throughout the globe are seeing the devastating impact climate  change is having on their communities and their families--with their  own eyes. That is what they are seeing right now as I speak.   Please understand--and this may be the most important point I want to  make this morning--that, with everything being equal, what is happening  right now will become worse and worse and worse. This is not, ``Oh,  boy, we have torrential rain,'' or, ``Oh, boy, ain't it hot?'' With  everything being equal, everything we are seeing today will become  worse in the years to come. Let's just take a brief look at what is  happening right now in the United States and around the world.   The past 8 years have been the hottest years in recorded history.  Right now, the western half of the United States is experiencing its  worst drought in over 1,200 years. Right now, in California, Nevada,  and Utah, they are experiencing recordbreaking heat waves.   Historic rainfall and devastating floods took place over a 5-week  stretch this summer in eastern Kentucky; eastern Illinois; St. Louis,  MO; Death Valley, CA; and Dallas, TX. These are supposed to be once-in- 1,000-years torrential rainfalls, and we are seeing them coming all  together within a few weeks.   Right now, Europe is experiencing its worst drought in over 500  years. And let's remember that when we talk about drought, it is not  only, ``Boy, isn't it hot?'' it impacts agricultural production and the  quantity and quality of food that we eat.   A massive heat wave in Spain and Portugal killed more than 2,000  people in July. Historically hot weather in London and China literally  melted bridges, airplane runways, and rooftops. Let me repeat that. The  extremely hot weather in London and in China this summer literally  melted bridges, rooftops, and airplane runways, with all of the  consequences that that has.   Recordbreaking forest fires in Europe have already burned 1.6 million  acres of land--56 percent more than the previous record set in 2017.  That is a size that is over eight times bigger than New York City.   Recordbreaking drought in China has caused parts of the Yangtze River  to completely dry up. The Yangtze River is the third largest river in  the world. It is the source of drinking water for 400 million people.   Catastrophic rainfall and massive floods have been going on for weeks  in Pakistan, killing at least 1,200 people and displacing another 10  million as one-third of Pakistan is now underwater.   If all of this is not sobering enough and if it is not frightening  enough, a glacier in Antarctica that the scientists have dubbed the  ``doomsday glacier'' has been in ``rapid retreat'' and is melting much  faster than previous predictions. Without this glacier and its  supporting ice shelves, sea levels could rise by 3 to 10 feet, which  could cause entire coastal communities to flood and go underwater  forever. We are talking about major cities here in the United States  and across the world that could be underwater in the coming decades.   Just think for a moment about the massive dislocation, turmoil, and  international tensions that will occur when millions and millions of  people migrate from where they have lived into new areas. The tragedies  and disturbances and destruction goes on and on and on.   In the past, a series of climate disasters like these might have  seemed like a silly plot in a bad movie about the apocalypse.  Unfortunately, however, what we are living through now is not a movie.  It is reality. This is what we are experiencing right now in front of  us. Again, this entire scenario--what we are seeing now--will almost  definitely become worse in the years to come if the United States,  China, and the rest of the world do not get our act together and break  our dependency on fossil fuels.   One of the strange ironies about this moment is that, if the United  States did all of the right things tomorrow, it would not be enough. We  need the cooperation of China and of countries throughout the world. We  as a planet are in this together, and we are going to have to act  decisively. In my view, the largest economy in the world, which is the  United States of America, must lead this effort. If we retreat, it  sends a terrible message to countries all over the world. If we  retreat, clearly, what we will be seeing are more floods, more rising  sea levels, more extreme weather disturbances, more ocean  acidification, more drought, more famine, more disease, and more human  suffering.    Today, to all of my colleagues here in the Senate who have kids and  grandchildren--I think that is almost everybody--I just ask you to  think ahead 10, 15, 20 years. Think about the discussions you will be  having with your kids or your grandchildren when that young person  looks you in the eye and says: Dad, Grandma, what did you do to save  the planet?   I want you to think about that.   We all know that climate change is real. We know that climate change  is caused by carbon emissions. No one disagrees with that. We know that  climate change is already causing devastating destruction throughout  the world. We know that, if we don't rapidly transform our energy  system away from fossil fuels and toward energy efficiency and  renewable energy, the situation will only become much worse, and our  planet will face irreparable and irreversible harm. That is the simple  reality.   Yet, given all that we know and given all that the scientists are  telling us, what is the U.S. Congress about to do? Well, the U.S.  Congress is seriously considering legislation to provide a huge  giveaway to the fossil fuel industry to drill, produce, and sell more  oil and gas.   Really? At a time when climate change is threatening the very  existence of our planet, why would anybody be talking about  substantially increasing carbon emissions and expanding fossil fuel  production in the United States? What kind of message does this  [[Page S4502]]  send to the people of our own country, to the young people, and to  suffering people all over the world? It is that, in the midst of this  horrific crisis caused by fossil fuel emissions, we are about to pass  legislation to increase fossil fuel production.   Like every other Member of the Senate, I have a pretty good  understanding of how politics works in our corrupt political system.  Like every other Senator, I understand what campaign contributions are  about. I understand what the thousands of lobbyists all over Capitol  Hill do, and I surely understand the extraordinary power of the fossil  fuel industry to push the legislation that they want. In fact, they  were successful for decades in lying to the American people about the  reality of climate change. So I know about the power of the fossil fuel  industry.   But, today, I beg of my colleagues that, at this moment, when the  future of the world is literally at stake, that we have the courage to  stand up to the fossil fuel industry and to tell them and the  politicians whom they sponsor that the future of the planet is more  important than their short-term profits.   In the coming weeks and months, the Senate has a fundamental choice  to make. We can listen to the fossil fuel industry and the politicians  they pay, who are spending huge amounts of money on lobbying and  campaign contributions to pass this dirty side deal, or we can listen  to the scientists and the environmental community that are telling us  loudly and clearly to reject this side deal and eliminate the $15  billion in tax breaks and subsidies Congress is already providing to  big oil and gas companies each and every year.   While the legislative text of the side deal has not been made public,  according to a one-page summary that was released last month, this bill  would make it easier for the fossil fuel industry to receive permits to  complete some of the dirtiest and most polluting oil and gas projects  in America.   Specifically, this deal would approve the $6.6 billion Mountain  Valley Pipeline--a 303-mile fracked gas pipeline spanning from West  Virginia to Virginia and potentially on to North Carolina. We are  talking about a pipeline that would generate emissions equivalent to 37  coal plants or over 27 million cars each and every year.    It is hard for me to understand why anyone--anyone who is concerned  about climate change--would consider for one second voting to approve a  pipeline that would be equivalent to putting 27 million more cars on  the road each and every year, especially at a time when we are trying  to transition into electric vehicles.   On August 24, over 650 environmental and civil rights organizations  wrote a letter to Majority Leader Schumer and Speaker Pelosi urging  them to reject this side deal. This letter was signed by the Sierra  Club, the Sunrise Movement, Friends of the Earth, Physicians for Social  Responsibility, 350.org, Greenpeace, Public Citizen, People's Action,  and the NAACP.   Here is a summary of what the letter says. This is a letter signed by  650 environmental and civil rights groups:         On behalf of 653 frontline communities and environmental .       . . organizations representing millions of members and       supporters nationwide, we are writing to express our       strenuous opposition to any additional fossil fuel giveaways.       Alarming proposals have been referenced by Senator Manchin,       in a short memo, and in legislative language that was clearly       drafted in consultation with the American Petroleum       Institute. . . . It has been reported that Manchin has       demanded these handouts to the fossil fuel industry as a       further price for his vote on the Inflation Reduction Act,       which already included large giveaways to polluters.        We call on you to unequivocally reject any effort to       promote fossil fuels, advance unproven technologies, and       weaken our core environmental laws. . . . This fossil fuel       wish list is a cruel and direct attack on environmental       justice communities and the climate. This legislation would       truncate and hallow-out the environmental review process,       weaken Tribal consultations, and make it far harder for       frontline communities to have their voices heard by gutting       bedrock protections in the National Environmental Policy Act       and Clean Water Act. . . . Supporting this legislation would       represent a profound betrayal of frontline communities and       constituents across the country would have called on you to .       . . advance a just, renewable energy future.    That is from 650 environmental organizations. I could not agree more.   The entire letter can be found online at https:// peoplevsfossilfuels.org/dirty-deal-letter/.   I should also add that at least 59 of our colleagues in the House of  Representatives will soon be releasing a letter expressing strong  opposition to this side deal. Let me briefly quote from that letter:         According to media reports, there is agreement to advance a       series of anti-environmental and anti-environmental justice       provisions through the House, at the behest of the American       Petroleum Institute. . . . These destructive provisions will       allow polluting manufacturing and energy development projects       to be rushed through before the families who are forced to       live near them are even aware of the plans. . . . We remain       deeply concerned that these serious and detrimental       permitting provisions will significantly and       disproportionately impact low-income communities, indigenous       communities, and communities of color. The inclusion of these       provisions in a continuing resolution, or any other must-pass       legislation, would silence the voices of frontline and       environmental justice communities by insulating them from       scrutiny. Such a move would force Members to choose between       protecting environmental justice communities from further       pollution or funding the government.        We urge you to ensure that these provisions are kept out of       a continuing resolution or any other must-pass legislation       this year.    That is a letter that comes from over 50 of our colleagues in the  House of Representatives.   I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the  Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Cosigners (59): Rep. Grijalva, Rep. Khanna, Rep. Ocasio-      Cortez, Rep. Schakowsky, Rep. Stansbury, Rep. Huffman, Rep.       McEachin, Rep. Takano, Rep. Bowman, Rep. Bush, Rep. Doggett,       Rep. Velazquez, Rep. Espaillat, Rep. Norton, Rep. Tlaib, Rep.       Scott, Rep. Gwen Moore, Rep. Case, Rep. Raskin, Rep. Andy       Levin, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, Rep. Lowenthal, Rep. DeSaulnier,       Rep. Bass, Rep. Watson Coleman, Rep. Nadler, Rep. McNerney,       Rep. Clarke, Rep. S. Brown, Rep. McCollum, Rep. Waters, Rep.       H. Johnson, Rep. Barbara Lee, Rep. Neguse, Rep. Carson, Rep.       Omar, Rep. Evans, Rep. Meng, Rep. Pressley, Rep. Barragan,       Rep. Chuy Garcia, Rep. Jayapal, Rep. Danny K. Davis, Rep.       Federica Wilson, Rep. Dean, Rep. Adams, Rep. Porter, Rep.       Clarke, Rep. Blumenauer, Rep. Roybal-Allard, Rep. Napolitano,       Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, Rep. Cardenas, Rep. Crow, Rep.       Cohen, Rep. Cicilline        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader Hoyer: The permitting and       public notice and comment provisions mandated by the National       Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) are among the only tools       local communities have to force careful review of federal       projects that may have serious, long-term, environmental, and       public health consequences in those communities. Congress       should continue to provide increased funding to assist       federal agencies in completing the NEPA process but attempts       to short-circuit or undermine the law in the name of       ``reform'' must be opposed.        According to media reports, there is agreement to advance a       series of anti-environmental and anti-environmental justice       provisions through the House, at the behest of the American       Petroleum Institute (API). These destructive provisions will       allow polluting manufacturing and energy development projects       to be rushed through before the families who are forced to       live near them are even aware of the plans.        The proposed legislation would restrict public access to       the courts to seek remedies against illegal project       development; place arbitrary limits on the amount of time the       public is given to comment on polluting projects; and curtail       public input, environmental review, and government       accountability. Additionally, the API plan would require a       certain number of harmful fossil fuel projects to be       designated as ``projects of strategic national importance''       to receive priority federal support, assistance, and       expedited environmental review. These permitting ``reforms''       would weaken other important public health protections,       including the Clean Water Act and more.        We remain deeply concerned that these serious and       detrimental permitting provisions will significantly and       disproportionately impact low-income communities, indigenous       communities, and communities of color. The inclusion of these       provisions in a continuing resolution, or any other must-pass       legislation, would silence the voices of frontline and       environmental justice communities by insulating them from       scrutiny. Such a move would force Members to choose between       protecting EJ communities from further pollution or funding       the government.        We urge you to ensure that these provisions are kept out of       a continuing resolution or any other must-pass legislation       this year.    So there we are. We have got 650 environmental and  social justice organizations, representing millions of people, and we  have got the entire scientific community saying we have got to cut  carbon emissions. And then on the other side, we have the fossil fuel  industry and all of their campaign contributions. So that is what it  is.  [[Page S4503]]    Today, I ask my colleagues to stand up for our kids, for our  grandchildren, and for future generations. We have got to have the  courage to finally tell the fossil fuel industry that the future of  this planet is more important than their short-term profits.   I yield the floor.
