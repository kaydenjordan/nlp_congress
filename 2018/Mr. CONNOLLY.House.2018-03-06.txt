 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us is H.R. 1132, the Political Appointee  Burrowing Prevention Act, as amended.   I want to thank my friends on the majority for working with us to  improve this bill since its consideration by the committee. Because of  the improvements we have been able to make, I support moving this bill  forward in the legislative process; however, I continue to believe that  some further changes may be needed.   The bill would make it very difficult to hire former political  appointees into career positions in the Federal Government. It would  prohibit hiring a former political appointee into a career position for  2 years after that individual held a political position.   It would also add significant hurdles for agencies seeking to hire an  applicant to a career position who separated from a political  appointment in the last 5 years. The agency would be required to  certify to the Office of Personnel Management that the appointment is  ``necessary to the agency's ability to meet its mission.''   There are several controls already in place to ensure that the  process used to hire former political appointees into career positions  is fair, open, and based on merit. For example, the Office of Personnel  Management must ensure, right now, that the appointment process was  free from political influence and report the results of its reviews to  Congress.   A February 2017 report found that OPM reviewed just 16 requests by  agencies to hire former political appointees from October 1, 2016,  through January 20, 2017, and did not find any reason to deny any of  those requests.   We all want the best people in the Federal service, and there should  be no undue favoritism in the hiring process.   In comments on this bill, OPM suggested that certain provisions may  conflict with the merit system principles that have formed the basis of  the Federal civil service for over a century. That issue should be  clarified before this bill becomes enacted into law.   Nonetheless, we support the spirit with which the bill is offered us  today, and we have no objections to the legislation in front of us.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I do support the bill in the spirit in which this bill  is offered. I think we want to make sure we preserve the integrity of  the civil service system that we have worked so hard to build in this  country, where we build in integrity and we avoid nepotism and  favoritism and political connections over merit.   One caveat, though, as I mentioned: once in a while, there may be a  political appointee who is the best thing since sliced bread, who  brings a level of expertise that we need, and we don't want to make it  harder to look at those credentials on their merits. I know that is not  the intention of the bill, but it may be one of the unintended  consequences, and that is what we want to just make sure we are not  doing as we move forward, but with that, I support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think this bill is long overdue and recognizes the  internet world in which we live and operate.   This bill would require the Director of the Office of Personnel  Management to issue a report to Congress on the use of social media  checks in background investigations for security clearances.   In recent years, a number of agencies have begun pilot programs to  help develop the best methods of incorporating social media into those  background checks. For example, the Army initiated a pilot program that  found that while checking social media is a  [[Page H1417]]  valuable tool, it can be costly and may raise some legal issues.   This bill would require that OPM conduct a comprehensive study on  those issues and report back to the Congress. This one-time report  would describe the current uses of social media postings for  investigative purposes and any legal concerns or impediments that may  arise. In addition, the report would summarize the results of any pilot  programs on the use of social media conducted to date and provide cost  estimates for implementing their widespread use in background  investigative processes.   The report would greatly assist Congress, I believe, in determining  whether further legislative action is needed when it comes to the  Federal Government's use of social media in background investigations.   This bill was approved without opposition by our committee, the  Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, last year, and I  certainly commend it to our colleagues today.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. DeSantis and Mr. Lynch for their  leadership on what I think is a commonsense measure that will actually  improve the process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, we think this is a commonsense bill. I agree  with the sentiments just expressed by our friend from Florida that, in  today's day and age, we can't not take cognizance of social media, and  it can be a useful tool in evaluating someone's security clearance  application.   We also understand it could be a tool that is used to invade people's  privacy, and we want to avoid that. That is why what this bill does is  call for a report looking at all of the legal ramifications and the  practicality of utilizing this tool to get to a better outcome in the  process of security clearances.   Mr. Speaker, I support the bill and commend it to our colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the need for this bill comes into recent focus just  today with reports, maybe unconfirmed, that one of the Trump Cabinet  members is engaged in a witch hunt against a whistleblower. We need  this kind of protection.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4043, the Whistleblower  Protection Extension Act.   Representative Blum and Committee on Oversight and Government Reform  Ranking Member Elijah Cummings introduced this bill to extend the pilot  program that requires every inspector general's office to have a  liaison dedicated to assisting whistleblowers.   Under this legislation, the whistleblower protection coordinator  would help educate agency employees about whistleblower protection  laws. This bill would help employees who want to blow the whistle know  their rights, and it would put agency management on notice that it is  against the law to retaliate against whistleblowers.   This bill would require whistleblower protection coordinators to  provide whistleblowers who have suffered retaliation information about  options available to them to have their allegations evaluated.                                time  1545    No matter how strong we make our whistleblower protection laws, they  will not help if whistleblowers do not know how to exercise their  rights under those laws.   I urge my colleagues to pass this bipartisan measure to strengthen  whistleblower protections. I urge passage of this commonsense bill,  this good government bill coming out of our committee. I thank my  friend from Iowa for collaborating with the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Cummings) on this commonsense piece of legislation, and I urge its  adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This is a sad day in the swamp, to eliminate oil paintings of men and  women who consider themselves very important, to make sure that  taxpayer funds are never used for such a thing; sad day for the swamp  in Washington.   One can come to the Capitol and look at oil paintings that bestride  every corridor and wall, in hearing rooms here in the Capitol, and not  know most of these people. We haven't got a clue who most of them are.  We recognize John Adams, but when we go to committee hearing rooms, one  or two chairmen past, we often don't know who they are.   I guess it was an attempt to achieve immortality, but it really is an  act of ego that is a little embarrassing, even for Washington, D.C.   This is an important bill, a commonsense bill, that brings us all  back to Earth; that none of us is expendable and that, frankly, we make  our contribution and we move on.   This bill strikes at the uncontrolled egos and, I hope, sends a  message to those narcissists among us that they can stay that way if  they wish, but the taxpayer is not going to pay for their oil painting.   I thank my friend from Iowa for bringing up the bill. I support the  bill, and urge its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Iowa, with whom I  share a dry sense of humor. I will remind him, being Irish, that  leprechauns are always on the shoulder, especially this time of year.   Mr. Speaker, I like this bill. I think most taxpayers are going to  like this bill. I think it is high time we acted on this kind of  improvement and injected a sense of humility and humanity into our  enterprise here in the United States Capitol. I urge passage of this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
