 Mr. Speaker, I do not believe that noncitizens should  have the ability to vote. Full stop. I think a regular review of  criminal code is a good idea and a good exercise for any State or local  government. Full stop. I also believe that States and local governments  and municipalities have the right to self-determination on these very  issues.   Today, I voted on two curious proposals that my colleagues in the  majority felt as though we should be spending our time, limited  precious time, voting on.   I do not believe it is my place to vote to overturn or disapprove of  choices made by the people of Washington, D.C., nor do I think this is  a sincere use of Congress' focus and time.   These early weeks of the 118th Congress have been focused on voting  on headline grabbing, divisive, meaningless, and unserious legislation.  The American people want us here in Washington working on our most  pressing challenges, issues like addressing our debt, our economy's  recovery, the safety of our planet and communities, and bettering the  lives of our citizens.   I look forward to working on these real issues. Let's finish the job.                            ____________________
