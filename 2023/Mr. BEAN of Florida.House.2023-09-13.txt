 Mr. Speaker, did you know that more than 40  million Americans have served in the Armed Forces since our Nation's  founding?   From Yorktown to Gettysburg, from San Juan Hill to Saipan, from the  Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora, America's sons and daughters have heroically  answered the call to protect our precious  [[Page H4271]]  freedoms and defend the cause of liberty, both at home and abroad.   Each one had a duty to serve, but our duty, Mr. Speaker, is to  remember.   On September 15, National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we remember the  more than 500,000 prisoners of war who endured the horrors of enemy  captivity and faithfully served through severe suffering and  incomprehensible trauma.   We remember the tens of thousands of brave patriots who are still  missing in action and have yet to return home safely to the warm  embrace of their families and loved ones.   This week, from sea to shining sea, thousands of ceremonies will take  place in an expression of solidarity. Balloons will be released, and  moments of silence will be held.   Hundreds of thousands of Americans will gather to honor the lives and  deeds of our greatest American heroes in church yards, national  cemeteries, and town squares, and a black and white flag will fly  proudly.   All of this is good and fitting, but our patriots deserve a special  place of honor because of their selfless dedication, unmatched valor,  and unsurpassed devotion to our Nation's values.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I have introduced legislation which will  designate the POW/MIA Memorial and Museum at Cecil Field in my  Congressional District in Florida as a national landmark to honor,  connect, inspire, and educate the American people about prisoners of  war and those missing in action.   This memorial will give Americans a unique opportunity to honor the  immense sacrifice made by our POWs and serve as a powerful reminder of  the servicemembers whose fates are still unknown.   Mr. Speaker, we will never be able to repay our debt to those who  have given their last measure of devotion for the spirit of America,  but we can continue to do our duty: To remember.   On POW/MIA Recognition Day and every day, we, the people of the  United States, with a grateful heart salute those who endured great  dangers in the hands of the enemy and those lost in service to our  Nation.                    THE POWER OF PEOPLE AND POSSIBILITIES     Mr. Speaker, think about the following motto:  ``The power of people and possibilities.'' It embodies a belief that  everyone has something to contribute to our society and that meaningful  employment helps people achieve the American Dream.   I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to recognize the people that are committed  to this goal, Challenge Enterprises of North Florida, and the  AbilityOne program.   Challenge Enterprises is an organization established in 1972 in Clay  County, Florida, that presently employs--get this--more than 305  constituents in my district.   They employ over 100 people with disabilities as a result of the  AbilityOne program, the largest employment program for persons with  disabilities.   I have been there, Mr. Speaker. I've seen firsthand how AbilityOne  enhances the quality of lives. Work changes lives. That is what  everybody should have; a reason to get out of bed, a reason to go to  work.   The program teaches hardworking individuals to load our Navy ships  with provisions, to staff the IRS mailroom, to stock shelves, to pull  grocery orders for our military personnel, to clean Federal buildings,  and to maintain over 70 acres of grounds.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I thank the staff,  employees, and volunteers of Challenge Enterprises and the AbilityOne  program for helping my constituents in northeast Florida become  productive, self-reliant citizens of their community and seeing the  worth and value of every individual.                            ____________________
