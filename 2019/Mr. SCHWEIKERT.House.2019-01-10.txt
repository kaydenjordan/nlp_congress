 Mr. Speaker, this is one of those opportunities, now  that we have the new session of Congress up and running, to come up  here and sort of walk through some of the math and the reality.   And, look, it is always fascinating when we hear, you know, the  discussion of, well, there is $5 billion for security and the barriers,  but I just want  [[Page H455]]  to say to everyone, before we sort of go into the presentation of the  actual math of what is going on in our society, you do realize the  total amount that is being discussed as the plus-up for the border  security is less than we borrow in 2 days. It is less than 2 days of  borrowing.   I mean, we live in this world of absurdity where the politics  actually have outstripped sort of the reality and the math.   And, look, I accept that there is part of our society that so  desperately doesn't want the White House to ever get any of its  priorities, they will burn the place down, but come on.   Being from a border State, you know, come and see the fentanyl, the  heroin, the human exploitation that is happening not only across the  country, but particularly for those of us that are from border States.   But that isn't why I had reserved tonight's time. I actually want to  make sure that once we get beyond this partial shutdown and we maybe  get back to the business of governing, we actually start to have some  understanding of the reality of what our society is up against.   In the first chart I have brought I am going to try to make an  argument that our greatest difficulty we have as a society, as a  country, is actually demographics. This is something we often don't  talk about, because it is not something we really can do a lot about,  but the reality of it is, as a society, we are getting older very fast.   There was an article just last week saying we are growing older the  fastest in 80 years. You have seen the crash in our birth rates. I  mean, you do realize that our birth rates are nowhere near what we call  replacement rates as a society. We are down to, what is it? What do  they say? 1.76 births, when you need to be up around 2.1 just for  population stability.   What does that actually mean? Well, we are going to walk through a  number of these boards and start to understand what that fiscal impact  means if you want to keep our society's promises on things such as  Social Security, Medicare, and how we deal with it.   I actually want to give sort of an optimistic idea. We believe we  have sort of a five-point idea, but it is going to require my brothers  and sisters on the left, my friends on the right, and people in between  to pull out their calculators and think.   The fact of the matter is I often feel like I work in a math-free  zone.   Just a bit of trivia. In 11 years, you and your partner, so two  people, will be supporting one retiree. In 11 years, two workers for  every one person in retirement. Think about that.   No matter what you think about politics and who pays and who doesn't  pay, just think about that structurally as a society: two workers for  every one person in retirement, and that happens in 11 years.                                time  1845    It is hard to talk about because, let's face it, we are Members of  Congress. We often like talking about the shiny object, the thing that  when we walk out these doors, the reporter is going to stick the  microphone in our face, and it is going to be the shiny object of the  day instead of the structural reality of what threatens our Republic.   The first slide here, all I want to be absorbed is this is 1965, a  long time ago, 50-some years.   Do you see the red? That is what we call mandatory spending. Those  are things that are on autopilot.   The most elegant way I think to describe that is that you have Social  Security and Medicare. Those are earned entitlements. You worked a  certain number of quarters; you paid in; and you get those benefits.   There are other entitlements that fall under this. If you are part of  a certain Tribal population, we have a treaty obligation. Or if you  fall under a certain income, you get these benefits. But they are  mandatory. They are built into the base. We don't vote on them. They  are on autopilot.   In last year's budget, actually, well over 70 percent of all the  spending was on autopilot. It is what, ultimately, is consuming the  budget.   We are going to do a couple of these slides, just to try to get our  heads around this. Let's swap to the next one. This is just to sort of  help the breakout.   My understanding is that in this coming budget year--you need to  think about this--defense spending in the 2019 cycle will basically be  the same as Medicare.   How many of us, when we go home to talk to our constituents, somehow  think defense is two-thirds, a third of the budget? Basically, as you  start to look at the charts here, you will actually see--and these are  the 2018 numbers.   As you walk through, you see the blue. We will call that the sea foam  blue. That is Social Security. That is 24 percent of all our spending.   If you come over here, national defense is this rust. That is 15.   Last year, Medicare was actually a little over 14-point-something.  This year, Medicare and defense are almost the same.   With our demographics--remember the baby boom, 74 million of our  brothers and sisters who were born in that 18-year period who are baby  boomers--the peak of the baby boom right now is about 62, 63 years old.  They are just starting to move into the years where they will receive  those earned benefits.   Then you come over here to Medicaid and other income programs, net  interest--remember, interest is a mandatory. You have to pay it to  protect the sanctity and full faith and credit of U.S. debt. You start  to realize, the amount that we, as Members of Congress, actually get to  work on starts being about a quarter of all the spending.   It is not driven, really, by current policy. These are previous  policies. It is driven by our demographics. We are getting older very  fast.   This is the slide that is the most devastating to get your head  around. Yes, I have not adjusted this for inflation, so these are  stagnant dollars. When you use a 30-year time window, you can deduct  about a third. Eventually, I will get this slide up, and I will do the  interest deduction.   But think of this: Over the next 30 years--2018 to 2048, a 30-year  window--what is causing an $84 trillion budget deficit? It is  substantially interest, the shortfalls in Social Security, and the  shortfalls in Medicare. The rest of the budget has about a $16 trillion  surplus in what we calculated as revenues to spending.   That is really important to get our heads around. It is fascinating  that, when you show these numbers, I will get people who will protest  the math. It is not Republican math; it is not Democratic math; it is  just math.   The reality of it is that we have these massive, unfunded liabilities  that are basically in two programs, Social Security and Medicare, and  we have a moral obligation to keep our promises as a society.   So how do we get there?   The next one, I am just going to put this one up so it helps  reemphasize the way this works. Think of this: From 2008 to 2028--so  that 20-year window--91 percent of the increased spending in this body  comes from three things: interest, the growth in Social Security, and  the growth in spending in healthcare entitlements.   When you see my kind come behind these microphones, and we speak as  eloquently as we can, unless we are telling the truth about the  demographics, we are actually not telling the truth of what is really  going on. I know it is hard. It is math with lots and lots of zeroes.  But this is the reality. When you look at the charts, things like  defense, nondefense discretionary, even some of what we call the other  entitlements, they are substantially flat over that 20-year period.   We are getting older very fast as a society, and our birth rates as a  society have collapsed. We don't have enough children right now, over  the last decade, to even be at replacement rates. We are basically  following the trend of the rest of the industrialized world.   You have to think that through. What does that mean for our ability  to promise Americans, as they move into their senior years, that  retirement security? That, I think, both Republicans and Democrats all  agree we must have, but, yet, then we do everything we can to avoid the  actual math.   The next slide I want to go to is to, once again, reemphasize the  reality of what is happening in our society population-wise. For this  next chart, I am using Arizona, because that is my home. But guess  which State appears  [[Page H456]]  to have the biggest fall in birth rates? Arizona.   Now, please be merciful on me. I am going to try to explain something  with a lack of sort of elegant language. I have had multiple  conversations with a couple of folks who make their living just fixated  on demographic numbers, and they, partially, are giddy about this for  one thing in society. They sort of come back and say: Look, in previous  demographic modeling, we thought parts of our Hispanic populations,  parts of our LDS populations, and parts of others were going to  continue to have very high birth rates, and that was going to provide  some population stability.    But the fact of the matter is the melting pot, apparently, is  actually working in our society. In our country, the melting pot is  working. One of the ways that demographers refer to it is say: Look, we  are all not having children like each other. The likelihood you will  have a similar education, live in the same neighborhood, and now also  not have children like each other, you see it in the math.   So, on one hand, yes, the melting pot is working. That is great for  our country. We are Americans. We are a diverse lot, but we are  Americans.   Now we need to deal with the social entitlement problem. That is, in  11 years, if I have two workers for every one person that is retired,  and my birth rates are continuing to fall, how do you make the math  work? How do you keep your promises?   Remember my first quip when first coming up to the podium: We are  having this dispute over an additional $5 billion of border security  and the effects that has on humanitarian aid. But the absurdity is that  it is less than 2 days of borrowing right now, and almost all that  borrowing is driven by--you saw it on the previous slide--our  allocation to cover our interest costs, Social Security, and the  healthcare entitlements, where almost all the spending growth is.   This is a reality, but it is fascinating. The beginning of this is  2000. In 2000, we were basically about 3.1 in birth rates. Fertility  rates have collapsed. When you actually start to do the mean  nationwide, we are now down to--what is it?--1.67.   We need to actually couple that in with the massive unfunded  liabilities we have and start to understand that the greatest threat to  our country right now is massive entitlement promises and the lack of  resources to cover them.   I have done it before, and I am going to do this about every week. I  am going to bring in different boards. I have a series of boards that  show almost every idea that gets quipped out of: ``Well, we will raise  tax rates to this, or we will do this.'' None of them come anywhere  close to actually covering the scale of our obligations.   Right now, I want to do one or two things that I actually believe are  optimistic. I am going to give you sort of a five-point idea. This is  something I have been talking about in Arizona and partially around the  country and other places. I need us to think about, okay, this is the  math reality. We have these massive unfunded liabilities that are  basically driven by two programs and our interest obligations. How do  we fix it?   Let's actually walk through a list and understand it. I call this the  unified theory because we have to do all of them. We have to do all of  them at the same time, and we have to fixate on the growth aspects they  all bring.   The first one I want to talk about is immigration. As we go through,  partially, the political theater, as this body has been doing with  regard to immigration, let's actually take a step backward and say:  What immigration policy maximizes economic growth for the country so  that growth helps us pay our promises, so people will receive their  Social Security and Medicare?   We will have to move to a talent-based immigration system, because,  as the rest of the world has done, whether it be New Zealand, Great  Britain, Canada, or Australia, the rest of the world has basically  moved to a talent-based system because they figured out it maximizes  economic growth.   In our case, hopefully, we would move to a substantially talent-based  system. You still are going to have compassion. There will still be  types of visas for our brothers and sisters around the world that meet  our standards of compassion. But with that, I believe, you also are  going to have to put in math shock absorbers that deal with the fact  that we are going through a cycle right now with birth rates falling.  Would you adjust certain portions of that talent-based immigration  population to deal with something we call population stability for the  future?   Remember, this is about maximizing economic growth, so we can keep  our promises as a society.   The slide I have next to me is sort of as we deal with the next  couple issues. So I believe a major reform in the immigration system  can maximize economic expansion.   The next thing is a fixation on growth. When we did tax reform, as we  get together and start to realize this supercomputer we carry in our  pocket, oddly enough, could be the greatest regulator in our society  because it can crowd source information. I have done presentations on  this in the past.   Instead of building bureaucratic models, where we make people fill  out lots of pieces of paper and shove them in file cabinets, how about  moving to a modern system?   As a simple example, how many of you use Waze as a way you drove to  your office, or to work, or to pick up the kids? That is a crowd source  model that gives you information.   It turns out that same concept can actually be a way to regulate air  quality and know that we are safe without building a bureaucratic  model. It can be so many things.   We need to fixate on what maximizes economic growth in our society,  and that is Tax Code; that is regulatory code; that is removing  barriers, removing the barriers at the State, local, and Federal level  that encourage risk-taking entrepreneurship, the things that create the  economic disruptions, so we grow.                                time  1900    The third thing, and that is what that chart is about, we call it  labor force participation. We got the report last week that was  actually in some ways wonderful and in some ways it is heartbreaking.   We are giddy that we broke 63 percent labor force participation. We  hit 63.1. I can show you a stack of articles from the last decade from  really smart economists, mostly on the left side. They said we are  never going to get back to 63 percent labor force participation because  we are getting older as a society, we have so many worn-out workers, or  whatever the current pop cultural term is.   Well, we broke through 63.1 last month in December. But understand,  it was only a decade ago we were pushing around 67 percent labor force  participation. What does that mean? It means we have substantial  portions of our population who, for lots of reasons, whether it be  drugs, whether it be certain educational aspects, whether it be  societal expectations, are not in the labor force.   I have actually done it before, and we will do it again over the next  couple of months. I will do some charts where it is actually a really  interesting sort of barbell-type curve where we have lots of young  people--mostly males--who are not in the workforce, and then older  parts of our population who are choosing maybe the rational thing, to  retire.   How do you build a society that encourages a person to stay or to  enter the workforce? So as we have debates around here where the left  wants to talk about certain types of income assistance, we in the right  will talk about: How do you take that and make it a reward to work?   We need more of our population to work. If we could go right now from  that 63 percent labor force participation and get back to that 67 that  we were at just a decade ago, it is amazing how it helps.   So the third thing I am going to give you is we need to have  everything, whether it be from the discussion of SNAP--food stamps--to  incentives in Social Security and Medicare, to encourage someone to  stay in the workforce longer, to a young person in their student loans  to actually enter the workforce and begin that process.   Every program we as a government, as a society, participate in, we  should maximize the incentive to work because we need it if we are  going to keep our promises.  [[Page H457]]    Remember, this is a loop. Everything here we talk about is, if we are  going to keep our promises on Social Security and Medicare, we have got  to have the economic expansion that provides the resources.   The next one I am going to give you is the one that I am most  optimistic about. And let's put that board up. But this one is a little  harder to talk about, so I will beg you to bear with me.   When we have had debates around here on the ACA--some people know it  as ObamaCare--or our Republican alternative, or this healthcare debate,  I need everyone intellectually to strip away our partisanship and take  a step backwards. Almost all of the debates have been about who gets to  pay.   The ACA just shifted lots and lots of the spending onto the  government. Some of our alternatives were actually trying to spread the  cost out more across the private payer populations. But we have done  almost nothing to disrupt the cost curve.   So part of the thought experiment I want us all to engage in is: How  many of us went to Blockbuster Video last weekend? I know it is a  little starky, but think about it. Didn't it feel like almost overnight  you no longer stood in line at the local retail strip center at  Blockbuster Video to get the little silver disk that you were going to  take home and shove into your Blu-ray player? You would now go home and  you hit a button and you get Netflix, or HBO Go, or Hulu, or whatever  you are watching.   That is what we call a disruption. Almost overnight, society figured  out, hey, this is cheaper, faster, better.   How do we take that sort of concept of disruption and make it part of  healthcare? How do you say, instead of playing this game that we have  played over and over of just trying to move around who gets to pay, we  are going to engage technology in such a fashion that we disrupt the  cost curve of healthcare delivery?   The fact of the matter is there is so much technology rolling out,  this is about to become your primary care physician.   How many of you have seen the articles of something that looks like a  kazoo, a large kazoo that you blow into and it tells you if you have  the flu virus. The article from last week, something a little bigger, a  cone over your nose and mouth, you blow into it and it tells you if you  have a bacteria.   There is the Apple Watch that will help you manage your arrhythmia.  There is all of this technology rolling out. There are things, I am  told, right now at the Consumer Electronics Show, a couple of hundred  items being shown at this moment that are all technology--we like to  refer to them as digiceuticals in our office--that will disrupt the  cost of healthcare if we can break down the regulatory legal barriers,  whether it be on how we pay for them or the fact that many of them  provide a level of autonomous healthcare. Our system as it is regulated  and compensated today does not, was not designed for a level of  autonomous.   We have a company in Scottsdale that now has four or five locations  up. I guess they used to be Theranos booths. I think they are at  Safeways, if I am allowed to say such a thing.   You go in and you functionally fill out your information in an iPad.  You go into a private booth. There is an avatar on the screen. You grab  the scope--and forgive me, I am not a medical person--and you shove it  down your throat, in your ear, in your nose. It tells you how to move  it. It tells you what they need.   You put your hand on something. It can do a pulse and the  temperatures and other things. And an algorithm does the calculations.  Apparently, the algorithm is amazingly accurate.   What would happen if that type of healthcare became available to all  of us? We crash the price. We dramatically change the availability.  And, yes, these things are scary because it is a disruption of  technology into our economy, but we don't have a choice.   You saw the charts before. The greatest fragility in our society is  promises we have made that we have no money. And almost every solution  gets us nowhere close to the types of resources needed. We must have a  disruption in the cost of delivery.   And part of the thought experiment, it has been a year or two, but we  have seen things like the contact lens that can calculate your blood  glucose, that talks to your insulin pump.   Because we do know that more than half of our healthcare costs in  this country are for the 5 percent of our brothers and sisters who have  chronic conditions, what happens when those digiceuticals help manage  those chronic conditions to prevent the crashing?   How about the pill bottle that makes sure that--we know that 50  percent of pharmaceuticals are not used properly. The solution becomes  a technology one when all of a sudden your phone rings. The beeper goes  off. You haven't taken your hypertension medicine that morning.   We desperately need this body to start to understand this. And is  that Republican or Democratic? It is technology. Now, I am sure,  eventually, we will break down and it will become a Republican issue or  a Democratic issue, whether it be because which lobbyists go where, but  for right now, it is just a solution.   The last one I will give you of my five is when we do all of this  progrowth, this ability to crash the cost of delivery of healthcare, we  are going to then have to have a really honest conversation of what we  must do, particularly in Medicare, to modernize the design, deal with  the reality that life expectancies for those who make it into  retirement are going up.   Many of us will spend a third of our life in retirement. Do we need  to change the incentives within those individual programs on how we  take our benefits? How we manage those costs? How we participate in  them?   We have some really interesting ideas: Would you make adjustments for  folks who may have the ability to carry previous healthcare options  with them?   But I truly believe we need to do all five of these, and we need to  do them almost immediately because every day we wait, another 10,300 of  our brothers and sisters, Americans, reach 65 and start to move into  their benefits. And every day we wait, we avoid the reality of math.   I guess there are a couple of smart people out there who many years  ago said: Tell me your demographics and I will tell you your destiny.   I have just told you our demographics. I have just shared with you  the scale that is off the charts on the promises we have made and our  lack of resources, and I believe I have actually begun to give an  approach of a unified theory of how we make it work and how we make it  through, functionally, our 74 million baby boomers who are moving into  retirement and how we move through that population bubble so someone  like my 3-year-old daughter also has the economic opportunities that I  have had.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 10 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, January 11, 2019, at  9 a.m.                            ____________________
