 Mr. Speaker, the House has now spoken in a clear voice and  approved this bipartisan bill. If there are any developments that would  require Members to return before our scheduled return date of March 23,  24 hours' notice will be provided.   I want to thank all Members for their patience as leaders on both  sides worked hard to negotiate the coronavirus response legislation the  House has now adopted. Much remains to be done, but we have done good  work last week on behalf of the American people and good work this week  on behalf of the American people.                            ____________________
