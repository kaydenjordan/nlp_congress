 Mr. President, in its relentless pursuit of canceling  student debt, the Department of Education seems to have forgotten that  Congress gave it a job to do.   Last year, the Department announced its unconstitutional efforts to  spend hundreds of billions of taxpayers' dollars, contrary to law. Of  course, you  [[Page S5939]]  remember that was the forgiving of student loans.   Even after this attempt was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme  Court, endless efforts of debt cancellation seem to have taken  precedent over the duty Congress is giving the Department.   For example, after being on pause for 3 years, student loan payments  finally started back up here in October of this year.   Servicers, students, and Members of Congress pressed for answers  about how and when this process would work. But instead of a plan, the  return to repayment has been utter chaos. Iowans, and even some Members  of my staff who have student loans, have waited for weeks to get  answers to very basic questions about their loans.   Due to sloppy recordkeeping, the Department has failed its audit for  the second straight year in a row. In its hurry to cancel debt, the  administration can't even provide auditors enough information to do  their jobs.   It isn't just previous students who are being left in limbo. There is  another issue that is hard to get information on.   So we have current and incoming college students who still can't fill  out the application form that goes by the acronym FAFSA. That stands  for ``free application for student aid.'' In a normal year, students  would fill it out in October and know early in the process whether they  had qualified for Pell grants or other forms of student aid, but this  year, students still don't have the information they need to start  choosing the best school for them. I have long said that students don't  have enough transparent information when applying to college. The  shortened timeline this year makes it even harder.   To address the problem that I just mentioned, I recently sent a  letter, with Senator Kaine of Virginia and other colleagues, pressing  the Department of Education to give students the information they need.  That includes making sure that farm families aren't forced to sell  their farms in order to send their kids to college. It helps no one to  lump small family farms in with the largest mega farms--as if a farm  family who is barely getting by is somehow considered to be rich--and  have their kids not qualify for student loans. The bipartisan effort by  Senator Kaine and me pushes the Department to recognize that  distinction and ensure that farm kids have the information they need to  properly fill out the proper forms to see if they qualify for student  loans.   All students deserve to have the information they need and to get  that information ahead of time. Students, families, and borrowers  shouldn't have their timelines delayed by changing political whims.   Congress certainly did not pass a law telling the Department to  cancel hundreds of billions in student debt, but Congress did give the  Department a mandate to properly oversee student loan repayments, the  implementation of the FAFSA, and to keep its finances in order. Before  trying to unconstitutionally create enormous new cancelation programs,  I suggest and encourage the Department of Education to do the job it  has actually been given by the Congress to do.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, the organ transplant business and  network governance has been in shambles for decades, and people have  needlessly died because of it, and we have passed very good legislation  unanimously to correct it.   So I come to the Senate floor because I have very serious concerns  about the Biden administration's implementation of H.R. 2544. That  legislation goes by the title of Securing the U.S. Organ Procurement  and Transplantation Network Act. I am joined by a colleague who has  worked really hard on this issue, Senator Moran of Kansas, who will  also give his views on this issue. He worked with me and championed  this very important issue.   On September 22 of this year, this legislation, H.R. 2544, was signed  into law by this President. In less than 3 months, the Health Resources  and Services Administration of the Department of Health and Human  Services is already ignoring congressional intent while asking  Congress--can you believe it--for money to implement the law, and it is  presumably to implement the law contrary to what the legislation  requires.   Now, I am proud to have been a cosponsor of this very important  bipartisan piece of legislation. We fought alongside patient  organizations that knew this whole setup, for decades, was not working  the way it should. We did this with the hope and expectation that we  would have real competition to manage our organ donation system.   Congress unanimously passed the bill, as I said before, and we were  able to do it despite attempts by a lot of people within the 40-year- old organization that runs this program that tried to kill it with what  we call around here poison-pill amendments. And that point is very  important because we didn't adopt any of those amendments. Yet we see  some of those amendments' approaches being now promoted by this  administration in the implementation of this bill.   These potential poison-pill amendments would have prevented  competition in our organ donation system, and we felt that competition  was what we needed, instead of the monopolistic approaches that had  existed for decades. And you can imagine these amendments were pushed-- yes--by the same nonprofit monopolies that have called the shots in our  Nation's failed organ donation system for the last 40 years.   So here is where we are within just 3 short months after the passing  of what we thought was real reform. Now, the Health Resources and  Services Administration of HHS, led by Administrator Carole Johnson,  has attempted to restrict competition right out of the gate by  inserting, via contracting process, the very poison pills that Congress  kept out of the law. For example, that Agency announced plans to  install the existing United Network for Organ Sharing board--the one  that has been running the show--as the new, so-called independent  board.   Regarding limiting competition for the board contract, Agency  officials  [[Page S5941]]  told my staff and staff from other congressional offices: the Agency  can place restrictions on any contracts, including the IT contract.   Again, the purpose of this legislation was to create competition, not  stifle it with government restrictions and sweetheart deals. My  bipartisan oversight over the years has shown that the United Network  for Organ Sharing IT system is failing at every level. I have heard  from patient groups and leaders with these very same concerns.   These patient advocacy organizations are rightfully concerned that  HHS, today, is caving to bad actors who have been running our Nation's  organ donation system since 1986. The president of the Global Liver  Institute wrote: I never imagined that industry could so quickly  dictate the terms of the law's implementation.   The National Kidney Foundation wrote that these proposals ``continue  to empower those who have been responsible for the problems that have  plagued the transplant system.''   From what my staff has been told, Health Resources and Services  Administration officials have threatened the very patient groups  writing those letters to me and other Members of Congress. The Health  Resources and Services Administration allegedly told some of these  patient groups to retract their letters of concern and that their  letters were a lie.   All of this is unacceptable--and should be to the 100 Members of this  body who passed this legislation unanimously. I started working to fix  our Nation's corrupt, broken organ donation system way back in 2005.  Since then, more than 200,000 Americans have needlessly died on the  transplant waiting list, disproportionately for people of color and  people of rural America.   Patients and Congress fought for this legislation. Now, HHS, under  this administration, needs to implement this law in the interest of  patients. Patients' lives depend on it--200,000 lives over 40 years  lost because of how this organization has distributed or lost or a  hundred other ways you can say the organ not getting to the patient it  was intended.    Maladministration by the organ network must stop, and it looks to me  like HHS wants to keep it going as it is and prevent and stand in the  way of this important piece of legislation.    I yield the floor.    Madam President, today, I placed a hold on S. 595, the  Rio San Jose and Rio Jemez Water Settlements Act of 2023. The  legislation is not paid for and would violate multiple budget  enforcement rules. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the  bill would increase the deficit by $1.7 billion.                            ____________________
