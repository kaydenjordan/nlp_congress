 Mr. President, today it is my pleasure to honor  Kentwool, an Upstate textile manufacturer that is celebrating its 175th  anniversary this year. Originally founded in Philadelphia in 1843,  Kentwool has since opened a plant, and maintains headquarters, in the  South Carolina Upstate.   Kentwool has had a long history of textile manufacturing in America,  including supplying the Armed Forces in both World Wars. Kentwool has  been a family-owned business for five generations and maintains a  strong emphasis on American-made goods.   Kentwool has been an integral business to the South Carolina Upstate  since it opened a production facility in Pickens County in 1954.  Kentwool currently employs 65 people at its Upstate facility and has  its corporate headquarters in downtown Greenville. They have been a  business that the people of the Upstate and of South Carolina are truly  proud of.   As I share my congratulations with Kentwool, I know this  accomplishment is bittersweet. Just last year, CEO Mark Kent passed  away suddenly, and I know that, while Kentwool celebrates this  milestone, they also commemorate all the hard work and philanthropic  endeavors that Mark accomplished during his time with the company. As  someone who gave back to the Upstate through his interest in preserving  historic structures and philanthropic work, Mark will certainly not be  forgotten and is remembered fondly on this 175th anniversary.   Congratulations, Kentwool.                            ____________________
