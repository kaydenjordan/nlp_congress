 Mr. Speaker, far too many things in life  just aren't fair. However, one thing should, frankly, always be fair,  and that is taxes.   What should always be fair is access to insulin, access to clean  energy, and relief from the raging energy costs that we see across our  country.   This historic Inflation Reduction Act is fully paid for by requiring  the biggest corporations and the ultrawealthy to pay their fair share.  It does so without any new taxes on small businesses or those making  under $400,000. I said ``$400,000.''   We can achieve this goal by strengthening IRS enforcement against  wealthy tax cheats and closing tax loopholes exploited by the  wealthiest few, 150 massive corporations.   In opposing these provisions, my Republican colleagues are, sadly,  aligning themselves with megacorporations and the ultrawealthy and  turning their backs on the American people.   I am proud that, with this bill, Democrats are once again putting  people over politics, fighting for the American people. I urge full  support for this measure.
