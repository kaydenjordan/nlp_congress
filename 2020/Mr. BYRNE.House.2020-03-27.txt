 Mr. Speaker, last week, 3.3 million Americans filed for  unemployment. Small businesses around this country are shuttering.  Millions of Americans and their children are at home practicing social  distancing, a term that few knew 2 weeks ago. Countless others are on  the front lines in our hospitals, doctors' offices, and pharmacies or  simply checking us out at the grocery store.   Yesterday, I spoke to many small businesses in my district on a call.  I was asked to give them hope.   To the American people who are watching: There is hope, and help is  on the way.   There are many things in this bill I do not like. There are portions  that I think are a mistake. But, Mr. Speaker, this is our time for  action. Do not hold this bill up. We owe it to the citizens of this  great country who are struggling. We owe action for them today.
