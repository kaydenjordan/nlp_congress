 Mr. President, I want to talk about transparency, and I  want to talk about the need for transparency here in the U.S. Senate  more than ever.   The House and the Senate are moving with breakneck speed to pass one  of the biggest, most reckless spending social bills in U.S. history,  over $3\1/2\ trillion--a spending spree that will be the largest in a  generation--which will include the largest tax hike that we have seen  in peacetime and something that the majority leader himself has called  the largest transformation in a generation.   Make no mistake. This is trying to transform America--cradle to grave  socialism. Don't take my word for it. Here is the way the New York  Times described this $3\1/2\ trillion reckless spending bill from the  House coming to the Senate. It is legislation that would touch  virtually every American's life from conception to age and infirmity,  from cradle to grave. That is the New York Times. In other words, the  Federal Government will be involved in all facets of every single  American life, from birth to death--one of the biggest  [[Page S6709]]  tax-and-spend programs certainly since President Johnson's Great  Society or President Roosevelt's New Deal.   With that involvement of our government will come higher taxes, taxes  on smaller businesses, taxes on the middle class, and, yes, we believe  our Senate colleagues are planning a tax cut for those who live in the  big cities, known as the ``Blue State Bailout.'' The chairman of the  Budget Committee, who is crafting this bill, Senator Sanders, who has  called himself ``a proud socialist,'' is going to have tax cuts for  millionaires and billionaires in this legislation.   So one would think that a bill of this magnitude, this size, this  transformational an impact on every single American, would be a bill  that the U.S. Senate, the so-called most deliberative body in the  world, would actually hold one hearing on--just one--and would actually  hold a markup or two in the different committees. Right now, our  Democratic colleagues, with no explanation, are not planning on one  hearing or one markup in any committee--none. As, I think, anybody who  knows anything about this body knows, that is unprecedented.   The House rushed, no doubt. They have already marked up this  legislation, way too fast, but, at least, they allowed for amendments.  At least, they debated it.   When Republicans controlled the Congress in 2017, with regard to the  2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which went through reconciliation, we held  numerous hearings in Senate committees. We had markups. We debated  amendments. But for this bill--3\1/2\ trillion--right now, our  colleagues are not going to do any of that.   Of course, the media has given them a free pass. Nothing. The most  deliberative body in the world, the transformational bill of a  generation, the Green New Deal and all the other socialist ideas, and  we are not going to have one hearing, not going to have one markup in  one committee.   What is going on? Well, I would love it if the majority leader or any  other Senate Democrat would come down to the Senate floor and explain  to the American people why. Why aren't we doing that? No transparency?   So I have a theory, because we are not going to hear from the  majority leader or any of my other colleagues. I would love to hear  them.   Come on down. Explain why we are not having one hearing on the  biggest bill in a generation--3\1/2\ trillion.   Here is my theory. There are several reasons why they don't want the  public to see a hearing or a markup relating to this bill.   First and foremost, they don't want to have to defend what is in it.  They don't want the public, who is seeing skyrocketing prices at the  pump, at the grocery store, seeing all the increases in prices across  our country, to see the specifics of a bill that are clearly going to  supercharge more inflation. They don't want to have to defend a bill  that will have the largest tax increase in American history. They don't  want to have to defend a bill or show the American people tax rates on  small businesses that will be bigger than anything in the European  Union or in communist China, or hundreds of billions to bail out health  insurers or $200 million for the Speaker's pet project in the Presidio  Park in San Francisco or $5 billion for an environmental justice tax  credit for universities, whatever the heck that is. Or how about $100  billion for amnesty for 10 million illegal immigrants, making them  eligible for Federal benefits? They don't want to have to defend that.  They don't want to have to debate that. These are just a few core  elements of the bill as we know it. As I mentioned, there are also the  tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires in big cities.   And they don't want to have to talk about the debt ceiling that my  colleagues are trying to raise so they can continue their trillion  dollars of reckless spending. The majority leader just mentioned that.  He doesn't mention what is in the bill, won't have hearings about what  is in the bill, won't have markups for the American people to see.    And on the debt ceiling, you know, just last month, 45 of my Senate  Republican colleagues and I signed a letter, putting our colleagues on  the other side of the aisle on notice that we will not vote to increase  the debt limit if they continued down this reckless path. And the  reason is simple: My Democratic colleagues are content to go it alone  and pass their irresponsible $3\1/2\ trillion socialist spending spree  with no hearings, no markup, no nothing, with just Democratic input,  which is all we have.   Again, when we were going through our budget reconciliation process,  we took amendments, we debated them, and we voted on them. They are not  doing that.   If they are doing this solely by themselves, with no transparency,  then our Democratic friends should be solely responsible for raising  the debt ceiling to accommodate it. They control all branches of the  government. The majority leader clearly knows they could fix that right  now. They are creating their own crisis, and they can solve it.   So, once again, this $3\1/2\ trillion bill is being rushed. What is  another reason? I think they are getting a little nervous that if you  had a markup, say, in the Budget Committee, you would see that the  author of the bill, the chairman of the Budget Committee, is promoting  a socialist agenda that he is proud of because he is actually an avowed  socialist.   Now, I am not trying to insult anyone. This is what he calls himself.   So I think my Democratic colleagues get a little nervous that a bill  authored by a socialist in the Senate would have to be defended. But,  again, no hearings, no markup, and I know a lot of my Democratic  colleagues are uncomfortable with this. They are uncomfortable with the  bill. They are uncomfortable with the lack of transparency, but they  are not calling for transparency. They are saying: Let's just move this  as quickly as possible so nobody in America can see it.   So far, they are being successful, but I think we need to put this  into context. Here is a piece from the Wall Street Journal from last  week, where it talked about putting this rush job on the reckless  spending bill from the majority leader and the Speaker of the House in  historic context. It said:         FDR's New Deal programs were passed incrementally over two       Presidential terms with overwhelming Democratic majorities.       Democrats created the Great Society over two years, with       supermajorities under President Johnson. ObamaCare was hashed       out over nine months before Democrats enacted it into law       with 56 votes in the Senate. The 2017 GOP tax reform bill--       as I just mentioned--       was debated for months, and its principles for years before       Congress voted and marked it up.        Now with merely 50 Democrats in the Senate--  fifty-fifty here--       and a five-Member House majority, Democrats are planning to       rush through the biggest tax and spending increase in half a       century--    With not one hearing in the U.S. Senate, without one markup in any  committee.   There is no mandate for this, but for most of my colleagues, the  quicker the better to move on. Don't look, America. Don't look that the  author of this bill is actually a socialist, because it is socialism.   Now, this rush job is not good for the American people. So here is a  better idea, and it comes from a Senate Democrat, my colleague Senator  Manchin. A couple of weeks ago, he very wisely called for a ``strategic  pause.''   In an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal he said that there is another  reason for a strategic pause.   Now I am quoting Senator Manchin:         We must allow for a complete reporting and analysis of the       implications a multitrillion-dollar bill will have for this       generation and the next. Such a strategic pause will allow       every member of Congress to use the transparent committee       process to debate: What should we fund, and what can we       simply not afford?    That is Senator Manchin. His op-ed also said that amid the inflation  that we are seeing, debt and the inevitability of future crises,  Congress needs to take a strategic pause on this $3\1/2\ trillion  reckless spending spree.   So one of my Democratic colleagues is wisely calling for what we all  know we need here, which is the precedent of this body, the most  deliberative body in the world--a pause, hearings, markups so the  American people can see what is actually in this.   It sounds like that is not going to happen, and I would love it if  any of my Democratic colleagues would come  [[Page S6710]]  to the floor and tell the American people why.   We can and should have debates about our respective visions for our  great country.   No one should be afraid of looking closely at this $3\1/2\ trillion  monstrosity. Let's have a debate about it. Let's debate the massive  increases in taxes, the vast expansion of entitlements, the cradle-to- grave socialism that certain Democrats are proposing for every  individual American's life.   The American people deserve this. My constituents back home in Alaska  certainly would welcome such a debate, but the American people deserve  this.   Why are my colleagues afraid to debate and have hearings and a markup  on this massive legislation? It is the American people's money, after  all, that will pay for this transformational, socialist bill, and it is  their lives that will be impacted and upended if this reckless, rushed  bill becomes law.   So let's do this. Let's hit a strategic pause, as Senator Manchin  asked for.   Let's pry this bill open, hold hearings, and lay out our visions for  our country. Let's have a debate: More taxes or freedom? Socialism  versus market capitalism. Do we want a fundamental transformation, as  the majority leader and the budget chairman have asked for, or do we  want commonsense legislation that helps working men and women in our  country achieve their dreams?   I am hopeful that the majority leader will agree with Senator Manchin  and do what is right for the American people: Hit a pause, hold  hearings, and hold markups before he makes a mockery of the phrase  ``the world's most deliberative body,'' which he is now trying to do  with this rushed and reckless spending bill.                            ____________________     Madam President, the tragic story of 22-year-old Gabby  Petito, whose body was recently found at the Grand Teton National Park  in Wyoming, has captured the attention of our Nation. It is an awful  story that is still playing out. We pray for her parents and her loved  ones, and we hope that they soon will receive justice.   As we watch the story unfold, we empathize with her family and her  friends, and we mourn with them, and we think about how this horrible  crime hurts all of them, their neighbors, our fellow citizens, the  result of such a brutal murder. We think of our daughters and think of  the daughters of others, all of our Nation's daughters. And all of this  reminds some of us of another terrible tragedy in America, and it is  this: Native and indigenous women in America are murdered and sexually  assaulted at rates as high as 10 times the national average. Think  about that. Horrendous.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that  murder is the third leading cause of death among American Indian and  Alaska Native women. However, this issue rarely, if ever, receives much  coverage or awareness. But awareness often results in additional  resources--something that has unfortunately been lacking in our  criminal justice system on this issue, the issue of missing and  murdered indigenous women.   According to the FBI's National Crime Information Center, there are  roughly 1,500 unsolved cases of missing and murdered indigenous women  in America--1,500. Alaska has about 300 of these unsolved cases.  Experts think there are many more such cases that don't make it into  the Federal database.   There has been some progress. Under the previous administration, the  Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Indian Affairs, Tara Sweeney,  who did such a great job, began an initiative throughout the Federal  Government called Operation Lady Justice, the whole point of which was  to bring light to this horrible issue of missing and murdered  indigenous women, to bring justice and hope and closure to their  families. Operation Lady Justice, the task force, has opened up  numerous offices across America, including one in Alaska. Last year, we  in a bipartisan way here in the Senate passed Savanna's Act and the Not  Invisible Act to address the crisis of missing, murdered, and  trafficked indigenous women in our country. Progress is being made, but  we need to continue to keep this issue front and center.   As we pray for the family of Gabby Petito, we also offer our thoughts  and prayers to the families of these missing and murdered indigenous  Americans and commit to continue to focus on all of these issues to  make our country a better place.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
