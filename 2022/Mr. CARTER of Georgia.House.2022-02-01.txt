 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  accomplishments of Doug Weathers, the long-time WTOC Savannah  broadcaster who was recently inducted into the Georgia Association of  Broadcasters Hall of Fame.   Doug has been a titan of Georgia broadcasting since 1962, when he  first began presenting the news.   Starting in 1954 as a film editor, Doug worked his way through  running the projector, operating studio cameras, and helping with  production until he was tapped to host. When it comes to news, Doug  truly is a jack-of-all-trades.   Doug helped WTOC news reach the top of their local ratings and remain  there during his tenure. In 1973, Doug left WTOC for WJCL because they  had the ability to broadcast in color, and he helped springboard them  to number one in the local ratings.   When Doug eventually returned to WTOC, he helped bring their evening  news back to number one, where it remained until his retirement in  2001.   Having worked in every aspect of a television studio, Doug has helped  modernize and popularize local news throughout our State. We are very  grateful for his years of service and congratulate him on this historic  accomplishment.   Congratulations to my friend and my neighbor.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and honor the life of the great  John Lewis.   I am honored to have called Congressman Lewis a colleague and, more  importantly, a friend. Mr. Speaker, I have many fond memories of  serving in Congress, but some of my fondest memories are walking from  the Cannon Building over here to the Capitol with John Lewis. Here I  am, this kid from south Georgia, walking with an icon over here to the  Capitol. And we did it on many occasions. His office was a floor below  mine when I was in the Cannon Building.   I also cherish the time that he invited Members of the Georgia  delegation to his home, and we had dinner that night. He sat and told  us stories, stories of his experiences with Dr. King. I was proud to  call John Lewis my friend.   Like all of us in these Halls, we can say that his wisdom, his  spirit, and his friendship are deeply missed.   But what can you say about John Lewis that hasn't already been said?  He was a giant among men. He fiercely dedicated his life to fighting  for equality and for justice for all.   From his early days fighting segregation in Nashville, to the Freedom  Rides, and to his service in the Halls of Congress, John Lewis  dedicated his life to a more perfect Union.   John Lewis never stopped. And now more than ever, it is encouraging  to be reminded of John's unyielding optimism and faith in the American  Dream.   My hope is that today's bill would, in a small way, continue his  legacy. The bill we are considering today would name Atlanta's central  postal facility after this American hero. It is only appropriate to do  so for a city shaped so much by Mr. Lewis.   What is more, Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if you have looked at the  number of cosponsors on this bill. If you count, this bill has an  incredible 341 cosponsors as of this morning. By my estimates, that  makes it the most bipartisan bill that Congress has considered. And  that is telling of John Lewis' legacy.   I should note that this legislation has the support of Congressman  Lewis' family, the John and Lillian Miles  [[Page H314]]  Lewis Foundation, as well as local Atlanta officials.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Nikema Williams, who now  represents Mr. Lewis' old district in Atlanta, for sponsoring this  effort.    As a Georgian, as a colleague, and as a friend, I am especially  honored to support this legislation and urge all of my colleagues to do  the same.
