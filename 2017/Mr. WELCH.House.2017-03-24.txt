 Mr. Speaker, those of us who support the Affordable Care  Act know that the work of improving health care and making it more  affordable and accessible is never done. It matters. It really matters  to the mothers and fathers we represent and to the children that they  love. But this bill, stripping 24 million Americans of health care, a  $1 trillion tax cut to the wealthiest among us, making people 50 to 64  pay five times as much as other Americans, obviously, is a giant step  backwards.   One of those Americans is Linda from Burlington. She left an abusive  marriage, but had to leave her health care behind. The Affordable Care  Act rescued her, and she has gone on to revive her life and her future.                                time  1315    Our community hospitals that do so much good in our communities have  gone from red ink to black ink by the help that the Medicare expansion  provided.   It is a sad day for this institution. We did all of this without  hearing from a single patient, a single doctor, a single person. We had  no hearings.   Mr. Speaker, can we do better than that?
