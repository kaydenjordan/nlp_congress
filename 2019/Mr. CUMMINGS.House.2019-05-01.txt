 Mr. Speaker, I know that Representative Joyce Beatty  would join me today in what I am about to say.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a great American and a distinguished man  of God, the Reverend Dr. Charles E. Booth. Dr. Booth transitioned from  this earthly plain on Saturday, March 23, 2019, after a valiant battle  with cancer.   Dr. Booth's life and mine moved along many of the same paths. Through  those shared experiences, we developed a deep personal bond.   He was born in my hometown of Baltimore, Maryland, on February 4,  1947, to Hazel Willis Booth and William W. Booth. He attended the same  high school as I did, Baltimore City College High School in Baltimore.  We also attended the same college, Howard University.   Dr. Booth went on to earn a master's of divinity degree from Eastern  Theological Seminary in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He then earned a  doctorate of ministry degree from United Theological Seminary in  Dayton, Ohio.   As a testament to his commitment to Christian education, Dr. Booth  served as a member of the board of trustees of that institution from  2011 until his recent passing.   At the age of 23, Dr. Booth pastored his first church, St. Paul's  Baptist Church in West Chester, Pennsylvania. In 1978, he became pastor  of Mount Olivet Baptist Church in Columbus, Ohio, where he remained the  faithful leader for 41 years.   Dr. Booth proudly made Columbus his home, but he never forgot his  roots. He visited Baltimore often to preach at various churches and  spend time with family and friends. In fact, he preached revival  services each year in my own church, the New Psalmist Baptist Church,  where Dr. Bishop Walter Scott Thomas, Sr., is the pastor. When I was  not in Washington, I was at church to listen to his prolific sermons.   As the son of two preachers, I understand the power of the preached  word, and Dr. Booth could deliver like none other. They often called  him a preaching machine. He had a commanding presence in the pulpit  with his towering stature and baritone voice. He studied the Bible  voraciously and had the uncanny ability to make Biblical text relevant  to the issues we face today in our daily lives. At a time when people  are turning away from traditional religion, Dr. Booth made Christianity  accessible and inspired people to deepen their faith.   Dr. Booth was a pastor's pastor. He traveled the world to preach the  gospel, and he was tremendously respected by his peers. He found joy in  mentoring young preachers and made time to listen to their concerns and  offer his counsel.   In 2011, Dr. Booth founded the Charles E. Booth Preaching Conference,  which focuses on the tenets of keeping passion in one's preaching,  Christ-centered preaching in contemporary life, building relationships  with preachers, strengthening the preacher's devotional life, and  remaining true to the sermonic ingredients of information and  inspiration.   Education was central to Dr. Booth's life. Not only was he  continually learning, but he also encouraged others to use education as  a key to open doors of opportunity. In 1994, he founded the Gloria S.  Friend Academy, a fully accredited elementary school at his church that  emphasized academic excellence and cultural enrichment centered on  African American history. Dr. Booth also authored several books focused  on Christian education.   A pillar in his community, Dr. Booth used his position as a faith  leader to be a strong voice for the voiceless. He worked tirelessly to  help create solutions to issues such as poverty, homelessness,  unemployment, and access to quality healthcare.    As I mourn the loss of my friend, I am comforted by the inspiring  legacy he leaves for all of us. In the New Testament book of Titus, the  Apostle Paul writes: ``Show yourself in all respects to be a model of  good works, and in your teaching show integrity, dignity, and sound  speech.''   Dr. Booth lived this creed. Through his example, he encouraged  everyone he encountered to do the same.   He leaves to mourn his wonderful wife, Crystal. He was a tremendous  blessing to his family, his church, his Nation, and, indeed, the world.   He will be sorely missed, but we give great thanks that God allowed  our lives to eclipse with his.                            ____________________
