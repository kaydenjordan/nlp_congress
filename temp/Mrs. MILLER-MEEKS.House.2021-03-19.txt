 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a local  hero in my hometown of Ottumwa, Iowa.   This coming Wednesday, March 24, Mary Margaret Butler of Ottumwa will  be recognized as a 2021 Hero of the Heartland by the American Red  Cross.   Mary Margaret is being recognized for founding Whatsoever You Do,  Inc., a nonprofit that has worked tirelessly on creating shelters for  the homeless in southeastern Iowa. For years now, Whatsoever You Do has  helped hundreds with basic needs such as, food, clothing, and housing.   Across the country, the Red Cross works every day through programs  and services related to disaster relief, the military, health and  safety, and helping the homeless. The Hero of the Heartland award  recognizes outstanding individuals who demonstrate courage, compassion,  selflessness, and work to better help their neighbors and communities.   I am proud to not only represent Mary Margaret Butler in Congress,  but proud to call her a neighbor. Thank you, Mary Margaret, for making  Ottumwa a better place to live.   Additionally, I would like to wish a happy birthday to two other  amazing women of integrity, selflessness, compassion, and courage, my  chief of staff, Tracie Gibler, and my daughter, Taylor Miller-Meeks.                            ____________________
