 Madam Speaker, May 4 marked 2 years since  House Republicans passed their TrumpCare legislation to dismantle the  Affordable Care Act. If passed, this reckless bill would have ripped  away healthcare from millions. Thanks to Americans' tireless activism,  this bill did not become law. But that wasn't the end of the crusade to  protect our care.   This administration continues to sabotage the Affordable Care Act,  implementing rules and gutting programs in a very cruel conspiracy to  undermine it; and people with preexisting conditions are some of the  most vulnerable in a very dangerous game.   Madam Speaker, the Affordable Care Act, with its strong protections,  helped many of these Americans obtain health insurance for the very  first time. But now, this administration is using a back-door guidance  to allow junk insurance plans the ability to deny coverage to people  with preexisting conditions.   That is why I am glad the House plans to vote on H.R. 986, which will  stop this move and protect Americans living with preexisting  conditions.   I will proudly vote for this bill.                            ____________________
