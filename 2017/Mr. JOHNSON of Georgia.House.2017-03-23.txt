 Mr. Speaker, today the Republicans are doing  something that goes against what was promised in the campaign, and that  was that everyone would have insurance, the insurance would be better,  and it would cost less. But, instead, we are going in the opposite  direction. Less people are going to have insurance; 24 million are  being kicked off. It is going to cost more for the insurance, and you  are going to get less insurance coverage than what you are paying for.  It is a total disaster what they are trying to do here.   Today, they are going to meet with the Freedom Caucus at 11:30, I  understand, over at the White House. So the bill is going to get worse.  Can you imagine that?   If you have got fooled the first time, don't get fooled again. If  someone tells you something that you know is not true or that you  thought was true and you find out it is not true, don't fall for it  again, Members. It is time for change in America.
