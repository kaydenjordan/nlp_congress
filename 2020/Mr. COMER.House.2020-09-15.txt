 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage this body to keep  Casey County, Kentucky, in your thoughts and prayers.   On Sunday, the community experienced flooding that impacted multiple  businesses, roads and homes in the area.   This is not the first time the community has experienced flood  waters, with the ``great flood'' that occurred in 2010. The community  came together during that flood, and I know they will once again unite  to tackle this tremendous challenge.   Casey County is a resilient community where people look out for each  other and help their neighbors in times of need. As they continue to  weather this challenge, I would like to encourage anyone in or around  Casey County to reach out to my office for any assistance they may need  moving forward.                            Honoring Tommy Willett     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize my dear friend, political  teacher, community leader, and statesman, Tommy Willett, who passed  away on September 8.   Tommy served as my Monroe County Judge/Executive from 2011 to 2018.  Under his steady leadership, Monroe County saw unique and unprecedented  cooperation among various elected officials, which was clearly  reflected in his running unopposed for reelection on 2014.   I knew Tommy Willett my entire life. He owned Pure Drug Pharmacy in  Tompkinsville and was always active in the world-famous Monroe County  political scene. As a young, aspiring candidate for public office,  Tommy took me under his wing and taught me so much about grass-roots  organization, political strategy, and get-out-to-vote techniques.   Tommy's beloved wife, Elizabeth Young Willett, preceded him in death.  Ms. Willett was my high school English teacher, and one of the best  ever at Monroe County High School. Tommy is survived by his two, fine  sons, James and Scott Willett.   Judge Willett lived a life of public service and professional  achievement. He was a true Monroe County success story who will be  deeply missed.                       Honoring Dr. Leann Dalton Cooper     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Leann Dalton  Cooper, who has been selected by the Kentucky Family Medicine as the  State's top, young doctor. She is a native of Russell County and a  graduate of the University of Kentucky College of Medicine. For the  past 3 years, she has practiced medicine in Russell County. Dr. Cooper  will receive the award at a ceremony in Louisville on September 25.   Mr. Speaker, I join with everyone in Russell County and throughout  the Commonwealth in honoring her on this outstanding statewide  achievement.                           Honoring Senior Centers     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the valuable services  that our senior centers in Kentucky are providing for senior citizens  throughout the First Congressional District.   Along with essential workers, senior centers have provided crucial  services to our elderly populations during the COVID-19 pandemic.   As the country has learned to adapt to different times, senior  centers have also modified their services. For instance, the Union  County Senior Services organization had to cancel potlucks, exercise  classes, and bingo sessions. While those in-person activities were  unfortunately suspended, the dedicated servants who make up this  organization dramatically increased options for home delivery and meal  pickup for area residents.   In addition to providing meals, the Union County Senior Services also  distributes food grocery items for the senior citizens. Just recently,  they even hit a tremendous milestone of 15,000 meals prepared since the  beginning of the pandemic. Their tremendous contributions have been  replicated in the entire region, showing that Kentuckians truly have  each other's backs during times of need.   As a lead Republican cosponsor of the Supporting Older Americans Act  of 2020, I understand the critical services  [[Page H4386]]  senior centers provide for the elderly. I stand today to recognize all  the hard work and dedications these centers provide throughout the  First District of Kentucky.                            ____________________
