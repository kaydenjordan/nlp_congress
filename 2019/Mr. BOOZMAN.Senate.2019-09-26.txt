 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of Dr. Milo J. Shult, whose steady hand led the University of  Arkansas System's Division of Agriculture for 18 years. Milo passed  away on July 19, 2019.   Dr. Milo Shult was originally from Keokuk, IA, and after graduating  with his Ph.d. from Iowa State University, started his career in  agriculture for the Texas A&M University System. In 1992, he became the  University of Arkansas System's vice president for agriculture, a  position he held for 18 years. Throughout his tenure, Milo transformed  the Division of Agriculture to enhance its research and extension  capabilities to become one of the finest in the Nation.   Throughout his 38-year career in public agricultural research and  extension, Milo was a dedicated advocate for agriculture. He served on  several local, State and national committees, including the Council for  Agricultural Research, Extension and Teaching, CARET; Arkansas  Agriculture Board; as chairman of the board for the National  Agricultural Research, Extension, Education and Economics, NAREEE; and  chair of the Winthrop Rockefeller Institute. In 2011, Milo was inducted  into the Arkansas Agriculture Hall of Fame.   The impact of his career and leadership are once again being  acknowledged as the division is commemorating Milo's years of service  by renaming the Arkansas Agricultural Research & Extension Center in  his honor. Starting on its 100th anniversary, ``The Farm,'' as it is  known in Fayetteville, will now be called the Milo J. Shult  Agricultural Research & Extension Center.   Milo Shult left a mark on the University of Arkansas System and our  State's agriculture community that no one will soon forget. I am proud  that this is one more piece of Milo's legacy that will live on at the  Division of Agriculture, and I hope that future leaders will follow his  remarkable example.                            ____________________
