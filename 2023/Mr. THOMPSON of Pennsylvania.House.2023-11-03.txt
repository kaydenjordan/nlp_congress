 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Travis Crate for being named the 2023  [[Page H5396]]  Harbor Freight Tools for Schools Prize For Teaching Excellence.   Mr. Crate is one of 25 public high school skilled trade teachers  across the country to receive this award. He has been a welding  instructor at Venango Technology Center for more than 25 years.   This prize was created to recognize high school skilled trade  teachers for their work to inspire the next generation.   Mr. Crate's welding program is dynamic and collaborative,  incorporating industry-based skills to prepare students for life beyond  high school. As students progress through Crate's program, they have  the opportunity to mentor first-year students, providing one-on-one  instruction that reinforces their learning and helps beginner students  grasp welding more easily.   Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the bipartisan Career and Technical  Education Caucus, I applaud the work of Mr. Crate and other CTE  teachers who continue to help students find their passions.   Congratulations, Mr. Crate, on this remarkable recognition.                            ____________________
