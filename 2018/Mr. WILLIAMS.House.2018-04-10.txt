 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mark Johnson, a  fellow Texan, a former marine, a father and a grandfather.   On March 17 and 18, Mark completed a double Ironman race across the  State of Texas.   A double Ironman is a 53.2-mile run, 4.8-mile swim, and 224-mile bike  ride. He began in Marble Falls in my district and ended in Lufkin,  Texas.   When asked why he chose to attempt the event, he answered swiftly:  ``For Wendy, my amazing sister who has Down syndrome.''   In addition to honoring his sister and raising awareness, Mark  Johnson has pledged all monetary donations to the National Down  Syndrome Society. This is the leading human rights organization for all  individuals with Down syndrome and where he sits on the board of  directors.   Today and every day, let us celebrate advocates like Mark, his  sister, Wendy, and all individuals with Down syndrome and their  families.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
