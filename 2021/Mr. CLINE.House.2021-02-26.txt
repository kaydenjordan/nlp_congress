 Madam Speaker, we all want to beat this virus, but you  can't beat a COVID pandemic with 91 percent pork barrel spending in the  bill. Only 9 percent of the funding in this bill is going to COVID  programs.   $1,400 checks at what cost? $13,000 per taxpayer?   If we have any additional relief we need to pass for addressing  COVID, it must be targeted, temporary, and tied to the pandemic.   What is not targeted?   $350 billion in State and local bailouts that reward States that  continue to shut down their economies.   What is not temporary?   A $1.5 million bridge to Canada or $112 million for an underground  subway to Silicon Valley.   What is not tied to COVID?   $86 billion to bail out the multiemployer pension plans that were  poorly managed in Democrat-run States before the pandemic even started,  $50 million in taxpayer dollars for abortion on demand.   This liberal wish list masquerading as COVID relief will cripple our  economy, harm our ability to reopen our Nation, and burden our children  and grandchildren with unsustainable levels of debt.   Madam Speaker, I strongly oppose this spending package, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.
