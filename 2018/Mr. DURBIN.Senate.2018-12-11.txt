 Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in thanking  our friend, Senator Joe Donnelly, for his service to his State and our  Nation.   When he was about 30 years old, while he was practicing law in South  Bend, Joe Donnelly sought the Democratic nomination for attorney  general in Indiana. Two years later, he ran for State senate. Both  times, he lost.   Then he did something truly astonishing: He walked away from  politics. For 10 years, he practiced law and ran a small stamp-and-ink  business.   In 2003, local party officials asked him to run for Congress. They  didn't expect him to win--just be a respectable sacrificial lamb.   He came closer to winning than anyone but he expected.   Two years later, he was elected, in a rematch, to the U.S. House.   As someone who also ran and lost three times before winning an  election, I feel a natural camaraderie with my friend from Indiana.   I think I may also have some insight into why he was willing to try  one more time.   You see, Joe Donnelly grew up in New York. He moved to South Bend for  college, and he is a Hoosier, through-and-through, but he is also a  member of the great White Sox Nation.   In 2005, the Chicago White Sox won the World Series for the first  time in 88 years--proof, some would say, that anything is possible if  you persevere and work hard.   The next year, it was Joe Donnelly's turn to score the upset victory  by winning election to Congress from a red district in a deep-red  State.   In his 6 years in the House, he voted to create the Affordable Care  Act.   During the financial crisis of 2009, he voted for the American  Recovery Act, to stop America's slide into a second great depression  that could have brought down the entire global economy.   When free market hardliners said, ``Save Wall Street but let the  American auto industry die,'' Barack Obama said no--and so did Joe.   In November 2012, Hoosier voters sent Joe Donnelly to the U.S.  Senate, the first Democrat to hold his seat since 1977.   In a political era that often seems often to reward snark over  substance, Joe Donnelly is a soft-spoken throwback to an earlier era,  when working across the aisle was viewed as a talent, not as treason.   Joe is decent, honest, and direct. You may disagree with him on an  issue, but you will never doubt his motives.   His values are classic Hoosier: hard work, common sense, bipartisan  compromise, and a disdain for grandstanding.   As a Senator, he has done what he believes is needed to level the  playing field for ``regular Joes,'' for farmers and factory workers  and, as he says, ``the people who go to work in the dark and come home  in the dark.''   I particularly want to thank him for his work to improve mental  health care for military members and veterans. That work will save  lives and families.   Like all nations, the White Sox Nation has some laws. One of my  favorites is: ``Respect the past . . . people that are shoeless . . .  and anyone named Joe.''  [[Page S7425]]    That last edict is a reference to one of the legends of White Sox  history, Shoeless Joe Jackson, but it applies equally to our friend and  colleague, Senator Joe Donnelly, who has served his State and our  Nation well and earned our great respect.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I join my colleagues in thanking Senator  Heidi Heitkamp for her service to her State and our Nation.   I remember one of the first conversations Senator Heitkamp and I had  after she joined the Senate. I told her: ``I would really like your  support on a bill to help the kinds of mom-and-pop stores that are the  heart of so many small towns in your state and mine.''   I was about to give her my ``elevator pitch'' on the Marketplace  Fairness Act. It wasn't necessary.   Heidi said: ``Uhm, Dick, you know the 1992 U.S. Supreme Court  decision that makes the Marketplace Fairness Act necessary. I'm the  petitioner in the case. `Quill v. North Dakota?' That's me. I was the  North Dakota tax commissioner who started that lawsuit.''   As I was quick to learn, helping Main Street, mom-and-pop stores stay  in business in the age of Amazon is just one of many causes that Heidi  Heitkamp had been working on, tenaciously, for years before she was  elected to this Senate.   Heidi Heitkamp came to Washington with a to-do list. She worked  doggedly, with Democrats and Republicans, to whittle down that list.   It was clear from the day she arrived here that she meant to use her  new position as a U.S. Senator to right as many old wrongs and fix as  many intractable problems as she could.   She leaves knowing that she made a difference in the lives of  countless people, in North Dakota and far beyond.   She has been a champion for Native Americans, whose voices are so  rarely heard in the halls of power.   The first bill she sponsored in the Senate created a new and long  overdue Commission on Native Children, to try to rectify the conditions  that cause one-in-three Native American and Alaska Native children to  live in poverty, with suicide rates 2.5 times the national average.   Like so much of her work here, that was a bipartisan effort. Her  partner in that case was Lisa Murkowski.   When the Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized in 2013, it was  Heidi Heitkamp who pushed successfully to close a loophole that allowed  non-Indians who commit sexual assaults on Indian Reservations--very  often--to go unpunished.   Her commitment to ``make a better future'' for Native children--and  all children--is what motivated Heidi to become my partner on a bill to  increase and improve the treatment of childhood trauma, the root of so  much suffering and violence.   We are proud that our trauma bill was included in the new law to  combat the opioid epidemic. It will save lives.   Heidi has said that her proudest achievement as a U.S. Senator was  when she was able to help a Korean war veteran receive the Purple Heart  and other medals.   The man, Corporal Andy Shaw, was a Native American elder who had  served in World War II, was wounded in a gunfight in South Korea at the  start of that conflict, and spent nearly the entire Korean war as a  POW, but never received the thanks or medals he should have.   After 60 years, Heidi Heitkamp was able to right that wrong.   She and her staff tracked down the facts needed to document Corporal  Shaw's heroism and sacrifice, and she travelled to the Spirit Lake  Sioux Reservation in North Dakota to present Corporal Shaw's medals to  him personally.   Andy Shaw has a little trouble standing now, but he stood proud and  straight as his Senator presented his Purple Heart.   Heidi cried because she knew how much he had sacrificed for that  medal and what it meant to him.   That is who Heidi Heitkamp is: a woman who uses her power to help the  underdog.   I wish she were not leaving so soon.   She has been a force for progress, a friend, and a leader for whom I  have great respect.   I know that she has a lot of grit and determination still in her, and  I look forward to seeing what her next chapter will bring.                            ____________________
