 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, and still I rise.  [[Page H6729]]    I rise today, as always, when I address persons in this most sacred  place in my heart. I rise as a proud American. I am proud to say that I  am an American. I am proud to say that I am American because my  foreparents made it what it is. Its greatness can be traced back to 240  years of free labor, free sacrifice, and I am proud.   I wear this tie indicating that I am proud. I salute the flag. I say  the Pledge of Allegiance. I sing the national anthem.   I am proud to be an American, and why wouldn't I be proud, given that  my foreparents made it great. The greatness of America resides today on  the economic foundations laid by persons of African ancestry. They are  the economic foundational mothers and fathers of this country.   Now, there are some who say to me, literally: How can you be proud,  Al Green, when your foreparents were put into chains, when they were  beaten, when women were raped, when they were born into slavery and  lived their lives as slaves? How can you be proud?   I can be proud because I have the power to forgive, the power to  forgive for all of these transgressions. God has given me this power. I  would hope that others could acquire the power to forgive. The power to  forgive is the power that will allow you to go on to do other things.   God did not give me, however, the power to forget. Forgive and forget  is not a sensible statement of where the heart and mind should be, in  my opinion. It is forgive and remember. Forgive all the transgressions,  but remember that they occurred. This is why we can say ``never again''  as it relates to certain transgressions.   So, I forgive, and I love the country, but I don't forget.   Today, I want to talk about my foreparents. This is a depiction of  when they may have arrived, on August 20, 1619. I want to talk about  them, and I want to talk about the racism in America today.   As we discuss racism in America today, we have to first identify the  reasons why Africans were enslaved, the reasons why America enslaved  Africans, to be more specific.   Remember, I am the guy who is forgiving. I am the guy who loves the  country, sings the national anthem, but he doesn't forget.   Why did America enslave Africans? Here is why: To be a permanent--I  think 240 years of enslavement is a pretty good representation of the  fact that there was an intentionality that it be permanent--to be a  permanent, identifiable--``identifiable,'' easily recognized among the  population; ``permanent,'' 240 years of enslavement; ``identifiable,''  the complexion of skin as a methodology by which one could be  immediately identified and put in his proper place or her proper place,  their proper place.   Permanent, identifiable, powerless.   There was never the desire to have persons of African ancestry become  powerful in this country. It was not there. I am talking about at the  genesis of this on August 20, 1619, when they were first introduced  into the Colonies. There was slavery in the country prior to this, but  we are talking about when it was introduced into the Colonies.   Africans were brought here to be a permanent, identifiable,  powerless--no power. The courts in this country actually recognized the  fact that we were powerless. In Dred Scott, the Chief Justice indicated  that persons of African ancestry had no rights that a White person had  to respect. It was not said in those exact words, but that is the exact  meaning. They had no rights.    Permanent, identifiable, powerless, subservient.   They were brought here to be servants--not just servants in the sense  of people who were to do the bidding of others but to do so with a  degree and a demeanor of servility. They had to be servile--servile.   Africans were brought here to be a permanent, identifiable,  powerless, subservient caste--not class; there is a distinction. Class  has to do with a socioeconomic identification. Caste has to do with a  hereditary identification, meaning if you were born into this caste,  this group, you were to be a slave. You were enslaved by birth.   By definition, at birth, you were enslaved. You were permanently  enslaved. You were identifiably enslaved. You were powerless as a  slave. You were subservient as a slave and forever a slave as long as  you lived.   These are the reasons why America enslaved Africans to be a  permanent, identifiable, powerless, subservient caste of people.   To this day, much of this still exists. To this day, there are still  people who treat persons of African ancestry as though they are still  powerless and should be subservient and belong to this caste.   When Dr. King went to India on his pilgrimage, he was introduced at a  certain venue. When he was introduced, it was said to him that he was  part of a caste. Initially, he didn't really, in my opinion, know  exactly how to respond to this because he had not been told that he was  a part of a caste. After giving some thought to it, he realized that,  to a certain extent, there was this caste system.   To this day, there is still evidence of people who believe that we  should be powerless. Let's examine that. Obviously, we are still  identifiable, but that we should still be powerless.                                time  1130    We still have problems accessing the capital that allows one to  succeed in society. We have evidence, empirical evidence, indicating,  evidencing, the fact that persons of African ancestry, who are  imminently qualified, can apply for a loan and they will pay higher  points for that loan, they will receive less sometimes than what they  need, and they will pay a higher interest rate than an Anglo who is  less qualified.   Empirical evidence. I sit on the Financial Services Committee. We  have looked into these things. The empirical evidence exists. Still a  desire, but powerless.   Now, some people will say, are you saying that there is a conspiracy?  I don't think anybody had a grand meeting and decided we will just  continue this caste system by making sure they remain powerless in  society. I don't think that happened. I think it has been inculcated  into the culture. The 240 years of slavery, thereafter followed with  Black codes, convict leasing, Jim Crow laws, thereafter followed with  lawful and legal segregation.   There was lawful and legal segregation until 1954, the Brown case. It  hasn't been that long ago. In my lifetime, I suffered lawful, legal  segregation. Thank God I have the power to forgive.   Powerless, intentionality, powerless, in the culture. It is not going  to be eradicated overnight. One court decision will not eliminate 240  years of slavery plus an additional great number of years of lawful  segregation. It doesn't eliminate it.   Many of the people who suffer from this affliction, they don't know  it in the sense that they purposefully do these things, but they  happen. There was 240 years of slavery, thereafter followed with lawful  segregation, and now we still suffer as powerless people.   I am going to say more about powerless, but I want to just remind  persons that we still are born Black in America, still have the  identifiable complexion. There are still people who expect us to be  subservient, to be more respectful than others.   I have seen it myself wherein an Anglo person can say to a police  officer that he or she or they happen to think is doing something  inappropriate: ``Who do you think you are? Give me your badge number. I  am going to report you.'' The officer accepts it. If an African  American says: ``Who are you? Who do you think you are?'' It is  unacceptable. There is a belief that you cannot challenge the system to  the same extent as Anglos, all emanating from the permanent,  identifiable, powerless, subservient caste.   Now, let's give a supreme, superb example of being powerless. I think  this example will speak in ways that many of us have not given  consideration to. I regret to have to bring this example to the  attention of the House of Representatives, to the attention of the  country, to the attention of the Senate, but here is the example.   This building is the Russell Senate Office Building. This building is  a symbol of national shame, the Russell Senate Office Building.  Taxpayer dollars built it. Taxpayer dollars maintain it. Every taxpayer  in this country has a stake in the Russell Senate Office Building, and  it is a symbol of national shame.  [[Page H6730]]    I am talking about racism in America now, how we learn to tolerate  it. Remember this: Those who tolerate racism perpetuate racism.   Let's talk about the Russell Senate Office Building, named in honor  of a self-proclaimed white supremacist. This is brother Richard  Russell, Senator. I refer to every man as my brother. If not my  brother, according to the notable anthropologist, paleontologist,  L.S.B. Leakey, we are probably cousins. We are probably related in some  way.   This is Mr. Richard Russell. Mr. Richard Russell is prominently  displayed in this building. When you enter this building, you enter  into a rotunda. This is where Mr. Richard Russell is prominently  displayed in the Russell Senate Office Building.   You will note at the top, we have styled this, we have captioned it,  ``self-proclaimed white supremacist.'' This is Mr. Richard Russell,  self-proclaimed white supremacist.   This building is named in honor of Mr. Richard Russell, this man, the  self-proclaimed white supremacist. He stands there today in the rotunda  of the Richard Russell Office Building.   Now, why would I make an issue of this for you in talking about  racism and enslavement? Well, here is why. Powerless. Remember,  powerless. This is the building.   Powerless. We, the people of African ancestry, are powerless to  remove this man's statue and to remove his name from a building we  support. We are powerless. We can't get it done.   The Senate knows that Richard Russell was a bigot and a racist. They  probably see him more as a racist than as a bigot, but he was the  person who fought antilynching legislation. He is the person who fought  civil rights legislation. He is the person who coauthored the  ``Southern Manifesto,'' and he is the person who stands in the rotunda  all to himself in the Russell Senate Office Building.   Yes, we have asked that his name be removed from the building and  that his statue be removed. Just as the Senate has removed names from  military bases, the Congress has, the House and Senate, the Senate can  remove that name of Richard Russell. This is Richard Russell standing  in his place of grandeur.   There is more to be said about this. I would now like you to see a  different view of the Russell statue. Your perch can sometimes  influence what you see. I have shown you Mr. Russell up close. Now  let's step back and take a look.   Here is Mr. Russell. He is standing here. By the way, I respect and I  say ``Mr. Russell.'' There are people who would demean me for saying  ``Mr. Russell.'' He was a former United States Senator. He was a bigot  and a racist, but I still give him respect   Here is Mr. Russell. Now, let's put this here for just a moment.  There is Mr. Russell. He is here. I hope the camera can pick him up.   Here is what you cannot identify that I have to identify for you.  Above Mr. Russell, in the Russell Senate Office Building, above Mr.  Russell, in these various spaces along this area in the Russell Senate  Office Building, are news outlets, major news outlets. CNN is there.  MSNBC is there. Major news outlets occupy the space above Mr. Richard  Russell.   Who can deny that they are aware that they are sharing space with a  self-proclaimed white supremacist? Have they no shame? CNN, have you no  shame? You fight against hate, and you house yourself above Richard  Russell. Have you no shame, MSNBC? Have you no shame?   The man's name shouldn't be on the building. His statue shouldn't be  on the building, and you ought not be housed above it. The Richard  Russell Office Building, with Senator Russell in all of his glory,  above his head, notable news sources reporting the news, not reporting  that Richard Russell is right beneath them, the racist.   Remember now, those who tolerate racism perpetuate racism. All of  these news sources I just mentioned--FOX is there, too. All of them,  they are there. If one of them that I have called is not there, let me  know. I don't go over there. I haven't been over there. I am a one- person protest. I don't go in the building. I respect myself too much  to go there. I have dignity. I have respect for myself. I am a sinner,  but I am not that much of a sinner.   Those who tolerate this perpetuate it. Those who tolerate this statue  being there perpetuate it. I am saying it. CNN is perpetuating racism.  MSNBC, you are perpetuating racism. FOX, you are perpetuating racism. I  am saying it. I know that I am powerless to do anything to you about  it. You can stay there as long as you desire, never report it, and it  becomes a nonissue. You can stay there, and the world will remain as it  is. There will just be one Member of Congress who came to the floor of  the House of Representatives and had the courage to call you out.   I know you won't get any airtime on CNN or MSNBC or FOX. You can't  challenge the news media and tell them where they are wrong and expect  them to allow you to be heard. It doesn't work that way in this country  and probably in very few countries in the world. You can't do it. I  understand that.   I understand that I am powerless, but I also understand that I can  take a stand. I also understand that I can point out to people that  yes, you can challenge power. Yes, you can be that person who speaks  truth to power. Yes, you can do it. Here is what is even more important  than to speaking truth to power; that is speaking truth about power.   You see, to speak truth to power, you simply say: Power, we have a  problem, and we need to solve it.                                time  1145    When you speak truth about power, you say: Power, CNN, MSNBC, FOX, we  have a problem, and you are part of it. They are part of the problem.  There are others up there with them, but they are part of the problem.   Richard Russell, a self-proclaimed white supremacist, in a rotunda  all to himself. I know of no other rotunda that has a single person in  it--if there may be one. There you are housing yourselves above him.   If I am wrong, let me know I am wrong and I will come back to this  very podium and I will extend an apology. I will do it. When you are  wrong, that is what you do. I will come back and I will extend an  apology.   I ask you, CNN, I ask you, MSNBC, I ask you, FOX, tell me I am wrong  that you are not reporting from above Richard Russell.   I am talking about racism in America. I am talking about those who  tolerate it and perpetuate it. I am now going to talk about solutions.  There are many solutions. Please don't take this as all inclusive, but  this is a necessary solution. A necessary solution to, as a matter of  necessity, deal with how this has been inculcated into society such  that these prominent news sources would tolerate this.   There are some things that have to be done. They could be very  beneficial in getting it done. If they are tolerating this, I don't  know to what extent we can count on them. Here is what we have to do.  One of the things we have to do is acknowledge the conscience agenda.   Let me remove Mr. Russell for a moment. He still maintains his place  of honor in the Senate, but not here while I am talking. Now, we have  to acknowledge this conscience agenda.   Conscience agenda, our moral imperative. Here is what we have to do.  We have to acknowledge slavery and the horrors of it, but also set  aside a day. By the way, I am not asking for a holiday with people  being paid and off from work. I don't want that. I don't think that we  should have that for something as important as this.   I don't want it to become something where people are going to have a  mattress sale and talk about how you can get a great discount. Slavery  Remembrance Day discount, come on in and get your mattress. I don't  want that.   I want people to understand that August 20, annually, ought to be  Slavery Remembrance Day. I thank God that at least one prominent person  has acknowledged it, and there are others that I will mention briefly.  Perhaps I will reverse the order and do it this way.   Mr. Steny Hoyer helped me to get legislation through the House  recognizing Slavery Remembrance Day. I thank Mr. Hoyer and I will never  let history write him out. I thank him for what he did. Slavery  Remembrance Day is important.   We have Juneteenth. Yes, Juneteenth is about celebrating freedom,  when General Gordon Granger came into Galveston, Texas, and read  ``General  [[Page H6731]]  Order No. 3.'' That is worthy of celebrating; this is about  commemoration, not celebration. This is about commemorating those lives  that suffered for some 240 years to make America great. There were 240  years of suffering. They were born into it, into a caste system.   They were born into it. Babies were slaves. Enslaved people is a more  appropriate way to say it. Babies were enslaved human beings that grew  up to become enslaved adolescents. They went on to become enslaved  adults and thereafter died as enslaved human beings. Lives devoted to  making America great.   No emolument has been accorded them. No recompense has been accorded  them. No consideration other than they had the necessities to remain  alive so that they could continue to be enslaved persons who could  produce a work product. We should honor this day.   I am proud of Senator Elizabeth Warren who has helped to get this  done, and she is working on the Senate to get the resolution through  the Senate. The same Senate, by the way, that won't remove Richard  Russell's name from the Russell Senate Office Building. That is the  same Senate that won't remove his statue from the rotunda that he  happens to enjoy all to himself.   We have to have Slavery Remembrance Day. We should honor these  economic foundational mothers and fathers on whose sacrifice America  has become the great Nation that it is. They built the Capitol. Yes,  these folks, their hands helped to construct the very Capitol that we  have here. They helped to construct the White House. They built the  roads and the bridges. They planted the seeds and harvested the crops  to feed the Nation. Yet, they are not properly recognized.   In fact, this Congress did something that demeaned them. Here is what  the Congress did in 1956. The Congress of the United States of America,  the country I love, land of the free and home of the brave, the  Congress of the United States of America awarded Congressional Gold  Medals to the enslavers. They awarded Congressional Gold Medals to  Confederate soldiers. They awarded nothing to the people whose hands  helped build the Capitol. Nothing to them. But awarded the enslavers,  the persons who fought to maintain slavery.   Remember, we had to go to war. Thank God for Abraham Lincoln. We had  to go to war to deal with slavery. People died. What a tragedy it was.  But that is what it took to eliminate slavery in this country. We gave  a Congressional Gold Medal to the Confederates, and nothing to the  persons who were enslaved.   Well, we can remedy that. Remember now, I am talking about things we  need to do to change the mindset that we have. We need, and I think  this Congress should, award a Congressional Gold Medal to the enslaved.  That seems so easy to comprehend, but yet so hard for this Congress to  do.   They just need to acknowledge that these folks who suffered for 240  years, they ought to be acknowledged for what they did too. They ought  to be acknowledged for what they did here, for what they did with the  White House, and for what they did for this country--a Congressional  Gold Medal for the enslaved.   There is a resolution pending for such a thing to be done. Remember,  powerless. Powerless. We are shown to be powerless when something as  simple as this can't be done. Something as simple as having a  Slavery Remembrance Day where the Congress, meaning the House and the  Senate and the President, acknowledges it.    We have a Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. We have a 9/11 Remembrance.  We have a Holocaust Remembrance Day, meaning the President, the House,  and the Senate recognizes Holocaust Remembrance Day. We don't have such  a thing for the people who are the economic foundational mothers and  fathers of this country. No slavery remembrance. Don't have it. That is  because we are still powerless.   We have some power. Yes, we are Senators and we are in Congress and  we have a President and there is a Vice President, but we are still  shown that we cannot demand justice and get justice. There are people  who would say: You are not asking for it properly. You have to be  subservient. Be servile and maybe you can get it then.   We can't demand it and get it. I demand it. We ought to have Slavery  Remembrance Day acknowledged by the House, the Senate, and the  President, as well as a Congressional Gold Medal accorded the enslaved.   I have talked about it; we need to remove Richard Russell's name from  the Russell Senate Office Building. I won't go into any great details  in explaining that, I have gone through it clearly. There is  legislation for atonement that is pending, and I won't go through that.   I do want to go to the last item on my agenda, which is number five.   Mr. Speaker, so I may govern myself accordingly, can you please tell  me how much time I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I want to talk now about the thing  that I think will help not only with slavery remembrance, but also will  help us with other issues that have not been resolved. That is the  establishment of a department of reconciliation.   Mr. Speaker, we have not reconciled. We have not. There are chasms  that we cannot see but that we can experience. We need to span the  chasms that divide us. To do so, we need to have a methodology by which  it can be accomplished. To have that methodology, we have to have a  means in place. This would be the means by which the methodology could  be enforced and put into motion so that we can get reconciliation.   Reconciliation. There ought to be in this country what we could not  do after the war because President Johnson was more interested in the  antebellum aspect of the war. He would have gone back if he could have,  but he could only go so far. He did limit forward movement, so we  didn't get reconciliation.   We need a department of reconciliation with a secretary of  reconciliation. A person that wakes up every morning with the mission  of helping us to reconcile the differences in a very positive way, I  might add--the differences that separate us, the chasms that we failed  to span over the centuries.   Remember, slavery lasted for more than two centuries, it wasn't a 20- year event. That is why some of the aspects of the powerlessness are  still inculcated into our society. We need this department of  reconciliation with a secretary and under secretaries of reconciliation  to deal with all of the invidious discrimination that has not been  resolved. There are issues related to other persons that have not been  resolved.                                time  1200    One example would be the indigenous Americans. They are the first  Americans. Their issues have not been resolved. These are the folk who  suffered the Trail of Tears. These are the folk who suffered wars  against them, and they were made the villains. They were defending  their land, and they are the villains.   We need to resolve this. The department of reconciliation would help  us do this. It won't be done in a month, a week, a year or 2, or a  decade. It is going to take time. Nevertheless, it is not going to be  done without some structure. It is not going to be done with just the  passage of time. It won't happen.   Dr. King reminded us that it is not the passage of time that makes  change--these are not his exact words--but rather what you do with time  as it passes.   What do you do with the time? If you don't make good use of it, then  the change won't take place.   So, we need this department of reconciliation; we need a secretary of  reconciliation; we need under secretaries of reconciliation; and we  need a budget. I have proposed that the budget for this department be  indexed and tied to, if you will, indexed and tied to the Defense  Department's budget.   Why the Defense Department's budget? It is because we will always  fund the Defense Department. I think that we should have a budget that  is indexed and tied to it. The money would not come out of the Defense  Department's budget.   There would be money that would be the equivalent of some percentage,  say 10 percent, of what is in the Defense  [[Page H6732]]  Department for the department of reconciliation so that we can at some  point, at some point, span the chasms that divide, separate, and  prevent us from having the level of unity within our country that we  richly deserve given the great documents, the great founding documents,  of the country, that all persons are created equal, endowed by the  creator with certain inalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness. These certain documents include the pledge of  liberty and justice for all.   We need to do these things. I am committed to Slavery Remembrance  Day. I am committed. I stand alone sometimes with this commitment. It  is an idea that I brought to this Congress, and I am going to stay with  it.   Yes, I am the progenitor, the progenitor, of Slavery Remembrance Day.  I am going to stay with it. I am not letting it go.   The Congressional Gold Medal for the enslaved, I will not let it go.   Removing Mr. Russell's name, I will not let it go.   Establishing a department of reconciliation, I won't let it go.   The question is: Will others find it within their hearts and their  spirits to take a similar stance? I pray that they will.   I close with this, Mr. Speaker: We persons of African ancestry have  suffered, our ancestors have and are still suffering, from the  indignation and humiliation associated with slavery and segregation. We  are still suffering from it. We are still suffering from racism.   There are people who would say: Forget the racism.   I am not going to forget it, just like I would not want my Jewish  brothers and sisters to forget the Holocaust. Don't forget the  Holocaust, and I won't forget slavery.   We are still suffering, and we are suffering because of what I  indicated initially.   Why were we brought to this country? When I say ``we,'' I am talking  about my foreparents. Why were they brought to this country? They were  brought here to be: permanent, remember, 240 years of slavery is  evidence of it, centuries; identifiable, they wanted people of color  because they could spot them easily; powerless, no power, not  recognized, the law recognizes no rights for you as they relate to  persons who are Anglo; subservient, always servile, always humble,  always ready to serve, pleading with the master, ``Give me something  that I may do for you, master''; and caste, the difference between  caste and class, remember, class is a socioeconomic condition. Caste is  usually hereditary. You are born into it, you live it, and you die.   We are still suffering from this original reason that enslaved  persons were brought to this country. Nevertheless, I believe that we  can bend the arc of the moral universe toward justice for African  Americans and all other persons who suffer from invidious  discrimination.   I believe it. I believe we can achieve it. I just know that we have  to work hard to get it done.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the time. I am proud to have stood  here, and I proudly move forward with the conscience agenda that I have  called to the attention of our country. God bless you, Mr. Speaker, and  God bless the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
