 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Pulp and  Paperworkers' Resource Council on its 30th anniversary.   The PPRC is a grassroots organization made up of hourly employees of  the U.S. forest products industry whose members work in mills and  converting plants, manufacturing sustainable paper and wood products  that Americans rely on every day.   Founded in 1991, the PPRC works to ensure real-world perspectives are  considered in all policy and regulatory decisions that impact their  jobs and our communities.   As co-chair of the bipartisan, bicameral House Paper and Packaging  Caucus, I am honored to meet with the PPRC representatives every year  when they come to Washington, D.C., to advocate for their priorities  and promote this important sector of our economy.   I am pleased to congratulate the PPRC for 30 years of hard work on  behalf of such an essential industry.                            ____________________
