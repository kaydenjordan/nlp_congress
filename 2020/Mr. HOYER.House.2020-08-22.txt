 Mr. Speaker, I had not necessarily intended to speak after  the minority leader, but I cannot help but respond to some of what the  minority leader had to say.   First of all, he practices the President's favorite tactic. Distract.  Speak about that which is not relevant. All the Democrats are voting.  They may be voting at that machine. They may be voting at that machine  over there. They may be voting at that machine, or they may be voting  at that machine back there. They may be voting by proxy, which you  didn't like. The minority leader sued, and the Court said it is up to  the House to decide its own rules.   Now, when we passed the HEROES Act 100 days ago tomorrow, what did  the minority leader say? Let's wait and see what happens. And what has  happened since then? Thousands, tens of thousands of people have gotten  sick, and thousands and thousands of people have died in those days.  Let's wait and see.   And what did the majority leader, who can put a bill on the floor,  what did he say? Let the States go bankrupt.   Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of talk on the floor about bring  this bill or that bill or the other bill. The Senate is controlled by  your party, I tell my minority friends in the House. They haven't  passed a single bill in 70 days, in 100 days, not a single bill. Why?  Because they would have to compromise.   And you say we need to bring things to the floor. The minority  leader, of course, had a man named Garland, from February to January  when Obama was the President of the United States, and refused to  consider it. Do you think there is a Founding Father who thought that  advice and consent meant that they could simply ignore the President's  nominations? I think not.   Some people talk about, Oh, there are some very, very important  things to do. One of them, the gentlewoman from North Carolina--now,  let me, 84,631 deaths since HEROES passed. Let's wait. We passed  HEROES. No action in the Republican-controlled and led United States  Senate. So don't whine to me about what you want on the floor. Don't  whine to me about we could have done this, we could have done that, we  could have done the other.  [[Page H4283]]    Mr. Speaker, I was just talking to the chief of staff of the White  House, and I kidded him, I said, You know, when you were here in the  House and we had Republican leadership and they offered solutions, you  undermined them.   Who says so? John Boehner says so. You had the opportunity to make a  deal.   Now we control the House, and very frankly, the majority leader  cannot pass a bill because 20 of your Members in the United States  Senate want to do nothing, and just tell the people who are suffering,  who are on unemployment, who don't have childcare, you are on your own.   Now, I have heard all this talk about what we could have done. Do it.  Do it. Nancy Pelosi and Secretary Mnuchin got four deals done. Most of  you voted for them, and they passed overwhelmingly in a bipartisan  fashion. But you made a decision, nope, no more.   Now we have it speculated that if we don't take action and have a  much more robust--and a plan for dealing with COVID-19, which we don't  have and haven't had, because this President called it a hoax. You  don't have to respond to hoaxes. That is what he called it, a hoax.  And, of course, if it is a hoax you don't respond, and he didn't.   And over 175,000--86,000 since we passed HEROES--175,000, and CDC  says it may be up to 200,000 by the end of this year. Still, you have  passed no bill in the United States.   We sent a bill over there. You don't like it, that is fine, pass your  own. You control the Senate. Pass your own, and then we will go to  conference. We will see which bill is better, or maybe we will put them  together. But what has the Senate majority leader done? He has reduced  the $1 trillion offer down to $500 billion, which the governor of my  State says is only sufficient to help the States because they are  hemorrhaging revenue, and they are on the front lines of responding to  this crisis.   Now, others of you have said all of this is a feign, this is not  real.   Mr. Speaker, I ask Madam Chair, has she spoken about the report from  the Postmaster General?    Mr. Speaker, let me repeat it, notwithstanding that.   It says, ``The new documents being released by the committee today  are part of the PMG briefing.''   Now, I hope the Postmaster General, unlike the President of the  United States, reads his briefings.   The President says he doesn't read his briefings, so he didn't know  about the Russian payments to kill American soldiers and has not  responded to this date on that assertion.   The new documents being released by the committee today are part of  the PMG briefing, a presentation prepared directly for the Postmaster  General last week on August 12, 10 days ago. They provide a detailed  assessment of service performance trends over the past year.   My friend from Ohio says, Oh, this is a fraud. There is no problem.  Not a big deal. Maybe he didn't read the PMG advisory either.   According to these documents, there has been a significant drop in  service standards across the board beginning in July, including first- class, marketing, periodicals, and priority mail.   The Postmaster General, of course, has never admitted to the sweeping  delays and reductions in service caused by the actions. Instead, here  is what he said: ``We all feel bad about what the dip in the level  of service has been.''    So he knows there was a dip in service right after he made these  changes.   Now, what do we know?   A, we know he is a big supporter of the President, gave a lot of  money to the President.   Secondly, we know he was appointed by the President. Essentially,  yes, elected by the Board of Governors--all thanks to the membership  appointed by President Trump--who, by the way, unanimously asked for  the $25 billion we are talking about.   We know the President of the United States wants to suppress the  vote.   Why?   He says so. He says so.   The first meeting I had with the President of the United States with  Republican leaders and Democratic leaders just shortly after he was  inaugurated President, the first thing he said was, I got a majority of  the votes.   If it hadn't been fraud, if it hadn't been all those people that  voted illegally, I would have gotten the majority of votes. He only got  62 million. 70 million voted for somebody else. And 65 million people,  the majority of the people of the United States voting for President of  the United States, voted for Hillary Clinton.   I challenge one of you to name me two members of the electoral  college in 2016. You can't do it. The American people voted for Hillary  Clinton.   The President of the United States wants to send, maybe with no name  tags and just sort of brown suits on, troops to the polls of America.  Never in my life--and I have run probably for office more times than  anybody here but   Don Young--never have I seen armed troops there at  the polls to intimidate people.   My State checks for fraud. And, by the way, all those fraudulent  votes that Donald Trump said had been cast, not a conviction. He  controls the Justice Department. He controls, presumably, the FBI.   Going back to what I said about this crisis that was occurring that  you say doesn't exist in the post office.   On January 15, 2013, we voted for a crisis, 50 million Americans  living in the northeast had been savaged by Superstorm Sandy. About 230  of you Republicans were here, you were in charge. Only 49 of you, not  Mr. Meadows, not Ms. Foxx, 49 voted for that bill, and 178 of you voted  no. No crisis. 50 million Americans. Superstorm Sandy. People being  flooded out of their businesses and homes. No crisis.   My suggestion is, wherever you are, you came here and that's great,  you are here, you can vote in person. Isn't that wonderful. I think  your vote would count just as much if you had voted--but your  leadership has told you, no, don't worry about the 86,000 people who  have died. The minority leader said, well, the crisis is gone. I don't  know where he thinks it went. It is certainly visiting the  neighborhoods in my State and the neighborhoods in your State.   So the report says the mail has substantially gone down since the  Postmaster General--aiding and abetting, in my opinion, the President  of the United States who wishes to suppress the vote--acted.   Now, I don't know how many of you read 18 U.S. Code 1703, but it  says, ``Whoever being a Postal Service officer or employee''--and says  some other things about secrets, destroys, detains, opens, et cetera-- ``whoever delays mail, which was intended to be conveyed by mail, shall  be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or  both.''   Now, I had a press conference with Senator Warner, Senator Van  Hollen, and six other Members, including Eleanor Holmes Norton, one of  the senior members of the Chair's committee. Five minutes before we  held that press conference, the Postmaster General issued his statement  that he was going to stop doing what he was doing. I guess it was  because he thought, Well, what I am doing is great, everybody will  support what I am doing. Or, did he think, I got my hand caught in the  cookie jar and I better stop? Which do you think is the more rational  determination as to why 5 minutes before he had that press conference  he issued his release? That he thought it was fine? He could defend it?  It was the right thing to do?   If he thought all of those, why in heaven's name did he change his  mind?   I will tell you why. He knew what he did was wrong. He probably read  that briefing that service had plummeted since he took that action, and  that he was putting the mail, prescription drugs, Social Security  checks, veterans' checks, at risk.   That seems to me to be the logical conclusion. And as the law says,  if you act and you delay the mail, you commit a crime, subject to 5  years in jail, and a substantial fine.                                time  1530    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership.   The Postmaster General appeared to back down from his attempt to set  the Postal Service up for failure just moments before a number of us,  as I have said, from the House and Senate were about to speak in front  of the Postal Service headquarters right down the street.  [[Page H4284]]    In his testimony yesterday, the Postmaster General indicated that he  and President Trump are simply hitting pause. They don't care about the  diminution of service that the Postmaster General's report said,  apparently. They just hit pause. Why? Because they are hoping it will  go away, the wrongdoing that they are perpetrating, not what was done  in the past by, yes: Should we make service efficient and effective? We  should. But that is not why this was done.   All you have to do is look at the President's statement about wanting  to suppress the vote, particularly of minorities. He said that if more  Blacks had voted in the last election, I would have lost. That is what  he said.   In his statement on Tuesday, the Postmaster General indicated that no  additional changes would be implemented. In other words, he is not  going to back up, even though his report says it is diminishing  service. Why? He can pledge all he wants, but if you don't give the  post office department and its employees the tools with which to do the  job, no matter what he says about voting--I am glad that we make sure  that first-class mail treatment--as a matter of fact, there ought to be  super-first class.   Voting for the President of the United States has got to be the most  important thing a citizen does in this election year, and it ought to  be treated as such by the postal department.   Even after 3 months, President Trump and Senate Republicans continue  to refuse to take action on the HEROES Act. I talked about that. That  is why Congress needs to take action now that will ensure our Postal  Service can continue to deliver for America through this pandemic, just  as it always has reliably delivered for our people. That is why this  legislation is necessary.   Millions depend on the Postal Service to obtain medications, receive  paychecks, and access vital services. For rural communities, in  particular, the Postal Service--that is the irony. For rural  communities, the Postal Service is probably even more important.   This year, in particular, it will play a crucial role, the Postal  Service, in helping tens of millions of Americans stay safe from COVID- 19. 86,000 Americans have died since we passed the HEROES Act. The  minority leader seems to think: Well, people not coming to Congress,  not wanting to get on an airplane, not wanting to come to Washington  and then go home and have to sequester themselves for 14 days, oh, they  are just playing games.   If you doubt the validity of their vote, say so. But whether I cast  it far over there or near here, it is the same vote. It is my vote, and  it is my people's voice.   It was so angering for Americans across the political spectrum that  President Trump and Postmaster General DeJoy openly sabotaged the  Postal Service in order to prevent people from casting votes through  the mail. I know you can discount the fact that the President wants to  suppress the vote. He said so. I am not making it up. He said so. Oh,  we have all the fraud.   By the way, he votes by mail, of course. You all understand that. I  don't know that he sends an ID card down when he votes. Well, maybe we  ought to check on that. You are so interested in ID cards, let's see if  the President of the United States sends an ID card down to Florida.   They employed tactics such as eliminating overtime pay, cutting  routes short, reassigning experienced managers, et cetera.   Maybe you guys and gals don't have a constituent office open. But  every one of my Members tells me they are hearing from thousands of  their people.   Congress, therefore, must take action to prevent them from simply  changing their minds and causing massive postal delays in the weeks  ahead. Remember, he said he has just delayed his changes, which caused  the fall in service.   Delivering for America Act, that is what the postal department has  done since before the Constitution was adopted. I am not going to go  through what it will require. You know what it will require. But it  would particularly require, and I am so pleased, Madam Chair, that you  included in your bill first-class treatment because voting is first- class priority in America.   Now, I am going to close with this because so many of you said: This  bill is not going to pass. You are wasting your time. You shouldn't  send it over there.   If we did that, we wouldn't do anything unless the President said you  can do it. Then, we would salute and say: ``Yes, sir. We will do it.  But if you don't want it, sir, if you don't want FISA--126 of us voted  for FISA, but if you don't want it, we will change our minds in 24  hours,'' which is what you did.   But then again, we wouldn't have sent campaign finance reform over  there because McConnell hasn't considered it. We wouldn't have sent  investment and infrastructure and jobs, which McConnell has not put on  the floor. We wouldn't have sent restoring voting rights or ensuring  LGBT equality or protecting Dreamers or ensuring equal pay for women  because McConnell hasn't put equal pay for women on the floor.   Requiring background checks for safer communities, only 90 percent of  Americans are for that, so I can understand why McConnell said: Look,  there is 10 percent against it. I am not going to put it on the floor  for consideration.   You say you haven't gotten notice, and you haven't been included in  the committee, et cetera. McConnell doesn't allow anybody to vote, your  leader.   Meeting the challenge of climate change, well, of course, many of you  don't believe climate change is real. I understand that.    Providing for justice in policing, did we send it over there? Yes.  Why? Because we want a fair, more just, more equal, more racially  conscious Nation. And I say racially conscious in the sense that we  don't judge people on the color of their skin.   We strengthened and expanded the ACA, which in a pandemic may well  have been very helpful. It hasn't been put on the floor.   Protecting workers' rights to organize and receive their pensions, it  hasn't been put on the floor.   So, if you tell me this can't pass, it can't pass perhaps because the  President of the United States tells you that he is not for it, and so  it doesn't pass.   In closing--and I know many of you have said thank God--in closing,  let me say that you ought to vote for this bill. Not for Democrats. You  ought to vote for it for your people, for the people in your rural  neighborhoods who are counting on the postal department to bring that  prescription drug, which is critical to maintain their health or save  their lives. You ought to vote for it for the over 1 million people  getting Social Security checks in the mail.   That is why you ought to vote for it, not for us.   You ought to vote for it because you want everybody to vote; you want  everybody to participate in this democracy; you want an election that  has, like so many other countries, 80 percent of our people  participating, who don't want to be the 86,001 who die because they  went someplace and aggregated together and got COVID-19.   That is what this is about, making our people able to participate  safely in their democracy.   Vote for this bill. It is not a partisan bill. It is a bill that says  Republicans ought to be safe in voting. Democrats ought to be safe in  voting. Independents ought to be safe in voting, if that is what they  choose to do.   This is a good bill. It is a bill for America's democracy. It is a  bill for making sure that our people are connected through the mail.   I thank the chair for bringing this bill to the floor. Vote ``yes.''  I urge a ``yes'' vote for all Members.
