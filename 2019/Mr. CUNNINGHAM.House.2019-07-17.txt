 Mr. Chair, I rise today to honor the valiant actions  of Deputy William Kimbro of the Berkeley County Sheriff's Office.   On June 11, Deputy Kimbro pulled over a speeding vehicle to find that  12-day-old Riley had stopped breathing. She needed immediate help, so  without hesitation, Deputy Kimbro administered lifesaving care to this  newborn until the first responders could arrive on the scene.   Deputy Kimbro served our Nation in the Navy for 21 years before  joining the Berkeley County Sheriff's Office in 2013. A school resource  officer on summer break, patrolling the road is not Deputy Kimbro's  primary duty, but he acted without hesitation. For his bravery and  composure, he earned Berkeley County's Life-Saving Medal.   He is a husband and father of two children. Deputy Kimbro is an all- around hero, and we are lucky to have him looking after us in the  Lowcountry. He, alongside all first responders, keep the Lowcountry and  this Nation a safer and better place.   Deputy Kimbro should take a bow. We are extremely proud of him.                            ____________________
