 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the amazing  accomplishments, once again, from the Fort Worth Independent School  District. I will start off talking about Kalani Lawson, who is a  sophomore at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Fort Worth.   Kalani recently broke a 27-year-old State record at the UIL State  track meet in Austin this year. Kalani finished the Class 4A 100-meter  hurdles in 13.98 seconds, breaking the previous record of 14.04  seconds, earning the accomplishment of having the first sub-14-second  time in the event's history.   In amazing Texas sportsmanship fashion, the record holder who owned  the record from 1998 in Groesbeck went on Facebook and congratulated  her for breaking her record.   By finishing in this time, Kalani also broke Dunbar's record for the  girls' 100-meter hurdles by beating the previous record set by her  track coach, Leah Matthews.   Madam Speaker, I want to highlight Kalani's dedication to track and  field, and her achievements as a young student athlete. This is an  incredible family. They have a long history in Fort Worth in the  business community and teaching endeavors, and lots of amazing athletes  have come out of this family, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I am looking forward to Kalani's junior and senior  seasons at Dunbar High School as she continues to do amazing things.                          Recognizing Malik Franklin     Mr. Speaker, I commend another Fort Worth ISD athlete, an  accomplished young student athlete by the name of Malik Franklin, at  Oscar Dean Wyatt High School in Fort Worth.   Malik is a junior and a two-time All-American track and field  athlete. He is the captain of the varsity football team, and he is  carrying a 4.1 GPA.   Malik competed in the 2023 track meet in Austin, and he brought home  the top prize for the boys' 5A 400-meter sprint event, winning in 47.58  seconds, almost a full second ahead of any of his competitors. To  qualify for the event, he had to race across all four regions in Texas.  That is 254 counties. This young man is going places.   Malik is following in his father's footsteps. In 1998, Michael  Franklin was a part of the winning O.D. Wyatt track team that set a  national high school record in the 4x100 relay, a record that still  stands to this day.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate these amazing student athletes on their  future and what they are doing on the field today.                            ____________________
