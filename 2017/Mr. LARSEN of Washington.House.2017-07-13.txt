 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the  Garamendi-Hunter amendment because I know how important a strong  icebreaker fleet is to national security.   The committee recognizes this reality, as elsewhere in the bill we  give the DOD some important authorities to support icebreaker  procurement. However, this section 123 prohibits DOD funding for  icebreaker procurement. This amendment strikes this provision because  flexibility will be essential to funding new icebreakers.   Coast Guard shipbuilding budgets are insufficient for icebreaker  procurement absent radical cuts elsewhere. As co-chair of the Arctic  Working Group, I know that the United States needs icebreakers. These  ships protect economic interests in the region, and they defend our  sovereignty.   As the Arctic becomes increasingly navigable, the importance of  icebreakers will only grow, and I urge my colleagues to support the  Garamendi-Hunter amendment.
