Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I  yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Wednesday, the Rules Committee met  and reported a rule, House Resolution 833, providing for consideration  of three measures: H. Res. 826, Expressing Disapproval of the Trump  Administration's Harmful Actions Towards Medicaid; H.R. 5687, the  Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief and Puerto  Rico Disaster Tax Relief Act; and, finally, H.R. 2474, the Protecting  the Right to Organize Act.   The rule provides for H. Res. 826 to be considered under a closed  rule, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.   The rule further provides for consideration of H.R. 2474 under a  structured rule, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and the ranking minority member of the Committee on  Education and Labor. The rule self-executes the manager's amendment  from Chairman Scott making in order 16 amendments and provides one  motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 5687 under a  structured rule, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Appropriations. The rule makes in order six amendments and provides one  motion to recommit.   Madam Speaker, before us today, we have three measures that all speak  to one very, very important topic in America today. That topic is  inequality.   Madam Speaker, Justice Louis Brandeis once famously said: In this  country, we can either have democracy or we can have the concentration  of wealth in the hands of very few, but we can't have both.   Unfortunately, right now in this country, we are at historic levels  of inequality. A handful of families control more wealth than the  bottom 50 percent of Americans--160 million Americans. Forty percent of  lower income Americans make $30,000 a year. The top 1 percent in  income--not wealth, but in income--earn over $7 million a year, while  the other 99 percent earn on an average of $54,000 a year.   We cannot have this level of inequality.   President Abraham Lincoln famously said that labor and capital must  always be balanced in America to have democracy. And he said:         If capital ever had the control over labor, democracy would       cease to exist.    From the pearls of wisdom of people like Lincoln and Brandeis, we are  warned again today that we have to have countervailing institutions, as  John Galbraith said, between labor and capital. This is in the best  interests of everyone, including those who are making and reaping  exorbitant benefits from the current inequality.   But most importantly--most importantly--as Brandeis said, you cannot  have democracy with the current situation of inequality.   Not only is this inequality wrong, but its consequences in our  everyday lives, like worse health outcomes, diseases of depression,  behavioral health impacts, and economic insecurity, these public health  instances are directly correlated to income inequality as demonstrated  by the landmark work, ``The Spirit Level,'' 10 years ago.   The first resolution that is part of this rule expresses strong  disapproval of the Trump administration's recent attempt to turn  Medicaid into a block grant.   Medicaid is our Nation's promise to a group left behind by rampant  inequality that will help provide basic services to protect their  health and well-being--basic services. The Trump administration  proposal doubles down on its cruel policies that put cost savings over  life savings.   The second bill provides disaster relief to Puerto Rico. This is a  community that has been devastated repeatedly by disasters, exposing  the inequality not only in Puerto Rico, but between this  administration's treatment of a territory versus a State. Puerto Rico  needs our help. Without it, roads will remain unpassable, schools will  remain closed, and the poor will become poorer.   And, finally, we have the Protecting the Right to Organize, the PRO  Act. President Eisenhower once said that only a fool would attempt to  block a working man or woman, an American worker, from joining a labor  union. President Eisenhower said this, a Republican President, much  admired.   This was at a time where America had the largest expansion in our  history, and the world's expansion, growing at over 6 percent of GDP a  year that everybody benefited from. One year was 13 percent. At that  time, one in three American workers were in a labor union.   By the time Ronald Reagan became President, one in four Americans was  in a labor union. By the time President Reagan left office, 1 in 10  American workers were in a labor union.   The balance between labor and capital is the essence of American  democracy. It is unbalanced and risks our democracy at this moment.   The ability for American workers to organize and have a voice in the  outcomes, not just of their work, but of their retirement and the  benefit to their families and communities, has been attacked since  President Reagan was in office.                                time  1245    Evidence is clear that the rise in inequality has coincided with the  decline  [[Page H861]]  in union membership. By most estimates, declining unionization  accounted for about a third of the increase in inequality of which I  speak in the 1980s and 1990s.   To address inequality, you have to include working people. You have  to include the right to organize. Labor unions are universally  recognized as providing major boosts to employees' wages and benefits.  Sadly, the best evidence we have on this trend is by comparing union  States like the one I am proud to represent, California, to right-to- work States.   In 1979, States with historically high levels of union membership,  like in the Northeast and the Rust Belt, saw relatively low rates of  income inequality. Just the opposite held true for right-to-work  States. If you watched data over the years since the 1970s as States  move as a group toward less union coverage, those same States have much  worse inequality and poor performing GDP.   Unions not only raise wages for workers they represent, but they also  have been shown to moderate compensation for executives. On top of all  the obvious benefits you think of that are associated with labor unions  like higher wages and safer workplaces, some of the others that come  along with union membership also help address the inequities in our  society.   Union workers are more likely to receive paid leave, are up to 28  percent more likely to have employer-sponsored health insurance and are  up to 54 percent more likely to be enrolled in employer-sponsored  pensions.   Not only do workers have better access to pensions, but their  employers contribute an average of 28 percent more toward those  pensions than nonunion employers.   The PRO Act simply updates labor laws, labor laws that have been  attacked for 30 years, to ensure that workers in today's economy are  able to create and join labor unions to receive the same kinds of  protections they see in other sectors. Nothing more.   Madam Speaker, I suspect we will hear a lot of misinformation-- especially about the PRO Act--from our colleagues on the other side of  the aisle. Make no mistake about it, Madam Speaker, these three bills  will help restore power to the people, which the administration  repeatedly has tried to strip power from.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, just a couple of points to my friend from Texas'  comments.   I include in the Record a February 2 Washington Post article  entitled: ``You'd think Trump would stop threatening insurance coverage  by now. Think again.''                  [From the Washington Post, Feb. 2, 2020]    You'd Think Trump Would Stop Threatening Insurance Coverage by Now.                                Think Again.                  (By the Washington Post Editorial Board)         Notwithstanding the progress under Obamacare, the United       States still does not provide health insurance to all of its       population. About 27.5 million people, or 8.5 percent of the       population, lacked coverage throughout 2018, according to the       most recent Census Bureau report published in September. The       country has moved in the wrong direction since President       Trump took office: The 2018 uninsured numbers were up over       2017.        You might think, given this history, that the Trump       administration would cease proposing policy that threatens       coverage; well, think again.        Mr. Trump's Department of Health and Human Services has       unveiled a proposal that would allow states to receive       federal Medicaid funding as a block grant, annually       adjustable for inflation, while implementing cost-cutting       measures such as work requirements, asset tests, co-payments       and prescription drug limitations. (As a sweetener, states       would be allowed to pocket some of the budgetary savings.)       Existing rules essentially require states to provide a set of       services to all those who meet federally established       criteria, and fund them on an open-ended basis.        To be sure, the administration's proposal would not affect       traditional Medicaid populations such as low-income pregnant       women and people with disabilities. It targets only the so-      called expansion population--the 17 million low-income adults       who got Medicaid through Obamacare. And even then, it's       unlikely it will be adopted in blue states with large       Medicaid populations, such as California, or in red states       that never expanded Medicaid in the first place and probably       won't no matter how federal aid is structured, such as Texas.        Where it might make a difference is in red states that       reluctantly expanded Medicaid but are looking for ways scale       it back, or in those 14 states that have not yet expanded but       still want to do so in a limited way. An example of the       latter category is Oklahoma, which is having a referendum on       Medicaid expansion in November. That state's Republican Gov.       Kevin Stitt, who opposes the referendum, jumped at the       administration's offer. The proposal invokes--probably       incorrectly--HHS's statutory authority to adjust Medicaid's       core requirements, so its ultimate fate may depend on the       courts. A federal judge in Washington blocked previous       attempts by the agency to let New Hampshire, Kentucky and       Arkansas set work requirements for Medicaid, which cost       18,000 people in the latter state their coverage, though the       administration has appealed. (Kentucky has withdrawn its work       requirements, which never took effect.)        Whatever its short-term practical impact, the       administration's latest block-grant proposal could be       significant in the long run. The ultimate goal is to       legitimize block-granting and the coverage reductions the       approach almost certainly entails. Reduced coverage, it       should be mentioned, was partly why Congress previously, and       repeatedly, rejected Republican plans to block-grant       Medicaid. The United States badly needs a system of universal       coverage that delivers services more efficiently than the       existing hodgepodge. In its determination to chip away at       Obamacare's compromise solution--Medicaid expansion--the       Trump administration has revealed that it has other       priorities.     Madam Speaker, on the Medicaid block grants, I would  just say, from my experience, as someone who was very involved in the  adoption of the ACA in the California State Senate, both chairing the  committee of jurisdiction and being involved in what we look back on as  a very successful rollout, doing the block grants sets the threshold  lower than is necessary. Remember that the Federal thresholds are only  a base level. States can put more contributions from the State and  local level in, which we have done in California. It has been  successful at getting millions of Californians into insurance, as  opposed to being in indigent care.   On the organizing aspect, this has come up in the Rules Committee,  the secret ballot and privacy. A reminder, as Chairman Scott said last  night: Secret ballot is still sacrosanct. It only comes up that it will  not be if the National Labor Relations Board sanctions the employer for  violating organizing rules.   Our research shows that 45 percent of employers threaten workers in  meetings, threaten them if they are trying to organize. Seventy-five  percent of employers hire consultants to run antiunion campaigns, and  one in five employees who try to organize their fellow workers get  fired or threatened with termination.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume before I introduce our next speaker.   I am a former small business owner who met a payroll for hundreds of  people in the restaurant business in California. Our economy is the  fifth largest economy in the world. There is lots of evidence showing  that helping the employer and helping the consumer so they have more  disposable income actually helps everyone.   As far as the dual employer rule, all we are doing is trying to  protect what has been in effect for decades and not have it diminished,  so there should be no impact on franchisees.   Lastly, the distinction I think that needs to be reiterated over and  over again in light of the administration's assertions about the  economy is, yes, the GDP is growing, not as large as the President had  promised, but it is not being spread out.   As I mentioned in my opening comments, 50 percent--150 million, 160  million people--live on $30,000 a year. They don't see the big benefit  in what Wall Street gets. The average income is for the bottom 90  percent of Americans. It has increased just 1 percent from 1980 to  2017, while all their other costs have gone up, most notably healthcare  and education. Average incomes, on the other hand, for the wealthiest 1  percent have increased by 184 percent.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from  Connecticut an additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Madam Speaker, I yield another 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I have no more speakers. So, if the  gentleman from Texas would like to close, I am prepared to close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I just want to thank everyone who came down and spoke on this  important issue. In my view, there is nothing more important.   You don't have to read the 600 pages in Thomas Piketty to know that  the level of inequality in this country right now. And I acknowledge  some of the improvements that globalism has given to people who earn $1  a day and are now up to the astronomical level of $2 a day, but that  has not benefited the American worker.   As I said in my opening comments, 40 percent of American households  live on $30,000 a year. That is not helping everybody. Most of the  benefits of the last 50 years went to the top 1 percent, people, as I  said before, who earn--not own, earn--$7 million a year as opposed to  the 99 percent below them who earn $54,000 a year.   We have to fix this. This is not democracy, as Brandeis and Lincoln  said. As Eisenhower said, when the economy was growing at historic  records, as I mentioned in my opening statements.   And this is how times have changed, particularly as a former  Republican, former small business owner, former teamster, and former  hotel and restaurant union member. Those jobs, that protection, gave me  the money to  [[Page H868]]   save enough money to go into business for myself and treat my  employees as I would want to be treated, which helped my customers.   Eisenhower said:         Only a handful of reactionaries harbor the ugly thought of       breaking unions and depriving working men and women of the       right to join the union of their choice.    President Eisenhower said:         I have no use for those, regardless of their political       party, who hold some vain and foolish dream of spinning the       clock back to days when organized labor was a huddled, almost       helpless mass.    Eisenhower said:         Only a fool would try to deprive working men and women of       the right to join the union of their choice.    Lincoln said:         All that harms labor is treason to America.    Madam Speaker, for decades, tax breaks, rollbacks on regulations that  benefited the ultrawealthy and powerful corporations, unfair labor laws  and the enactment and enforcement of those laws, and the rise of  monopolies have fueled inequality to the point where we are at Great  Depression levels, and we will suffer the consequences if we don't  address that in this room. It will be addressed outside of this room.   We have an opportunity today to move this country in the right  direction with these three measures. I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule  and the previous question.   And I have two last quotes. Plutarch said, 2,000 years ago, that the  oldest and fatal flaw to republics has always been the imbalance  between the rich and the poor.   Samuel Gompers, great union leader, when he was fighting to organize  Americans during the Depression, said: Unions and equality, and until  we get it, no surrender.   The text of the material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 833         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 834) supporting policies that are a part       of the ``Best is Yet to Come'' blueprint, outlined by       President Trump during his historic, optimistic State of the       Union Address. The resolution shall be considered as read.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the Majority and       Minority Leaders or their designees. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX       shall not apply to the consideration of House Resolution 834.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time,  and I move the previous question on the resolution.
