 Mr. Speaker, whatever you call the  President's recent executive orders, the reality is that they  constitute a Muslim ban.   Yesterday, one of my constituents was crossing the border into San  Diego when he was singled out for having brown skin. He was asked by a  CBP agent if he was Muslim as he stood in line. Well, in fact, he is an  Indian-American man who got his citizenship mere months ago, and he was  so proud to become a U.S. citizen because it meant that he could  finally vote in our elections.   His wife called our office, horrified at how casually her husband's  civil rights had been violated, and she told us that she was scared now  to travel with her kids because she didn't want to tell them that they  shouldn't talk to any agents at the airport. Her voice wavered as she  explained that she has lived here for 45 years, but this is the first  time she ever felt scared because of her skin color.   Mr. Speaker, I demand--in fact, we all should demand--that President  Trump rescind these discriminatory orders immediately and that my  Republican colleagues stand up against these un-American policies.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to  bring up H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump's refugee ban in  light of individuals like Jordanian Musa Sharkawi, a cardiology fellow  in Connecticut whose wife is a Syrian doctor and whose family cannot  visit her because of the ban.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.
