 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in favor of H.R. 23, which  would defund the $80 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act or, as I  call it, the inflation enhancement act, and thereby defund the hiring  of 87,000 new IRS agents, which would, in effect, double the agency.   Nary a one, not one, of my constituents has asked to hire 87,000 new  IRS agents, but, in fact, countless have asked if we can hire 87,000  new Border Patrol agents because there is a crisis and a catastrophe on  our southern border.   The last thing we want is to double an agency that is already bloated  and have them with these 87,000 new agents or, in military parlance,  five new divisions to harass, stalk, and otherwise terrorize law- abiding American citizens.   Who is this going to really kick in the teeth? It is not going to be  the wealthy or the poor. It is going to be the small business owners  and the middle-class, hardworking Americans.   Do you want to start a new Congress and do it well? This is a great  bill, and I urge the passing of H.R. 23, the Small Business and  Taxpayer Protection Act.
