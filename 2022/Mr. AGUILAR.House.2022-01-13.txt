 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis  Act, legislation that would protect the right to vote and strengthen  our democracy.   This week we heard President Biden, traveling to the home of our late  colleague, John Lewis, rally the Nation around the need to protect and  expand the right to vote.   Today, we will pass this legislation in honor of John's name. But in  order to honor our colleague, we must make good on our commitment. We  must pass this legislation in both Chambers without delay. We must also  make clear, as President Biden did this week, that there is nothing  more important--no rules or procedures--than the health of our  democracy. There is far too much at stake to let tradition get in the  way of real progress.   I know from my work on the committee and the Select Committee to  Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol that the  concerns about the future of the American system--the consent of the  governed--are well-founded.   Mr. Speaker, every Member of this body has a choice today, and the  world will remember where we stood. I am proud to stand on the side of  democracy, on the side of making it easier to  [[Page H166]]  vote--not more difficult--and on the side of the people because the  American people are with us. This is not a Democrat or Republican  issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and pass this  legislation.     Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the following  letters of support for the Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746.                                             American Federation of                                   Government Employees, AFL-CIO,                                                   January 13, 2022.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Federation       of Government Employees, AFL-CIO (AFGE) which represents  [[Page H172]]       over 700,000 federal and District of Columbia employees I       write to urge you to pass the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis       Act which combines key provisions of the Freedom to Vote Act       and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.        It is crucial for Congress to restore key provisions of the       1965 Voting Rights Act that were wrongly invalidated by the       2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision Shelby County v. Holder.       These provisions are critical to prevent state and local       governments from passing laws discriminating against voters       due to their race, ethnicity, or similar factors. Shelby       County v. Holder struck the preclearance provision of the       1965 Voting Rights Act, allowing states to implement voting       restrictions such as onerous identification requirements,       purged voter rolls, elimination of same day voting       registration, and limitations of early voting.        The fundamental right of all citizens to vote and       participate in the elections process is key to our       functioning democracy. Public servants defend and advance       this right every day through their work protecting our       environment, caring for veterans, and safeguarding our       country. Voting rights restrictions have a direct impact on       federal workers. A 2010 article in the Social Sciences       Quarterly stated that public sector voting turnout was two to       three percent higher than private sector union households.       Voters who favor a strong federal government and recognize       the contributions of the federal workforce are more likely to       show that support when they cast a ballot.        AFGE is a full and active partner in the traditional       alliance between the civil rights and workers' rights       movement. As such we are actively engaged in efforts to       protect the right to vote and to have all votes counted, in       protection against discrimination in the workplace, and       enforcement of justice everywhere.        The preclearance section of the Voting Rights Act blocked       discriminatory voting changes before implementation. Fifty-      three percent of the states covered by the preclearance       requirements imposed because of past discrimination had       passed or implemented voting restrictions that       disenfranchised tens of thousands of voters. Immediately       following the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v.       Holder, striking the preclearance provision of the Voting       Rights Act, states previously subject to preclearance (Texas,       Alabama, and North Carolina) implemented restrictive       identification requirements, purged voter rolls, eliminated       same day voting registration and limited early voting. AFGE       opposes denying the ballot to any eligible voter.        Voting rights restrictions have a direct impact on federal       workers. Statistics from the American National Election       Studies indicate that union household turnout is 5.7 percent       higher than that of nonunion households, and as noted above,       public employees vote in greater numbers. Voters who favor a       strong federal government and recognize the contributions of       the federal workforce are more likely to show that support       when they cast a ballot. Allowing new voting restrictions by       states trying to limit legitimate voters from exercising       their rights affect federal employees. These new limitations       cloaked in unsubstantiated claims of ``ballot protection''       include limiting polling places and locations for casting       early ballots, banning provision of drinking water to voters       waiting in line and imposing onerous restrictions on absentee       voting. Federal workers report for duty 24 hours a day, seven       days a week. They count on utilizing voting options to       exercise their patriotic right to vote.        AFGE calls on the House to pass the Freedom to Vote: John       R. Lewis Act. For questions, please contact Fiona Kohrman.            Sincerely,                                                 Everett B. Kelley,      National President.                                   ____                                                   January 13, 2022.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the members and officers       of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), I am writing       in strong support of the House Amendment to the Senate       Amendment to H.R. 5746, the Freedom to Vote and John R. Lewis       Voting Rights Advancement Act, which will ensure that voters       can safely and freely cast their ballots, protect against       election sabotage, stop partisan gerrymandering, and limit       the influence of dark money in politics so that billionaires       can't buy elections.        Nineteen states enacted 34 new laws that restrict access to       the ballot box in 2021 alone and more are under consideration       today. States are passing racially-gerrymandered maps that       dilute the power of Black and Brown voters. This legislation       would fight back against all these attacks, ensure the       ability for every American to participate in safe,       accessible, and transparent elections and restore political       power to America's working families.        These pieces of legislation are major step forward and our       democracy cannot afford to wait any longer for these crucial       changes. I strongly urge a majority vote in favor of these       historic pieces of legislation and oppose any amendments that       would undermine the bill's protections. CWA will include       votes related to consideration of this bill in our       Congressional Scorecard.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                      Dan Mauer,                                     Director of Government Affairs,      Communications Workers of America (CWA).                                   ____                                                              AFT,                                                   January 13, 2022.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.7 million members       of the American Federation of Teachers, and the millions of       American children and families we serve, I write in strong       support of the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to       H.R. 5746, the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. This bill       will ensure that voters can safely and freely cast their       ballots, protect against election sabotage, stop partisan       gerrymandering, and limit the influence of dark money in       politics.        The need to prevent voter subversion while re-establishing       and strengthening the protections of the Voting Rights Act of       1965 is more pressing than ever before. The country also has       a right to see where all its representatives stand on the       fundamental right of the people to decide who represents us       in the halls of power.        H.R. 5746 combines provisions from the Freedom to Vote Act       and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The Freedom       to Vote Act would enable the most comprehensive voting reform       in decades. It would establish rules for federal elections;       require automatic registration of any eligible voter, making       voting easier and more accessible; prohibit harassment and       intimidation of election workers; ban partisan       gerrymandering; strengthen election cybersecurity; better       defend elections from foreign interference; and provide vital       funding for elections. The John Lewis Voting Rights       Advancement Act would restore long-established federal voting       rights protections and prevent new state voter suppression       measures from being enacted.        In 2021 alone, 19 states enacted 34 new laws that restrict       access to the ballot box, and more are under consideration       today. Candidates are running for top election offices       peddling Donald Trump's ``big lie.'' States are passing       racially gerrymandered maps that dilute the power of Black       and Latino voters. This legislation would fight back against       all these attacks and ensure the ability of every American to       participate in safe, accessible and transparent elections. If       we care about our democracy and our way of life, we can no       longer sit idly by. H.R. 5746 will ensure the right to vote       is protected for all Americans.        The late Rep. John Lewis once said, ``The vote is precious.       It is almost sacred. It is the most powerful nonviolent tool       we have in our democracy.'' Protecting our democratic       principles is patriotic, not partisan. Our responsibility as       citizens is not just to vote, it is to stand up so that       everyone who is eligible can vote and every vote is counted.       The bedrock of American democracy is participation at the       ballot box for all, no matter their religion, their race,       their income, their gender, their age, where they come from,       what state they reside in or their ZIP code. The procedures       of a democratic institution should help preserve, not       undermine, the principles of our democracy.        I urge you to take the steps needed to pass H.R. 5746       without any delay. Thank you for considering our views on       this important matter.            Sincerely,                                                  Randi Weingarten,                        President, American Federation of Teachers.     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the extraordinary  life of Dr. Margaret Hill, who passed away peacefully last month at the  age of 81. She was, for many who knew her, the heartbeat of San  Bernardino.   For 50 years, she devoted herself to ensuring all children have  access to high-quality education. In 1971, she began as a high school  teacher, and would go on to serve as principal, assistant  superintendent for San Bernardino County, an adjunct professor and,  finally, the last decade, when I have known her more as a school board  member for San Bernardino City Unified.   Through all her roles, Dr. Hill never wavered in her devotion to the  children of our community. Her warmth, her wisdom, and her kind spirit  will be missed, but her legacy lives on in the countless lives that she  touched in the classroom and in the community.   It was a privilege to know her, Madam Speaker. May she rest in peace.                            ____________________
