 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Limit,  Save, Grow Act.   Every time I talk about debt, deficit spending, the budget-- anything--I think about my four boys who are 10 years of age and under.  I bring it up a lot, and it drives what I do. It gets me out of bed  every single day to be working on this. I just can't hear one more  time: Well, let's just raise the debt ceiling, and then let's get to  work on this.   It is no longer time for that. We cannot accept not using every  single opportunity that we have back here in Congress to address this.   I am in my second term in Congress. I have sat on the sidelines, and  I have watched us constantly do this over and over again. I want to see  something substantive happen here.   That is what we are doing here today, Mr. Speaker. We are trying to  do something substantive.   Our debt exceeds $30 trillion. The optimism of our future depends on  what we do over the next 10 years.   We have learned that the outcome is not good for empires that  overextend themselves like we have done.   America has done this before, and we are at an inflection point. Our  debt to GDP is where it was right after World War II, and for the bulk  of the 21st century, we were able to get our debt to GDP down.   We have to take action, and we have to do it now.   Let's use this opportunity like we have done over the last 30 or 40  years when there is a debt ceiling increase that comes up. Let's take  advantage of this, and let's find a way to reduce our spending. That is  the best way to address our debt-to-GDP ratio, and I know everybody in  this Chamber understands that.                                time  1615    We have an opportunity. This spring is our moment, again, to stop  debt-fueled spending sprees and give our children a fair shot at  success and not a mountain of IOUs.   This act saves $4.8 trillion, it grows our economy and our workforce,  and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  [[Page H2027]]
