 Mr. Speaker, I rise today also in support of H.R. 1331, the  Local Water Protection Act. I thank both my colleagues for their  support and their comments on this legislation.   Let's talk about what this really does, how this bill is so  important, and how it makes a difference with nonpoint source  pollution.   Point source pollution is easy to identify, for most people. They  have an image of it in their head. It is that pipe coming out of some  sort of seawall, coming out of the ground somewhere, dripping something  that doesn't look so fresh into their waterways that they want to look  pristine and beautiful.   That is easy to identify. The nonpoint stuff is not quite as easy for  everybody to go out there and see.   What this does is it helps us prevent toxic agricultural runoff that  can have an impact from things like fertilizer spraying, those things  that go out there and are put onto our crops at different times.   It can help implement best management practices. It can install pump  stations where they might be needed. It can assist with septic to sewer  conversions for those issues that arise in our more suburban and  residential areas where we have runoff coming off yards, leaky septic  tanks, things that we also don't want in our waterways coming from  those areas.   It can help address legacy pollutants already in our waterways. It  can help prevent other forms of pollutants from coming in. This is why  it is so important.   For us, Mr. Speaker, in Florida, this is a huge issue because our  Florida waterways, we know how irreplaceable a treasure they are. They  are ecologically unique. They are central to our economy. They are  central to our health because our family members are in and out of the  water so often, whether they are fishing, whether they are swimming,  whether they are boating, whether they are recreating, whatever it is,  whether it is a part of their livelihood, it is what they are in, so it  is a big deal for our health.   The community that I represent, like many others, is plagued with  toxic algal blooms that result from algae-laden discharges, an  unnatural infusion of freshwater into our salt water that causes this.  It creates a real mess for us.   When this nutrient-loaded freshwater hits our saltwater estuaries, it  wreaks havoc on our coasts. It kills everything in the sea life in its  path.   This past summer, we had freshwater that was released into our  coastal estuaries that was labeled nearly 50 times too toxic for human  contact. Now that water has tested positive for a number of toxins in  areas that are very heavily populated. It is a very bad situation for  what we experience each and every year.   This bill helps to stop this pollution by increasing the EPA's  successful section 319 grant program. It addresses nonpoint source  pollution through State-run nonpoint source pollution management, not  Washington, D.C., one-size-fits-all approaches, but State-run. The bill  reauthorizes this program and increases funding levels up to $200  million annually through 2024. This is an amazing bill. I am very proud  to work with everybody else on it.   In short, Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that can make a real difference  for communities across our country, but specifically for communities in  and around Florida and our beautiful peninsula, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I fully support its passage. I thank Congresswoman Craig  for leading this effort with me.   By the way, congratulations to Congresswoman Craig on passing her  first piece of legislation, as well. Let's get this bill passed.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  Indian River State College on being named a winner of the 2019 Aspen  Prize for Community College Excellence.   IRSC has made it their mission, literally, to provide the best to  every student developing academic plans. They have proven their ability  to consistently improve student success rates. Their effort to create  educational opportunities beyond the 2-year degree have produced  amazing results worth recognizing.   I have been on the campus many times. I have never spoken to a  student there that hasn't said anything but praise for IRSC.   So congratulations to Indian River State College, to Dr. Massey on  receiving this special recognition to help educate and prepare the next  generation of young professionals for success.                            ____________________
