 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my  colleague for yielding. As we have talked a little bit, the question  is: How do we help people get off of government programs? Not kick them  off but give them a path off the programs.   I think one of the things that has not been talked about enough is  the fact that the current system is a trap, and the harder people work  and the more they make, sometimes the less they have.   So what we have done in our farm bill that is coming up is to change  the assets that a household can have and remain on the SNAP program  until they graduate off the SNAP program.   Under current law, households without an elderly or disabled member  [[Page H3203]]  could not have counted liquid assets above $2,250. Households with an  elderly or disabled member could not have liquid assets above $3,250.                                time  1845    These dollar limits should have been annually indexed for overall  inflation and then rounded down to the next $250. But our bill raises  the asset limits for an eligible household from $2,250 to $7,000. I  want to say that again: $2,250. That asset limit is raised to $7,000  for an eligible household consisting of at least one elderly or  disabled family member. It moves from $3,250 to $12,000. We want people  who are out there doing the best they can to have the ability to work  hard, save some money, and continue to improve their lives.   We also exclude in this legislation the first $12,000 in the value of  any licensed driver's vehicle in a SNAP household from the applicant's  assets for purposes of eligibility determination. For many people on  the SNAP program, they have to travel a long way to work or to get  groceries, and we want them to be able to have that vehicle to get them  there, especially in rural areas like the 24 counties that I represent.  So excluding these vehicle assets is another benefit that we give to  people in helping them have that avenue to graduate off of the SNAP  program.   Our bill also permits SNAP applicants to maintain up to $2,000 in a  savings account. That is $2,000 that will not count towards the $7,000  asset threshold. So again, we are trying to help people who work hard,  who do the best they can, be allowed to save some assets so that they  are very comfortable when they graduate off of the SNAP program.   One other thing I would like to point out: Resources of a household  member who receives SSI or PA benefits, those benefits are excluded as  well. Under our current farm bill, SNAP recipients are caught between a  rock and a hard place: You work hard, you save a little money, you  invest in a vehicle, and you get kicked off the program.   Our farm bill actually fixes a lot of those things that people who  want to graduate off of the SNAP program need fixed. So I am very  pleased to be a supporter of this bill, and I think that this bill  moves the law in a great direction to help those people who are out  there actually working and doing the best they can graduate off of the  SNAP program. And these asset threshold increases, along with the  incentives to work, I think, move our legislation in a very good  direction. And I am looking forward to having the vote on the floor and  supporting this.
