 Madam Speaker, when the Supreme Court voted to  overturn Roe v. Wade, I was totally outraged. We knew that that day was  coming, and as horrific as it was and is, we were ready. But I was not  alone in that outrage.   Madam Speaker, over the past few weeks, the American people took  their outrage, and they turned it into action. From Kentucky to  California, red States to blue, our constituents made their voices  heard, and their message is clear.   Americans trust people, not politicians, to make their own decisions  about their health and their lives, including about abortion. Americans  will use their vote to strike down attacks on reproductive rights time  and time again and, yes, support reproductive freedom. Madam Speaker,  it is time to turn our constituents' demands into congressional action.   To my Republican colleagues who try to claim their extremism as  public opinion, we saw that the majority of American people are not  buying it. I am determined to ensure that their voices are heard, to  fight for all of our rights to make our own decisions over our bodies.  I won't stop, and none of my colleagues here will stop, until the right  to abortion is available and to keep politicians from interfering in  our personal decisions about our bodies. We are going to keep fighting  that this is available to everyone regardless of race, ZIP Code, or  income. It is our bodies, and it is our choices.                       Climate Change Fueling Wildfires     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  House amendment to S. 3902, the FIRE Act. I am proud to support this  bill and thank my good friends and fellow Californians, Senator Padilla  and Congresswoman Lofgren, for their leadership, and Chairman DeFazio  and the Speaker for bringing it to the floor.   Communities across the world are feeling the impact of climate  change, fueling wildfires and harming fragile ecosystems and  communities.   I was privileged to be in Egypt last week for COP27, and it was very  apparent and clear, and the voices were heard that we have got to  address these  [[Page H8551]]  critical issues with regard to the climate crisis now.   I have directly witnessed the devastating effects of wildfires on  homes and livelihoods in my community, which is why I am proud to  support this bill and urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' with me.    Current wildfires are growing larger and hotter, requiring urgent and  robust action from the Federal Government. The FIRE Act allows FEMA to  predeploy assets during high-risk times, improves relocation assistance  for public infrastructure affected by fires, and ensures equity of  assistance for Tribal communities and governments.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amended bill.                            ____________________
