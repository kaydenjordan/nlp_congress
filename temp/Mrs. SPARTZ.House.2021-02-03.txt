 Mr. Speaker, as a finance professional and CPA who spent  over a decade working in advanced finance, as former accounting college  faculty, and as a mother of two young daughters, I am appalled at how  reckless, irresponsible, and broken our budgeting process is.   The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the intent of fast-track  reconciliations has been completely misused, often by both parties.  These budgeting gimmicks are unacceptable. We must reinstate the  deliberative process in our House and restore transparency,  accountability, and basic principles of budgeting.   I hope my Democrat colleagues will express similar concerns to their  leadership, since we all care about the future of our children and our  country.   As their fellow Democrat Senator once said: We are in the process now  of seeing the Pandora's box, which has been opened to the abuse of the  reconciliation process.
