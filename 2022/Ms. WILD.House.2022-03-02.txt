 Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise today on behalf of the  more than 80,000 Puerto Rican constituents who call my district,  Pennsylvania's Greater Lehigh Valley, home.   My community would not be what it is without the contributions of the  Puerto Rican community. The United States would not be what it is  without the contributions of this community. Every aspect of our  national legacy, our cultural and artistic heritage, our groundbreaking  discoveries in science and technology, the dynamism of our economy, and  the strength of our Armed Forces has been shaped indelibly by these  fellow citizens.                                time  1900    And yet despite their service, residents of the island cannot vote  for the Commander in Chief. They lack voting representation in  Congress. And despite paying into programs like Medicare and Medicaid,  they do not have equitable coverage under these programs.   I am here to deliver a clear message. As United States citizens, the  people of Puerto Rico have the right to full representation in their  government. This is a principle at the very core of our Nation's  founding. It should not be controversial, and, in fact, it is widely  accepted among Americans of both political parties.   In fact, my colleague who has gathered us all here today and who has  introduced the Puerto Rico Statehood Admission Act is a Republican.  Thank you for having me. Today, the 105th anniversary of the date when  the people of Puerto Rico became United States citizens must mark the  moment when we finally begin the work of passing legislation to give  the people in Puerto Rico a long overdue voice and a vote in their  future.   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).
