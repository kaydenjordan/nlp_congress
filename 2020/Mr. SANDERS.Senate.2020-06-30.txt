 Madam President, in this unprecedented moment in  American history, I think there is a crying out all across this country  for us to rethink who we are as a nation and what our national  priorities are.   Whether it is fighting against systemic racism and police brutality,  whether it is the need to combat climate change and transform our  energy system away from fossil fuel, whether it is the absurdity of  being the only major country on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to  all people as a human right, or whether it is the grotesque level of  income and wealth inequality, where three people today own more wealth  than the bottom half of our Nation, all across this country people are  crying out for change--real change.   When we talk about the need for real change, it is beyond  comprehension the degree to which Congress continues to ignore our  bloated $740 billion defense budget. We talk about everything.  Democrats and Republicans disagree on almost everything, but when it  comes to this huge budget, which has gone up by over $100 billion since  Trump has been President, there is, unfortunately, a broad consensus,  and that is wrong.   Year after year, Democrats and Republicans come together with minimal  debate to support an exploding Pentagon budget, which is now higher  than that of the next 11 nations combined and represents some 53  percent of our discretionary spending. We are spending more on the  military than the next 11 nations combined. That is Russia, China, UK,  France, and you name it. That is more than all of them combined, and we  are spending on the military budget over half of our discretionary  spending.   Incredibly--and I know we don't talk about this too much--after  adjusting for inflation, we are now spending more on the military than  we did during the height of the Cold War, when we were in opposition to  the Soviet Union, a major superpower, or during the wars in Vietnam and  Korea. After adjusting for inflation, we are spending more today than  we did during the time of the Vietnam war.   This extraordinary level of military spending comes at a time when  the Department of Defense is the only agency  [[Page S3997]]  of our Federal Government that has not been able to pass an independent  audit. It comes at a time when defense contractors are making enormous  profits while paying their CEOs exorbitant compensation packages and  when the so-called War on Terror will end up costing us some $6  trillion. This is an agency that has not passed an independent audit.   I believe this is a moment in history when it would be a very good  idea for the American people and my colleagues here in the Senate to  remember the very profound statement made by Republican President  Dwight D. Eisenhower back in 1953. I think all of us remember that  Eisenhower was a four-star general who led the Allied forces to victory  in Europe. He knew a little bit about the military.   Eisenhower said:         Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every       rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from       those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are       not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone.       It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its       scientists, the hopes of its children.    What Eisenhower said 67 years ago was true then. It is true now. If  the horrific pandemic we are now experiencing has taught us anything,  it is that ``national security'' means a lot more than building bombs,  missiles, jet fighters, tanks, submarines, nuclear warheads, and other  weapons of mass destruction.   ``National security'' also means doing everything that we can to make  sure that every man, woman, and child in this country lives with  dignity and security, and that includes many people and many  communities around this country that have been abandoned by our  government decade after decade.   Without a moment's hesitation, we spend billions and billions on the  military, while we come to work and step over people who are sleeping  out on the streets and move away from communities where children are  getting totally inadequate educations and where teachers are underpaid.   I believe that the time is long overdue to begin the transformation  of our national priorities, and I cannot think of a better way to do  that than by cutting military spending.   I have, for this bill, filed three separate amendments, and I would  like to discuss them briefly.   The first amendment would reduce the military budget by 10 percent  and use the $74 billion in savings to invest in distressed communities  around the country that have been ravaged by extreme poverty, mass  incarceration, deindustrialization, and decades of neglect. We are  proposing to transfer money from the military into distressed  communities all over this country where people are suffering, where  people are hurting, where people are unemployed, where people don't  have any healthcare, where infrastructure is crumbling, where people  need help.   This amendment is being cosponsored by the Senators from  Massachusetts--Senator Markey and Senator Warren. Importantly--and I  hope my colleagues hear this--this amendment has the support of more  than 60 organizations throughout this country, representing millions of  workers, environmentalists, and religious leaders, including Public  Citizen, Union of Concerned Scientists, Physicians for Social  Responsibility, Greenpeace, and the United Methodist Church.   At a time when more Americans have died from the coronavirus than  were killed in World War I, when over 30 million people have lost their  jobs in recent months, when tens of millions of Americans are in danger  of being evicted from their homes, when education in America, from  childcare to graduate school, is in desperate need of reform, when over  half a million Americans are homeless, when close to 100 million people  are either uninsured or underinsured, now is the time to invest in our  people, in jobs, in education, in housing, and in healthcare--not in  more nuclear weapons, not in more tanks, not in more guns.   Under this amendment, distressed cities and towns in every State in  this country would be able to use these funds to create jobs by  building affordable housing, building new schools, childcare  facilities, community health centers, public hospitals, libraries,  sustainable energy projects, and clean drinking water facilities.   These communities would also receive Federal funding to hire more  public schoolteachers, provide nutritious meals to children and  parents, and offer free tuition at public colleges, universities, or  trade schools.   This is a pivotal moment in American history, and it is time to  respond to those crises that we are facing by transforming our national  priorities.   Do we really want to spend more--billions more--on endless wars in  the Middle East, or do we want to provide decent jobs to millions of  Americans who are now unemployed? Do we want to spend more money on  nuclear weapons, or do we want to invest in a childcare system that is  dysfunctional, in an education system where community after community  lacks the funds to provide decent, quality education for their kids? Do  we want to invest in affordable housing when half a million Americans  are homeless and 18 million families in America are spending half of  their incomes on housing?   Those are the choices that we face, and I think the American people  are clear that the time is now to invest in our people, not in more  weapons systems.   When we analyze the Defense Department budget, it is very interesting  to note that Congress has appropriated so much money for the Defense  Department that the Pentagon literally does not know what to do with  it. According to the GAO, between 2013 and 2018, the Pentagon returned  more than $80 billion in funding back to the Treasury   People sleep out on the streets, children go hungry, schools are  crumbling, people have no health insurance, but we have given the  Department of Defense so much money that they are actually returning  some of it back to the government.   In my view, the time is long overdue for us to take a hard look not  only at the size of the Pentagon budget but at the enormous amount of  waste, cost overruns, fraud, and the financial mismanagement that has  plagued the Department of Defense for decades.   Let us be clear. About half of the Pentagon's budget--and people, I  think, don't know this--goes directly into the hands of private  contractors, not the troops. Over the past two decades, virtually every  major defense contractor in the United States has paid millions and  millions of dollars in fines and settlements for misconduct and fraud,  all while making huge profits on those government contracts. This is at  a time when we are not very vigorous in terms of our oversight.   Despite that, since 1995, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and United  Technologies have paid over $3 billion in fines or related settlements  for fraud or misconduct--$3 billion. That is what they have been caught  doing. That is what they have been found guilty of or agreed to in a  settlement. God knows what else is going on that we still don't know  about.   Yet those same three companies received around $1 trillion in defense  contracts over the past two decades alone.   Further, I find it interesting that the very same defense contractors  that have been found guilty or reached settlements for fraud are also  paying their CEOs excessive compensation packages.   Last year, the CEOs of Lockheed Martin and Northrup Grumman both made  around $20 million in total compensation, while around 90 percent of  the companies' revenue came from defense contracts. In other words,  these companies--and I am talking about Lockheed Martin and Northrup  Grumman--for all intents and purposes, are governmental agencies. Over  90 percent of their revenue comes from the taxpayers. Yet the CEOs of  those companies made over 100 times more than the Secretary of Defense.  It is not too surprising, therefore, that we have a revolving door  where our military people end up on the boards of directors of these  major defense companies.   Moreover, as the GAO has told us, there are massive cost overruns in  the Defense Department's acquisition budget that we have to address.  According to GAO, the Pentagon's $1.8 trillion acquisition portfolio  currently suffers from more than $628 billion in cost overruns, with  much of the cost growth taking place after production. In other words,  they quote a price, and then they come back after they get the contract  and say: Oh, we made a slight mistake; you are going to have pay  [[Page S3998]]  twice as much or 50 percent more, whatever it might be, for the weapons  system you wanted.   GAO tells us that ``many DoD programs fall short of cost, schedule,  and performance expectations, meaning DoD pays more than anticipated,  can buy less than expected, and, in some cases, delivers less  capability to the warfighter.''   A major reason why there is so much waste, fraud, and abuse at the  Pentagon is the fact that the Department of Defense remains the only  Federal agency that hasn't been able to pass an independent audit. That  is why I have filed an amendment with Senators Grassley, Wyden, and Lee  that would require the Defense Department to pass a clean audit no  later than fiscal year 2025.   When you have an agency that spends some $700 billion, I don't think  it is too much to ask that we have an independent audit of the  Department of Defense   Interestingly enough, many of us will recall what then-Secretary of  Defense Donald Rumsfeld--not one of my favorite public officials--told  the American people on the day before 9/11 about the serious financial  mismanagement at the DOD. Here is what Donald Rumsfeld said. Needless  to say, the following day was 9/11. That was the terrorist attack  against the United States, so what Rumsfeld said the day before that  never got a whole lot of attention. But this is what a conservative  Republican Secretary of Defense said:         Our financial systems are decades old. According to some       estimates, we cannot track $2.3 trillion in transactions. We       cannot share information from floor to floor in this       building--    That is the Pentagon.         because it's stored on dozens of technological systems that       are inaccessible or incompatible.    And yet, nearly 20 years after Donald Rumsfeld's statement, the  Defense Department has still not passed a clean audit, despite the fact  that the Pentagon controls assets in excess of $2.2 trillion or,  roughly, 70 percent of what the entire Federal Government owns.   The Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan  concluded in 2011 that $31 billion to $60 billion spent in Iraq and  Afghanistan had been lost to fraud and waste.   Separately, in 2015, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan  Reconstruction reported that the Pentagon could not account for $45  billion in funding for reconstruction projects. More recently, an audit  conducted by Ernst & Young for the Defense Logistics Agency found that  it could not properly account for some $800 million in construction  projects.   It is time to hold the Defense Department to the same level of  accountability as the rest of the government. That is not a radical  idea. And support for this concept is bipartisan. That is why I am  delighted that this amendment is supported by Senators Grassley and  Lee, as well as Senator Wyden, and we hope it will be supported by a  strong majority of the Members of the body.   I believe in a strong military, but we cannot continue to give more  money to the Pentagon than it needs when millions of children in our  country are food insecure--there are kids all over this country, in  every State in this country, who are hungry--and when we have 140  million people who cannot afford the basic necessities of life without  going into debt.   Further, let us be very clear, when we are talking about the need to  protect the American people, we are talking about the need to defeat  our most immediate adversary right now, an adversary that has taken in  recent months over 120,000 American lives, and that, of course, is the  coronavirus.   When we talk about defense, when we talk about protecting the  American people, we must get our priorities right and do everything we  can to protect the American people from the coronavirus. I don't think  nuclear weapons are going to do it. I don't think tanks are going to do  it. I don't think F-35s are going to do it. But we need to do  everything we can to protect the lives and the health of the American  people in terms of the coronavirus.   What virtually every scientist who has studied this issue will tell  us--and they just told me that this morning as a member of the HELP  Committee--is that the most effective way to prevent the transmission  of this deadly virus and to stop unnecessary deaths from COVID-19 is  for everybody in this country to wear a mask. It is not rocket science,  not very complicated, but if you wear a mask when you are in contact  with other people, the likelihood that you will spread the virus or get  the virus is significantly reduced.   That is why I have filed an amendment which requires the Trump  administration to use the Defense Production Act to manufacture the  hundreds and hundreds of millions of high-quality masks that this  country needs and to deliver them to every household in America.   This is not a radical idea. It is an idea that is being implemented  all across the world, in countries like South Korea, France, Turkey,  Austria, and many other countries; that is, they are distributing high- quality face masks to all of their people for free or at virtually no  cost. That is what I believe we have to do.   There was a study that just came out from the University of  Washington very recently, which suggested that if 95 percent of the  American people wore face masks when they interact with others, we  could save some 30,000 lives and hundreds of billions of dollars.   I think this is a commonsense amendment. It is beyond my  comprehension how in the wealthiest nation in the world, with the  strongest economy, we have not been able to produce the personal  protective equipment--the masks, gowns, gloves--that our doctors and  nurses and medical personnel need. We have to do that, but we also have  to produce the masks that the American people need.   As everyone knows, over the past 3 months, the coronavirus has  infected more than 2.5 million Americans and caused nearly 130,000  deaths. More Americans have died from the coronavirus than were killed  fighting in the wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq combined.   Sadly, there is new evidence that this pandemic is far from over and  may kill many tens of thousands more. In the past few days, new COVID- 19 cases in the United States have increased dramatically--jumping to  their highest level in 2 months and returning to where they were at the  peak of the outbreak.   If we take bold action now, we could prevent tens of thousands of  Americans from dying. That is exactly what we have to do.  Unfortunately, the Trump administration continues to endanger millions  of Americans by ignoring the most basic recommendations of medical  professionals and recklessly downplaying the most effective tool we  have to contain the pandemic; that is, simply wearing a mask.   This amendment is nothing more than listening to science and saving  lives. Again, this morning, I participated in a hearing with Dr. Fauci  and many others from the Trump administration. They were very clear:  Masks work. Social distancing works. And we should listen to the  scientists.   We are, as I mentioned earlier, at a pivotal moment in American  history. We as elected officials have to respond in a transformational  way. We have to stand up for people. We have to rethink the way we have  done things in the past. The amendments I have offered begin the  process of changing American priorities. I hope all three of those  amendments will pass.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask to have printed in the  Record some of the finalist essays written by Vermont High School  students as part of the 10th annual ``State of the Union'', essay  contest conducted by my office.   The material follows:                Hussein Amuri, Winooski High School, Junior         ``Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses       yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming       shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift       my lamp beside the golden door!''        Emma Lazarus, a native-born American, included these       sentiments in the sonnet ``The New Colossus'' engraved on the       pedestal that supports the Statue of Liberty. The words and       the statue embody the greatness and intellect of this       country. I am a teenage immigrant from Tanzania, whose family       fled the Second Congo Civil War to enter the ``golden door.''       Those words are not just words to me, they represent my       reality. Yet, I think America is moving away from these       values, dishonoring the hard-won identity of countless       immigrants. I think America needs to reclaim these values       because diversity forms this country's strength and its path       to renaissance.        People fleeing wars, persecution, and conflict founded the       United States to build better lives. Our founders, like my       family, arrived poor and desperate. Today, however, Americans       attack newcomers, blame them for economic tribulations and       cultural disruption. Do we steal jobs and fail to pay taxes?       No, these so-called beliefs are myths. According to the       National Foundation for American Policy, 55% of the country's       $1 billion start-up companies-such as Uber, SpaceX, and       Avant--had at least one immigrant founder and each start-up       created more than 760 jobs. In my hometown of Winooski, we       have popular ethnic restaurants like Pho Dang Vietnamese Cafe       and Tiny Thai; grocery stores like Sagarthama Grocery and       Asian Market; businesses built and owned by immigrants, the       ``huddled masses yearning to breathe free.'' Many people from       around Vermont find job opportunities here, including myself.       Native-born Americans come to shop and enjoy themselves at       these shops and restaurants.        In 2017, working immigrant households paid $405 billion       dollars in taxes; DACAeligible residents paid $4 billion,       according to the New America Economy Coalition. Legal and       unauthorized immigrants pay taxes. Poor, ``wretched refuse,''       struggling in our home countries, we decided that America       offered more opportunities, and brought our cultures, ways of       life, and strong wills here. We enhance the economy and       introduce new perspectives to American life. My beautiful       mother hardly speaks English and works two jobs to support       herself and my brothers. She pays taxes. We see her seldom       because she's usually at work. From where we sit, she's       contributing a lot to the economy.        We are ``your tired, your poor.'' We are ``the homeless,       tempest-tost.'' We are here today and contributing to this       country. We are the New Colossus and represent the words       engraved on the pedestal supporting the Statue of Liberty.       Can we keep the legacy of this sonnet alive, a legacy that       truly defines this country's strength, roots to renaissance,       and diversity? Listen and acknowledge stories from my mother       and thousands of other immigrants. Those stories are full of       hardship and revitalization. In despair, we came to ``lift       our lamps, beside the golden door,'' and we found hope for       ourselves and the United States of America.             Maely Brightman, St. Johnsbury Academy, Sophomore         Today in many schools, students are receiving inadequet sex       education and it's negatively impacting their health and       well-being. In the United States only 24 states require       public schools to have sex education and 20 of them require       it to be medically accurate. The lack of coverage on subjects       such as safe sex, LGBTQ topics, menstruation, and body image       is damaging the well-being of today's youths.        Research shows that having accurate comprehensive sex       education classes leads to lower rates of teen pregnancy and       contracting an STI. Teens understand the importance of using       protection and contraceptives. In fact, NCLS states that       people age 15-25 make up 25% of the sexually active       population but the rate of them contracting is       disproportionately high. By teaching teens accurate       information, they have more knowledge to make safer       decisions. Medically accurate information has been shown to       have a higher influence than no sex education at all or       abstinence-until-marriage education.        It is also important that we do not just teach about       heterosexual intercourse, but have an LGBTQ inclusive       ciriculum. The lack of awareness and information about the       LGBTQ community leads to teens and adults who don't know how       to have safe same-sex intercourse. A surprising amount of       people don't know what a dental dam is. It's a protection       from STis when performing oral sex. Furthermore, teaching       children about healthy, normal LGBTQ relationships would help       normalize same-sex relationships and non-cisgender       identities. It is an important component in supporting LGBTQ       youth.        In addition, accurate sex education would help defeat the       stigma in teens, specifically boys, that surrounds       menstruation and other natural things that happen to girls       and boys during puberty. Because of society's influence, many       people end up believing that normal, healthy processes are       bad or gross. This can cause bullying, low self esteem, or       abuse. Sex education would help normalize these natural       occurances. That is why the government should require all       public schools to have medically accurate sex education       classes.        While it would be a difficult and long process, the outcome       would be worth the effort. Many people are against this idea,       under beliefs that kids shouldn't be exposed to the world yet       or for religious reasons, however by shielding them from the       truth parents ensure that their children have less knowledge       and information to rely on when they reach adulthood.       Typically in schools that teach sex education, they start in       middle school. I feel that it is a good starting point for       schools. The law would have to be changed at a federal level,       so that it affects the whole nation. This would be a tedious       process, however I believe it would bring a much needed       improvement for American youths.                 Isabelle Chen, Oxbow High School, Freshman         As everyone starts to shift into the next decade, there is       one prominent issue that can no longer be silenced. This       problem not only applies to Americans but includes every       living species who wanders this earth. Despite our state of       ignorance, earth has continuously given us telltale signs       that climate change is quickly altering our planet. Yet many       of us still refuse to see the consequences that climate       change has created thus far. Unstable air quality, increase       in hotter temperatures, and the rise of sea levels are a few       of the repercussions that mankind has generated. Before we       can solve other pressing matters like gun control or       inequality, we must make global warming our top priority, for       it is destroying the very ground we stand on.        According to NASA, the exploitation of fossil fuels is the       main driving force in the production of atmospheric carbon       dioxide. The action of burning fossil fuels leads to the       consolidation of carbon and oxygen in the air to forge CO2.       The depositing of excess CO2 in the atmosphere is solely       based upon human activities. We lack the action needed from       the government to prevent such happenings.  [[Page S4031]]       Additional grants and federal funding should go towards       companies whose mission is to use sustainable energy sources.       Those companies will improve further with the increased       funding and influence others to reject coal and oil for the       more sustainable utilization of solar energy, geothermal       energy, hydroelectric energy, etc. The cessation of fossil       fuel use will decrease stock and mass production for oil and       coal companies, ultimately weakening the usage of greenhouse       gases.        What also needs special attention drawn to is the       deliberation of entering America back into the Paris Climate       Agreement. The agreement states that all countries signed       into the arrangement will focus their efforts on the       prevention of global warming and greenhouse gas emissions.       Nearly 200 countries plus the European Union are currently in       the agreement. If America joins back into the Paris       Agreement, not only would we be establishing trust and a       working relationship alongside other countries, but America       would be delivering a message to all citizens living in it       that fighting climate change is crucial to the outcome of our       future. Not to mention, the United States is one of the most       vigorous advocates for climate action. We must not abandon       our efforts now in a time like this.        The world cannot prosper with the threat of climate change       looming over our heads. In the words of President Obama,       ``Climate change is no longer some far-off problem; it is       happening here, and it is happening now.'' Denial of the       present and our own ignorance to believe the earth will fix       itself will simply not stand. Acknowledging that climate       change is legitimate would be an essential element in       hindering the ongoing growth of global warming. Switching       over to viable energy sources and providing government       funding to sustainable corporations will decrease the       advancements of CO2 emissions by a large sum. This is our       planet, and we must protect our only home.                            ____________________
