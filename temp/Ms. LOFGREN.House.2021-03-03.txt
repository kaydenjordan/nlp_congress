 Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I disagree with this amendment. It would  strike section 4208 of H.R. 1 which requires online platforms to retain  records of certain online political advertisements. According to Forbes  magazine, political advertisers spent $1.6 billion online in the 2020  election--almost 10 times what they spent in 2012.   At a time when Americans are increasingly bombarded with political  ads online, striking this provision is not useful and would harm the  efforts of this bill to provide increased transparency in political  advertising. Fundamentally, Americans deserve to know who is paying for  online political ads to ensure that they are informed voters.   Digital advertising can also have a far greater reach than broadcast  advertising. Online political ads are relatively inexpensive to produce  and can be disseminated instantly to vast audiences across great  distances without regard to geographic boundaries. It is time for our  disclosure and disclaimer laws and regulations to be updated to reflect  how campaigns are run in the 21st century and how to keep pace with  changing technology.   The online platform records requirements in this section are key to  the Honest Ads Act, which is a part of H.R. 1, designed to improve  transparency in political advertising. By requiring online platforms to  retain copies of political ads, everyday Americans at home will be able  to see who is paying for what. These requirements are narrowly drawn  and only apply to online platforms with over 50 million monthly unique  visitors and to advertisers who run over $500 a year in political  advertisements.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the measure and  protect this important reform.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts  (Ms. Clark).    Mr. Speaker, I would just note that the late Justice  Scalia, who was not exactly one of our liberal beacons on the Court,  said this: ``Requiring people to stand up in public for their political  acts fosters civic courage, without which democracy is doomed.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Ms. Wasserman Schultz) for the purpose of a colloquy.    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to work with the gentlewoman as  this bill advances towards enactment.   Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I would urge a ``no''  vote on the Lesko amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 179, I rise to  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bloc of amendments provides important additions to  H.R. 1 that strengthen the bill and enhance voter access.   Among the amendments in the bloc is an amendment from the gentlewoman  from Virginia that would require foreign agent disclaimers to be  included on social media content. This increases transparency by  requiring disclaimers to be embedded on the face of a social media post  itself, and those disclaimers must remain whenever the post is  subsequently shared.   There are four amendments from the gentlewoman from California,  including one that addresses longstanding privacy concerns of survivors  of domestic and sexual abuse who want to register to vote but do not  want their personal information to be publicly accessible; and a second  that requires all in-person voting locations to have a sufficient  number of accessible voting machines for their voters.   There is an amendment from the gentleman from California that  clarifies prohibitions on polling places or ballot drop boxes that  falsely purport to be an official location established for an election.   I would note that, in California, the Republican Party in southern  California established drop boxes that purported to be from the  registrar of voters. That was deceptive. An agreement was reached with  the secretary of state that they could have the boxes, but they  couldn't hold themselves out to be the registrar of voters.   H.R. 1 calls for all States to provide same-day voter registration.  The gentlewoman from Michigan's amendment makes an important addition  that will help ensure the successful carrying out of this requirement:  States must ensure that they have adequate copies of registration forms  and other relevant voter registration at polling places.   There is an amendment from the gentleman from New York that requires  the GAO to conduct a study on voter turnout rates, broken down by age  in States and localities that permit voters to participate in elections  before the age of 18. This is an issue that merits examination, and  this amendment will ensure that Congress is fully equipped to debate  the issue.   There is an amendment from the gentlewoman from Illinois that would  require the GAO to review small-donor campaign financing to study the  extent to which the program increases opportunities for candidates of  diverse racial, gender, and socioeconomic backgrounds.   There is an amendment from the gentlewoman from Georgia that would  require the Director of the CFPB to work with the EAC to develop a  statement providing certain individuals with information regarding  voter registration and their voting rights. This commonsense reform  ensures that tenants and homeowners will have easy access to voter  registration and other voter-related information.   Finally, there is an amendment from the gentlewoman from California  that would ensure that the bill's prohibitions against election  disinformation cover false claims that voters will face civil and other  legal penalties for voting.   I support these amendments, and I urge their adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Underwood).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), my colleague on the Committee on the  Judiciary.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time each side has  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Spanberger).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Ms. Williams), who serves in the seat of our late, beloved  John Lewis.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close if the gentleman  is ready to yield back or use the rest of his time.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  secretary of state of Colorado, with a number of other secretary of  states, urging support for this bill; and a letter from former leaders  of the American Civil Liberties Union and concerned first amendment  scholars urging support.                                                     Jena Griswold,                                     Colorado Secretary of State,                                                      March 2, 2021.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leader Schumer, Speaker Pelosi, Leader McConnell, and       Leader McCarthy: It's no accident that the 2020 elections       were the most secure in American history. A monumental effort       by election administrators--from board of elections       officials, to county clerks, to poll workers--ensured our       country's democratic process was stronger than ever, even       with the unique challenge posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.        While the 2020 elections proved that our democracy is       resilient, the elections also showed us that they cannot be       taken for granted. Our elections were safe, secure, and       successful because countless patriotic Americans took action       to protect them. The policies that gave voters better options       to safely  [[Page H1036]]       register to vote and cast a ballot in the face of the       pandemic were a resounding success and must now be made       permanent.        Modernizing elections meant that eligible voters did not       have to choose between casting a ballot and risking their       health. It also resulted in record turnout for both parties.       Policies like vote-by mail for all and early voting saw       resounding success in states and municipalities across the       country. Now, only Congress can ensure that every eligible       voter across America has access to these voting options in       the future. That's why we need to immediately enact the For       The People Act (H.R. 1) into law.        The For The People Act offers a comprehensive path to       securing and modernizing American democracy for generations       to come. The bill provides clear guidance for all 50 states       and the District of Columbia to implement election processes       that work for administrators and voters alike, and its       adoption into law is critical to the future of American       elections. Proven policies such as automatic and same-day       voter registration will remove administrative obstacles for       eligible voters while maintaining up-to-date and accurate       voter rolls. Voter-verified paper ballots will ensure every       vote is accurately recorded and allow administrators to run       key audits to verify election results. Other provisions, such       as independent redistricting commissions to combat       gerrymandering and shining light on dark money, will further       strengthen the integrity of our elections.        As the chief elections officials in our respective states,       and as the administrators who will be tasked with executing       many of the policies proposed in H.R. 1, we can confidently       state that this bill is designed to make our democracy       stronger and safer than ever. We proudly and firmly support       the For The People Act, and we strongly recommend its passage       in the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate.            Sincerely,        Katie Hobbs, Arizona Secretary of State; Shirley Weber,       California Secretary of State; Jena Griswold, Colorado       Secretary of State; Denise Merrill, Connecticut Secretary of       State; Kimberly Bassett, Secretary of the District of       Columbia; Shenna Bellows, Maine Secretary of State; Jocelyn       Benson, Michigan Secretary of State; Steve Simon, Minnesota       Secretary of State; Maggie Toulouse Oliver, New Mexico       Secretary of State; Shemia Fagan, Oregon Secretary of State;       Nellie Gorbea, Rhode Island Secretary of State; Jim Condos,       Vermont Secretary of State.                                   ____           Former Leaders of the American Civil Liberties Union and             Concerned First Amendment Scholars,                                                 February 18, 2021.      Re H.R. 1, For the People Act.       Hon. Zoe Lofgren,      Chair, House Administration Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. John Sarbanes,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chair, House Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Lofgren, Chair Nadler, and Rep. Sarbanes: The       undersigned are former leaders of the American Civil       Liberties Union (ACLU) and concerned academics who have       devoted much of their careers to the defense of the First       Amendment and the protection of American democracy. We write       in support of speedy House enactment of H.R.1, the For the       People Act.        American democracy is at a perilous crossroads. H.R.1       responds with sweeping reforms countering voter suppression       and partisan gerrymandering that have targeted communities of       color; overhauling our deeply inequitable campaign finance       system; and reducing the influence of secret ``dark money''       in federal elections. We view H.R. 1 as the most significant       prodemocracy legislation since the Voting Rights Act of 1965.        Some have argued that despite the overwhelmingly positive       content of H.R.1, enactment should be delayed in the House       pending legislative hearings and efforts to amend certain       provisions in the 700-page legislation, especially provisions       requiring disclosure of the identities of large donors to       tax-exempt organizations operating on the margins of       electoral politics We agree that, ordinarily, best       legislative practice would call for hearings designed to       resolve First Amendment concerns over important legislation.       But, given the importance of shoring up the democratic       process, the limited window of opportunity for passage of       H.R.1, the likely delay in Senate consideration, and the       nature of the First Amendment objections to disclosure, we       believe that immediate passage of H.R.1 in its present form       is the preferable course of action.        Objectors to immediate passage of HR 1 appear to us to: (1)       underestimate the risks to enacting HR 1 posed by substantial       delay in House passage; (2) understate the importance of       closing loopholes in our campaign finance disclosure laws;       and (3) overstate the risks to First Amendment freedom posed       by the bill's disclosure provisions. We live in a democratic       culture saturated by great wealth. The Supreme Court has       rendered it almost impossible to directly regulate the role       of money in determining electoral outcomes. One of the few       practical reform windows left open is public disclosure of       the sources of money-driven influence over electoral       politics. Such disclosure is important, not only to prevent       corruption, but to allow ordinary citizens to evaluate the       truth of electoral speech by knowing who is paying for it. We       recognize the need to preserve anonymity for persons whose       speech or association might be deterred by fear of       disclosure. That is why the H.R.1 disclosure rules apply.       only to large donations exceeding $10,000. Moreover, current       First Amendment doctrine already provides an ``as applied''       exception to disclosure rules if a genuine fear of       retaliatory action were to exist.        In short, we do not view First Amendment concerns over the       precise scope of disclosure requirements affecting large       donors to tax exempt organizations operating on the margins       of electoral politics as outweighing the need for expeditious       enactment of the clearly desirable aspects of H.R.1 into law.        We urge you to press for speedy enactment of H.R. 1 in its       current form.        Respectfully submitted,        Aryeh Neier, President Emeritus of the Open Society       Foundations, ACLU Executive Director, 1970-78; Burt Neuborne,       Norman Dorsen Professor of Civil Liberties Emeritus at NYU       School of Law, ACLU National Legal Director, 1981-86; Helen       Hershkoff, Herbert Mand.

Levi Distinguished Service       Professor of Law and former Dean of the University of Chicago       Law School.     Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I appreciate that the ranking member has shown us this chart because  he has proven that all of the Republican Members claiming that there  was tax money funding the pilot project for the small matching donors  were wrong.   This is a pilot project that is funded by an additional fine on  corporate wrongdoing. It doesn't take money away from anything else. It  is an additional fine that, if H.R. 1 doesn't pass, will not be  imposed.   I was interested to hear our colleague from New Jersey say it is your  money that will be used. Well, it is only your money if you are a  corporate malfeasance individual, a corporate wrongdoer that gets  fined; and I don't think very many of us have sympathy for that crew.   I would like to just give some perspective here because all over the  United States, because of the pandemic, efforts were made to allow for  people to vote and not have to endanger their health. So absentee  voting became more of the norm. There were more early voting efforts, a  lot of things of that nature, because of the pandemic.   And what happened?   There was a huge increase in turnout, both among Republicans and  Democrats. It was a safe and secure election, the most safe and secure  election in modern history. There wasn't a bunch of fraud.   Some of my colleagues said that people don't trust our system.   Why is that?   Because there are politicians in this country that are misleading the  American public about that election. And I would say the former  President is first among them, telling things that are not true and  convincing people of that.   So now that we have had this huge turnout because of the pandemic, we  are seeing States--Republicans, I must say, unfortunately, all over the  United States trying to cut off access to the ballot.   In Georgia, they just passed a whole slew of voter restriction  measures to try and tamp down turnout, and we see hundreds of bills  being introduced to do that.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this en bloc and on the underlying bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that in the  engrossment of H.R. 1, the Clerk be authorized to correct section  numbers, punctuation, spelling, and cross-references and to make such  other technical and conforming changes as may be necessary to reflect  the actions of the House.
