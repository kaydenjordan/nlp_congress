 Mr. Speaker, I thank the able Chairman Scott for allowing  me this 1 minute, and I congratulate him on this legislation, also to  Chairwoman Lowey on a related bill, and Chairwoman DeLauro.   I rise in support of the Child Care Is Essential Act and the Child  Care for Economic Recovery Act.   Parents in our communities want and need quality, affordable  childcare. Since the Childcare and Development Block Grant's enactment  in 1990, the program has been the largest source of financial  assistance to families struggling to afford childcare.   Today, the need for childcare assistance in this country has never  been greater, and coronavirus has made the situation so much worse. In  Ohio, the average annual cost of infant care is $9,697 a year. That is  a staggering $808 a month, which is unattainable for the majority of  families in Ohio.   With the ongoing pandemic, there could not be a better time for  Congress to make investments in stabilizing the childcare sector to  support providers, workers, and families they serve.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  additional time.   The Child Care for Economic Recovery Act adds to and modifies tax  provisions allowing for an increase and refundable child and dependent  care tax credit, allows employers payroll tax credits, while also  increasing the general funding for childcare entitlement under the  Social Security Act.   Furthermore, the Child Care Is Essential Act allows providers to use  stabilization grants to support personnel pay and benefits,  sanitization and PPE, training and professional development, and mental  health services. According to the Economic Policy Institute, investing  in children could increase economic recovery by $5.6 billion in new  economic activity in Ohio alone.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support these important bills.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Water Resources  Development Act.   This bill, which was artfully and carefully drafted by Chairman  DeFazio and the chair of the Water Resources and Environment  Subcommittee, Congresswoman Napolitano, enjoys broad bipartisan  support.   In particular, this bill includes provisions that will protect the  Great Lakes, which contain 90 percent of North America's fresh surface  water.   It includes a specific authorization of the invasive species control  system at Brandon Road Lock and Dam. Once completed, Brandon Road will  prevent Asian carp and other invasive species from entering the Great  Lakes.   The Great Lakes delegation has fought for that authorization for  nearly a decade. Since 2010, when Congress authorized the Great Lakes  interbasin study, our delegation has worked for a long-term and basin- wide solution to the threat posed by the Asian carp.   Today's authorization is not the end, but it sends a bipartisan and  clear message to our Nation that we take the protection of America's  greatest $7 billion recreational, fishery, and freshwater system  seriously.   In addition to the bill's commitment to the Brandon Road project, I  also commend the committee and its chair for taking important steps  updating requirements for resiliency, embedding beneficial reuse into  the Corps' project development process, and investing and rebuilding  the Nation's water infrastructure for the 21st century, all of which  will create good jobs across this Nation.   Let me applaud Chairman DeFazio and the ranking member for their  careful work to develop a bipartisan bill. The Water Resources  Development Act of 2020 enjoys broad support and will ensure our  Nation's continued prosperity.                                time  1430
