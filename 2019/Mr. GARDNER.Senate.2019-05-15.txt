 Mr. President, Kendrick Castillo was an 18-year-old  senior set to graduate high school at the end of the week when his life  was tragically cut short. On Tuesday, May 7, Kendrick Castillo sat in  his British literature class, just like any other day in school, when  two schoolmates burst into a classroom at the STEM school in Highlands  Ranch and opened fire.   When faced with the unthinkable, Kendrick acted out of pure heroism  as he put his classmates' lives before his own and charged the  shooters. A classmate of Kendrick's described his heroism by telling  NBC News about his actions, ``giving all of us enough time to get  underneath our desks, to get ourselves safe, and to run across the room  to escape.''   Brendan Bialy, a classmate who charged the assailants with Kendrick,  told ABC News:         Kendrick Castillo died a legend. He died a trooper. I know       he will be with me for the rest of my life.    John Castillo reflected on his son's actions by saying:         He did what he had to do, and I knew that was my son's       nature. That was who he was.    Kendrick Castillo displayed courage well beyond his years. He was a  member of the robotics club and wanted to study electrical engineering  in college and loved spending his free time fishing and camping.   Today, Colorado mourns the loss of a hero as we say good-bye to  Kendrick Castillo. As his friends, family, and community all gather at  Highlands Ranch for a final farewell, we must pledge to never forget  this young man. Kendrick Castillo lost his life saving his fellow  classmates. The students of the STEM school in Highlands Ranch  experienced an absolute tragedy and showed fearlessness well beyond  their years as they took charge in the face of danger.   Now is the time to come together in tragedy to rise above it and  remind every single student at that school that we love them, we are  with them, and we will never forget them.   I also want to take a moment to honor the first responders who, once  again, displayed true bravery in their response to this tragedy. The  deputies of the Douglas County Police Department, South Metro Fire  Rescue, and all of the neighboring first responders on the scene acted  quickly to help stabilize the situation and lead the students and  faculty to safety.   This week is National Police Week, a fitting time to reflect on those  who protect our sons and daughters every day.                             National Police Week    Mr. President, in Washington, DC, this week, we are celebrating  National Police Week, a time we take each year to thank law enforcement  for protecting our communities and to remember the cost of providing  this comfort.   Today, thousands of officers and their families will gather on the  west front lawn of the Capitol to participate in the 38th Annual Peace  Officers' Memorial Service, an event to honor all of those we have lost  in the line of duty.   I hope the camaraderie and support they have experienced during the  ceremony and throughout the week will bring a bit of comfort to law  enforcement and our law enforcement community. I also hope it  demonstrates the tremendous gratitude that we all have for these  sacrifices.   Police Week also serves to show the law enforcement community that  the  [[Page S2863]]  lawmakers in Washington have their back. We will continue to help  departments all over the country afford lifesaving equipment, like  bulletproof vests to help as many officers as possible return home  safely every day. In fact, just this week, the Senate is working on  legislation to make sure we are providing lifesaving equipment through  the Bulletproof Vest Grant Program. We are also working on legislation  this week that will help address mental health needs, not just for law  enforcement officers themselves but for their families, as well,  because we know the pressure and strain that this duty can create and  put upon the family.   I know my colleagues in the Senate will join me in thanking the many  officers who have joined us in Washington this week. Their bravery and  courage allow all of us to enjoy the safety and security we so often  take for granted. It should not take a tragedy for any of us to reach  out to a police officer, EMS, or a firefighter, to thank them for their  work, and to let them know their bravery does not go unnoticed.   Yesterday I had the honor of joining the Colorado memorial ceremony  at the fallen officers' memorial. There have been 320 Coloradans over  the years who have been added to the fallen officers' memorial. That is  320 too many. Four were added this week: Adams County deputy Heath  Gumm, El Paso County deputy Micah Flick, Las Animas County sergeant  Matthew Moreno, and Littleton police officer Kevin Denner.   One of the most poignant moments at the ceremony yesterday was the  comment made by a police officer who spoke to a widow of a fallen  officer, who said: Support for the law enforcement community is needed  long after the bagpipes have played. I think that is what we have to do  as colleagues together. While the pomp and ceremony memorials end, it  is after the bagpipes have finished that we must continue to stand with  the men and women on that blue line of service to our communities.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and shall be in a period of morning  business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes  each.    Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to  meet during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.

If there is no business to come before the Senate, I ask  that it stand adjourned under the previous order.
