 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as we consider the appropriations minibus  this week, I rise to emphasize once again the importance of  acknowledging and addressing the threat of interference in our election  systems. In particular, Congress must address the continuing threat of  Russian hybrid attacks against our democratic institutions.   It is difficult to overstate the need to shore up support for  democratic institutions here, and around the world, in light of  President Trump's recent foreign policy failures. In the last week or  so, the President has attempted to derail the NATO summit by insulting  our allies and demanding that they immediately double their  contributions, thrown a wrench into Brexit negotiations and seemingly  endorsed a new Prime Minister for the United Kingdom, and then embraced  Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki.   President Trump stood shoulder to shoulder with President Putin,  while the world looked on, and chose to take the word of an autocrat  and KGB agent over the assessments of the American Intelligence  Community on Russia's interference in our elections. By indulging  President Putin's fabrications, he also gave credence to Putin's  propaganda on Crimea and Syria, Russia's use of chemical agents against  civilians, and its violations of its arms control obligations. This  failure to stand up for America's interests and those of our allies and  partners was a dereliction of the President's responsibilities that  will continue to undermine our national security.   President Trump's erratic and divisive actions are undermining that  which makes us strong. Our Nation, our allies, and our partners around  the world benefit from the world order that the United States created  after World War II. We draw strength from our allies and from  participation in international institutions. We are not weakened by  them; we are strengthened by them.   While the President later took low-energy steps to walk back and  obfuscate his words on Russian interference, he soon took to Twitter  again to aggressively attempt to discredit the investigations into  Russian election interference and into his own campaign.   Regardless of what President Trump may say or tweet, we must be  absolutely clear: The threat of Russian interference in our democracy  is not a ``hoax'' or a ``witch hunt,'' and Congress and the States must  act now to  [[Page S5322]]  address the real threat of another foreign intrusion into our  elections.   Indeed, the findings of the intelligence community's assessment were  clear, and I quote:         We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an       influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential       election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in       the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and       harm her electability and potential presidency.    This problem is not behind us. Indeed, President Trump should listen  to the national security officials whom he appointed and a Republican- controlled Senate confirmed. The Director of National Intelligence,  former Republican Senator Dan Coats, issued multiple public warnings  this month, including stating that the warning signs about Russian  cyber attacks ahead of our midterm elections are, in his words,  ``blinking red again,'' akin to before 9/11. Last week, FBI Director  Christopher Wray stated: ``Russia attempted to interfere with the last  election and . . . continues to engage in malign influence operations  to this day.'' When asked last week whether Russia is still targeting  the United States, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen  Nielsen said: that the United States ``would be foolish to think [the  Russians] are not. They have the capability. They have the will. We've  got to be prepared.''   The private sector also validates these concerns. At last week's  Aspen Security Forum panel, Tom Burt, Microsoft's Vice President of  Customer Security and Trust, told an audience that Microsoft already  has detected cyber attacks against three candidates running for  Congress this fall. These attacks looked very much like those phishing  attacks that Russian agents used against Democrats in 2016.    This Chamber faces a stark choice: We can listen to the American  Intelligence Community and nonpartisan experts, acknowledge the  indictments and guilty pleas of 32 people and 3 companies by the  special counsel, and heed the ongoing warnings of Republican national  security official--all of whom agree that our democracy is under  attack. Or we can trust the words of Vladimir Putin, online trolls and  conspiracy theorists, and President Trump--who insist in the face of  evidence that Russia is not attacking our democracy. For my part, I  don't think that is a very difficult choice.   Securing our elections should not be a partisan issue. Election  security is national security, and the States need our help to defend  our elections against these attacks. The fiscal year 2018 omnibus  included $380 million in State election security grants, and all 55  eligible States and territories requested funding. To date, 100 percent  of the funds have been requested and 90 percent of the funds have been  disbursed. Yet concerns remain.   On Monday, 21 state attorneys general, including the Attorney General  of my home State of Rhode Island, wrote to the House and Senate to ask  for additional assistance to secure the 2018 midterm elections against  cyber attacks. I understand Senator Leahy intends to offer an amendment  to the Financial Services and General Government title of the minibus  legislation this week that would provide $250 million in additional  State election security grants. These grants could provide States  additional and much needed resources to update voting equipment and  secure election systems. I am a cosponsor of this amendment and believe  that Congress should pass it and continue to listen to the States and  take further steps to ensure that our foundational democratic  institutions are secure against foreign actors.   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment.   Amtrak's Long-Distance Routes serve as critical connections on our  national rail network in 39 States and the District of Columbia. In  fact, they are the only intercity trains in 24 States where Amtrak  operates. In many parts of the country, Amtrak is the only affordable  option for long-distance travel, particularly for the elderly and  people with disabilities.   Senator Collins and I have worked in a very bipartisan fashion to  fund Amtrak's National Network at record levels over the past 2 fiscal  years, and this bill provides $1.29 billion to continue those services.   Amtrak should use this funding to improve the quality and service of  Long-Distance Routes around the country. I urge my colleagues to  support this amendment.    Mr. President, I join my chairman, Senator Collins, in  requesting that all of our colleagues file their amendments by 1 p.m.  tomorrow afternoon so that we can continue to make progress on this  bill. Again, I thank the chairman for her great leadership.   With that, I yield the floor.
