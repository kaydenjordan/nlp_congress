 Mr. Speaker, she was born at evening time as a full  Moon rose over Texas. Ivy Frances Shoemaker joined the world weighing 7  pounds and was 20 inches long. Her birth was on May 9 in Dallas.   The miracle of birth is God's blessing to the rest of us. It is a  blessing to Ivy's parents, Kellee and Anthony, and her sisters, Olivia  and Rosalyn.   Ivy, of course, is a beautiful, smart-looking baby. She has the  privilege to be born to wonderful parents who will raise her to grow in  widsom and stature in the Lord.   My wife, Carol, and I are the proud grandparents of Ivy, whom I will  call from time to time, number 12.   Mr. Speaker, you see, I refer to my other grandchildren by their  birth numbers as well. There are 11 of them.   My hope for Ivy is that she sees the importance of being good to  others; that she makes the world a better place; that she is faithful  to the Lord; that she appreciates her heritage; and that, of course,  she always lives in Texas.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding me  time, and I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their  comments on this legislation. The bill promotes religious freedom  throughout the world.   Mr. Speaker, as has been mentioned, it has been 60 to 70 years since  the Jewish community in Europe was decimated by the Holocaust. Now,  more than ever, the Jewish community is under assault yet again.   In Europe, anti-Semitic individuals are back like never before. A  study commissioned by the German parliament this year found that there  were 644 anti-Semitic offenses in the country in 2016 alone.   In countries like Holland, Jewish schools and synagogues need to be  protected by special forces because of fear of attack on those schools.   And, unfortunately, our country has not been immune. Jewish community  centers across the country have been targets of bomb threats, even  recently in Houston, Texas, my hometown, such bomb threats.   This past Sunday, a historic synagogue in New York City was attacked  and burned down by arsonists. That is why this bill, the Combating  European Anti-Semitism Act, is so important. We must continue to  partner with our European friends to ensure that we stamp out the  cancer of anti-Semitism.   As a representative of a country founded on religious freedom, we, as  Members of Congress, must send a clear message to Jews and non-Jews,  from Houston to Amsterdam, that we will not allow the horrors of the  Holocaust to repeat themselves in this generation.   Mr. Speaker, we must reiterate the commitment the free world made  over 60 years ago: Never again. Never again.   And that is just the way it is.                                time  1630     Thank you, Sheriff.   I appreciate your comments, Lawyer Gowdy; as I call him, his  comments.   I know that the outlaws in Washington State are glad you are in  Congress and you are not back in Washington arresting them and putting  them in the jailhouse where a lot of them belong. But thank you for the  opportunity to speak at this very important Special Order.   As you know, while you were a sheriff in Washington, I was down at  the courthouse in Texas, first as a prosecutor, like Lawyer Gowdy, and  then, for 22 years, I tried criminal cases, felonies, everything from  stealing to killing.   I met a lot of police, as I call them, during that time. Some of  them, as Mr. Gowdy has pointed out, gave their lives in the line of  duty. I met them in the middle of the night when they would come  bringing a warrant to me to sign so they could go arrest somebody while  the rest of us all slept. They are doing what they do best, and that is  protecting and serving our communities.   A lot of police officers--and I don't think it has been said yet-- their job is being a police officer, but most of them have other jobs  just to make ends meet. They have an extra job, as we call it, because  they don't make a lot being a police officer. None of them ever do it  for the money--none of them anywhere in the world do it for the money.  So to support their families, they have to have other jobs to do that.   I think we as a nation need to understand and appreciate that they do  what they do because they feel, and it is, an important service to our  community.   Last year, 135 police officers throughout the Nation were killed; 64  of them were shot and killed, and 21 of those were ambushed.   Among the States, my home State of Texas had the most police officers  killed. Twenty-one were killed last year in the line of duty. We also  had five canines that were killed that worked with police.   I have here a photograph--or a poster of the 21 officers killed in  the line of duty in the State of Texas last year; all races, both  sexes, all ages throughout the State of Texas. Last year, we saw  probably more than I can remember, this phenomena of hate and ambush of  police officers.                                time  1915    On July 7, 2016, five Dallas police officers were shot and killed as  they were protecting a protest demonstration in downtown Dallas.   What occurred was a sniper who had been preparing, obviously for some  time, was watching this procession go by and he opened fire on those  police officers. Other than 9/11, this was the most deadliest day for  police officers in the United States.   Shortly before 9 p.m., a domestic terrorist--and I am not going to  give his name. His name is not important. The names of the officers are  what is important--parked his black SUV on Lamar Street. He put on his  body armor. He got his automatic weapon ready to fire, and he started  stalking Dallas police officers.   As those Dallas police officers and a DART officer--DART is Dallas  Area Rapid Transit officer--marched along with the protesters, he  opened fire on them with the intent to kill as many as he could. So  gunfire rang out and bullets struck and killed Senior Corporal Lorne  Ahrens, Officer Michael Krol, Officer Patrick Zamarripa, and three  Dallas police officers were wounded, along with a civilian.   But the sniper wasn't through yet. He headed back up Lamar Street-- and that is in downtown Dallas--shooting out the windows of a nearby  college campus, El Centro College campus. During that time, he injured  two El Centro College police officers trying to get into the school.   He had continued on his quest to kill officers and he snuck up behind  a DART officer--his name, Brent Thompson--and shot him in the back and  killed him. He then turned his way on to Elm Street nearby and shot his  way back into El Centro College.   All of this took about 20 minutes. Police officers were following  this sniper, trying to capture him, but this individual went up to the  library in the school and started firing down. His next victim was  Officer Michael Smith, and he injured yet another DART officer.   He was cornered in the library. Chief of Police Brown said: During  that 2-hour-long negotiation, the individual lied to us, played games,  laughed at us, sang, and continually asked how many of those coppers  did he kill?   Eventually, the Dallas SWAT team took care of the sniper, and he was  killed.   In total, five officers were killed, seven others were wounded. And  these officers were killed for the sole reason that they wore a  uniform, that they wore a badge or a star over their heart, symbolizing  protecting us from the do-bads. That is why that badge is there over  their heart. They were willing to give their life so that we might have  peace, order, and safety; and on that day, five of them did.   In total, like I mentioned, 21 officers were killed in Texas last  year, the most in any State. I include in the Record their full  background and the departments that they worked with.   Their names are: Officer David Hofer, Patrolman David Ortiz, Trooper  Jeffrey Nichols, Border Patrol Agent Jose Barraza, Officer Endy  Ekpanya, Sergeant Stacey Baumgartner, Officer Calvin McCullers, Jr.,  Sergeant Michael Smith, Officer Michael Krol, Officer Patricio  Zamarripa, Officer Brent Thompson, Senior Corporal Lorne Bradley  Ahrens, Officer Marco Zarate, Correctional Officer Mari Johnson,  Officer Justin Ryan Scherlen, Officer Amir Abdul-Khaliq, Deputy Sheriff  Kenneth Maltby, Corporal Robert Ransom, Border Patrol Agent David  Gomez, Commander Kenneth Starrs, and Detective Benjamin Marconi.

Lastly, I would like to mention one other officer whose name I read.  His name was Sergeant Stacey Baumgartner. He worked at a little bitty  police department called Patton Village in Texas, right outside of  Houston, and he was killed when his patrol car collided with another  vehicle while he was involved in a hot pursuit.   He is survived by his wife, his son, and his daughter, Chloe. This is  a photograph of Chloe taken last week in Austin, Texas, at the Texas  Peace Officers Memorial Service event. This is her. It was posted by  the police chief of Patton Village, Texas. It expresses the families,  the humanity of their fathers and their mothers, and how we as a people  need to understand the consequences when people murder our finest.   God bless the thin blue line.   And that is just the way it is.
