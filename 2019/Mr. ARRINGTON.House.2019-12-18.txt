 Madam Speaker, today, many of my Democratic colleagues  will be making history, unfortunately, for supporting the first-ever  completely partisan impeachment of a President of the United States.   Madam Speaker, I am deeply disturbed that history will indeed be made  today in this hallowed Chamber, but for all the wrong reasons: not for  love of country, but hatred for a political foe; not to pursue justice,  but to punish a political adversary; not to seek truth, but to seize  political power.   Madam Speaker, for the love of country, I urge my colleagues to  oppose this disastrous political ruse.
