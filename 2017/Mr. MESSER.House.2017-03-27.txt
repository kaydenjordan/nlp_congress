 Mr. Speaker, Hoosiers don't like ObamaCare, and they have  worked hard for 6 years to stop it: electing a Republican House  majority, a Republican Senate majority, and, eventually, President  Trump, all on the promise to repeal and replace this failed law.  [[Page H2448]]    That is what has made last week's failure to vote in the House so  disheartening. It is inside baseball, politics as usual, and it is not  okay.   It is not okay to the millions of families facing soaring premiums  and worse health care under ObamaCare, and it shouldn't be okay to any  of us. We cannot walk away now without even a vote with so much at  stake.   This debate has gotten really complicated, but to me, it is really  simple. We need to do what we said we would do: keep our promise to the  American people, and repeal this failed law with something better.                            ____________________
