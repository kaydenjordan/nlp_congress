 Mr. Speaker, Elks Lodge 2839, in greater Cape May,  South Jersey, recently won first place in the Division IV ENF  Chairman's Challenge at the National Convention. It was also named  number one in the entire State of New Jersey.   Anne Krause, the lodge's ENF chairperson, is truly a dedicated member  whose leadership has helped make this Elks Lodge the very best of its  kind.   Elks Lodges help our community by offering programs to keep children  healthy and to keep them drug-free. They also meet the needs of  veterans and help improve the quality of their life, work that is so  much needed in today's times.   In addition to these services, Elks Lodges have a generous charitable  foundation that gives millions of dollars in scholarships each year to  help shape the future of the community of our children.   I feel very lucky to have such a well-run community center as a place  for people to come to gather, to grow closer in our beautiful district.   To all the members and staff of Elks Lodge 2839: Congratulations on  your awards, and thank you for all you bring to our community. South  Jersey is proud of you; New Jersey is proud of you; and the United  States of America is proud of you.   God bless you.                            ____________________
