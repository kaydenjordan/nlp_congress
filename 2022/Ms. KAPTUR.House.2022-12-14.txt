 Madam Speaker, this week, gas prices in Toledo, Ohio,  fell to $2.87 a gallon. Am I the only person in Congress noticing gas  prices are falling? Hello?   The best part is that this gasoline is derived from energy reserves  that are brought up from the Utica and Marcellus shale located right in  Ohio near the border with Pennsylvania and West Virginia. This means  transport costs to market are less. How about that?   What America produces and makes, produces and makes America. Powering  our Nation from inside our country means importing less.   Just yesterday, the Department of Energy made a historic announcement  about the achievement of fusion ignition at Livermore National  Laboratory.   America is making great strides to unleash the future of energy. When  America innovates, she is able to stand on her own two feet.   Inside our borders, we must secure energy independence and good- paying jobs through distributed generation, solar, fusion, hydrogen,  biofuels, advanced nuclear, and more.   Energy security is national security. Let's keep working to make our  country energy secure with the good jobs that go with it, both for  today and the tomorrows to come.   Onward, energy progress.
