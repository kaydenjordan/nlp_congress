 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join with the Armenian  community to commemorate the 103rd anniversary of the Armenian Genocide  with my colleague, Congressman  David Valadao. We both represent a  large constituency of Armenians in the San Joaquin Valley.   On April 24, 1915, the Ottoman Empire began to systematically deport  and kill 1.5 million Armenians, sending them to their death. It was  systematic, it was planned. But as history has shown, the Armenian  people are stronger than any attack, even genocide; the first genocide  in the 20th century, by the way.   Many Armenians settled in California's San Joaquin Valley, where I  was raised, and now I have the honor to represent. I heard their  stories of their losses with their families, but I also saw their  determination, their joy, and their strength, and their contributions  to our community and to our Nation.   The Armenian people show us that we must move forward, but we must  never forget where we are from and who we are; therefore, the Congress  and the President must, sooner than later, officially go on record  recognizing the Armenian Genocide.   Tonight, I stand with the Armenian people and commemorate their  spirit. As we move forward, we must never forget.                            ____________________
