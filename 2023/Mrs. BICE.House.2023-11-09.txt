 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to say good- bye to Ava Forrester, one of the last World War II Rosie the Riveters.  Ava worked on the left wing of the C-47 cargo transport aircraft in  Oklahoma City.   I had the tremendous honor of meeting Ava on her 105th birthday this  last April. She was optimistic about life, willing to try anything, and  funny, too.   It is imperative that we remember the legacies of women like Ava, who  stepped up to serve her country in a time of need. Their work allowed  the American war effort to be successful and powered an unprecedented  age of American ingenuity.   It seems only fitting that as we approach Veterans Day, I have the  blessing to recognize Mrs. Forrester. Rest in peace, Ava.                            ____________________
