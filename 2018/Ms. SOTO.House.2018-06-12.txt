 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Demings for bringing up  something that I know has troubled all Orlandoans right now, which is a  day before the second annual remembrance of the Pulse nightclub  shooting, we had a standoff where four children were killed. It is a  testament to the fact that there is so much left to be done.   Next I want to talk about Christopher Hansen. Christopher Hansen is a  survivor of the Pulse nightclub shooting. That night, he personally  helped save the lives of those around him by assisting injured victims.    Mr. Hansen is now a member of the Pride Fund to End Gun Violence's  board of advisors. Pride Fund works towards supporting candidates on  the Federal and State level who will promote gun reform and advocate  for LGBTQ safety and equality. Pride Fund is currently America's only  LGBTQ organization that focuses solely on gun policy reform to ensure  safety for all.   Through his own recovery, Hansen has found a home in a community  which he recently joined months before the shootings. He has become a  spokesperson for the memory of those killed at the Pulse nightclub and  a central figure of support for survivors and everyone affected by the  tragedy.   In an op-ed for the Orlando Weekly, Christopher writes: ``It started  with an invitation. An invitation to a popular gay nightclub in  Orlando, Florida: Pulse. In preparation for my night out, I decided to  see a movie--'The Conjuring 2'--a horror movie based on a true story.  Little did I know that I would have a night of horror of my own. And my  night of painting the town red would be drenched in blood.   ``Before the attack, I was having the time of my life. I was tearing  up the dance floor and mingling with fellow club-goers. Then everything  changed. I heard three loud booms, but I didn't think much of it. I  continued dancing, thinking it was the base from the music and not the  sound of gunshots. By the time I realized what was happening, screams,  smoke, and flashing lights filled the club. People were rushing toward  me, desperately looking for exits and places to hide. I followed the  crowds and moved past the bathroom where people were hiding. I managed  to get out unscathed. There was a pause in gunfire, and I was compelled  to go back. Before I knew it, the gunfire started again, and I watched  two men heading towards the hospital--one was shot twice. I urged his  friend to keep him calm as I tried to stop the bleeding. I took my  bandana off and wrapped it around one bullet wound, and pressed my hand  on the other, praying he wouldn't die. I kept him level on the curb  until an ambulance arrived.   ``I turned and saw a girl in the grass, begging to be moved because  she couldn't get up. We were told not to move her to avoid further  injury, but I couldn't ignore her cries. I picked her up and her body  became cold. I put her on my lap, which saved her life; she was shot in  the back, and my thigh pressed against her wound. As she began to fall  asleep, I slapped her face and asked her questions. Through keeping her  awake, I learned her name was Kalisha, and she was a 19-year-old from  Ohio.''   Just 19 years old.   ``A man came to me and said I saved him as well, but I didn't  remember; everything became a blur.   ``I wanted to help as many people as I could, but I was later told to  leave since I wasn't a professionally trained paramedic. My phone died  earlier that night and my wallet was still in the club. Without a way  to contact loved ones or money to get home, I walked the streets of  Orlando covered in blood. I feared for my life that night and felt  helpless and alone. I thought about the victims who were still there  and the families who would learn their loved ones never made it home.   ``That night, I met the mother of a victim I had seen hiding in the  bathroom. She showed me his frantic text messages. His name was Eddie  Justice, and he was killed in that very bathroom. The girls I met that  night, Akyra Murray, Tiara Parker, and Patience Carter, were hiding in  the same bathroom--all three had been shot.  [[Page H5081]]  Akyra, who just graduated from high school and was ready to attend  Mercyhurst University in the fall on a basketball scholarship, had  died. At 18 years old, she was the youngest Pulse victim.''   18 years old. We lost her.                                time  2000    ``Her life was drastically cut short due to gun violence and someone  with easy access to military-style assault weapons.   ``Forty-nine people lost their lives that night, and another 38,000  will lose their life this year to senseless gun violence. I've joined  Pride Fund's Board of Advisors so I can be a voice for the survivors  and victims of Pulse, Las Vegas, and every shooting to come.   ``Pride Fund's mission to save lives starts by supporting candidates  on the Federal and State level who will act on sensible gun reform and  champion for LGBTQ safety and equality. Pride Fund and I are turning  tragedy into action''--they are also honoring these victims with  action--``through a focus on commonsense gun reforms like enacting  background checks, limiting ammunition sales, and preventing those  convicted of hate crimes from purchasing guns.   ``Members of Congress, reluctant as they are to cross the NRA, can  effect change. They can address the easy access to assault weapons,  large-capacity magazines, and ammunition sales. They can address our  safety, rather than focusing instead on the safety of their own seats,  courtesy of NRA cash.   ``If Members of Congress won't prioritize our safety, then we have  the power to find those that will.''   Those are powerful words by Christopher Hansen of the Orlando Weekly,  so I want to take a few minutes about action.   First, I want to talk about gun reform actions and lack of actions on  the Federal and on the State level. On the Federal level, we have had  some reforms actually pass this past year. In the omnibus, we saw that  the CDC can now study gun violence, even though they are not allowed to  take any positions or say anything that would be deemed to promote or  to advocate against gun violence.   We had a Fix NICS bill that will ensure that our agencies are getting  the information about those who have been convicted of crimes or those  who may be ineligible for other reasons into the background check  system earlier, so that those background checks will be more accurate.  We even see rulemaking to potentially ban bump stocks which were used  in the Las Vegas shooting.   But the list is short of action that has been taken by this Congress,  and the list of unfinished business is long.   First, is the failure to even give a hearing on re-instituting the  Federal assault weapon ban. I say re-instituting because many people  forget, from 1994 to 2004, we had such a ban. During that time,  people's Second Amendment rights were still in effect; but we banned  weapons that have no civilian use whatsoever. And we saw, during that  period, the statistics bear out, because when you look at gun violence  and mass shootings at that time, I challenge anybody watching this  tonight across America to recall whether they remember during that time  the number of mass shootings, the number of deaths during the assault  weapons ban.   Then we look at 2004-2014, the number of incidents tripled. The  number of deaths tripled. And that is just to 2014, not including  Charleston or Vegas or the Pulse nightclub shooting or recently, in  Parkland.   We also see universal background checks still not fixed. Ninety  percent of Americans support this. Ninety percent of Americans support  that there should no longer be loopholes in our universal background  checks.   That you could easily, right now, sell in a gun show without any  background check; this makes no sense. You could sell in a private sale  without a background check; this makes no sense. This is an easy way  for people who are wholly ineligible to be able to buy guns every day  in every State.   And so what is the purpose of fixing our Fix NICS bill and having  better background checks, if these giant loopholes that swallow the  whole?   Also, these extended magazine clips. The reason people heard 45 to 50  shots fired in a minute is because of these extended magazines and  these assault weapons. When you have a shotgun, when you have a  handgun--and I will let Congresswoman Val Demings talk a little bit  more with her background in law enforcement--yes, you can hurt people.  But you can't do the kind of carnage we have seen with these assault  weapons. And I look forward to hearing your opinions on that  Congresswoman Demings.   I also want to talk about gun reform on the State level. We had some  victories, we had some defeats. After fighting to keep guns out of  teachers' hands in schools, that battle was lost; while we have been  able to prevent them from being on college campuses.   But we did have some positives, and I give 100 percent of the credit  to the victims of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and  the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting, who stood hand in hand and  went up to Tallahassee to advocate for greater gun safety. And I could  say, having survived nearly 10 years in the Florida Legislature, it is  not a welcome place for a lot of these reforms.   But they had some great reforms passed. They raised the age to  purchase firearms from 18 to 21. They banned bump stocks--which,  President Trump, it is time to follow suit like they did in Florida.  Attorney General Sessions, it is time to get those rules in place.   They also were able to harden our schools. Now that is something that  I was remiss before to not mention. We did have the Safe Schools Act to  help harden our schools.   They also created critical red flag legislation that allows our law  enforcement--and I look forward to your comments on this as well, from  your background, Congresswoman Demings--to allow law enforcement  officers who are on the scene and see that someone will be a danger to  others, to be able to take away their guns for a limited time period  and then to be able to go and request a judge to get it back. We do  this in domestic violence, as you are familiar with.   So these are things that actually have happened in Florida that are  moving the ball forward. And if it can happen in our State, that has  been so protective of some of these critical reforms, I believe it can  happen, both on the Federal level and that Republicans and Democrats  can join together for these reforms.   But the last thing I want to talk about, but not least, are first  responders, because you can't talk about action without talking about  our first responders. The brave men and women of the Orlando Police  Department that you had the honor of being chief of, Congresswoman  Demings; the brave men and women of the Orange County Sheriff's Office,  which your husband is our honorable sheriff of; our Orlando and our  Orange County Fire Department who were on the scene, along with our  EMTs, to give lifesaving aid to 68 injured people and try to save some  of those 49 we lost.   We have had some action to help out our first responders, too. Our  UCF Restores program, which helps with PTSD for firefighters, law  enforcement, and our military, immerses these heroes into virtual  reality so that they can, unfortunately, have to relive those  experiences, but then meet with a psychologist or a psychiatrist to  talk about that, to bring up these repressed memories. And we have had  tremendous success. We have had tremendous feedback from our local fire  departments, from our local law enforcement, and from our military.   We are able to work together, you and I and Congresswoman Murphy, to  get $4 million in our Federal budget and open up more of this  treatment, not only to our military, but to victims of sexual assault  in this recent National Defense Authorization Act bill.   We also saw, and I will let you expound on this more, anti-terrorism  dollars finally come back down to Orlando, that you led the charge on.  And thank you for that, Congresswoman Demings, for doing that, from  your perch helping out with homeland security and being our expert on  security and on antiterrorism, protecting the homeland.   And then, finally, I want to end this part of our section by talking  about the advancements in our pension system in Florida to help out our  first responders. Your husband was a leader, is  [[Page H5082]]  a leader, but was a leader in the State Legislature, as Sheriff, to  help with the Adam Pierce Act, which made sure that our fallen law  enforcement who were paralyzed but still wanted to work, wouldn't lose  their pensions because they want to do some administrative work and  want to still be involved and want to go to work every day and do their  part for justice. And that was a bill that your husband spearheaded  through, and I remember.   We also had an amendment of my bill onto that bill; you may or may  not recall, and the Sheriff was really nice to allow us to do it along  with law enforcement, to help our firefighters.   There was a loophole where, if our firefighters died in training  exercises, they would get nothing. They would get no death benefit for  their families. They wouldn't get the healthcare benefit. They would be  left with nothing because of this loophole.   And John C. Curry, Mr. Begg, and Mr. Mickle from Osceola County, John  Curry, from Volusia County, they, retrospectively, were able to get  relief because we made it retrospective.   Then finally, we were able to, after we lost Deputy Pine in Orange  County, with Sheriff Jerry Demings helping us lead the way, made sure  that first responders who died in the line of duty didn't get 50  percent of their pension. They weren't half heroes. They now get 100  percent of their pension for their families, because they are 100  percent heroes and they gave 100 percent of their life and put 100  percent of their courage and their life on the line. And, at the very  least, their families can be taken care of when they are no longer with  us.   So there is a lot that we have honored with action over the years,  both before and after Pulse. But there is a lot more to go, and I look  forward to hearing your comments on that, Congresswoman Demings.   And thank you again for your service as our Orlando chief. And I know  that there is a lot that you could bring to this conversation that we  are continuing on with based upon your rich experience in these fields.
