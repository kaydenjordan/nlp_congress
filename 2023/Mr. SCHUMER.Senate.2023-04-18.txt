 Mr. President, preserving the full faith and credit of  the United States is one of the most important responsibilities that  Members of Congress face. It requires cooperation, bipartisanship, and  leaders who can instill confidence and calm to markets and working  families alike.   But I cannot think of a worse message to send to the world than for  Speaker McCarthy to travel all the way to New York, look Wall Street in  the eye, and threaten that the United States will default on its debt  unless Republicans get spending cuts first.   Why the Speaker traveled all the way to New York to give a speech  that offered nothing new in substance or concept but the same dangerous  message--different than what we have done in the past--is beyond me. If  Speaker McCarthy continues in this direction, the United States is  likely headed toward default.   But do you know what will avoid default? Republicans working with  Democrats to avoid this crisis--all together--just as we did under  Donald Trump.   The Speaker has insisted for months on cuts, though he has failed to  offer any clarity about what kind of cuts Republicans want. House GOP  leadership is presenting their wish list to their Members at a closed  meeting this morning. No one should confuse this wish list as anything  more than a recycling of the same bad ideas we have heard about for  weeks, and it is still not clear that Speaker McCarthy has the votes to  even pass this. Indeed, a handful of House GOP Members insist they  won't raise the debt ceiling for anything, not even a GOP wish list.   One of the few specific items is the Speaker's laughable suggestion-- and it is laughable--that we avoid default for only a year, ensuring  that this dangerous crisis repeats itself in 12 months. Why the Speaker  thinks anyone--anyone--would agree to have another debt ceiling crisis  next year is beyond me.   Nobody is saying that there cannot be a conversation about what kind  of cuts Republicans want, but it doesn't belong in this debate, plain  and simple. It belongs in discussions over the budget that Congress has  every year and not as a precondition to avoiding default.   So let me make this easy for my Republican colleagues. Don't bother  with partisan wish lists and unrealistic proposals that will never  solve this debt  [[Page S1150]]  default crisis. Instead, avoid default using the same approach we did  under President Trump twice and under President Biden once: Democrats  and Republicans, working together, without preconditions. If  Republicans agree to that, there will be no default.    On this solemn day--on this solemn day--we owe it to the  survivors, their families, and the world to continue bearing witness to  the tragic legacy of the Holocaust and keep repeating our conviction  and our prayer: Never again.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session and resume consideration of S. 870.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture  motion with respect to S. 870 be withdrawn and that the only amendments  in order to the bill be the following: Lee No. 80; Scott No. 81;  Hagerty No. 72, as modified; Van Hollen No. 85; Sullivan No. 83; and  Paul No. 79; that if offered, the Senate vote in relation to the  amendments listed at a time to be determined by the majority leader  following consultation with the Republican leader; that following  disposition of the above amendments, amendment No. 58 be withdrawn;  that the bill, as amended, if amended, be considered read a third time  and the Senate vote on passage of the bill; that 60 affirmative votes  be required for the adoption of these amendments and passage of the  bill, with the exception of the Sullivan and Paul amendments; and that  there be 2 minutes for debate equally divided between the two leaders  or their designees prior to each vote, all without intervening action  or debate.    For the information of the Senate, the vote on the Lee  amendment will be at approximately 4:30 p.m. today.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, few have left their mark on this country  like our dear friend Senator Dianne Feinstein. She is a legend in  California, the first woman Senator from the State.   She is a legend here in the Senate--the longest serving woman Senator  in U.S. history. She built a reputation as an expert legislator on so  many issues--gun violence, VAWA, the environment, women's rights, and  so much more.   But her impact doesn't end there. Dianne is a legend throughout the  country. She shattered enumerable glass ceilings, moved countless  mountains, and molded millions of minds. Few have accomplished as much  in office as Senator Feinstein.   Our colleague and friend has made her wish clear, that another  Senator temporarily serve on the Committee on the Judiciary until she  returns. I thank Senator Cardin for agreeing to step in.   So today, I am acting not just as leader, but as Dianne's friend in  honoring her wishes until she returns to the Senate. Mr. President,  when someone as dear and as accomplished as Senator Feinstein asks us  for something so important to her, we ought to respect it.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration  of my resolution which is at the desk; I further ask unanimous consent  the resolution be agreed to, that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the notice  of adoption of regulations from the Office of Congressional Workplace  Rights be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                            ____________________
