 Scott Franklin).    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I appreciate  Congresswoman Miller's efforts and leadership on this critical and  vital topic.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in defense of the God-given right of  parents to guide and shape the education of their children. Preparing  our children for the world and teaching them the skills they need to be  successful adults is not only a parent's right; it is also their  responsibility. Unfortunately, it is one of many of our sacred rights  that my Democrat colleagues want to rip away and give to the Federal  Government.    Having already corrupted our higher education system with anti- American ideology, Democrats are now pushing their indoctrination  program down to K-12. This may sound like partisan rhetoric, but my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle are hiding their intentions.   Their build back broke plan includes a $10 billion environmental  justice slush fund that will be used to push the Green New Deal in  universities. They are incorporating divisive, racist ideologies like  critical race theory into classrooms across the country.   They will try to say that is not true. But don't buy their lie.  Regardless of what you name it, Madam Speaker, any curriculum that  teaches kids that they are inherently racist or hopelessly victims  simply because of the color of their skin is itself racist. It runs  counter to the American ideal. That is not freedom of ideas. That is  indoctrination.   They are working actively to push parents out of every aspect of  their children's education.   Don't believe it.   In Loudoun County, Virginia, just across the river here, any parent  wanting to review the CRT components of the curriculum is required to  sign a nondisclosure agreement, a legally binding document that forbids  them from sharing what they find out.   What is it in their curriculum that they don't want people to find  out about it?   And once they find out about it, why don't they want it to be shared?   I come from Florida, a State where we value transparency and the  sunshine. We have very strict sunshine laws. This would never fly in  the State of Florida. We are not afraid of what our government is doing  there. In fact, we want people to know more about it.   The COVID pandemic and our country's response to it will have long- lasting effects on our Nation. Perhaps one of the most destructive of  these aspects is the developmental damage inflicted on our children  because their needs were placed last.   If there is any silver lining at all to the pandemic, it is that  parents whose children were subjected to school shutdowns were finally  able to experience firsthand what they are being taught. They responded  with anger and frustration at the politicians who have allowed this  travesty to occur.   Unfortunately, the Democrat response to this nationwide movement has  been to treat concerned parents as domestic terrorists, and they have  weaponized the Justice Department in an effort to get these parents to  sit down and shut up.   Terry McAuliffe's statement that he doesn't believe parents should  tell schools what to teach was a horrifying peer into the soul of what  radical progressives truly believe, that Big Brother, the Federal  Government, knows best and should be given full autonomy to control our  lives.   But Virginians put the Democrats on notice last night. America  rejects their efforts to ram through a toxic platform of cradle-to- grave government dependence. This doesn't just include Federal  overreach in our education system but also in the outrageous spending  programs that will destroy our economic prosperity.   Democrats are trying to sell Americans a bill of goods they don't  want, they can't afford, and with money the country doesn't have.   During election years, we often ask the American people how they are  doing compared to 4 years ago. I would ask them now: How are you doing  compared to 10 months ago?   Our education system is falling apart, our southern border is a  disaster, violent crime has skyrocketed across the country, our botched  withdrawal from Afghanistan has diminished our standing on the world  stage, and inflation is running rampant. Every action the Biden  administration takes is hurting our country. Americans know they are  worse off, but Democrats appear to be unaware or apathetic.   As I look across the aisle, where are the traditional liberals?   If you are still there, it is time to come out of hiding and stand up  to the radical progressives who are destroying the very fabric of the  country I know you love. Stop listening to the D.C. and big city echo  chambers. Those are not the voice of America.   Show the American people that you are listening to them by standing  against divisive rhetoric in our schools, stopping outrageous  government spending, and supporting law and order. Yesterday's election  should serve as a wake-up call to all who wish to save America from  destruction. It is not too late.    Scott Franklin of Florida):        H. Res. 770.
