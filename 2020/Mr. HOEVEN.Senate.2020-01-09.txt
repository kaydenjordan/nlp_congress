 Mr. President, today I rise, along with my colleague  Senator Cramer, to honor former Senator from North Dakota Jocelyn  Burdick. She was the first woman to represent the State of North Dakota  in the U.S. Senate. My wife Mikey and I were saddened to hear of her  recent passing, and we want to extend our sincere condolences to all of  the Burdick family.   As I said, I, along with Senator Cramer, have introduced a resolution  to honor Senator Jocelyn Burdick and her service to the people of North  Dakota and the United States in this body.   Jocelyn was born in Fargo, ND. She attended Principia College and  Northwestern University and began her career as a radio announcer in  Moorhead, MN.   On September 12, 1992, Jocelyn Burdick became the first woman from  the State of North Dakota to serve in the U.S. Senate. She was  appointed by then-Governor George Sinner to fill the seat of her late  husband, Quentin Burdick, whom she served alongside during his 32 years  in this body, the U.S. Senate. The Burdick family has a long history of  public service.   During her time in the Senate, she helped to establish the Quentin N.  Burdick Indian Health Program at the University of North Dakota,  supporting healthcare training programs for Native Americans, and  helped to secure funding for the Federal courthouse in Fargo named  after her late husband.   Jocelyn was a Sunday school teacher and devoted member of the  Christian Science Church. She served as president of the local Parent  Teacher Association, recorded public service announcements raising  awareness of substance abuse and drunk driving, and was nationally  recognized for her philanthropy on behalf of the Gamma Phi Beta  sorority.   I knew Jocelyn Burdick, and she was a fine person. I join with the  people of North Dakota in expressing our appreciation for her service  on behalf of our State and our Nation.   With that, I yield the floor.
