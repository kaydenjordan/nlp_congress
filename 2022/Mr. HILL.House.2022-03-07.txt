 Madam Speaker, I am delighted to be able to speak on the  House floor today and talk about what we are witnessing, all Americans,  as we turn on our televisions and see the horrors in Europe.   For the first time in eight decades, we are witnessing a mass,  unprovoked ground and air invasion in continental Europe. Not since  World War II have we seen this sort of aggressive, evil action by one  European nation against another, let alone such action by a global  power and member of the United Nations Security Council.  [[Page H1323]]    The tragedy unfolding today has no precedent in recent history, not  even the terrible civil war and ethnic cleansing in the former  Yugoslavia.                                time  2015    Let's be clear, Madam Speaker, Putin feels emboldened and believes  that he can wield his power anywhere in the world, including in his own  backyard in a pitiful but ruthless attempt to restore his idea of some  18th century Russian kingdom with himself as czar.   Putin is emboldened by the fact that he has personally, and Russia as  a nation, not paid any significant economic or diplomatic price for his  previous violations of international law, the U.N. Charter, or common  decency and norms.   One only has to recall the poisoning in a London park of an  opposition voice in 2006, forging a partnership in 2015 with the  butcher Assad in mass destruction, murder, and mayhem in Syria,  waltzing into Crimea without firing a shot in 2014, and his border  incursions into Georgia in 2008.   Putin has simply marched on, trampling international law and  sovereign borders, all the while thumbing his nose, Madam Speaker, at  international norms and the negligible reaction of his neighbors.   In fact, his neighbors, dependent on the European drug of choice-- Russian natural gas--for so long they just stared glassy-eyed at their  enabler, unable to stand up for themselves and fight back. Now, these  neighbors have rejected the dominance of Putin's pushing and are  fighting back.   That is why America once more steps into the breach as the essential,  indispensable nation. Our resolve encourages a stronger European Union  and a stronger NATO.   During the 20th century, our freedom-loving people consistently  stepped up to push back against the disposition and destruction of  individual rights, international norms, and sovereign nations.   Europe doesn't want to go back to their ancient, feudal fights, and  Ukrainians don't want to return to vassal state status under the boot  of Russia.   Ukrainians want to go forward. They don't want to go backward. They  don't want to go back to the Berlin Airlift, Checkpoint Charlie, the  Fulda Gap, and Churchill's Iron Curtain.   At the height of the Cold War, Madam Speaker, I traveled through  Checkpoint Charlie to the other side of the Iron Curtain. I have  witnessed what life is like in communism, socialism. I have laid a  wreath at Auschwitz. I have laid a wreath on Decoration Day at the  American Cemetery in Normandy. And, Madam Speaker, Americans don't want  to go back to those days either.   Our boys sacrificed their lives in the forests of Germany, the  beaches of France, the hills of Italy, and the sands of North Africa to  prevent this very thing from happening again.   That is why American leadership is critical. Partnering with our  transatlantic allies, we must muster the military, economic, and  diplomatic clout and might to hit this bully in the nose. Bullies only  respect clout and might.   While Europe and the United States were timid in the Obama-Merkel  days, our collective leadership must fill the void now and push back  once and for all against the assault on sovereignty and freedom we are  witnessing in Europe.   If not now, when? If not in Ukraine, on the borders of Ukraine,  where, Madam Speaker?   If we fail here, despots will race to trample borders around the  world, and democracy and freedom everywhere will be in peril.                       Russia's Special Drawing Rights     Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to how the  International Monetary Fund fuels Russia's war on Ukraine by providing  them a blank check in the form of special drawing rights, or SDRs.   Last week, I with 40 of my Republican colleagues in the House and the  Senate, we wrote Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urging that all IMF  member countries not bail out Russia by facilitating the exchange of  Russian SDRs with their own hard currency.   Russia was handed a blank check of nearly $17 billion equivalent in  SDRs by the IMF just last year and has an estimated total of $24  billion in SDR reserves. This should have never happened, Madam  Speaker, and that is why I have been so adamant for years about  limiting the issue of IMF special drawing rights.   Earlier last week, the United States and other countries expanded  economic sanctions against the Russian Central Bank, and while this is  a late but welcome development, we must do more.   For decades, Russia has been accumulating a war chest that includes  gold, international reserves, and importantly, special drawing rights.  And with the ruble tanking in open markets, the Kremlin's access to  foreign currency reserves being cut off, these SDRs are one of the only  remaining ways that Russia can access financial resources for its  warmongering in the Ukraine.   That is why now is the time for the U.S. to lead at the IMF for  calling on all member countries, including China, Madam Speaker, to  formally agree not to facilitate any exchange of their currencies with  Russia's SDRs.   We are already seeing China and Russia deepening their ties, forming  the latest and newest axis of evil. We cannot allow Moscow to turn to  Beijing for an SDR bailout. As the largest shareholder of the IMF, the  United States has a responsibility to ensure that these resources are  not hijacked to fuel Russian bombs and tanks.                               Small LENDER Act     Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  latest Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the CFBP, proposed small  business data collection regulation. It is called section 1071.   Access to capital for small businesses is the lifeblood of each of  our local economies, and for many, the community bank lender is often  leading the way in supporting our entrepreneurs in small businesses  across our districts.   And yet, the CFPB's new regulation, if finalized, would actually hurt  small business by making the cost of credit more expensive and imposing  significant compliance costs that would fall the hardest on the  smallest lenders across our Nation.   That is why I, along with Congressmen Williams of Texas and  Luetkemeyer of Missouri have introduced the Small LENDER Act, a new  bill that would provide regulatory relief to small business lenders by  exempting them from this proposed CFPB 1071 rule and providing an  additional year to comply, plus a 2-year safe harbor.   Specifically, my bill would expand the definition of a small lender  as one that originates at least 500 small business loans per year,  instead of the 25-loan limit proposed by the CFPB.   It would also codify a ``small business'' as one with gross revenues  of $1 million or less instead of the $5 million threshold that the rule  proposed.   Finally, the bill extends the effective compliance date with the  final rule to be 3 years plus that 2-year grace period instead of only  18 months as proposed by the CFPB.   In the absence of Congress repealing section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank  Act, this bill would prevent some of the most harmful aspects of the  rule from going into effect. I urge my colleagues to support the Small  LENDER Act.                         Economic Crisis of Inflation     Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  economic crisis that has been fueled by the Biden administration's out- of-control spending and the very accommodative monetary policies of our  Federal Reserve.   2021 was the worst year, Madam Speaker for consumer inflation since  1981.   Last year, inflation cost the average worker roughly two paychecks  and the average family $3,500.   And inflation doesn't just impact major corporations, but also our  small businesses, 61 percent of which have had to raise prices in the  last month in order just to try to keep up with inflation.   Of course, getting people back to work will greatly aid supply  chains, thus we need to encourage work. But President Biden's policies  of vaccine mandates, higher regulations on employers and policies to  cut the supply of energy hurt the cause of getting our citizens back to  work.   The President has called this inflation ``transitory'' and caused  only by ``supply chain'' disruptions and greedy corporations. Madam  Speaker, in my view, this is just pure political theater.  [[Page H1324]]    Yet, instead of addressing these concerns, working to get spending  under control and our Nation's economy fully back on track, President  Biden spent the bulk of his State of the Union speech doubling down on  those policies that got us into this inflationary situation in the  first place.   Central Arkansans' pockets are hurting.   The President should stop proposing to spend trillions more. The  President should cut regulatory burdens hindering hiring employers like  truck drivers, general contractors, and health service employees.   The President should unleash American energy to help bring down  prices for U.S. consumers and help our struggling allies in Europe.   I urge the Biden administration and my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle to reach across the aisle to help bring relief to the  American people and get back to our prepandemic spending priorities and  alleviate the burdens that many face across our country, particularly  the burden of inflation.                        Crisis at the Southern Border     Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  crisis at our southwest border.   In January, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol reported over 153,941  migrant encounters at our southwest border, which represented a 320  percent increase over January of 2020.   Of the over 150,000 migrants who were encountered, the Biden  administration opened the door and said come in, releasing about 60,000  migrants into the United States.   Deportations are down 70 percent when compared to 2020, averaging  about 100 a day, and that was in the face of 7,000 migrants appearing  at our border each day.   Officials at our southern border have estimated that nearly 400,000  illegal immigrants have successfully crossed the border without being  caught. So not being interdicted, not being processed, not being turned  back.   Those numbers, like the inflation that we are experiencing, are out  of control.   These numbers are unacceptable, and we need to get back on track. I  have encouraged the Biden administration for over a year now, return to  those Trump-era policies that were controlling the flow across the  border, resume construction on the wall, resume support of our  personnel on the border, resume the efforts to control and secure our  southwest border.                        America's Energy Independence     Madam Speaker, today I rise to bring awareness to an issue  that concerns all Americans, and that is America's energy independence.   Every day the U.S. is importing nearly 600,000 barrels of oil from  Russia. As we continue to increase sanctions against Russia, we must  also keep the American people in mind, who are already feeling the  effects of inflation each day when they visit the pump.   We need to boost domestic production now. That should be our  priority, boosting American production. Prior to the pandemic we were  producing 13 million barrels a day. Today, we are producing about 11  million barrels per day. That would more than make up for this Russian  oil that for some reason we are still importing.   This week, I received a call from a constituent. This constituent is  on a fixed income, and she shared with me her concerns about filling up  at the gas station. She shared with me her concerns about Ukraine and  asked if she should expect her gas bill to increase even more as  tensions rise. And the answer to that question, Madam Speaker is I  believe that is right, that is what is going to happen.   And that is why we can benefit Europe and benefit American consumers  by unleashing American energy production and get back to those 13  million barrels a day. That way we can offset what we have been  importing from Russia and benefit our American consumers.                                time  2030                         Great American Outdoors Act     Madam Speaker, I rise to highlight the important work being  accomplished through the success of the Great American Outdoors Act,  the bipartisan conservation legislation signed into law by President  Trump.   In Arkansas, I recently had the opportunity to visit one of those  sites and visit with leaders at the National Forest System spearheading  this effort at Blanchard Springs Caverns in the Ozark National Forest.   These incredible caverns not only attract thousands each year to  Arkansas, but they have a robust economic impact on the surrounding  areas as they are enjoyed by all Americans each year.   Thanks to funding by the Great American Outdoors Act, the cabins are  able to undergo much-needed renovations to improve the existing trail  system and lighting system throughout the caverns and invest in  preventative measures to enhance the safety and resiliency of the  underground system. This allows the caverns to be enjoyed by American  families for years to come.   Madam Speaker, these improvements that are underway as a result of  this bipartisan achievement are the first major capital expenditures  spent on this beautiful cavern since it was opened during the Nixon  administration. So, I look forward to these funds continuing to support  various projects in the Natural State and look forward to their  enhancement in the years to come.                                Opioid Crisis     Madam Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to the opioid  crisis in Arkansas and across our Nation.   Each day, over 250 individuals lose their lives to an opioid-related  overdose. According to the CDC, we lost a record number of 99,106  people between March 2020 and March 2021. What a milestone. What a grim  milestone.   My home State of Arkansas has one of the highest opioid-prescribing  rates in our Nation. In Arkansas alone, we lost at least 225 of our  neighbors in this crisis.   Opioid misuse and addiction begin at home, coming from a familiar  medicine cabinet. More Americans lose their lives to addiction than  from car accidents, guns, or HIV.   This is a crisis, a growing crisis, and one that is reaching new  highs. These deaths are preventable, and it is up to each of us to do  our part to save lives and combat the disease that is addiction.   That is why, last September, I introduced the bipartisan Preventing  Overdoses and Saving Lives Act with my colleague from Michigan,  Representative Debbie Dingell. My bipartisan bill will create a grant  program allowing States and localities to conduct research on the  opioid crisis, create a strategic plan on how to respond to the crisis,  and implement co-prescribing under certain circumstances. Increasing  access to naloxone reduces opioid fatalities. If this bill passes, it  will save lives.   Madam Speaker, we have seen that in Arkansas, one of 14 States that  offers co-prescriptions for opioid prescription recipients. I would  like to see that broader across our Nation. Lives will be saved.   In this bill, I urge all of my colleagues to join Congresswoman  Dingell and I in this fight.                               Be Pro Be Proud     Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about Be Pro Be Proud,  an initiative launched in 2016 as a response to the workforce shortage  experienced in my home State of Arkansas.   Be Pro Be Proud is a technical program that introduces students and  young adults to skilled trade jobs and the well-paid opportunities that  these jobs unlock.   In the past 5 years, Be Pro Be Proud's mobile workshop has completed  over 500 stops in the State of Arkansas and recruited over 20,000  individuals who have joined the movement to learn more about key  trades, new opportunities, and finding that career that is right for  them.   After seeing the tremendous success in Arkansas, the initiative has  expanded to surrounding States. We have traveled around the country  exposing young adults to this kind of opportunity--in middle school and  high school--a career that starts immediately after high school  graduation.   In January, I had the pleasure of joining Governor Asa Hutchinson and  State and local leaders to announce that Be Pro Be Proud was awarded  $1.45 million in a grant to support the launch of a second mobile  workshop to bring this story to schools all over Arkansas.  [[Page H1325]]    This expansion will see additional communities visited by Be Pro Be  Proud sooner and better, and that means faster opportunities to be  witnessed by our young people when they graduate from high school.                Recognizing the Life and Legacy of Sam Chaffin     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  legacy of a dear friend and a great Rotary International colleague, my  friend Sam Chaffin. I was sad to share the news with my friends that  Sam passed away in November.   Born in 1936, in Magnolia, Arkansas, he was a proud graduate of the  University of Arkansas, where he earned a master's degree in industrial  engineering. Shortly after graduation, Sam opened his own business,  Eagle Material Handling of Arkansas, which specialized in material and  manufacturing management.   In 1975, Sam joined the Rotary Club of Little Rock, Club 99. During  his time in Rotary, Sam served in many leadership positions, including  foundation chair, president of our club, and district governor. Through  our work together in Rotary, we had the opportunity to go to Lacombe,  Louisiana, following Katrina and help many, many families rebuild their  homes.   Madam Speaker, we couldn't have done that at our club, the Rotary  Club of Little Rock, without Sam's instrumental leadership. He was a  friend to all who were blessed to know him. My thoughts are with his  wife, Charlie; children, Cole and Marty; and his grandchildren and  great-grandchildren.    Sam, thank you for your impact on our community, our Rotary Club,  Rotary International, and our State.                      Recognizing Scipio Africanus Jones     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an exemplary  Arkansan, Scipio Africanus Jones.   Scipio Jones was born into slavery in Arkansas in 1863. Throughout  his life, he attended Black schools near his hometown, eventually  earning his bachelor's degree from Arkansas' own Shorter College.   Although there were no schools for African Americans to study law in  Arkansas, Scipio took on the challenge himself and began studying  independently and, in 1889, passed the Arkansas Bar. He began his  career in Pulaski County and, in 1900, was admitted to the Arkansas  Supreme Court.   In 1919, 12 Black sharecroppers had been sentenced to death for their  alleged role in the Elaine Massacre, while 87 other defendants also  awaited trial. Scipio Jones' primary goal was to secure a fair trial  for the 87 defendants. After his partner's unexpected passing, he  became the lead attorney in the appeals process for the 12 defendants  who had been sentenced to death.   Of the 12 original sharecroppers who had been sentenced to death,  charges were dismissed against six, while the other six had their  sentences commuted. The remaining 87 defendants received pardons from  the Governor of Arkansas.   Following these immense legal victories, Scipio Jones remained an  advocate for the Black community across Arkansas. In recognition of his  advocacy, the United States Post Office in downtown Little Rock was  named in his honor in 2007.   In 2020, President Trump signed into law my bill, which facilitated a  large, full-sized portrait of Scipio Jones to be displayed in that post  office. Last week, I had the honor, with all of our citizens, to gather  and unveil this beautiful portrait of Scipio Jones at the post office  named for him.   Special thanks are owed to John Gill, Garbo Hearne, artist Wade  Hampton, and the Central Arkansas Library System for all of their  collaboration in making this wonderful portrait a reality. It will  serve as a reminder of the legal skill, persistence, bravery, and  diplomacy of Scipio Jones, permanently honoring him as the amazing  legal leader and citizen that he was.                             Honoring Daisy Bates     Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Daisy Bates and her  brave actions that shaped American history and Arkansas history.   When Daisy Bates moved to Little Rock in the early 1940s, she  immediately joined the NAACP and became a leader in our African- American community. As a civil rights activist in Little Rock, Daisy  Bates played a leading role in the integration of Little Rock's schools  and served as a mentor to the Little Rock Nine.   Her bravery and leadership led her to achieve the unimaginable-- sparking change across our whole Nation. Just last month, I had the  opportunity to visit with students and speak about her impact and her  legacy at the Daisy Bates Elementary School in Little Rock.   Daisy's accomplishments deserve to be recognized, and I am proud that  Daisy Bates and her legacy will be memorialized here in the United  States Capitol. Soon, her statue will become part of the collection in  the National Statuary Hall, commemorating her bravery, strength, and  leadership.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to honoring that memory and continuing  her fight for equality every time I pass that statue in our Capitol.                      Recognizing Army Colonel Mike Ross     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Retired Army  Colonel Mike Ross and his selfless leadership with Veterans Villages of  America.   Colonel Ross is a combat veteran with 37 years of military service.  He has received numerous awards, including the Legion of Merit, the  Bronze Star, and the Meritorious Service Medal.   Currently, Colonel Ross serves on the board of directors for Veterans  Villages of America, where he operates a food pantry for veterans,  military personnel, and their immediate family members. They also  network in our communities to meet the needs of our veterans--and I  mean all the needs of our veterans. Colonel Ross is indeed tireless.   Although he is retired, he continues to give back to others, serve  others, and work tirelessly for American military families and our  veterans to ensure they are well cared for.   Madam Speaker, I thank Colonel Ross for his outstanding service and  dedication to our community and central Arkansas veterans.                         Recognizing Montine McNulty     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of  Montine McNulty.   After serving 25 years as the head of the Arkansas Hospitality  Association, Montine has announced her well-deserved retirement. Early  in 2020, Montine thought about retirement, but when COVID-19 hit, she  made a decision to stay and guide her organization through the pandemic  in the midst of such great uncertainty.   Montine, I commend your embodying of the motto, ``Service Above  Self,'' and I hope you enjoy every moment of your retirement.   Madam Speaker, it is also important that we take a moment and  recognize Katie Beck, the new head of the Arkansas Hospitality  Association. Katie has had a distinguished career in serving Governor  Hutchinson's communication department, and I know she will bring that  drive, that spirit, as the new head of the AHA.   The Arkansas Hospitality Association is very valuable for our State,  and I look forward to seeing where Katie takes the organization while  continuing Montine's legacy.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains.    Madam Speaker, the United States currently has one of the  highest prison populations in the world. Every year, we spend about  $34,000 per inmate in our State. In Arkansas, the current rate of  reentry after re-offending is about 57 percent, one of the highest in  the Nation.    We can do better, which is why I introduced the bipartisan Shift Back  to Society Act. This bill would enact policies that avert individuals  from re-offending, keeping people out of prison. This is accomplished  by providing funding for our historically Black colleges and  universities for educational programming that they design for offenders  who have or who have almost completed serving their time, so engaging  to better prepare people we know that are going to be released.   By developing this pathway to education, we directly decrease the  rate of recidivism. The more education an individual has, the less  likely they are to re-offend. This legislation will save millions in  current spending while creating an opportunity that will keep  individuals out of prison and transition  [[Page H1326]]  them back into being productive members of society.   As we currently face an uptick in crime, both in Arkansas and across  our Nation, I am proud to bring forward a bill that will save taxpayer  dollars as well as improve paths for successful reentry shifting back  to society.                 Congratulating Mike Poore on His Retirement     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my good friend,  our superintendent of Little Rock Public Schools, Mike Poore.   Mike has decided to retire, and I wish him a happy and healthy  retirement. In 2016, Mike made the move from northwest Arkansas to  Little Rock with the goal of transforming the district, which at the  time was under the control of the State.                                time  2045    In March 2020, when the world turned upside down because of the  COVID-19 pandemic, Mike did not skip a beat. He worked to make sure  every teacher and every student had the technology needed to continue  learning with as little disruption as possible.   He worked mightily with the district teachers and staff to make sure  students were back in the classroom. Madam Speaker, that was a great  accomplishments of our State to have over 80 percent of our kids in the  classroom during the midst of the pandemic. Mike led that way.   His other accomplishment included raising money for students in the  community, increasing teachers' salaries, and being named Arkansas'  Superintendent of the Year.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mike for his service and dedication to the  Little Rock School District, his long-lasting impact in our community  is appreciated.   Congratulations and our best wishes for his retirement.                     Recognizing Eagle Scout Marcal Young     Madam Speaker, today I rise to recognize fellow Eagle Scout  Marcal Young of Little Rock. I am congratulating him on his career with  the Boy Scouts of America having been active with that organization for  over 40 years.   Since its founding, the Boy Scouts of America have remained committed  to the idea that educating our youth in citizenship, service, and  leadership is best for their development, and an amazing opportunity of  service for our Nation.   Marcal has embraced these principles, and in 2018 was named Scout  Executive of the Qupaw Area Council. Throughout his career, he has had  a positive impact on thousands of young people and their families, and  as a result, their communities.   With their character development and value-based leadership programs,  over 2.5 million young men have achieved the rank of Eagle Scout.   In 1972, I earned the rank of Eagle Scout at Troop 27 at Holy Souls  Catholic Church in Little Rock. To this day, it is one of my proudest  accomplishments.   I am grateful for Marcal and his commitment to Scouting and making  those achievements possible for youth across the communities of our  State. His leadership and influence will be remembered, and I wish him  the very best in his well-earned retirement.                Recognizing the Retirement of Margaret Ellibee     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the retirement of  Margaret Ellibee and commemorate her service of 11 years as chancellor  at the University of Arkansas Pulaski Technical College.   UA Pulaski Tech, a 2-year community college in the heart of my  district, has moved mountains for its students and faculty under her  leadership.   Margaret Ellibee's critical decision to raise admission standards not  only led to increased graduation rates but also reduced student loan  default rates, positively impacting the school's performance and  trustworthiness.   Madam Speaker, I thank Margaret for making these achievements  possible for our students and faculty, and I am grateful for her bold  and robust leadership. Her legacy will be remembered for years, and I  wish her the very best of a well-earned retirement.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
