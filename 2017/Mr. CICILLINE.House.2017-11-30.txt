 Mr. Speaker, millions of Americans will lie awake in  bed this evening worried about their ability to take care of their  families because they simply don't make enough money and are struggling  with the daily needs of life.   What is the Republican Party working to do to make it even worse?   Passing a tax cut for the richest people in this country, the most  powerful corporations, that will result in raising taxes on 82 million  families, providing $1.5 trillion debt for the next generation, making  deep cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, Pell grants, and infrastructure--all  things that are necessary to grow and strengthen the middle class of  this country--which will be a huge boon to the richest people in  America.   The Senate version will also remove 13 million people from having  access to affordable healthcare. The Republicans in the Senate are  doing this right now.   The American people need to be certain that their voices are being  heard to stop this proposal. It is a scam that will impose tremendous  costs on working people in this country. It will provide tremendous  benefits to the very powerful and very wealthy. It incentivizes  American companies to ship American jobs overseas by making those  incentives more generous.   The American people deserve a better deal. They deserve better wages,  better jobs, and a better future. They deserve a much better deal than  this raw deal these Republicans are giving in this tax scam.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  Maryland, for yielding.   I want to quote Congressman Raskin, who has said before, and I think  it actually accurately captures what is happening: The Republicans are  moving at the speed of light in the dark of night to jam through this  proposal which will visit so much harm upon our economy and upon the  American people, and particularly onto working families.    I think it is important to say, at the outset, that the process that  has produced this piece of legislation that is now under consideration  in the Senate--their own version of the same proposal--is an important  thing to understand.   The last time that we did comprehensive tax reform--it was before I  arrived in Congress--there were hundreds of people who testified. There  were hearings to really understand the implications of these proposals.   Our economy is complicated. Tax policy is complicated. You want to be  sure that you are making the right decisions based on good information,  good evidence, and the guidance of experts.   This proposal in the House and, similarly, in the Senate happened  with no hearings. Not a single witness testified. In fact, it was  drafted even without the participation of some of the Republican  Members of Congress. It was presented as a finished product and then  brought to the floor for a vote.   One of the reasons I would say, Mr. Speaker, that my Republican  colleagues are trying to get this done so quickly is because the more  the American people learn about this proposal, the more they realize  that it is not something they support, and it undermines the long-term  health and prosperity of our country.   What does it do?   It provides a huge, gigantic tax cut for the people at the very top.  About 50 percent of the proposal goes to the top 1 percent.   It creates greater economic incentives to ship American jobs  overseas. Think about that. It creates better incentives to send good  jobs overseas.   It raises taxes on 82 million middle class families.   It imposes $1.5 trillion additional debt on the next generation.   To pay for all of this, it imposes deep cuts on things that are so  important to the economy and important to working families: Medicare,  Medicaid. We will see more cuts in infrastructure, education, and all  the things that are necessary to build and strengthen our economy.   This is a gigantic giveaway to the biggest corporations and the  wealthiest people of this country, and it is paid for by the middle  class. It is paid for by hardworking Americans.   There are, as I said just a moment ago, millions of people who lie  awake at night worrying about whether or not they can make ends meet,  take care of their families, and pay their bills because they are just  not making enough money.   But instead of addressing that with a real tax reform proposal that  provides real tax relief to middle class families and incentivizes the  creation of good-paying jobs, this does just the opposite. It makes the  situation worse. In fact, what the bill does, although its name is  something about job creation, it does just the opposite because it is  premised on this economic theory called trickle-down economics: if you  let people at the very top hold on to more of their money, keep more of  what they make, it will somehow just trickle down to the rest of us.   We know that is an economic theory that doesn't work. It doesn't work  because what you really need to create jobs and to grow the economy is  for people of the middle class to have a good-paying job and have money  in their pockets so they can buy the goods and services businesses  produce. That is how you grow the economy.   If you go to any small business in my State and ask, ``What do you  need to create another job to add to your number of employees?'' they  will tell you, ``I need customers. I need people to buy the things I  make and sell.''   That is why having a tax policy that invests in rebuilding the middle  class and provides tax relief to middle class families and doesn't rely  on this trickle-down economics is the way that you grow the economy.  This does just the opposite.   In addition to that proposal on the Senate side, they have inserted  another proposal that will strip away healthcare from 13 million  Americans.   Think about this: Just when you thought this bill or this approach  couldn't get any worse, the Senate Republicans have done that.   We had a rally today with folks from all across this country who are  standing up to say: This is not fair. This makes our Tax Code worse.  This provides no relief for the people who need it. It doesn't help  small businesses. Instead, it is a reflection of what a swamp  Washington is.   All those folks who have a lot of political power, who spend a lot of  money on elections, have allowed or have demanded that a tax bill go  forward that benefits them.   Shame on my colleagues. This is a disgrace. What this is going to do  to our economy and to working families is something that everyone who  votes for this will be responsible for.   We are still hoping that we can defeat this proposal in the Senate  and move forward in a bipartisan way for serious tax reform that will  grow the economy, that will provide relief to middle class families,  that will help raise people's wages and not be a huge giveaway for the  richest people in the country, the most powerful corporations,  incentivizing shipping American jobs overseas and then giving the bill  to the next generation and to working families in this country.   This is dead wrong. We have to defeat it.   I thank my friend, the gentleman from Maryland, for organizing this  Special Order hour so we can continue to bring attention to this  horrible piece of legislation, which, by the way--I will end with  this--is not tax reform. This is a scam being visited upon the American  people. We need to do everything we can to stop it.                                time  1745
