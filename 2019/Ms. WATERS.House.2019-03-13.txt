 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 206) acknowledging that the lack of sunlight and  transparency in financial transactions and corporate formation poses a  threat to our national security and our economy's security and  supporting efforts to close related loopholes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 206         Whereas money laundering and other financial crimes are       serious threats to our national and economic security;        Whereas the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has       reported ``The estimated amount of money laundered globally       in one year is 2 - 5% of global GDP, or $800 billion - $2       trillion in current US dollars'';        Whereas the scale, efficiency, and complexity of the U.S.       financial system make it a prime target for those who seek to       conceal, launder, and move the proceeds of illicit activity;        Whereas money launderers, terrorist financiers, corrupt       individuals and organizations, and their facilitators have       proven to adapt quickly in order to avoid detection;        Whereas given the global nature of money laundering and       terrorist financing, and the increasing interrelatedness       within the financial system, a secure national and       multilateral framework is essential to the integrity of the       U.S. financial system;        Whereas extensive collaboration among financial regulators,       the Department of the Treasury, law enforcement, and the       private sector is required to curtail the illicit flow of       money throughout the United States;        Whereas despite how extensive and effective these efforts       are in the United States, there is still substantial room for       improvement;        Whereas financial compliance, reporting, investigation, and       collaboration, as well as courageous whistleblowers and       investigative reporting have had significant impact in       shining sunlight on the people and institutions behind dark       money and markets;        Whereas in 2016, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF),       the international standards setting body, evaluated the       United States' anti-money laundering/combating the financing       of terrorism measures and determined the United States has       significant gaps in its framework;        Whereas in 2016, the FATF found that in the United States,       ``Minimal measures are imposed on designated non-financial       businesses and professions (DNFBPs), other than casinos and       dealers in precious metals and stones'';        Whereas in 2016, the FATF recommended, ``The U.S. should       conduct a vulnerability analysis of the minimally covered       DNFBP sectors to address the higher risks to which these       sectors are exposed, and consider what measures could be       introduced to address them'';        Whereas dealers in arts and antiquities are not, by       definition, covered ``financial institutions'' required to       comply with the Bank Secrecy Act;        Whereas Federal authorities have cautioned that art       collectors and dealers to be particularly careful trading       Near Eastern antiquities, warning that artifacts plundered by       terrorist organizations such as the Islamic State of Iraq and       the Levant are entering the marketplace;        Whereas, according to the Antiquities Coalition, ``because       the United States is the largest destination for       archaeological and ethnological objects from around the       world, the discovery of recently looted and trafficked       artifacts in our country not only makes Americans and our       institutions accessories to crimes, but also threatens our       relations with other countries'';        Whereas the real-estate industry, both commercial and       residential, is exempt from having to develop and implement a       four-pillar anti-money laundering program pursuant to the       Bank Secrecy Act;        Whereas it was asserted in a 2018 Conference Report by the       Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at the       Schar School of Policy and Government of George Mason       University, money laundering in real estate (MLRE) has       damaging effects on local economies by negatively impacting       property prices and dislocating residents;        Whereas in 2017, in response to evidence about significant       money laundering through real estate in the United States,       the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued       Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) requiring limited       beneficial ownership disclosure in certain transactions       involving high-end luxury real estate and ``found that about       30 percent of the transactions covered by the GTOs involve a       beneficial owner or purchaser representative that is also the       subject of a previous suspicious activity report'';        Whereas the influx of illicit money, including from Russian       oligarchs, has flowed largely unimpeded into the United       States through these anonymous shell companies and into U.S.       investments, including luxury high-end real estate;        Whereas the United States has not fulfilled the recommended       steps to address the money-laundering loopholes that the FATF       has identified with DNFBP sectors;        Whereas high-profile enforcement actions against some of       the largest and most sophisticated financial institutions       raise troubling questions about the effectiveness of U.S.       domestic anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing       regulatory, compliance, and enforcement efforts;        Whereas there are financial institutions and individuals       employed therein which continue to engage in egregious       violations of the Bank Secrecy Act and enter into deferred       prosecution agreements and non-prosecution agreements rather       than facing convictions and sentences corresponding to the       severity of their violations;        Whereas effective anti-money laundering programs must       emphasize sound corporate governance, including business-line       accountability and clear lines of legal responsibility for       individuals; and        Whereas anti-money laundering examinations in recent years       at times failed to recognize the cumulative effect of the       violations they cited, instead narrowly focusing their       attention on individual banking units, thus permitting       national banks to avoid and delay correcting problems, which       allowed massive problems to occur before serious enforcement       actions were taken: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) acknowledges that the lack of sunlight and transparency       in financial transactions poses a threat to our national       security and our economy's security;        (2) supports efforts to close loopholes that allow       corruption, terrorism, and money laundering to infiltrate our       country's financial system;        (3) encourages transparency to detect, deter, and interdict       individuals, entities, and networks engaged in money       laundering and other financial crimes;        (4) urges financial institutions to comply with the Bank       Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering laws and regulations;       and        (5) affirms that financial institutions and individuals       should be held accountable for money laundering and terror       financing crimes and violations.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  on this legislation and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 206, a resolution I  have introduced to inform the Congress and the American people about  the persistent  [[Page H2698]]  money laundering loopholes and problems that continue to plague the  American financial system.   I am pleased to bring this resolution to the floor in recognition of  Sunshine Week. As part of Sunshine Week, the Financial Services  Committee is shining a bright light on money laundering and discussing  ways to strengthen our country's anti-money laundering and  counterterrorism finance efforts.   Criminals like drug traffickers, human traffickers, fraudsters,  kleptocrats, rogue governments, and other corrupt individuals and  organizations know our financial system well and work hard to find ways  to circumvent our anti-money laundering laws.   Congress has enacted numerous laws to improve the transparency of  financial transactions that touch institutions in the United States and  those on each end of a financial transaction. We have created reporting  mechanisms, strengthened law enforcement and intelligence capacities,  and promoted responsible, privacy-protecting information regimes to  ensure that both the industry and the government have the tools needed  to rid the economy of these illicit funds. However, there are still  glaring problems and loopholes in our system that Congress must  address.   The resolution that I have introduced highlights two significant  loopholes that remain: the lack of transparency in, number one, the  arts and antiquities industry and, number two, the real estate  industry.   First, we know that ethnic and cultural artifacts are stolen and  traded to garner funds for bad actors. According to the Antiquities  Coalition: ``The United States is the largest destination for  archeological and ethnological objects from around the world.'' We  know, too, that terror groups like ISIS have looted and sold these  treasures to fund their operations, which the head of UNESCO, the  United Nations' cultural heritage agency, said was worth millions of  dollars and conducted on an ``industrial scale.'' However, today,  dealers in arts and antiquities are exempt from the Bank Secrecy Act,  creating a huge loophole for bad actors to launder funds.   Second, the significance of the real estate loophole in the United  States was acknowledged in 2017 by the Financial Crimes Enforcement  Network, FinCEN, when it issued Geographic Targeting Orders, GTOs,  requiring limited ownership information to be disclosed and reported in  some high-end real estate transactions. In fact, FinCEN has noted that  ``about 30 percent of the transactions covered by the GTOs involve a  beneficial owner or purchaser representative that is also the subject  of a previous suspicious activity report.''   The movement of illicit funds throughout the global financial system  raises numerous questions regarding the actors who are involved in  these money laundering schemes and where the money is going. This is  precisely why the Financial Services Committee is investigating the  questionable financing provided to President Trump and The Trump  Organization by banks like Deutsche Bank to finance its real estate  properties. The committee is also concerned that Trump-branded and  managed condo buildings, for example, have taken millions from suspect  Russians or individuals from former Soviet states through cash  transactions, some well above the market value and many through shell  companies.   Congress must close these loopholes, and financial institutions,  including the biggest banks, also must do their part and fully comply  with our BSA/AML laws. Although most do, we can continue to see not  only failures in compliance, but also egregious acts where money  laundering and terror finance are facilitated.   Further, many of our largest financial institutions have facilitated  money laundering through our U.S. financial system from abroad. One  scheme was carried out in Deutsche Bank's Moscow and London branches  using mirror trading, in which corrupt traders in Russia managed to  move $10 billion in illicit funds out of Russia by buying blue chip  stocks in rubles and selling them for U.S. dollars in London. Deutsche  Bank was fined nearly $630 million for allowing this mirror trading  scheme to take place.   Another scheme involved Danske Bank, wherein $230 billion in  suspicious funds moved from Russia and other former Soviet states  through one of Danske Bank's small Estonian branches to several U.S.  financial institutions.   We also know that real estate is frequently used to launder dirty  money. Bad actors like Russian oligarchs and kleptocrats often use  anonymous shell companies and all-cash schemes to buy and sell  commercial and residential real estate to hide and clean their money.   Today, these all-cash schemes are exempt from the Bank Secrecy Act.  This must stop. In passing this resolution today, we also remind our  colleagues in the banking industry of their responsibilities.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, this resolution has benefited from the  comments of the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee, Mr.  McHenry, and other members of the committee, and I thank them for their  thoughtful consideration of this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this resolution  that recognizes the need to close these loopholes and to urge financial  institutions to comply with the law.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr.   David Scott), who is a senior member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green), the chair of the Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations on the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch), a longtime member of the Financial Services  Committee.     Mr. Speaker, I cannot describe how pleased I am working  with Mr. McHenry and the way that he has expressed to you in his  presentation how we have worked together, and I thank him for that. I  am very appreciative of that, and I will continue to work on those  issues that the gentleman alluded to.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Carolyn B. Maloney), the chair of the Subcommittee on Investor  Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I include in the Record the following letter of general support for  H. Res. 206 from the Fraternal Order of Police.                                                  National Fraternal                                        Order of Police                                     Washington, DC, March 13, 2019.      Hon. Maxine M. Waters,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Emanuel Cleaver II,      Chairman, Subcommittee on National Security, International           Development and Monetary Policy, Committee on Financial           Services, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Patrick T. McHenry,      Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Steven E. Stivers,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on National Security,           International Development and Monetary Policy, Committee           on Financial Services, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Madam Chairman, Mr. Chairman and Representatives       McHenry and Stivers: I am writing on behalf of the members of       the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our continued       support for the collection of beneficial ownership       information to  [[Page H2701]]       combat terrorist financing, money laundering and other       criminal activities. We strongly agree with many of the       points raised in H. Res 206 as they pertain to the collection       of this information and we look forward to working with the       Committee on Financial Services and the Subcommittee on       National Security, International Development and Monetary       Policy to address these issues, in the months ahead.        For years, the FOP has supported the collection of       beneficial ownership information and we've been proud to       partner with Representatives Carolyn B. Maloney (D-NY) and       Peter T. King (R-NY) on legislation entitled the ``Corporate       Transparency Act `` A discussion draft sharing that same       title is being considered by the committee today and the FOP       is once again prepared to support this important legislation.        Transnational criminal organizations and terrorist       operations are using our banks, financial institutions and       other means to profit from their illegal activity This is a       well-documented problem for our financial institutions and       for law enforcement as we work together to shut down these       sophisticated criminal enterprises.        Congress and this committee have played a leadership role       in identifying the problem and working with law enforcement       to develop legislation like the ``Corporation Transparency       Act.'' In addition, this Administration also agrees with this       approach--last July U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven T.       Mnuchin testified before this committee and stated that there       is a real need to ``have access to beneficial ownership       information for law enforcement and for combating terrorist       financing.''        The Secretary's remarks were very clear that this is a       pressing issue and the vulnerability of our financial       institutions poses a genuine threat to public safety and       national security. Under current laws, shell corporations may       be used as front organizations by criminals conducting       illegal activity such as money laundering, fraud, and tax       evasion. Legislation like the ``Corporation Transparency       Act'' and other measures identified in H. Res. 206, propose       to combat this misuse of U.S. corporations by requiring the       U.S. Department of the Treasury, specifically the Financial       Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), to collect beneficial       ownership information for corporations and limited liability       companies formed under State laws unless the State is already       collecting this information. It is vital that such       information, once collected, be available to law enforcement       at every level--local, State, tribal and Federal--upon a       lawful request. The sharing of this information will help       speed the ability of law enforcement to investigate any       possible connection between these corporations and terrorist       funding.        All too often, investigations will hit a dead end when we       encounter a company with hidden ownership. Just as robbers or       burglars wear masks to hide their faces and make identifying       them more difficult; the criminals we are chasing in these       cases use shell corporations as masks, concealing themselves       while still profiting from their crimes. When we are able to       expose the link between shell companies and drug trafficking,       corruption, organized crime and terrorist finance, law       enforcement will be able to bring these criminals to justice       and make our citizens and our nation safer.        We would also like to raise our concerns about proposals       that would increase the monetary threshold for filing       Currency Transaction Reports and Suspicious Activity Reports,       thereby reducing the information law enforcement currently       receives. It is not clear what policy or public safety aim       such a change is intended to accomplish. Organized criminal       enterprises are already aware of the current thresholds and       often take steps to avoid triggering these alerts and       bringing scrutiny to their operations. Increasing these       thresholds may negatively impact law enforcement and       investigations into money laundering and other financial       crimes.        On behalf of the more than 345,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, I want to thank this committee for its       leadership on this issue and most of all, for its willingness       to engage and work with the law enforcement community on the       collection of beneficial ownership information. By working       together, I believe we can make our financial system and our       nation safer from criminal and terrorist organizations. If I       can provide any additional information on this matter, please       do not hesitate to contact me or my Executive Director, Jim       Pasco, in my Washington office.            Sincerely,                                                  Chuck Canterbury,                                                National President.     Mr. Speaker, as we join together during this Sunshine  Week to highlight the importance of transparency in our economy and our  national security, and the preservation of our rule of law, we cannot  ignore the insidious harm that is being done by institutions like  Deutsche Bank, Danske Bank, and others that facilitate money laundering  and financial crime.   Kleptocracy and corruption around the world and here at home, as the  Trump family and its companies have proven, can only thrive with the  cooperation or willful blindness from financial institutions that move,  hide, and launder their ill-gotten money, money that can come in and  out of the financial system through investments in real estate, art,  and other luxury markets across America.   I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle would agree that we  need to close loopholes that allow criminals and terrorists to hide  from sunlight and scrutiny, and I urge the House to support H. Res.  206, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
