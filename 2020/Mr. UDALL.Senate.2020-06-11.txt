 Mr. President, I pay tribute today to Joe Vandever, Sr.,  who was one of the last surviving Navajo Code Talkers.   Joe was born February 5, 1923, into the Red Running Into the Water  People clan, born for Two Who Came to the Water clan. He passed away 5  days shy of his 97th birthday, on January 31, 2020, in Haystack, NM.   Joe enlisted in the Marines when he was 19. He went through boot camp  at Camp Pendleton and spent 6 months of intensive training learning the  code and how to operate communications equipment to become a Navajo  Code Talker.   Navajo Code Talkers transmitted key military information through a  code based on the Navajo language that the Japanese never broke. They  participated in every major Marine operation in the Pacific theater and  gave the Marines a critical advantage throughout the war. However, when  they returned, they couldn't talk about their work, which remained  classified until 1968.   In 2001, Navajo Code Talkers, including Joe, received the  Congressional Silver Medal.   Joe epitomized the bravery and skill of the Navajo Code Talkers.  Joe's Navajo name means ``going places,'' and he certainly did during  the war. Serving in the 6th Marine Division from 1943 to 1946, Joe was  stationed on 16 battleships--serving from Samoa to Guadalcanal to Guam  to Japan to China. Joe translated messages from Navajo to English and  set up communications posts on the frontlines.   Joe was a spiritual man, and he provided spiritual support for others  in his Marine division. He liked to tell a story about how he knew he  would come home from the war. Before he left, he had been blessed in a  ceremony. When he was in Guam, a bird he called a sheep-face bird-- which was a Cassin's kingbird--came to him. There were no sheep-face  birds in Guam, and that bird gave Joe a sign he would return home  safely. And he did.   After he returned, Joe honored his Navajo traditions as a medicine  man. He held many different jobs over the years--working at an oil  refinery, in construction, and as a miner, prospector, farmer, and  chauffeur. For 14 years, he was employed at the Gallup Indian Medical  Center as a custodian.   Joe was fiercely proud of the Navajo language. According to Joe,  ``Our language is powerful,'' and ``we [won]the war with our tongue.''  He wanted younger generations to learn the language and counseled them:  ``Don't ever leave your language.''   Joe was a loving family man. After the war, he came home and married  Bessie, to whom he was married for 73 years, until she passed away on  September 24, 2019. He and Bessie had 9 children, 36 grandchildren, 55  great-grandchildren, and 1 great-great-grandchild. He inspired them and  encouraged them to pursue higher education, and he was beloved by them  all.   Joe lived a long life, and a good life--with kindness, optimism, good  humor, integrity, and commitment and love for family and community. His  light will continue to shine bright in his children and his future  generations. I am honored to pay tribute to Joe Vandever who faithfully  served our Nation and his family and Tribe.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I rise to acknowledge the service of  Mr. Darrell R. Willson, who is retiring as the Administrator of the  National Gallery of Art in July after a 50-year career serving the  public.   Mr. Willson has spent the three past decades with the gallery  overseeing the backbone of its operations--protecting and preserving  its historic buildings, working to expand its footprint, and ensuring  that it maintains a world-class staff. As an executive officer of the  institution, he has worked closely with gallery leadership, executive  branch officials and Congress--including with the House and Senate  Committees on Appropriations--to ensure that the gallery has had the  people and resources it needs to fulfill its mission. During his  tenure, the gallery has completed more than $400 million worth of  renovations to the East and West Buildings and welcomed visitors to new  public spaces such as the Sculpture Gallery and the Andrew W. Mellon  Memorial Fountain. In short, his work has provided the gallery with a  stunning backdrop to showcase its collection of more than 150,000  sculptures, paintings, drawings, and photographs to the American  public.   His work with the National Gallery of Art is not the only  contribution on Mr. Willson's resume that deserves recognition. Prior  to joining the gallery, Mr. Willson worked for a decade at the Art  Institute of Chicago, rising through the ranks to becom executive  director of protective services. He also served the public as a local  law enforcement official with the Waukegan, IL, police department. And  of course, these positions are all in addition to his most important  role--his service as a husband, a father, and a grandfather.   Mr. Willson deserves to take great pride in all of these important  accomplishments--especially his tireless work in support of our  Nation's great arts and cultural institutions--as he retires from the  gallery. On behalf of the Senate, I send him our thanks and warmest  congratulations for a job well done.                            ____________________
