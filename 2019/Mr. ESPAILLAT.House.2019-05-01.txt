 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment today lays before this  House a very simple fact, an undeniable fact: Communities of color  across this great Nation and, in fact, across the world are least  responsible for climate change. They contribute far less to the carbon  footprint of the world; they don't drive as many cars; in fact, they  most often take public transportation. So they contribute less to  climate change, and yet they suffer the most harm from its impact.   The most vulnerable among us, from my home in Washington Heights, in  Harlem and the northwest Bronx communities and around the world, are  all experiencing greater impacts and stand to suffer even more.   At home, I see it in the worsening of asthma rates among African  American and Latinx children when parents come to my office looking for  help for ballooning healthcare costs that they cannot afford.   I see it with seniors who have an array of respiratory diseases, in  many cases contributing to long illnesses, if not death.   I see it in Central America, where extreme drought endangers  livelihoods and has led to violence and outward migration.   I see it in the Caribbean and even here in the United States, where  climate change has increased the magnitude and frequency of hurricanes,  affecting millions who do not have the capacity to prepare for  worsening storms and have barely recovered from one before the next one  hits.   I see it in southern Africa and in south Asia and in small island  developing states, where climate change affects food scarcity and  access to clean water, damaging public health and increasing political  instability and regional violence.   Mr. Chairman, in the United States and around the world, climate  change has an unequal impact on communities of color because it  compounds existing injustices of racial and economic disparities. This  is fundamentally unjust, Mr. Chairman.   The amendment that I bring before you today is a very simple  amendment, one that says that poor communities that are very often  communities of color suffer disproportionately from climate change,  although they do not contribute more to that ill.   My amendment makes it clear that the Paris Agreement seeks to address  issues of environmental justice and the disparate impact climate change  is having and will continue to have on vulnerable communities and  people of color.   If adopted, I believe it will send a strong message, a very strong  message that, with this bill, the United States of America's commitment  to remain in the Paris climate agreement also means our agreement to  address environmental injustices.   When it comes to mitigating climate change, we cannot forget  disenfranchised communities. We cannot forget communities of color. We  cannot forget indigenous communities. We cannot forget low-income  communities. We cannot forget climate refugees, and we cannot forget  the children who will bear this burden when we are all gone.   In every piece of legislation on climate change considered by this  House, in every bill on environmental issues we pass, and at every  hearing that we hold regarding this important matter, we must ensure  that issues of environmental justice are equally addressed and that the  disenfranchised communities and communities of color are heard,  because, again, Mr. Chairman, they contribute far less to the carbon  footprint, they contribute far less to climate change, and yet they  suffer tremendously. So this is, fundamentally, an injustice.    I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Engel and the  leadership, Chairman Pallone, for working with me to advance this  important issue.   I want to, further, thank my colleagues who have cosponsored this  amendment and are similarly dedicated to advancing environmental  justice: Congress Members McEachin, Omar, Jayapal, Pressley, Carbajal,  Cisneros, and Moore.   Finally, I want to thank many other groups in my district that  continue to advocate day in and day out for environmental justice, a  strong and diverse coalition that I am proud to represent.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1630
