 Madam President, I rise to introduce the CASELOAD Act of  2023.   This legislation would address the critical need for additional  judges in California's Eastern District, which faces disproportionately  high workloads and significant litigation backlogs.   This legislation would add five new judges to the Eastern District of  California over the next 4 years to increase that court's capacity to  address the needs of its roughly 8.4 million citizens.   The bill adds the judges in three tranches. Two judges would be added  in 2025, one judge would be added in 2027, and two would be added in  2029.   It also would authorize the funds necessary for the additional  positions.   The Eastern District of California encompasses 34 counties and has  roughly 8\1/2\ million residents. Despite this massive geographic size  and population, the Eastern District has only six permanent judgeships  and has not added a permanent seat since 1978.   The judges of the Eastern District face a staggering caseload. The  total pending cases per judge as of June 2022 was 1,308, over 2\1/2\  the national average for districts.   The people of the Eastern District, as well as the hard-working  judicial officers who serve them, would greatly benefit from the  additional judgeships that this bill would add.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Carper):   S. 1772. A bill to establish a national mercury monitoring program,  and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public  Works.    Madam President, I rise to reintroduce the Protecting  Unique and Beautiful Landscapes by Investing in California, PUBLIC  Lands Act. This measure would increase protections for over 1 million  acres of Federal public lands throughout northwest California, the  central coast, and Los Angeles, including nearly 600,000 acres of new  wilderness, more than 583 miles of new wild and scenic rivers, and over  100,000 acres of an expanded national monument.   This legislation would preserve our public lands for the benefit of  current and future generations and help protect California communities  from the impacts of the climate crisis.   The PUBLIC Lands Act is grounded in the best conservation principles:  It expands access to the outdoors for all, addresses disparities in  access to nature, supports locally led efforts, and is based on  science.   In northwest California, this bill would designate new wilderness,  wild and scenic rivers, recreation and conservation areas, and forest  and watershed restoration areas. Importantly, it would increase  wildfire resiliency in northwest California, where the impacts of the  climate crisis have resulted in more frequent and severe wildfires.   Along the central coast, the bill would designate nearly 250,000  acres of public land in the Los Padres National Forest and Carrizo  Plain National Monument as wilderness and establish a 400-mile-long  Condor National Recreation trail, stretching from Los Angeles to  Monterey County. The designations in the bill would protect the Central  Valley's abundant biodiversity, including threatened and endangered  species.   In Southern California, the bill would expand the San Gabriel  Mountains National Monument to include more of the San Gabriel Mountain  range. Los Angeles County is one of the most park-poor, densely  populated, and polluted regions in the Nation, and this legislation  would begin to rectify that by providing increased outdoor  opportunities for Angelenos and ensuring that disadvantaged communities  can benefit more easily from our public lands.   I want to highlight that this legislation protects existing water  rights, property rights, and land-use authorities. The bill also does  not create any new public lands--rather, it protects existing public  lands through the designation as wilderness in order to keep these  lands as untouched and wild as possible.   The science is becoming increasingly clear that we must conserve 30  percent of our lands and waters by 2030 as part of our efforts to solve  the climate crisis, protect nature, and save America's wildlife. This  legislation would provide significant progress on that goal, helping  California and the Biden administration meet our 30x30 goals and  reverse the worst effects of climate change.   The bill would also provide outdoor recreation opportunities for  park-poor communities. It is imperative that as we conserve our public  lands, we do so in a way that also reverses racial and economic  disparities in access to nature and parks.   This bill enjoys the support of hundreds of local municipalities and  elected officials, community groups, and businesses and local  outfitters. It is the product of significant public engagement in the  legislative process over decades.   I would like to thank my colleagues and conservation champions,  Representatives Jared Huffman, Salud Carbajal, and Judy Chu, for  championing these bills in the House.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the PUBLIC Lands  Act as quickly as possible.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to introduce the CASELOAD Act of  2023.
