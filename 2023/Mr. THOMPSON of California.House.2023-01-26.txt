 Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Huffman for doing  this amendment and for yielding me time.   Mr. Chair, the northern California coastline includes some of the  most scenic and biodiverse waters in the world. As one of the five most  significant upwellings in the world, California's north coast is home  to nutrient-rich surface waters critical to maintaining vast  biodiversity.   This coastline is home to dozens of marine mammals, over a hundred  species of seabirds and shorebirds, and a tremendous number of fish  species, which include salmon, striped bass, halibut, tuna, and many  more.   An oilspill off this coast could devastate both the marine life and  the local economy. It would crush the fishing community and local  tourism. This amendment deserves to be passed.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk, No. 23.    Mr. Chair, my amendment would ensure that  any plan to respond to high prices with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  includes oil conservation measures which will save our constituents  money and strengthen our national security.   Reducing our country's reliance on oil reduces our economic and  security exposure to hostile foreign governments.   The Biden administration has successfully used the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve to lower prices for consumers following Russia's  despicable invasion of Ukraine and in response to OPEC's punitive oil  production cuts. In both cases, prices fell, and fell significantly,  following the administration's actions.   My amendment would give the administration another tool to reduce  prices and save money for our constituents. Policies that reduce oil  use by using it more efficiently or transitioning to other fuel sources  altogether benefit every American.   Having a plan with options that include boosting public  transportation ridership, encouraging teleworking, and speeding the  transition to using more electric vehicles would reduce our reliance on  oil and lower fuel prices.   Relying on oil companies to drill our way out of overreliance doesn't  make sense and will never deliver true energy independence. Oil  companies are sitting on 13 million acres and about 9,000 approved but  unused permits on public lands that aren't being used to produce gas or  oil.   We need to do everything we can to build on the success of the true  energy independence provisions secured in the landmark Inflation  Reduction Act to break our dependence on oil, to create jobs in our  country, and to strengthen our national security.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                Point of Order     Mr. Chairman, I couldn't disagree more.  The whole purpose of this is to deal with providing a plan--that is the  underlying bill, to provide this plan--and the whole idea is to save  oil and gas and to reduce that. This amendment does that. It relies on  that plan.   As a matter of fact, it embellishes the plan to include other known  ways to save oil and gas. This is absolutely germane.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
