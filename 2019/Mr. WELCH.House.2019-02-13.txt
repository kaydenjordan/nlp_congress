 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Engel).   I have listened to the arguments of my colleagues who say that Saudi  Arabia is an ally and a partner and we have to support them. Saudi  Arabia is a questionable ally--we all know that--and it is time to  reexamine that relationship.   But I have a question that this raises: If we have an ally that is  engaged in violent strikes killing innocent civilians, including  children, do we turn a blind eye and condone that behavior because it  is ``an ally''?   Do we condone the bombing of schools, of hospitals, of funerals  because it is a partner or an ally?   Do we disregard our own responsibility as human beings to oppose  violence against innocence because that violence is being perpetrated  by an ally?   And, yes, it is true, our troops are not there, but our bombs are,  our mid-air refuelers are, our targeting folks are.   We are allowing ourselves to be complicit in what is the greatest  humanitarian tragedy that is on the face of this Earth at this moment.  We should not be doing that, and we should stop by voting for this  resolution.   Mr. Chair, we have a proud tradition in this country that both sides  want to honor, and that is to stand up for freedom and for human  decency and dignity.   This policy of Saudi Arabia to bomb and bomb again and bomb yet  again, despite the devastating impact upon innocent people, despite how  reckless and ineffective it is, must end. Let's end it.
