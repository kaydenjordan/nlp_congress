 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight a critical piece  of legislation that my colleagues and I in the Committee on Education  and Labor are currently marking up next door, the College Affordability  Act.   For too many students across our Nation, the dream of pursuing higher  education remains out of reach. Rising tuition costs and financially  debilitating loans prevent young people from reaching their full  potential, and that is simply unacceptable.   That is why we are working to provide relief for students through the  College Affordability Act. This reauthorization of the Higher Education  Act restores Federal investments in public colleges, increases the  value of grant opportunities, and makes student loans easier to pay  off.   Nothing should stand in the way of the success of our children's  educational opportunities, especially not the fear of crippling long- term debt.   Mr. Speaker, I am on my way back to the committee room to continue  our work to make higher education accessible and affordable for all  students.                            ____________________
