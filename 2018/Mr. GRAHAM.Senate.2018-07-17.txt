 Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments about the  topic in the news today and yesterday and, hopefully, will result in  some action by Congress; that is, the threats we face as a Nation  regarding our electoral system.   First I would like to recognize the Presiding Officer of the Senate,  Senator Rubio, for working with Senator Van Hollen to come up with a  piece of legislation called the DETER Act, which I think will serve us  well. If the Director of National Intelligence certifies that a foreign  power--Russia or anyone else--is trying to attack our electoral  infrastructure, they will pay a heavy price.   Today is July 17, 2018. On Friday, last week, I think it was July--I  don't know the dates; I just got back from traveling. So on Friday of  last week, a few days ago, the Director of National Intelligence said  the following: ``The warning lights are blinking red again. Today, the  digital infrastructure that serves this country is literally under  attack.''   How much more do we need as a body and as a nation to rally ourselves  to act while there is still time?   He indicated that our cyber space strategies emphasize only defense,  not offense as well, evoking President Reagan's Cold War approach to  the Soviet Union. Mr. Coats suggested that if Russia continues to try  to take on the United States in the cyber arena, then the  administration should throw everything we have into that exercise.   Every Member of Congress, every Member of the Senate, as well as the  President, has an obligation to defend the Nation against all enemies,  foreign and domestic. I am 1,000 percent convinced that the Russians  meddled in our election in 2016. They did not change the outcome, but  they did disrupt our election. The bottom line is they are still up to  it.   If you don't believe me, just ask Director of National Intelligence  Dan Coats, who is a former Member of this body.   In August of 2001, the 9/11 Commission found statements from the CIA  that indicated there was something afoot, that ``the lights are  blinking red,'' but they couldn't point to bin Laden specifically. As  we look back, how much accountability should the Bush administration  have had and how much accountability should Congress have had back  then? Did we miss the warning signs regarding the September 11 attack?  I would suggest that the chatter was strong and the threat was real,  but nobody could really pinpoint it.   Here is what I am suggesting: The chatter is strong, the threat is  real, and we know exactly where it is coming from. The question is,  Will the House and Senate, working with the President, do anything  about it? Senator Rubio and Senator Van Hollen have chosen to try to do  something about it.   We are all eventually going to be in the history books. President  Trump said today that he believed our electoral infrastructure needs to  be made more secure--not just electoral infrastructure; energy and  financial services are under threat, and not just from Russia.   So I want to look forward. I heard Senator McConnell say today that  he would like to find some bipartisan legislation that could come  forward sooner rather than later to try to harden the infrastructure  before the 2018 election. The bottom line here is that we all owe it to  every voter in the country and all of those who are serving in the  intelligence community and in the military to secure our election the  best we can.   I am hoping that we will become ``Team America'' just for a few  minutes. I am not asking my Democrat friends to give President Trump a  pass, and I am not asking my Republican colleagues to stop fighting for  our agenda. I am asking both parties to calm down and focus on the  common enemy. The common enemy is Russia, and countries like Russia,  that want to undermine our democracy, pit us one against the other, and  they did it in 2016. If you believe Dan Coats, they are going to do it  again. This meeting recently with President Trump and Putin--in my  view, we missed an opportunity to really put the Russians on notice.  But rather than look back, let's look forward.   Today, President Trump expressed confidence in our intelligence  community. I am glad to hear that. I trust them far more than I trust  Putin. It is not just America that Putin has been trying to interfere  with; it is in France and Germany and everywhere else there is a  democracy. President Putin is trying to destroy alliances like the  European Union, which, I think, has value to the United States. He is  trying to break NATO. He is attacking us here at home: fake news--truly  fake news--made-up news article to try to pit one American against the  other and trying to steal emails from party officials and dump them  into the public domain at critical times in the election.   What do I say to my Republican colleagues? It was the Democrats last  time; it could be us next time. It was Russia last time, and they are  still up to it this time, but Iran, North Korea, China--fill in the  blank--we are all exposed.   Article 5 of the NATO Charter says that an attack against one is an  attack against all. So I would ask my colleagues tonight to think about  that in terms of our democracy. An attack on one party should be an  attack on all parties.   The Republican Party should take no comfort or glee in the fact that  our Democratic friends were compromised in a very embarrassing way that  hurt them. Nobody changed vote totals. But can you imagine how we would  feel if the inner circle of the President was hacked and, at a crucial  time in the election, the information was exposed?   To my friends in the media, you have to make a hard decision: How  much do you empower this? How much do you aid a foreign government by  publishing this information?   I believe we are at war in many ways. We are not at war in a direct  way with Russia, but these cyber attacks are, to me, a hostile act  against our country just as much as if they had launched a conventional  attack. They are going to continue to do this until they pay a price.   I would like for us to come together to not only harden our  infrastructure to make sure that 2018 cannot be compromised by a  foreign power but also to make countries like Russia pay a price.   Senator Van Hollen and Senator Rubio have a very good piece of  legislation which basically says that if the Director of National  Intelligence certifies that a foreign power like Russia is continuing  to interfere in our election, then we will up sanctions. We will make  it harder, not easier, on that foreign power. It is Russia today; it  could be somebody else tomorrow, and it probably already is.   So rather than taking the moment and dividing us about what President  Trump said or didn't say, why don't we use this as an opportunity to  listen to the professionals, not the politicians.   Senator Rubio is on the Intelligence Committee. I am very proud of  the work they have accomplished. They made a bipartisan finding that  Russia did meddle in the 2016 election with the view of trying to help  Trump over Clinton, but there is no evidence it changed the outcome.   The bottom line for me is that if we don't come together now--this is  the end of July, July 17--we have precious days left to take action  that could protect the 2018 election cycle.   The worst thing that could happen in a democracy is if somebody's  vote could be stolen or the information provided to the public could be  tainted in a fashion by some foreign entity to pit  [[Page S5000]]  one American against another. We do enough of that ourselves; we don't  need anybody else's help. And the record is clear, in terms of 2016,  that Russia was all over the place spreading disinformation, trying to  create conflict within the Democratic primary, within the Republican  primary, and during the general election.   November will be here before we know it. Here is what we have to ask  ourselves as a body--and eventually be held accountable by the public  and history. What did we do in July to answer the alarm raised by  Director Dan Coats about the warning lights blinking red? I see attacks  on critical infrastructure going on today, and I will expect them to  continue. We need to up our game as a nation.   I don't know how any of us can go to our constituents in November and  say that we answered Dan Coats' call if we do nothing. So I hope that  Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer can find a way to come up with a  common agenda--maybe starting with the Rubio-Van Hollen bill--to see if  there is common ground to deal with a common problem.   I would ask President Trump not to look backward, but to look  forward. I have no doubt that you won the election, Mr. President, in  2016. The Russians didn't beat Ms. Clinton; you did. But what they are  up to now can jeopardize our democracy.   We are just a stone's throw away from their changing vote totals.  Senator Rubio knows this better than I because he is on the  Intelligence Committee. They are already infiltrating voter  registration files. It would not be much of a leap to have some votes  flipped through cyber attacks. So we have a chance in the coming days-- working together, not against each other--to find solutions to this  problem. I am sure whatever we come up with will not be perfect, but at  least we tried. The one thing I cannot live with is not trying.    I have known Dan Coats for well over a decade, Secretary Pompeo, the  entire national security team, Senator Burr, Senator Warner, Senator  Rubio--they all tell us the same thing: Our critical infrastructure is  under attack by foreign powers, Russia being the leader. The question  for us is, What do we do about it?   I am hoping that next week the President will call the Congress  together, in a bipartisan fashion, to come up with some preventive  measures to protect our infrastructure, when it comes to the November  election, and that we, as a nation, try to figure out what the rules of  engagement are going to be, not to just defend ourselves from  aggression but punish the aggressor.   I don't have all the answers. I am not suggesting this is my area of  expertise, because it is not, but I am smart enough to know Russia is  going to continue what they did in 2016, until somebody makes them pay  a heavy price, and it is just not Russia; be it Iran, China, North  Korea, or other bad actors.   I don't know how, as a body, we can live with ourselves if we don't  try to heed Dan Coats' warnings. They are not just given by him but by  those who work for him, who are nonpolitical, who have made it their  life's work to find ways to protect this Nation.   So, Mr. President, we have a chance to bring the Congress together.  Challenge us to work with you to find solutions to this looming threat,  better ways to defend America's critical infrastructure when it comes  to our 2018 election, and challenge us to work with you. I hope we will  be smart enough to meet that challenge, and I hope you will issue that  challenge. You are the most special person in our constitutional  democracy when it comes to national security. You are the Commander in  Chief. You rightly criticized President Obama for being slow when it  came to reacting to Russian interference in 2016. I am sure that was a  hard call for President Obama, but there is no doubt in my mind that  you, the Senate, and the House are now on notice--by your own  intelligence services--that Russia is interfering now and will continue  to do so up to 2018 and beyond unless somebody stops them. At a  minimum, we should come up with defensive measures available to us. As  a nation, we need to deal with this threat.   I am not worried about a foreign power taking over our country in a  conventional military fashion. I am worried about foreign powers and  terrorist organizations using cyber attacks to cripple our country, our  economy, our finances, and our energy, but, most importantly, the heart  and soul of democracy, which is free and fair elections. Putin wants no  part of free and fair elections. All of us should very much want to  have a free and fair election in 2018. We are not going to have one  unless we push back together and push back now.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein.
