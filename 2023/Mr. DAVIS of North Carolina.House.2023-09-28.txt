 Madam Speaker, today I rise to highlight  East Carolina University ROTC Detachment 600's 75th anniversary.   As a former commandant of cadets at this remarkable detachment, it  was a privilege to participate in this celebration to see former cadets  who are successful with their careers.   During the celebration, a true American hero, our most decorated  graduate, retired General Gary North, shared a message that resonated  deeply with everyone.   He reminded us that our Air Force stands as the finest in the world  today because of the unwavering service of those who came before us and  the dedication of those who serve today. His charge to us was simple,  but profound: Always remember your oath. This oath is our commitment to  protecting our Constitution, our values, our great Nation, and our way  of life. May God bless our Air Force and Detachment 600. Go Pirates.  May God bless America.                            ____________________
