 Mr. Speaker, Republicans are bound and determined to  rush through this Congress an immense tax bill before Americans even  begin to know what hit them. We need to speak up and inform families  about this bill and its many bad parts.   I came here to the House a few weeks ago and said: All you need to  know about this tax bill is that it is good for Donald Trump and his  billionaire buddies. It rewards those multinational companies that have  been shipping jobs and profits offshore for so many years and who think  they have no responsibility to pay for our national security and other  vital public services.   Well, I am here today to admit that I was in error. All of those  things are true. It is about Donald Trump and his billionaire buddies  and all the additional money they will pocket. It is about shipping the  jobs offshore by multinationals who get a new incentive, a giant, new  loophole in this bill, but I was wrong to say that was all that it is  about. It also now begins to impact one family after another across  America in their healthcare.   It is the same fanaticism that drove Republicans to try to take away  healthcare 60-plus different times in the last Congress and the same  fanaticism that has caused them to push forward with repeal effort  after repeal effort. It is the kind of fanaticism that American  citizens stood up to.   It was not only the courageous votes of John McCain, Susan Collins,  and other Members in the Senate who stopped this wretched healthcare  bill that passed through the House, but it was the fact that Americans  kept saying: No, don't take the right that my family has to get access  to a family physician. Don't take away my neighbors' or my church  members' right to get access to protect their family with healthcare.   Today, we learn that this new tax bill is being changed to do just  that. It is another assault on the Affordable Care Act.   In the beginning of the rush to force it through the House long  before Thanksgiving, before Americans even get to give it attention,  the first step that Republicans took here in the committee that I serve  on that considered the tax bill last week was on what we call the  Alzheimer's tax.   Currently, American citizens have a right that has long existed in  our tax law that if you have really serious medical expenses of over 10  percent of your income, such as a family who earns $50,000--which is  now, today, a modest income--and they have over $5,000 in medical  expenses, they can deduct those from their taxes.   It is called the Alzheimer's tax because so many of the families that  rely on disability to deduct medical expenses are older people who have  a family member with Alzheimer's. They need long-term, special care, or  they need someone with home health care to come and help them with this  very serious problem.   Under the bill that is before us today, they will be denied any right  to continue to do that. Under this bill, they will get an opportunity  to pay a tax on the dollars they are having to expend for Alzheimer's  care.   Of course, it is not just Alzheimer's care. It might be a young  family that has a child with a serious disability who requires home  health aides or physical therapy, or it might be a woman with breast  cancer whose medical coverage does not provide all of the treatment  that she needs.   Under this Republican bill, you will no longer be able to deduct one  cent for all those serious, burdensome medical bills. No, they want to  tax you on what you paid in excess of medical bills.   We have moved today to chapter two. The bill that the House will  consider will be merged with a Senate bill. The Senate has declared  they will end forever the individual responsibility portions of the  Affordable Care Act. Those are the provisions that ensure all Americans  will participate so that we will have the largest possible risk pool  and that people don't sign up for the Affordable Care Act just after  they are sick, after they have a problem. Everyone is there. It is just  like you don't sign up for fire insurance after your house is on fire.   It is essential for everyone. We must reject this bill as the wrong  way for America to go to deny healthcare coverage and impose more taxes  on too many Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this wretched Republican tax bill threatens  the health of millions. That is why Republicans are rushing this sham  through in record pace. They want to pass it before most Americans know  what has hit them.   It is amazing that, on this Alzheimer's Awareness Month, they  celebrate it by imposing a new Alzheimer's tax. Families paying  thousands of dollars to care for a loved one would lose the right that  they have today to deduct those huge expenses. It is not just a tax on  Alzheimer's, but on any substantial healthcare expense.   As if that were not bad enough, they pursue with their fanatical zeal  the destruction of ObamaCare. Again, they would remove one of the key  pillars that will lead to denying coverage for those with preexisting  conditions because their insurance premiums will soar.   It will mean that millions of Americans will lose their healthcare  coverage. Protect your health. Reject this sorry Republican tax bill.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, only 1 minute?   Well, one minute is longer than all of the hearings that have been  held by  [[Page H9273]]  Republicans on this sham of a tax bill that is so very broad in impact  and so shallow in analysis.   Only one minute?   That is more than all of the Trump Administration officials who did  not have the courage to come and face our committee and be questioned  about this lousy proposal.                                time  1315    Mr. Speaker, one minute? That is more time than all of the businesses  in America and economists were given to explain the nature of these  corporate giveaways.   Why should a tax bill that is so broad get less time than it takes to  microwave popcorn? Haste does make waste. This tax plan, born in the  shadows and rammed through here 90-to-nothing will lay waste to family  budgets, lay waste to affordable healthcare, and undermine our national  debt.   This tax scam must be rejected. They want it through here before the  American people know what hit them, but if we speak out and remain firm  in our resolve, we will defeat this sham of a bill.
