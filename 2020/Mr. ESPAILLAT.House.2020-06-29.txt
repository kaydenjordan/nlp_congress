 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Waters for her  steadfast support of tenants. With close to 130,000 deaths that are  COVID-19 related, 40 million unemployed, these are difficult times.   But now we are facing a housing tsunami as millions of families go to  sleep every night afraid and anxious of where they are going to get  their rent money. The rent is too damn high.   That is why Congressman Chuy Garcia and I introduced the STAY HOME  Act of 2020 that provides billions of dollars of financial support for  renters. This is a good bill that will provide $100 billion for  renters, people who really don't know where they are getting their  money to pay their rent. They want to keep a roof over their head. They  don't want to be homeless. This is a critical time in America, and this  bill will produce the moneys that we need to ensure that people are not  homeless.
