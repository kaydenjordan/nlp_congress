 Mr. Speaker, if we want America's kids to remain  competitive in the 21st century, we can't just teach reading and math.  We need to ensure they have healthy, nutritious food in school. Studies  show keeping kids fed leads to better attendance, higher test scores,  and lifelong benefits.   Last summer, Congress temporarily increased the Federal reimbursement  level schools receive for breakfast and lunch, but in the richest  country in the history of the world, we can do better. This National  School Breakfast Week I have introduced the Healthy Meals Help Kids  Learn Act to permanently increase the reimbursement level for our  children.   The next generation of Americans--our future doctors, engineers,  carpenters, professors, mechanics, and more--need nutritious food to  learn and to thrive. If we pass my bill, schools can make more made- from-scratch meals with more locally sourced, healthier ingredients.   It is a win-win-win for our kids, our farmers, and our future. I urge  strong bipartisan support for my bill.                            ____________________
