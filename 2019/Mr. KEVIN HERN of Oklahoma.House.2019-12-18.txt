 Public hearings began November 13. Less  than a month later, Speaker Pelosi announced Articles of Impeachment on  December 5, saying the investigation had revealed enough information to  move forward with impeachment.   Let's think about that 22-day investigation. Six of those days were  weekends where hearings weren't happening, and the House was not in  session. Seven of those days were weekdays that the House was in  recess, including the week of Thanksgiving. Two of those days were fly- in days, where Congress doesn't hold hearings. So out of the 22 days,  just 7 days were used to investigate, debate, and vote on the  impeachment of the duly elected leader of our country.   No wonder my constituents are upset; 7 days to impeach the President  of the United States. Not to mention that this 7-day investigation  uncovered zero facts in support of impeachment. I spent every minute I  had in there as an observer of these hearings, and all I learned is if  you hate someone so strongly and enough people agree with you, that is  grounds enough to be impeached.   We asked for 12 hours of debate, the same amount of time allotted to  President Clinton's impeachment, 12 hours of debate for possibly the  biggest vote I would cast in my tenure as a Representative. It isn't  asking too much, but, no, they want to get out of here before  Christmas, so it is okay to rush the process.   I am ashamed to be part of this today, even as I vote against the  impeachment. My constituents are calling every day mad as hell, saying  we should be ashamed that this historic Chamber has fallen so low as to  allow something like this to happen.
