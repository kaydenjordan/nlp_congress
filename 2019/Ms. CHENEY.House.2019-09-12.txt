 Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague from Alaska for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this legislation.   I wish I could say that I am surprised by the bills that are being  brought before us this week, but I am not. The Democratic war on our  economy, on America's families, and on fossil fuels continues.   Mr. Chairman, energy independence is crucial for our economy and our  security. I stand in strong solidarity with my friend and colleague  from Alaska, someone who is a mentor not just to me, but to all on our  side of the aisle.   Partly, I stand in solidarity with him because I, like Mr. Young,  represent my entire State. Like Alaska, Wyoming is no stranger to  outsiders thinking they know what is best for us.   The legislation we have before us today echoes the majority's goal of  making the Green New Deal a reality, fundamentally changing our way of  life by making us increasingly dependent on foreign sources of energy.    Yesterday, Mr. Chairman, I joined my colleagues, Whip Scalise and the  House Committee on Natural Resources ranking member, Mr. Bishop, to  introduce the American Energy First Act.   Our bill would end unnecessary overreach from Washington bureaucrats  and enable States to manage energy production on lands within our  borders. Our all-of-the-above pro-energy legislation would help put our  families to work, further our energy independence, and put our national  security at the forefront.   Wyoming prides itself on our fossil fuels. We know that our economy  and that our security depends on these. We consider our fossil fuels to  be national treasures, and, Mr. Chairman, we thank God for our fossil  fuels.   Mr. Chairman, I stand here today to oppose this misguided anti-energy  independence and anti-national security agenda that the Democratic  majority has continued to put before us, and I urge my colleagues to  oppose this bill.
