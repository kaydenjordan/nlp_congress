 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National  Family Caregiver Month.   More than 95 percent of individuals with dementia also have one or  more chronic conditions. Individuals with dementia rely heavily on  their family members or other caregivers to provide time,  transportation, and other health services, which can be economically  and emotionally challenging for a family.   In Illinois alone, we have over 381,000 caregivers for people living  with dementia, and 53.5 percent of them have their own chronic health  conditions.   During National Family Caregiver Month, it is important to recognize  the dedication and sacrifice that families and caregivers provide for  their loved ones.   My legislation, the Comprehensive Care for Alzheimer's Act, provides  additional support to dementia patients and caregivers. The bill would  direct the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation to implement a  dementia care model to test comprehensive care management services and  would make a big impact on the lives of people living with dementia and  their caregivers.   As I travel throughout Illinois, dementia care and Alzheimer's  advocates continue to share their caregiving stories with me. Mr.  Speaker, I ask for support of this bill.                            ____________________
