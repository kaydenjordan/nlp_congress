 Madam Speaker, I rise today to clarify  the intent of Section 205 of this amendment and thank you for including  my 60 day disaster relief extension in the House Amendment to the  Senate Amendment to H.R. 1865--Further Consolidated Appropriations Act  of 2020, although I cannot support this bill in its final form.   The language of Sec. 205 of the House Amendment to the Senate  Amendment to H.R. 1865--Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020  was originally introduced in my bill, H.R. 3287--Tax Relief and  Expedited Assistance for Disasters Act of 2019 (TREAD Act). This  provision provides disaster related tax relief to those who are victims  of a natural disaster. Specifically, this provision allows for people  to receive a 60 day extension to file their taxes if there is a  federally declared disaster. I want to clarify that this extension is  not limited to the current Internal Revenue Service (IRS) policy of  extending by a declaration for FEMA Individual Assistance or FEMA  Public Assistance, but may be triggered by any federal assistance under  the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as  amended, and Related Authorities as of August 2016. This would include  Technical Assistance to State and Local Governments for Effective  Warnings or any assistance outlined in Section 202 of the Stafford Act.  Additionally, this provision does not prevent the IRS from extending  this tax relief beyond 60 days.   Thank you again for including this common sense provision to assist  disaster relief victims.
