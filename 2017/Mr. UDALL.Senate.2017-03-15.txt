 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, this week is Sunshine Week, a week when we  applaud open government and when we celebrate the institutions that  hold government accountable. Throughout our Nation's history, one of  the most important has been the press, the free press. Donald Trump, as  candidate and President, has repeatedly attacked the press. He has  called it the ``enemy of the people,'' he has labeled the national  media outlets as ``fake news,'' and he has criticized respected  reporters who have reported for years.   He has singled out mainstream newspapers like the New York Times,  Politico, and the Los Angeles Times, and television outlets like ABC,  NBC, CBS, CNN. That is how this President operates. He acts like a  bully, and not just with the media. He attacks the courts when article  III judges disagree with him, and when they find he is breaking the  law. He attacks sitting judges for deciding against him, even those  appointed by Republican Presidents.   Without basis, he attacks our intelligence agencies, and he even  demeans career public servants who risk their lives to keep our Nation  safe. The President's goal is obvious, to undermine the institutions in  our country who threaten him, who criticize him. Authoritarians have  used this strategy for centuries and continue to do so today in  countries where democracy is weak or nonexistent and where autocracy or  kleptocracy is strong.   But this is the United States. We are an example to the world of  democratic principles and action. The President's repeated attacks on  our democratic institutions need to stop and they need to stop now. A  free and robust press is critical for democracy to work, period, end of  story. Our Nation's history of a free press dates back to our founding.  Free press in the colonial United States developed in reaction to  severe restrictions on free speech in England.   During the latter half of the 17th century, all books and articles  were required to be licensed by the government to be published. Then,  ``seditious libel''--bringing ``hatred or contempt'' upon the Crown or  the Parliament by written word--was a criminal offense. So to speak  against the Crown was a criminal offense. Truth was not a defense.   No publication could criticize the Crown or the government, even if  it was accurate. The first newspapers in the Colonies operated under  licenses from the colonial Governor. But by 1721, James Franklin,  Benjamin Franklin's older brother, was publishing one of the first  colonial independent newspapers, the New England Courant, in Boston.   Ben Franklin was his apprentice, typesetter, and sometimes  contributed under pen names. Several years later, Ben Franklin began  publishing his own independent newspaper, the Pennsylvania Gazette. His  newspaper became the most popular in the Colonies and was published  until 1800.   By 1735, the tenets of seditious libel were coming undone. John Peter  Zenger, the publisher of the New York Weekly Journal, ran articles  harshly critical of the colonial government. Zenger was arrested and  tried for libel. While he admitted he published the articles, his  lawyer argued truth was a defense. The press, the lawyer argued, has  ``a liberty both of exposing and opposing tyrannical power by speaking  and writing the truth.''   The judge, however, instructed the jury as to the law at the time,  that Zenger must be found guilty if he published the articles, whether  truthful or not, but after 10 minutes of deliberation, the jury  acquitted Zenger. These were some of the beginnings of a free press in  our Nation.   The first rights in the Bill of Rights are freedom of religion, the  press, speech, petition, and assembly. The press, as an institution, is  expressly protected by the Constitution. In 1789, the drafters of the  Bill of Rights understood that a free press was essential to the growth  and success of our new democracy. They understood that debate,  disagreement, the free flow of ideas, make an informed public, that the  press helps educate voters.   They understood all too well that government power needed to be  checked and that the press holds the powerful in check by investigating  and exposing arbitrary conduct, abuse, and corruption. A democracy  cannot exist without a free press. It is as simple as that, but our  President does not seem to understand this or he does not care.  According to him, the press is ``dishonest,'' ``not good people,''  ``sleazy,'' and, ``among the worst human beings.'' Those are all quotes  by our President.   Established press organizations are the ``fake news,'' and a few  weeks ago he declared the press ``an enemy of the people.'' We have not  heard attacks like this since Watergate, and even then, it wasn't so  much so fast. The President's subordinates are now given license to  accuse and to limit press access.   Chief Strategist Steve Bannon said the press should ``keep its mouth  shut and just listen for a while.'' This quote from Mr. Bannon has  extra significance today because he is no longer the head of a  rightwing media company. In a controversial move, President Trump  issued an Executive order to add him to the National Security Council's  Principal's Committee.   Today, we are going to vote on the nomination of General McMaster to  retain his three-star general status while serving as the head of the  National Security Council. I do not believe a political extremist like  Mr. Bannon should serve on the Council. At a minimum, General McMaster  should direct Mr. Bannon to stop attacking the free press while serving  on the Council.   Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway called for media organizations to  fire reporters who criticized Candidate Trump. Press Secretary Shawn  Spicer barred the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, BuzzFeed,  and Politico from a press conference, and the Secretary of State will  now travel without the press corps, disregarding a decades-old  practice.   Now, don't get me wrong. The press does not always get it right. They  make mistakes. News organizations have their biases. Mistakes should be  corrected and bias should be tempered by using accepted journalistic  methods and professional judgment and following journalism's ethics  code.   Mistakes and the exercise of professional judgment are not the same  thing as reporting ``fake news.'' The President's Republican colleagues  have been too silent in the face of attacks. Few in Congress have stood  up against the President's hostility to the press. Government officials  are afraid to disagree. Just last week, at a Senate Commerce Committee  hearing, I asked the FCC Chair, Mr. Pai, a yes or no question, does he  agree with the President that the press is the enemy of the people.   He did not engage. He would not answer. He let stand the President's  remarks. The President's characterization of the press as the enemy is  reminiscent of President Nixon, when Nixon said: ``Never forget. The  press is the enemy. The press is the enemy. The press is the enemy,''  as recorded on his secret tapes.   The press was Nixon's enemy because the press exposed his criminal  conduct which led to his resignation. The press is Trump's enemy  because the press exposes his and his associates' ties to  [[Page S1820]]  Russia, the President's myriad Trump organization conflicts of  interest, his constant barrage of misrepresentations of fact.   Nixon's Press Secretary called the Washington Post investigative  reporting shoddy and shabby journalism. Like President Trump's  accusation of fake news, that same Post reporting won the paper a  Pulitzer Prize.   Watergate was a break-in of the Democratic National Committee during  the Presidential campaign. Nixon ordered his Chief of Staff to have the  CIA block the FBI's investigation into the source of the funding for  the Watergate burglary. During this last Presidential election, we had  a cyber break-in of the DNC. Even after 17 U.S. intelligence agencies  concluded Russia hacked the DNC to sway the election, Candidate Trump  refused to accept their analysis.   The President's Chief of Staff pressured the FBI to publicly deny  that Trump associates had contact with the Russians, while his Chief  Counsel reportedly breached the firewall seeking information from the  FBI about an investigation into the President and his associates. Since  the press began to look hard at the ties between President Trump and  the Trump organization, his associates and Russia, the President has  not let up on his criticism. Just last week, the President threatened  by tweet as follows:         It is amazing how rude much of the media is to my very hard       working representatives. Be nice, you will do much better!    The job of the press is not to be nice. It is to gather the facts and  report them. Now that the President of the United States has called the  reputable U.S. news organizations fake news, others are doing the same.  Russia's Foreign Ministry spokesman recently accused a CNN reporter of  spreading ``fake news'' because the reporter asked about accusations  from U.S. officials that the Russian Ambassador is a spy.   This is a dangerous path. Putin has throttled an independent press in  the Russian Federation, imposing restriction after restriction on the  news media. Reporters have been harassed, threatened, and jailed. The  numbers of truly independent media organizations in Russia have been  reduced to a very few, and they have been replaced by state-owned,  state-run news media, like RT, formerly known as Russia Today, a  propaganda bullhorn for Putin, according to Secretary John Kerry.    The President admires Putin as a--and I will quote the President  here--``strong leader.'' Putin has used his strength to silence an  independent press. We do not want our press silenced.   Justice Brandeis, in a famous defense of free speech in a 1927 First  Amendment case, said: ``[T]hose who won our independence by revolution  were not cowards. They did not fear political liberty.''   Does President Trump fear political liberty?   The irony of the President's accusations of ``fake news'' is that he  himself has spread misinformation and fanned the flames of internet- driven lies, from questioning President Obama's citizenship, to his  frivolous claim that millions of people committed voter fraud and that  he really won the popular vote--that is the President's claim, that he  really won the popular vote--to President Trump's unsubstantiated  accusation that President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower.   We have entered into an era in U.S. politics never seen before in my  lifetime. We cannot allow this to be sanitized or explained away. The  phrase ``alternative facts'' has become a national joke because it  sounds like something from George Orwell's ``1984.''   It is not acceptable for a President to falsify, misrepresent, or  flatout lie. The President's party in Congress should not allow this.  They should not look the other way and continue to profess that the  emperor's clothes are grand.   Reacting to Mr. Trump's attacks on the press, President George W.  Bush responded:         I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy. We       need an independent media to hold people accountable. Power       can be very addictive and corrosive . . . and it's important       for the media to hold to account people who abuse their       power--whether it be here or elsewhere.    That was President George W. Bush's recent comment.   President Bush's prescription for democracy in 2017 is the same as  the drafters of the First Amendment in 1789: A free and independent and  robust media is essential to democracy, and any broad-based attack on  the press is an attack directly on our democracy.   There is one thing President Trump must understand: The press won't  go away. They won't stop reporting on the actions he takes and on the  decisions he makes. He can spend the next 4 years attacking the press,  but they will still be there--just as they were after Nixon resigned.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
