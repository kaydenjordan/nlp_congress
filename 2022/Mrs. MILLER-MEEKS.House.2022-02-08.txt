 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  previous question so that the House can immediately consider  Congresswoman Hinson's H.R. 6619, the Unmask Our Kids Act.   The Unmask Our Kids Act would restrict funds from going to any local  education agencies that don't offer an option for in-person instruction  at both elementary and secondary public schools. Further, the Unmask  Our Kids Act would allow parents to opt their child out of having to  wear a mask at school.   As the mother of two children, I understand how important it is for  all kids to be in school, learning among their peers. Unfortunately,  throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a political theater of  both masking policies and virtual learning, which has resulted in K-12  students paying the price through learning loss, which is at an even  higher rate among students who come from disadvantaged families.   Several studies have found that there are adverse effects on the  quality of  [[Page H1030]]  education due to the lack of time students spend with their peers,  especially for students who struggled with school before the pandemic.  Students need and deserve to have in-person instruction so that they  can receive the best education possible for their future.   As a physician and former director of public health, I recognize that  children are at low risk of severe illness with COVID and low risk of  transmission. A recent study found that grade-schoolers are at a lower  risk than vaccinated adults.   Wearing a mask at school can create both behavioral and physical  complications for students. A student wearing a pair of glasses may  have to keep defogging their lenses, or a student that has a facial tic  may have to keep correcting their fallen mask.   As we have seen across the Nation, mental health has been a big part  of this pandemic, and students are not immune to this impact. Not being  able to see other peers or your teacher's face can lead to only further  loneliness, anxiety, and depression, and the rate of suicide in  children as young as 9 has been staggering. Many young students are  also unable to learn because facial expressions are absent.   Just yesterday, New Jersey's Democratic Governor announced that,  beginning in March, the State will no longer require students and  school employees to wear masks. The Governor was quoted saying that:  ``This is not a declaration of victory as much as an acknowledgment  that we can responsibly live with this thing.'' Europe has had that  policy for almost a year.   Beginning this Friday, the Governor of Delaware, the President's home  State, will lift Delaware's universal indoor mask mandate, with a lift  on the school-based mask mandate beginning March 31.    Also yesterday, a medical analyst for CNN said that the decision to  wear a mask should shift from a government mandate to an individual  choice.   If a parent and student believe it is in the best interests of their  health and well-being to wear a mask, so be it. Let them make that  decision for themselves. We do not need elite, powerful people imposing  their will upon our most innocent and most powerless.   Remove the mask. Let students be back in school. And vote down the  previous question.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a  young man in my district.   On February 1, Andrew Spyrow of Bettendorf passed away after a nearly  4-year battle with brain cancer.   Andrew was a lifelong native of Bettendorf, graduating from Our Lady  of Lourdes and Assumption High School, where he developed many lifelong  friendships. He loved playing sports and running, participating in  several marathons across the country.   I first met Andrew in 2014 when he volunteered and worked at the RNC  victory office in Bettendorf.   Andrew was a devoted husband, son, and father. After his cancer  diagnosis, Andrew built a beautiful family. He married his best friend  and love of his life, Mary. They had two beautiful children, Audrey and  Oliver.   No matter what was happening in his life, Andrew always put the needs  of others first. Even when he was fighting cancer, he always made sure  to ask how others were doing, never complaining about his diagnosis.   Andrew's family, friends, and his RNC friends are in our prayers  during this difficult time.                            ____________________
