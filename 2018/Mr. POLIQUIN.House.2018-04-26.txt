 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, my fellow Mainers woke up to  heartbreaking news: Corporal Eugene Cole, a deputy at Somerset County  Sheriff's Office in Norridgewock, was shot and killed in the line of  duty. This horrific act was the first killing of a police officer in  Maine in almost 30 years.   Every day, Mr. Speaker, for 13 years, Eugene Cole put on his uniform  and his equipment and set out to protect our families in Maine. Mr.  Cole served central Maine with honor and integrity and a relentless  sense of duty.   Mr. Speaker, Maine is one of the safest places in the country to live  and work and raise your kids, and that is because of heroes like Eugene  Cole. I am so grateful for his work and his sacrifice.   On behalf of all of my fellow Mainers, Mr. Speaker, I send our  deepest sympathies to the family of Eugene Cole. I will be praying for  them during this very, very difficult time.                            ____________________
