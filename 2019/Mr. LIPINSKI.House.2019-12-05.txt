 Madam Speaker, robocalls, just mentioning them is  enough to make anyone's blood boil.   Robocalls interrupt our time with family and friends, scam people out  of their hard-earned money while spoofing numbers to make calls look  local, and even clog up the phone lines of hospital emergency rooms. In  2018, Americans, collectively, received 48 billion robocalls.   I cosponsored legislation earlier this year to stop robocalls, and  the House voted yesterday to pass the final version, which we expect to  be signed into law.   The TRACED Act strengthens penalties and extends the statute of  limitations on violations; it requires phone companies to authenticate  where calls are coming from and help customers easily block them at no  extra charge; and it requires continued work by the Federal Government  to combat emerging robocall methods.   This is a clear win for the American people and shows what we can do  here when we work together.                            ____________________
