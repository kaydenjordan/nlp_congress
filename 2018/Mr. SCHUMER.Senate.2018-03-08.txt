 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, later this afternoon President Trump  plans to announce sweeping steel and aluminum tariffs. Let me say once  again, I believe the President's instincts on China are correct. All  those who are trying to push him away from his instincts will allow  China over the next decade to become the dominant economic power and  greatly hurt American jobs and American prosperity as well. So I would  say: Mr. President, stick to your instincts.   But while the President's instincts are correct, the execution on  these tariffs is poor. That is the difference here--not the instinct,  not that we shouldn't go after China, and not that we have to do more  to bolster American wealth and American workers against rapacious  policies of China's. China will stop at nothing, nothing, nothing, to  steal our intellectual property and to manipulate its currency to  exclude American companies from being there.   China has been rapacious about trade, and I have spoken about this  problem for years. Early on--I think it was 2004 or 2005--Senator  Graham and I discovered that China was manipulating its currency. I  heard it from Crucible steel up in Syracuse, NY.   The great thinkers said: They don't manipulate their currency. This  is protectionist.   In the same week--I was quite proud of this--the New York Times  editorial board, which is liberal, and the Wall Street Journal  editorial board, which is conservative, both said: There is no such  thing as currency manipulation, and Schumer and Graham ought to back  off.   Of course, we proved to be right on that and other issues.   China is rapacious. If we don't stop China, America will be a weaker  place with fewer good-paying jobs, with less wealth, less strength, and  we probably won't stay the greatest country in the world--although we  deserve to because we play by the rules.   President Trump has identified the right opponent--China--much better  than both the Obama and Bush administrations did. Both Democrats and  Republicans have been blind to this issue, and Trump isn't. Good. But I  would say to the President: Don't swing blindly and wildly at our foe,  China. Establish a well-placed jab at China. Set them back. Let them  know we mean business.   President Trump ought to rethink his plan so it actually achieves  what he says he wants it to achieve.   U.S. steel and aluminum workers have been battling heavily subsidized  products from China for decades. I know. I have Nucor in my State, in  Auburn and in Chemung County. On aluminum, I have Alcoa in my State, in  Massena. Our steel and aluminum workers deserve a more level playing  field against these countries like China that heavily subsidize their  products or other countries that purchase Chinese steel at artificially  low prices and ship it to the United States. A targeted trade action  against China would be very helpful not only in providing relief for  the steel and aluminum workers in New York and around the country, but  it would send a strong shot across the bow to China for the first time  in decades: We mean business. We are not going to let you prey on us  any longer.   Targeted trade against China and against countries that allow China  to sell them steel at artificially low prices and then send it here, go  after them, but instead of getting right at China, the President's  across-the-board tariffs will cause more damage to key allies and other  domestic industries. I not only have steelworkers in Upstate New York,  I have a lot of autoworkers. For instance, we are so proud of the GM  plant in Tonawanda near Buffalo and the Ford stamping plant also in  Western New York. We are so proud of our agriculture.   Incidentally, the President is right, Canada has put in certain  restrictions on American dairy going to Canada that has hurt companies  like the Cayuga cooperative in Central New York and O-AT-KA in Genesee  County.   We have to protect and help our workers in auto manufacturing and our  farmers who do export and who do good things. China doesn't let our  auto products in, in a fair way, but other countries do--Canada does.   So the President's proposal does more harm to Europe and other allies  [[Page S1531]]  like Canada than it does to China. That is what is wrong with it. It is  so typical of this White House. Even when they have a good idea, they  mess it up because they don't think it through, and the President acts  only by his instincts. You have to act by your instincts and put a  thought process on top of it.   The goal of the President to go after China was not really achieved  very well in his proposal. The haphazard way these tariffs were put  together has caused policy to miss the mark. It seems no one is at home  in the White House right now. President Trump makes up his mind one  day, changes it the next, and meanwhile trade policies, foreign  policies, gun policies, immigration policies are all in chaos because  he says one thing one day and another thing the next. So we need the  President to follow his instincts but then allow the people who know  this issue to craft something smart.   The President and I may agree on trade. As I said, we are closer on  this issue than I have been with either the Bush or Obama  administrations, but the slapdash way these tariffs were constructed  have few of us cheering, even those of us who really have wanted to go  after China long before politics was a gleam in President Trump's eye.  Well, maybe that is not true; it may have been a gleam in his eye but  before he ran for anything.   I strongly urge the President to rethink these tariffs and focus his  policy more directly at China and countries that ship cheap Chinese  steel to the United States. On the flip side, I am sure some of our  business interests will tell the President do nothing on trade.   The chamber of commerce--they are interested in the bottom-line  profits of their big companies, and they don't care if they make those  profits at the expense of American workers. They are not a barometer  here, and President Trump is right to ignore them. We have to be smart  about this--not just tough, but tough and smart. We need to get tough  and smart on China, and the right approach is targeted action against  China's most flagrant abuses.                             Republican Tax Bill    Mr. President, on tax, since the Republican tax bill passed last  year, nearly every day there has been a new story about a corporation  choosing to pass along the savings from the tax law to wealthy  shareholders and corporate executives because they buy back their  stocks. They use this new tax money not to help their workers but to  buy back their stocks. In January, there was an initial flurry of all  these bonuses. They have been totally overwhelmed with stock buybacks.  What Democrats said is proving to be true. The vast majority of this  tax break is for the wealthy, by the wealthy, used by the wealthy to  help themselves, not help workers. That has been the history when you  give these corporations lots of money, when they have so much money  already, without pointing it in the direction of helping workers.   Yesterday, Chevron joined the parade of those with stock buybacks. It  was Chevron who announced that while it was making no changes to  workers' compensation or benefits, it would be restarting its dormant  stock repurchasing program. Do you know how much Chevron got from this  tax bill? Mr. President, $2 billion. Do you know how much they are  giving their workers--or benefits--out of that $2 billion? Nothing.  Nothing as of now. Do you know what they are using it for? Stock  buybacks. Let our Republican friends come to the floor and defend those  stock buybacks. Let them do that.   Today, another oil company, Hess, announced it would be purchasing  back $1 billion of its stock by the end of the year. Since the start of  2018, just in the last few months, the cumulative total of share  buybacks has passed $200 billion. Let me repeat that, $200 billion has  been used for stock buybacks. The month of February set the 1-month  record for share buybacks, and analysts at JPMorgan--hardly a liberal  think tank--says they ``expect total buybacks in 2018 to surpass $800  billion, way up from the $530 billion last year and demolishing 2007's  all-time high that came in a bit below $700 billion.'' That is not  Chuck Schumer or CPAC or any of these liberal think tanks, that is  JPMorgan Chase.   So our poor Republican friends had hoped this tax bill would send  them on a trajectory to win elections and, by February, the numbers are  starting to turn against them again. Look at the Quinnipiac poll of  yesterday. Why? Because, as this tax bill plays out, what Democrats  said all along; that the vast majority of the benefits are going to the  wealthy, it increases the deficit, and it increases the clarion call of  many on the Republican side to cut Medicare and Social Security to pay  for the deficit they created--it is not going over too well. We will  match our argument against theirs now in October and November. We are  confident we are going to win that argument, and that is why already  the enthusiasm about this tax bill is fading.   The massive deluge of corporate share buybacks is proving to be the  principal legacy of the Republican tax bill--not benefits to workers,  not bonuses, not wage increases, not even new equipment or investment  in R&D. I would welcome that. Nope, corporations are spending the bulk  of the savings from the tax bill on themselves, their corporate  executives, and their wealthy shareholders.   Guess how much of the capital companies have earned from the tax bill  has been allocated to their employees, the workers who were going to  get such huge benefits from this bill--6 percent. No, no, it is not 60;  it is 6. Sixty is the percentage that has gone back to corporations in  the form of stock buybacks--a 10-to-1 ratio. It doesn't make much  sense. The American public is beginning to realize that. Those are the  numbers according to Just Capital.   As I said, the American people are starting to catch wind of the  truth. Three separate polls yesterday--I mentioned Quinnipiac, and  there are evidently two others. Three separate polls show the  popularity of the Republican tax bill was significantly underwater and  has lost ground since the last round of polling. I predict those  numbers will continue to slip as more Americans learn that their hard- earned taxpayer dollars were used to give a tax break to corporations  who hoard the savings for themselves. It is no wonder their candidate  in a hard-fought race in Southwest Pennsylvania has abandoned the tax  argument. It is not going over well with his working-class constituents  because they get a tiny, little bit, and everyone else gets so much  more.   Mr. President, Democrats have a plan to rein in these buybacks and  put the middle class first. Yesterday, Senator Baldwin and I announced  an amendment to the pending banking bill that would rein in corporate  buybacks by giving the SEC the authority to reject buybacks that come  at the expense of workers. Who will object to that? I hope not my  colleagues. They say the buybacks will benefit workers, so they  shouldn't be objecting to our bill. Senator Baldwin's bill and my bill  would require company boards and their executives to put their money  where their mouth is and certify that the buyback is in the best long- term financial interest of the company.   We are going to make this one of the top amendments to the banking  bill, and I hope it gains Republican support. If Republicans mean what  they say about their tax bill helping workers, they should join Senator  Baldwin's amendment. The glut of corporate share buybacks highlights  precisely how the corporate tax cut in the Republican bill is being put  to ill use. Rather than stimulating the economy, creating jobs, or  raising pay, corporations are spending the lion's share of the tax  savings on goosing their stock.   Let's not forget, these buybacks are relatively new. A ruling by the  SEC in the early eighties said they could start doing these. Before  that, the heyday, when corporate America dominated the world, profits  were great, jobs were growing, and wages went up, the safe harbor  provision wasn't there. Corporations had to go through a lot of proof  before they could buy back their stock, and that made sense, but once  our Republican colleagues got in power, they did what the corporate  leaders want them to do and look what happened.   The amendment to say no buybacks unless they can prove it is really  going to benefit their workers and be in the long-term financial  interest of their company, that amendment is going to be one of the top  amendments to the upcoming bill. I hope it gains Republican support. I  really do. If Republicans mean what they say, they should  [[Page S1532]]  join Baldwin's amendment, as I said before, but I want to repeat it for  the benefit of all my good Republican friends.   Now, the glut of corporate share buybacks highlights precisely how  the corporate tax cut in the Republican bill is being put to ill use.  Rather than stimulating the economy, creating jobs, raising pay,  corporations spend the lion's share of the tax savings on goosing their  stock. Americans are just scratching their heads, wondering why we put  ourselves in deeper debt so corporations could further enrich  themselves. Why do we tell our children and grandchildren they are  going to pay for the pay raise of the CEO of Exxon or the increase in  value because his stock is going up? That doesn't make any sense at  all. There are much better uses for the money.   Yesterday, Democrats announced our plan to help build a trillion  dollars of desperately needed infrastructure in America. How do we pay  for it? We unwind some of these tax cuts for the biggest corporations  to pay for a massive infusion of Federal funds in infrastructure--job- creating infrastructure, which is desperately needed. Just by putting  the top rate on individuals where it was, reinstituting the AMT and the  estate tax, which goes only to the very wealthy, and setting the  corporate rate at 25 percent--you may recall it was the Business  Roundtable that asked for 25 percent. Oh, no, for our Republican  colleagues and Donald Trump, that wasn't good enough. Make it lower-- even though the 200 biggest businesses in America said 25 percent was  certainly an adequate drop. Many on my side wouldn't even think that is  good.   In any case, the BMT asked for 25 percent. We go to 25 percent, along  with these other changes, and guess what we do with $1 trillion. We  create infrastructure jobs--millions. We create new roads and bridges,  new water and sewer. We say that every rural home in America should get  broadband just as Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s said every rural  home should get electricity. We update our power grid so all this new  energy coming from other places can go to the most populated centers.  It would be a huge shot in the arm for jobs in America, for prosperity  in America, far more than this slanted tax bill aimed so much at the  few wealthy who are so tight with this new Republican Party.   I daresay our proposal is a much more effective use of taxpayer  dollars than a handout to the biggest corporations and will create far  more good-paying jobs in the process.   I hope our Republican colleagues will rethink things. Their path is a  path to a cul-de-sac, to great losses in the election. Rethink that tax  cut. Don't allow these buybacks. They are doing no good for anyone but  a handful, and that is where 60 percent of the money is going on the  corporate rate.   Join us in taking some of that money to do what the Federal  Government has done since Henry Clay proposed it in the 1820s: Put that  money into infrastructure, jobs, good-paying jobs, efficiency. Let's  not let China or another country become the leader in infrastructure.  They invest. The Chinese Government, the Japanese Government, the  European Government invest in infrastructure, and so did this  government, until Donald Trump became President and the hard right  gained a stranglehold over the Republican Party. Let's reverse course  before it is too late.    I yield the floor.
