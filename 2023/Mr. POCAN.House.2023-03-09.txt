 Madam Speaker, you have probably heard the Republican  majority tell you they are laser focused on reducing costs for the  average American by lowering inflation. You have likely heard about  their alleged quest for a smaller, less-intrusive government. Yup, I  have heard them, too.   Well, this week in Congress clearly shows they didn't mean any of  that. In fact, quite the opposite.   Just yesterday, Republicans showed their real priorities--partisan  ultra-MAGA political priorities--by considering a trans and intersex  sports ban as their opening salvo in their efforts to undermine the  rights of LGBTQ+ people.   Here are the facts. Young people participate in sports to be part of  a team, learn sportsmanship, and challenge themselves. It is about  friendships and learning to work together as a team. The GOP sports ban  seeks to strip trans girls of all ages of these opportunities.   Look, there are real, pressing problems impacting women's and girls'  sports, including sexual harassment and assault, lack of equal  resources, and pay inequality. These are real issues that the GOP  majority is ignoring.   There are pressing problems facing kids of our Nation, including  nearly 50,000 gun deaths a year, including more than 4,700 that involve  kids; but not a peep from the Republicans in Congress about something  that is actually killing children.   Rather than addressing any of these issues, anti-equality politicians  on the Committee on Education and the Workforce spent their first  legislative markup this session targeting the few trans girls and women  who participate in school sports.   When it comes to protecting women's sports, we should look to leading  women's sports and gender justice organizations like the Women's Sports  Foundation and the National Women's Law  [[Page H1214]]  Center. Both organizations, as well as leading women athletes, support  transgender inclusion in sports.   Major athletic bodies such as the International Olympic Committee and  NCAA have guidelines for the participation of transgender athletes, and  these bodies reject the type of systematic exclusion of transgender  people from sports that anti-LGBTQ+ politicians are pushing.   This isn't about a real problem in this Nation. This is part of a  larger coordinated attack against transgender people and the larger  LGBTQ+ population. We have seen hundreds of anti-equality bills, many  specifically targeting transgender people introduced in States across  the country this year.   Unfortunately, this is about building the personal brand of some  extreme rightwing politicians, people who fundraise from and appeal to  a small subset of their political base, rather than about a real  problem in this country.   These bullying politicians will endanger the lives of trans kids for  their own political purposes, seemingly with the support of GOP  leadership.   I guess we shouldn't be surprised. Not one Republican in leadership  called out the comments last week by a conservative speaker at the CPAC  conference who called for the eradication of transgender people.   This isn't about sports. This is about attacking trans and LGBTQ+  kids and the extreme MAGA politics of that issue, not the substance of  just letting kids play. That is heartless and cruel.   We will fight these attacks hard. We will call out this dangerous  demagoguery, and we will make sure the public sees it for what it is-- raw, swampy politics, as usual, of the worst kind.   There will be few pages assigned to future chapters of ``Profiles in  Courage'' for the politicians that bully kids for their own gain. This  week, that is exactly what we saw from the majority party in Congress,  and we will expose this opportunistic bullying.                            ____________________
