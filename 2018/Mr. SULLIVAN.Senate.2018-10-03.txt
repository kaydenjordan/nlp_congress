 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Senate is debating right now,  obviously, a really important issue. It is the confirmation of Judge  Kavanaugh. It is a very serious and important debate. It is a  contentious debate. There are a lot of emotions out there, and it is  going to continue to be that way, but I want to talk about something  that is not actually related to that. In some ways, it is actually  related to something very different.   I heard in the news this morning--actually, I hear this in the news  all the time. I say to our friends in the media, this speech that I am  going to give has a little bit about something I want you to focus on  and to try a little harder in certain ways to report. There is a  conventional wisdom out there that the Senate is the most contentious  it has ever been--that there is hyperpartisanship, that nobody talks to  each other, and that nobody likes each other. I have heard people talk  about 1850, the Civil War, and that nothing gets done.   Now, I am not a media basher. I walk out, and I do my interviews. I  am very open. Back home in the great State of Alaska, I am open to the  media all the time. I am respectful. I don't see the media as the enemy  of the people or anything like that. They certainly have their biases,  but I will say that I believe, to some degree, this narrative of ``hey,  this place is so partisan; I haven't seen this since the 1850s; nothing  gets done here'' is driven by the media.   Conflict sells. We know that. Senators fighting and bashing each  other is kind of interesting to sell newspapers or to have a place on  social media, but bipartisan, hard work--the good work for the Nation-- let's just admit, can be a bit boring. It can be a bit boring.   People say: Wow, these guys are working together. These men and women  are working together.   That is a little boring in the media space. So it doesn't get written  about nationally and, certainly, a lot of times, locally in some of our  home States. I think this is a shame. I think it is a shame.   Of course, the media can write about the contentious issues. We are  seeing a really important one right now, and it deserves a lot of print  and a lot of press. It is getting it. That is for sure. It is a shame  because this can be a bit dispiriting, not only for the Members of this  body but much more importantly for the people we represent, for the  Alaskans I represent.   They see this when they read the newspaper, and they think: Jeez, is  this the only thing going on there?   So tonight what I want to do is something that is a bit of a shocker  to some watching back home, and we still have people in the Galleries.  It is going to be a bit of a shocker, and I am almost sure no one is  going to write about it or do a story about it, but, nonetheless, the  Alaskans I represent and the American people whom we all represent need  to hear about it.   In the past few weeks--heck, in the past few hours--this body right  here, the U.S. Senate, has gotten some important, bipartisan work done  for America. You might not read about it back home, but that doesn't  mean it didn't happen.   Some of these bills are big, important bills. Some of them are  smaller, maybe less important bills, but they  [[Page S6489]]  all have something in common: hard work, good work, serious work, and  bipartisan--actually, very bipartisan--work that will help America to  address challenges and take advantage of opportunities. Yes, it is  being done right here, today, and in the last 2, 3, or 4 weeks.   What might some of these accomplishments be just in the past few  weeks? Maybe our friends in the media will write about it. I hope they  do. Let's get started. Let's get started and talk about some of these.   Mr. President, as you know, we just had a bill that overwhelmingly  passed the Senate dealing with the opioid crisis. This is going to the  President's desk, and he is going to sign this. This is a huge issue  for all of us. It is a really important issue in my State, the great  State of Alaska.   The numbers are staggering--staggering. There are 72,000 Americans-- rich, poor, Black, White, Native, non-Native, young, old, but,  actually, mostly young--who have died of drug overdoses last year. This  is hard to comprehend. In my view, this body is finally waking up to  this challenge.   I am not going to go through each one of these bills, but there is  going to be significant funding--billions of dollars--in this bill we  just passed. This bill has the STOP Act, which is the bill of my good  friend from Ohio, Senator Portman. He has been such a leader on this. I  was an early cosponsor of the bill. The bill focuses on stopping the  killer drug fentanyl, which is coming from China and Mexico and killing  all of our people. That is the STOP Act.   This bill has a provision that I authored that gets 5 percent of the  funding to Native health organizations. Some of the Native  organizations in the lower 48 and in Alaska have really strong and far- reaching access to some of our rural citizens. So these organizations  are going to see a lot more funding.   There is a hugely important amount of good policy. We are not going  to get there and we are not going to fix this opioid-heroin addiction  problem for years, but at least we are focused on it. It is good  legislation, and it was very bipartisan legislation that just passed  the Senate and is going to go to the President's desk for his  signature. That happened today. That is newsworthy.   If you are going through recovery, like so many good people I know in  Alaska are, this is encouraging news. Hopefully, someone is going to  write about it. This is encouraging news.   OK, what else happened today? The FAA reauthorization happened. Some  people will say: Well, that sounds like a yawner. But this is basic  infrastructure. This is basic aviation security infrastructure and  improvements in weather reporting systems. For my State, the great  State of Alaska, this bill is enormously important--enormously  important.   I am not going to read all of the provisions in there that are going  to benefit Alaska, such as essential air service, like more funding for  airport infrastructure, and improvement programs such as streamlining  permitting, so you can actually build airport infrastructure. This is a  bill that is going to really help the whole country.   Again, we are starting to get work done. From 2008 to 2012, there  were 23 extensions of the FAA bill, or the Federal Aviation  Administration Reauthorization Act--23 extensions. What does that mean?  Well, essentially, it means the Senate wasn't doing its job.   This is a 5-year extension. People back home in Alaska and other  places can now plan for 5 years on infrastructure for airports. There  are no more of these extensions. There were 23 in 5 years. That is the  Senate not doing its job. We did that today.   For some people, this is a really big deal. I hope the media will  report on it. I am not holding my breath. What about this very  bipartisan legislation and a lot of hard, important work to keep  America at the cutting edge of drum technology and of aviation  technology?   We are the home and the most innovative place in the world for  aviation and aircraft. This will help us to stay that way. That  happened today also. That is going to go to the President's desk for  his signature. It is a bipartisan bill, important for the country.    Related to that--and I know the Presiding Officer has been a leader  on this issue on our budget and appropriations process--with the  enactment of the Department of Defense appropriations bill, this Senate  has had more spending bills enacted on time since at any time since  1997--20 years. I know a lot of people are like: Well, that is really  boring. And isn't that what you are supposed to do, pass appropriations  bills and get them to the President's desk so you don't have these  giant omnibuses? That is Washington speak for a bill that is $1.5  trillion, 2,400 pages that nobody reads because nobody knows what is in  it. I don't vote for those, by the way. That system was broken. A lot  of us ran on that in 2014 because the system was so broken. So we are  going to start to work on it, and we are doing it--success.   We have a long way to go, and, again, you are watching, and the  American people are saying: Well, big deal, you are funding the  government the way you are supposed to. They have a really good point,  but we hadn't been doing that for almost two decades, and we are  starting to do it in a serious way. By the way, it has to be bipartisan  here in the Senate because we need 60 votes for these appropriations  bills to pass.   So the Appropriations Committee has passed out every bill, as I  mentioned, at a pace that we haven't seen since 1998. Almost 90 percent  of the discretionary spending that runs our Federal Government is done  through the regular order--the process by which most Americans think we  should be doing things, but we haven't been. We are starting to do it  now. Bipartisan, important, get our budgeting process back in order--we  are doing that. That is good news. You are probably not going to hear  about it in the media, but that is good news.   Let me tell you about another one that is related that we did about 5  weeks ago--a little bit further back--the National Defense  Authorization Act, the NDAA. I sit on the Armed Services Committee with  the Presiding Officer. This is a really important bill. The President  signed it about a month ago. It rebuilds our military, which the vast  majority of Americans--certainly the vast majority of Alaskans-- support.   People forget that from 2010 to 2016, the budget of the Department of  Defense was cut by almost 25 percent. Despite serious national security  challenges all over the world, we were cutting defense spending  dramatically. Readiness plummeted.   This bill the President just signed significantly rebuilds our  military and implements the national defense strategy of the Pentagon,  written by Secretary Mattis. That is a whole new strategy for America.  Yes, we still have the threat from al-Qaida and international terrorism  from 9/11, but this strategy starts to focus on our big challenges,  such as the rise of great power rivalries like China and Russia. We  need to focus on them primarily, and that is what we are doing.   Guess how many Senators voted for that--a hugely important piece of  legislation. Eighty-five. It was very bipartisan--one of the most  important things this body does. I check most major newspapers; they  didn't even write about it when the President signed it. That is really  important. It is bipartisan, rebuilding the military, new strategy, so  that is good news. In my State, that is really good news. The vast  majority of Alaskans love our military, support our military. We have a  lot of military bases. They think this is great news.   So I hope our friends in the media will write about that. I know it  is about 4 weeks late, but I didn't see any articles on it. That is  important.   Let me give a few other examples. They are not like the NDAA--huge in  terms of their importance or the size of the bill--but they are  important. They are bills that I authored, so I like to highlight  those; when you get a bill that you work on with your colleagues here  on both sides of the aisle, you pass it, you get it over to the  President, and he signs it.   This week, the bill Senator Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island,  and I have been working on for, gosh, almost 2 years--the Save Our Seas  bill is all about addressing the challenge that we have not only in  America but globally, with ocean debris, ocean pollution, ocean  plastics littering our oceans, hurting our wonderful, sustainable  fisheries, potentially posing health risks to humans. That bill  [[Page S6490]]  passed this week. It is going to be signed by the President, hopefully  this week or next week.   I want to thank Senator Whitehouse and Senator Booker. It is a very  bipartisan bill. It passed here, passed the House--a really important  issue.   By the way, the Trump administration is doing a good job on this  issue. Even the U.S.-Mexico-Canada NAFTA agreement has a provision, and  we are pressing for that, on this ocean debris problem. This bill  is going to do a lot to help with this challenge. It passed. A  bipartisan group of Senators strongly supported that. It passed this  week and is being signed into law here soon by the President. That is  good news.    I am pretty sure no one wrote about it, but if you look at global  challenges for the environment--the ocean pollution, plastics, ocean  debris challenge is a big one.   Again, I want to thank Senator Whitehouse, in particular--great  leadership on this issue. We are taking important strides on this. He  and I are already working on SOS 2.0, and I guarantee that is going to  pass.   That is a bipartisan achievement, protecting our oceans, getting the  world to clean up plastics, ocean debris. That is not bad for 1 week in  the Senate, right? Hopefully someone will write about that. It was very  bipartisan, that is for sure.   Another one that was signed into law 3 weeks ago is a bill that is  really important to me, and it is one of the first bills I introduced  as a Senator when I came here 3\1/2\ years ago, called the Pro bono  Work to Empower and Represent Act--the POWER Act. That is what it is  called, the POWER Act.   This is a bill that I worked on very closely with Senator Heitkamp, a  Democrat from North Dakota. She and I worked on this bill for over 2  years. It passed the Senate and finally passed the House and came back,  had a couple more elements to it. We got it passed again, and the  President signed it 3 weeks ago.   What does the POWER Act do? Well, we all know America has big  challenges with regard to sexual assault and domestic violence. My  State has huge problems with this horrible, horrendous issue. The POWER  Act, through getting lawyers to step up and help victims and survivors  of domestic violence, is going to provide more legal resources and  services to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. That is a  pretty important topic, a pretty important issue for America.   Think about this: If you are an accuser--if you are someone who is a  perpetrator of one of these horrendous crimes, a sexual assault crime-- you get a Sixth Amendment right to counsel. That is under the  Constitution. If you are the victim, you get nothing--nothing. Well,  our bill, which is now the law of the land, is going to help change  that. We envision an army of lawyers all over the country helping these  survivors. So that passed. It is bipartisan. It passed 3 weeks ago. It  is an important issue, certainly, for Alaska but also for the country.  We all know that we can do much better in this area, so that is going  to help. I think it is going to help thousands of survivors personally  as we work to implement it. That is good news. It is bipartisan.   What else? NAFTA. This isn't in the Senate yet, but it will be coming  our way. The President and his team announced that they have reached  agreement with Mexico and Canada on an updated NAFTA agreement. I think  most Americans think that is very important. We will see if it is  bipartisan. I certainly have been one who has been encouraging the  President and his team. I am working hard on making sure we get there  and address some of our other economic challenges and trade challenges.  But that was announced a couple of days ago. That is good news.   We have to get to the details of it. We will debate it here on the  Senate floor. It is important for the country, for our allies, for the  American worker and American families. That is positive.   Then, related to NAFTA, of course, is bipartisan good news that  should make every American smile; that is, finally we are once again  unleashing the might of the U.S. economy--something I know the  Presiding Officer cares a lot about, and certainly it is a bipartisan  issue. We would rather have 4.2 percent GDP growth like we had last  quarter than 1.5 GDP growth, which was the average over the last 10  years. There is a debate here--it is a healthy debate--on what is  causing this robust economic growth. I think it is tax reform and  regulatory reform and unleashing the promise and power of American  energy. So there is a debate here, but there is no debate on the fact  that everybody in this body, I hope, thinks that 4.2 percent GDP  growth, thinks having the lowest unemployment rate in almost 50 years,  thinks having wages finally start to go up after being stagnant for 20  is good news. It is good news, and everybody here should have  bipartisan agreement on that. We will debate how we sustain it, how we  keep it going, but nobody debates that it is bipartisan good news.   So I am just going to ask my friends in the media--it is not 1850;  sorry, I know conflict sells. We are not on the verge of civil war. We  don't all hate each other; we actually like each other. We work  together. I certainly respect my colleagues here. Yes, we have our  tough debates; we are having one right now. But for my friends in the  media, it is OK to report on bipartisan successes. I just gave examples  of a number of bipartisan initiatives that occurred over the last 4 to  5 weeks that are actually really good for the American people. They are  good for the people I represent back in Alaska.   But even if you are not going to read about this or see it on TV, for  anyone watching, for the people in the gallery, for my constituents  back home, there is a lot going on here that is bipartisan, that is  significant, that helps us address challenges like opioids, helps us  take advantage of industries like the aviation industry which, for  Alaska, is so important. So keep the faith.   Again, to my friends in the media, it is OK to report on bipartisan  successes. The American people care about them. You might not care  about them, but the American people do. So let's work together and try  to make sure everybody is understanding that there is some important  work being done here, and a lot of it is going to help the people we  represent.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  engage in its routine legislative wrapup as in morning business during  today's session of the Senate.    Mr. President, I would like to honor the memory  of Wister ``Pug'' Edwin Williams--a patriot, an Alaskan pioneer, a  loving husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and a role  model to so many. Pug passed away on September 25, 2018, at the age of  92 in Anchorage, AK.   A member of the Greatest Generation, Pug was born on October 28,  1925, in Baltimore, MD, and grew up in Daytona Beach, FL. He enlisted  in the Army Air Force when he was 17 years old and served in the World  War II Pacific Theatre in New Guinea and the Philippines. He was  awarded a Purple Heart.   After recovering from his injuries, in 1946--13 years before Alaska  became a State--he headed to Alaska and got to work building a State  that he loved. He worked for the Alaska Railroad until he could get on  with the Federal Road Commission, building the then nonexistent  highways Alaskans drive on today.   After the road commission, he field-apprenticed into becoming an  engineer with the Corps of Engineers, again instrumental in building  Alaska's infrastructure where none had existed. He worked at the Corps  of Engineers for 25 years, including during the disaster recovery of  the 1964 earthquake. At the time of his retirement, he was chief  executive assistant at the Corps of Engineers, the highest civilian  position at the Corps.   Pug met his wife Yvonne O'Brien early on in his life in Alaska. They  enjoyed 42 years of marriage until her death. Together, they had 8  children, 22 grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren. They were the  love of each other's lives, and that love is reflected in the values  passed on to multiple generations of Alaskans.   Pug was in awe of Alaska and worked all across the State, including  in rural Alaska. His door was always open to rural Alaskans who did not  have a place to stay when they came to Anchorage.   He loved to hunt and fish, a passion he passed down to his children  and grandchildren. Pug also loved listening to the opera, playing  piano, and listening to people's stories. He was funny, kind, and  generous, particularly to those in need. His faith in God never  wavered.   Pug lived a good, long life. He helped build and shape the character  of our great State, and he served our country valiantly. For this, we  celebrate his life, honor his memory, and will keep his family in our  thoughts and prayers.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs be discharged  from further consideration of H.R. 3359 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.
