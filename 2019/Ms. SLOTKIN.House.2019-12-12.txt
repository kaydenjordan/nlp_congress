 Mr. Chair, for the last 2 years, the single most common  issue that Michiganders raise with me is the price of prescription  drugs. Michiganders, regardless of party, are demanding that Congress  do something about it. People literally clutch my arm at the grocery  store to tell me how their son is rationing his insulin or their  daughter couldn't go to summer camp because she couldn't afford the  inhalers.   That is why shortly after being sworn in in January, I started  working in earnest on the issue. I am very proud to stand behind my  colleagues and support H.R. 3, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act. This  important legislation will drive down the cost of the country's most  expensive drugs by allowing our government to negotiate for the very  best prices.   To be clear, the VA does the exact same thing. I am on military  insurance, and the VA can negotiate for drug prices. Why not allow  Medicare to do the very same thing?   To put this in perspective, there are over 800,000 Michiganders  living with diabetes, and common insulin medications can cost somewhere  between $1,200 and $20,000 a year. This includes Sarah, a woman who  lives in Holly, Michigan, where I live, who literally says she is being  priced out of her life. Her insulin costs are higher than her rent per  month.   This bill, if passed, would allow the government to negotiate,  bringing the price down to as little as $400 a year. Once the price is  negotiated, all Americans, including Medicare recipients, benefit from  that price. The bill would also improve Medicare coverage for seniors  and lower their out-of-pocket costs.    Two months ago, I cointroduced a bill that included vision coverage  in Medicare. That means Medicare recipients, once every 2 years, will  get an eye exam and one set of either glasses or contacts.   I am very pleased that this was incorporated into this bigger bill  along with other measures that would include hearing coverage and  dental coverage for the first time. So, finally, preventive care will  be part of the routine coverage for Medicare.   To be clear, the bill pays for itself. Negotiation saves us,  according to the CBO, $450 billion, which covers the additions to  Medicare and still gives $10 billion for research and development to  the National Institutes of Health.   Mr. Chairman, you will hear my colleagues and Big Pharma say that you  have to make a choice between research and lifesaving cures and the  price of prescription drugs. That is a false choice, and anyone who  watches TV and sees those annoying ads knows that the drug companies  have plenty of places to cut their funding.                                time  1015    Members from both parties in the House and Senate, and indeed the  President, have said the right things when it comes to lowering drug  prices. Now it is time to walk the walk.
