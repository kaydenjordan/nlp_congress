 Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Kamlager-Dove).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                  Amendment No. 145 Offered by Mr. Grijalva     Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Jackson).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I listened to the gentlewoman from Georgia,  and to me, this amendment is unbelievable. I mean, she says that you  can't draw down or sell petroleum products under this amendment for  political and nonemergency purposes.   Well, I mean, everything around here is political, so I don't know  how you would define that.   What the President has been doing is using this Strategic Petroleum  Reserve to help bring down the price of gasoline at the pump, or in  other cases, to increase supply because of the supply shortage due to  Russia's action in the invasion of Ukraine.   These are, in my opinion, totally legitimate emergency purposes to  help the American people and help the supply chain.   What the bill does is to say: Well, if you want to do that--if you  want to use the reserve--then you have to drill for more oil on public  lands.   Well, isn't that political.   A decision is made to say that you can't use the reserve unless you  help the oil companies and let the oil companies take more of our  public lands. That is about the most political thing that I can think  of.   In addition to that, was it not political when the Republican  administrations in the past released and sold oil from the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve?   What did they do it for.   Well, they did it for deficit reduction. They did it to pay for  different items, like the 21st Century Cures bill that came out of the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Were those emergencies?   Were those not political?   I would argue that using the reserve for those purposes was not an  emergency at all and certainly was incredibly political.   This is just another example of what the Republicans are doing. They  are politicizing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because they want to  make message points.   They know that this bill isn't going anywhere. The President already  said that he will veto it, and the Senate won't take it up. They are  being so political. They are talking about situations that have nothing  to do with an emergency.   I really don't know what to say. The whole process here is very  political, oriented toward messaging, oriented toward going on TV, I  guess, to appeal to base voters. It is just incredible to me that this  amendment is being offered.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I insist on my point of order.    The pending amendment violates the germaneness  requirement of rule XVI, clause 7. That rule precludes amendments ``on  a subject different from that under consideration.''   The subject matter of the underlying bill is a requirement that the  Department of Energy issue a plan related to the leasing of Federal  lands for oil and gas drilling before certain first drawdowns from the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   However, the subject matter of the pending amendment is different.  The pending amendment introduces a new subject matter to the bill by  requiring a plan for drawdowns that have already occurred. Because the  pending amendment is on a different subject than that of the underlying  bill, I urge the Chair to hold this amendment as not germane.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, first of all, I think the gentlewoman's  previous amendment was about the policies of the President being  political. And I think this amendment is more political than anything.   First of all, as we know, what the underlying bill does is it says  that if the President wants to release crude oil from the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve, then he has to put together a plan that would  require more leases on public lands.   What the gentlewoman's amendment says now is that she makes this  retroactive and goes back to the day of the President's inauguration-- again, a very political decision to use that date--and says that any  releases from the reserve beginning on the day of the President's  inauguration, we would also then have to go back and make sure that we  sell or lease additional leases on public lands to cover those releases  from the reserve back to the inauguration.   So, the bureaucracy of all this in itself I think is absurd.   But the point is that she is essentially saying that now we have to  lease more public lands when, in fact, there are about 9,000 leases  already on public lands, half of which are not being used. The oil  companies do not want to pump more oil because that brings down the  price. They don't want any releases from the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve because that brings down the price.   So all that the Republican majority is doing here is trying to help  the oil companies, trying to make sure that there are no tools on the  part of the administration to increase the supply, to bring down the  cost of gasoline at the pump. Whatever the oil companies, which are  making huge profits, want to do, that is what they want to do, as well.   So I would just again say that this amendment may be germane but it  is certainly detrimental to what the President and the Democrats are  trying to do to help people deal with affordability.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment which would  add the text of my Buy Low and Sell High Act, which I reintroduced last  week along with my colleagues, Representatives Craig, Crow, Kuster,  Spanberger, and Trone.   Mr. Chairman, we heard quite a bit earlier today, as well as  yesterday, on how problematic the underlying bill before us is, how it  does not represent a serious attempt to tackle the challenges and  opportunities that come with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to make  sure it can be put to work for all Americans while helping fuel  transition to a 21st century clean energy economy.   Now, unlike my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, even when  Democrats are in the minority, we do not become a Party of No. We stand  ready to work on ideas that will seriously improve this country and to  propose our substantive ideas to improve bills brought before the  House, and that is what I am doing today with this amendment.   The Buy Low and Sell High Act is a serious bill that takes the  Strategic Petroleum Reserve seriously. It doesn't use it as a political  football, but instead, regards it as a valuable tool to our arsenal of  energy security.   The amendment would create an economic petroleum reserve within this  reserve that would be specifically to sell crude oil when prices are  high and buy crude oil when prices are low. Some of the profits for  that would then be reinvested into the American economy, accelerating  the electrification revolution that everyone from President Biden to  the CEO of every automaker can tell us is happening, not in the future,  but right now.   It would also create a network of regional product reserves, so we  have a full national network of crude and petroleum products.   The Colonial pipeline hack nearly 2 years ago was illustrative of the  need for regional product reserves. Crude by itself doesn't do us any  good without refining capacity and the infrastructure to take it across  the country. Regional product reserves can fight local shortages  immediately.   My amendment also includes Ms. Houlahan's important bill, which goes  further than our Republican Chamber did 2 weeks ago, in preventing  barrels from our strategic reserves from going not just to China, but  also not going to Russia, Iran, and North Korea.   Unlike our colleagues, Mr. Chairman, Democrats are not soft on  Russia. We are not soft on Iran. We are not soft on North Korea.   Finally, the bill would build on the work in the fiscal year 2023  omnibus bill that this Chamber passed last month to give the Department  of Energy further flexibility with congressionally mandated sales from  the reserve and required the Department of Energy time those sales to  maximize revenue back to the American taxpayer.   Now, these are all commonsense ideas. They should be bipartisan  ideas. They are certainly more serious than the bill before us today.   Unfortunately, it seems that Republicans aren't willing to engage in  a serious endeavor like this. They are not willing to hear our  dissenting views on this.   In any case, I would ask this amendment be adopted so we can take a  serious look at what needs to be done to address the energy crisis.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                Point of Order     Mr. Chair, the amendment meets the germaneness  requirement of clause 7 of rule XVI.   The amendment is germane because the amendment does not introduce a  new subject of the text proposed to be amended.   The subject of the introduced bill is applying certain requirements  to drawdowns from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The subject of the  amendment also applies certain requirements to drawdowns.   Again, Mr. Chairman, I have to stress that the reason that this  amendment is germane is because we are trying on the Democratic side to  seriously address the energy crisis and the energy future of this  country.   The Republicans are not doing that. They are simply using political  points and trying to prevent the use of the reserve to actually help  reduce the cost of gasoline at the pump.    Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I know we are closing the debate now on the  underlying bill, but I will say one more time, we have been at this 2  days now. We have had a lot of amendments. I certainly appreciate the  fact that we have had an open rule and that Members on our side of the  aisle have had an opportunity to present amendments and speak. A lot of  our new Members have had that opportunity.   The bottom line, Mr. Chairman, is that this underlying bill makes no  sense, and it is strictly a political message. It is going nowhere. The  President has already said that he would veto it, and the Senate won't  take it up.   The bottom line is that as Democrats what we are trying to do is  address affordability issues for the American public in the context of  gasoline prices. We knew as prices went up that we should use every  tool in our arsenal to try to bring them down. That is what  [[Page H448]]  President Biden did. He decided to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  to provide more supply and bring down prices. It succeeded in doing  that. His actions did that. From the price in June at a high, it went  down about $1.69 per gallon.   Why would the Republicans want to deny the President--not just  President Biden, but any President--that opportunity?   We are just trying to address the concerns that the American people  have.   We did it on drug prices by saying we are going to negotiate drug  prices.   We did it on insulin by saying we wanted to cap it at $35 a month.   Democrats are constantly trying to address these affordability  issues, many of which resulted from the COVID crisis.   The bottom line is, I don't understand why the Republicans would  suggest that the President not be able to do that.   They talk over and over again about how it is necessary to lease more  public lands at a time when over half the leases that are out there are  already not being used by the oil companies because the oil companies  don't want more oil. They don't want more supply. They want to keep the  price down. If there is more supply and more pumping of oil  domestically or internationally, they lose those huge profits that they  have made in the last few years.   Please, don't hamstring this administration. Let us use the reserve  in part to try to bring prices down and let the President continue to  have that option.   Mr. Chair, I would urge opposition to H.R. 21, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no.''   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
