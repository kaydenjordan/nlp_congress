 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a  colloquy with my friend and colleague, the distinguished chairman of  the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Isakson.    Mr. President, I would like to confirm my  understanding that the term Indian Health Service as it appears in  section 101 of the MISSION Act of 2018 includes Tribal health providers  that are funded by the Indian Health Service and step into the shoes of  the Indian Health Service pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination and  Education Assistance Act to provide healthcare.
