 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, late last night, due to the hard work and  diligence of the staffs of the Appropriations Committees on both sides  of the aisle in both Houses, the staff of the leadership, and so many  others, we were able to come to a bipartisan agreement on a bill to  fund the government through September. Most importantly, this agreement  takes the threat of a government shutdown off the table. It is also a  good agreement for the American people.   The bill ensures taxpayer dollars are not used to fund an ineffective  border wall; it excludes over 160 poison pill riders; and it increases  investments in programs that the middle class relies on, like  education, infrastructure, and medical research.   It includes a permanent extension for health benefits for miners.  Here, I want to praise--and I can't give enough praise--to the Senator  from West Virginia, Joe Manchin, who was relentless even after  disappointment after disappointment, at holding the Senate's feet to  the fire and making sure this was done. Many miners can rest easy  tonight--people who have worked so hard all their lives and had so much  disappointment--because of Joe Manchin's work and what we put into the  bill.   There is also funding to shore up Puerto Rico's Medicaid Program, and  $2 billion to help States like California, West Virginia, Louisiana,  and North Carolina recover from recent natural disasters.   The bill also includes a significant increase in NIH funding, which  deals with cancer research and the Cancer Moonshot that both President  Obama and Vice President Biden pushed for and continues onward, and a  restoration of year-round Pell grants that will benefit about 1 million  students. College is often the ladder up for a lot of students, and  this will help them stay on that ladder.   And the bill includes significantly increased funding for  infrastructure, as well as funding to combat the scourge of opioid  abuse which affects all parts  [[Page S2647]]  of the country--urban areas, suburban areas, rural areas. It affects  the poor, the middle class, and the rich.   Good news: It protects 99 percent of the Environmental Protection  Agency's budget so their quest to keep our water and air clean will be  able to continue. It increases funding for clean energy research as  well. That is one of the great hopes for jobs in this country, as our  Senator from Washington, Maria Cantwell, constantly reminds us.   For my home State of New York, I was particularly pleased the  agreement supports critical programs that are greatly needed and very  popular in my State, like the Community Development Block Grant  Program, which so many smaller cities depend on; the Great Lakes  Restoration Initiative to get pollution out of all the Great Lakes,  Lake Ontario and Lake Erie being on the shores of New York; and the  vital TIGER Grant Program, which has done so much to support  infrastructure, road building, and highways throughout my State and  throughout America.   As I said, the bill explicitly precludes the use of any of this  funding for a border wall. This is an idea that both parties rejected.  A load of Congressmen and Senators on the Republican side have said  that the wall doesn't make sense. In fact, you couldn't find one  Republican on the border in the States of California, Arizona, New  Mexico, and Texas who supported that wall. Why? Unlike the President's  promise, Mexico is not paying for it. There is no plan for the wall. We  don't even know where we would build it. The Secretary of the Interior,  President Trump's appointee, said: We can't build it from the U.S. side  because it cuts us off from the river. Mexico will not build on their  side. Where are we going to build it? In the middle of the river? And,  mainly, because it is not very effective--you can tunnel under a wall.   We all want to prevent the scourge of drugs from coming across our  border; so many of them come in little planes and boats. When they come  by land, they are often hidden in parts of cars, in the carburetor or  the exhaust tank--hidden. They will be able to come through because the  wall obviously is going to have portals in it where trucks and cars can  go through. So there is no money for the border wall, not one plug  nickel.   We do have money, of course, for border protection, which both  parties have always supported, and comprehensive immigration reform.  Senator McCain and I, in a bipartisan bill supported by 68 Members of  this body, made sure we had very strong border protection. But it has  to be smart, it has to be cost effective, and it has to work.   Early on in this debate, Democrats clearly laid out our principles  and insisted there would be no poison pill riders in this bill. We were  able to knock out more than 160 poison pill riders from the final  agreement, including the border wall, anti-labor measures that hurt the  working people of America, and efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. So  many women depend on these clinics for their health. And we were able  to achieve significant investments in domestic programs that help the  middle class and those struggling to get to the middle class.   Of course, this bill doesn't include all the things we wanted, but  that is the nature of compromise. At the end of the day, this is an  agreement that reflects our basic principles--something that both  Democrats and Republicans can support. It took a few extra days, but we  got a very good agreement.   I want to thank my friend, the majority leader, Senator McConnell. He  worked very hard to get a good bill. I thank the chairmen and ranking  members of the House-Senate Appropriations Committees, particularly  Senator Leahy from Vermont in our Chamber. I thank Speaker Ryan and  Leader Pelosi and all of their staff for working so hard last week and  over the weekend to forge an agreement.   I must tell you, and I must tell my colleagues, the negotiations  between our two sides were consistently productive and always  respectful. Throughout the process, both Republican and Democratic  Members and staff negotiated in good faith because we all wanted to get  something done. I believe this experience bodes well for the 2018  budget and future negotiations between our two parties on  appropriations. If we can show the same desire to get things done--the  same mutual respect, the same ability to compromise--we can get a darn  good budget for the year 2018 without the specter of a government  shutdown hanging over the country's head.   I wish to say one final thing. It shows that when our Republican  colleagues are willing to work with us, we can get things done. All too  often--particularly from the White House--this attitude is just do it  our way, my way or the highway. That is what happened on the healthcare  bill--no consultation with Democrats. That is what happened on this  little tax plan.   When you don't do things in a bipartisan way, it is much harder to  pass things. It is much harder to get a product that is at the  consensus of where America is. I hope that not only will this  successful negotiation on the 2017 appropriations bill be a model for  the 2018 bill but a broader model that we can all work together to get  things done for the country we love.   I expect we will vote on this bill later this week, and I believe it  will receive overwhelming support in this Chamber.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin)  is necessarily absent.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Are there any other Senators in  the Chamber desiring to vote?
