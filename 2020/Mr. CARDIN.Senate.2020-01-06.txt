 Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the nomination of  U.S. Treasurer Jovita Carranza to lead the Small Business  Administration. Treasurer Carranza's nomination comes at a time of  great change for American small businesses. With the growing diversity  in America, the face of business ownership in America is naturally also  becoming more diverse.   I have witnessed these changes firsthand in my home State of  Maryland, which currently boasts the highest concentration of women- owned businesses in the country, as well as the highest concentration  of minority-owned businesses. Maryland's success has been no accident;  it is as a result of our leaders' decades-long commitment to creating  opportunities for underserved entrepreneurs, which began when the late  Baltimore Congressman Parren J. Mitchell created the first Federal set- aside for minority contractors in 1977.   It was with this understanding that I requested a seat on the Small  Business Committee when I joined this body in 2006, and it is with this  understanding that I am hopeful that Treasurer Carranza will provide  much needed leadership at the SBA and serve as an advocate for  entrepreneurs--especially those from underserved communities--within  the administration.   If confirmed to lead the SBA, Treasurer Carranza will enter an agency  that has not had a Deputy Administrator since April 2018 and that has  been led by its General Counsel since former Administrator Linda  McMahon resigned in April 2019. She will join an administration that  has pushed for drastic cuts at the SBA in every budget it has sent to  Congress. I am grateful that our Appropriations Committee has  consistently rejected the administration's devastating budget  proposals, and I hope that Treasurer Carranza will work to ensure that  the administration's fiscal year 2021 budget is not more of the same.   Minorities, women, veterans, and entrepreneurs from other underserved  communities face specific, historical barriers to business ownership,  and they need an SBA that has the leadership, vision, and tools  required to meet their needs. I would like to use this opportunity to  highlight what I believe are the two most critical areas where the SBA  is falling short in its support of underserved communities.   First, SBA must do a better job of providing affordable capital to  entrepreneurs from underserved communities.   SBA's various loan programs provide entrepreneurs with affordable  capital to fund their businesses. These loans are especially important  for underserved entrepreneurs, who typically have less wealth with  which to fund a small business and have lower rates of business loan  approvals.   Instead of filling in the gaps in the credit markets, SBA's highest  volume loan program, the 7(a) Program, has mirrored the inequities in  the market. That is something we need to address. Addressing this issue  is important not only in Maryland, which, as I mentioned, has one of  the most diverse small business communities in the country, it is vital  for the future health of America's economy, considering that women and  minorities are driving growth in new business formation.   According to a recent American Express study, the overall business  ownership rate increased only 9 percent between 2014 and 2019. Over the  same 5-year period, the number of women-owned businesses increased 21  percent--more than twice as fast as the overall rate--and the number of  minority women-owned businesses grew by 43 percent.   It is clear that the underserved communities are driving the growth  and business formation in America, and SBA's loan programs must catch  up to this new reality.   Second, SBA must do all it can to increase opportunity for small  business contractors. Recent trends paint an onerous picture of the  future of small business contracting. A 2019 Bloomberg Government  report found that despite a steady increase in government spending in  the past several years, the Federal contracting marketplace is becoming  less competitive, with the number of contractors working on  unclassified contracts at a 10-year low. Small businesses are facing  the brunt of this decrease, which is particularly troubling in  Maryland, where Federal contracting accounted for 8 percent--roughly  $33 billion--of our State's GDP in 2018. The jobs created by these  companies have helped thousands of families in Maryland enter the  middle class.   The Senate has taken steps to help small contractors. I am proud to  share that today SBA will begin implementing the Runway Extension Act-- legislation I introduced that will allow small businesses to make  critical investments to grow their businesses without fearing they will  lose access to resources and Federal contracting opportunities.   But Congress alone cannot reverse the increasing insularity of the  Federal contracting process; SBA must work with large agencies that are  driving these trends in Federal contracting to ensure that small  businesses are given opportunities to become prime contractors and  supply the Federal Government.   Treasurer Carranza's prior experience should serve her well at the  SBA. In nearly 30 years at UPS, where she began as a part-time package  handler, Treasurer Carranza became the highest ranking Latina in the  history of the company. She also served in government as Deputy  Administrator of SBA under President George W. Bush, during which she  chaired the SBA's Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business  Utilization Council.   At a time when America's small businesses are experiencing rapid  demographic changes and new challenges, SBA needs bold and innovative  leadership. I am optimistic that Treasurer Carranza can be the leader  and advocate that SBA and American small businesses need right now. I  support her nomination. I urge my colleagues to approve her nomination  as the SBA Administrator.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
