 Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend and fellow Texan,  Mr. Chip Roy.   Get your guns up, Mr. Roy. I thank you for that introduction, and I  thank you for hosting tonight's Special Order for our friend and  fearless leader for Texas and for this great Nation, Rick Perry.   It is, I think, pretty telling that every Texan who has taken the  mike to pay tribute to our friend Rick Perry has spoken with the  fondness of a deep friendship, and I think that is a tribute to  Secretary Perry. He was a man who could connect with just about  anybody--not because he had the special political gift; it is because  he had genuine love for people. That was his gift. I am glad that God  saw fit to allow him to deploy that as our Governor, as Secretary, and  in public service for many, many years.   My favorite Rick Perry quote: If you want to make America great  again, make it more like Texas.   Mr. Speaker, in the summer of 2017, Energy Secretary Rick Perry  unveiled a vision for our Nation, not only to become energy  independent, but energy dominant. Predictably, some in the mainstream  media responded by dismissing it as overly ambitious and unrealistic.   The Washington Post said about his vision that it was ``dominated by  misleading claims.'' The Los Angeles Times said that the plan  ``threatens the entire planet.'' Not only did their criticism miss the  mark on both accounts, but, fortunately, for the American people, they  were definitively disproven by our friend and fearless leader,  Secretary Rick Perry.   We were once a nation reliant on foreign sources of energy. Today, we  are on track to become a net energy exporter by 2020. By 2025, U.S. oil  production is expected to equal that of Saudi Arabia and Russia,  combined.   Under Secretary Rick Perry's leadership, the United States has become  a net exporter of natural gas for the first time since 1957. In fact,  the U.S. is on track to more than double its LNG export capacity by the  end of this year.   Not only were we able to increase our energy production and export  capacity in these United States, we have done it while leading the  world in reducing  [[Page H8947]]  carbon emissions, decreasing our output of CO2 by 42 million  tons, while, at the same time, the European Union increased its carbon  by about the same amount, China increased theirs by almost three times  the amount that we reduced our carbon, and India twice as much of an  increase to our decrease.   I would say that is a heck of a track record for our Texas Secretary  of Energy.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation's energy security is and always will be a  matter of national security. And thanks to the skilled leadership of  Secretary Perry, I am proud to say that America is, indeed, safer and  more secure today than, well, than it was before he took office.   I am especially proud, Mr. Speaker, that our Nation's leading voice  for energy dominance was born and reared in west Texas, right smack in  the middle of my district, Texas 19.   I think Mr. Roy would agree with me that, if you are a Texan, no  matter what your title is and how far up the chain you go in political  leadership, the Governor is always the highest title of all. So I am  going to call him Governor Perry. I can't wait to refer to him as  Governor Perry again.   Rick Perry is a fifth-generation Texan. He is from Haskell, USA,  which is 50 miles north of Abilene.   I remember introducing him once in Lubbock, saying that there are  some people and politicians who have street cred, and then there are  some who have farm-to-market cred. Where I come from, Mr. Speaker,  farm-to-market cred is more important.   He had a bead on all things rural America because he was rural  America. He understood that the small towns and the highways and the  byways of this country were not just producing our food, fuel, and  fiber; they were producing a people with a substance and a character  that this Nation desperately needed.    He understood that west Texas, where he hails from and where I hail  from and have the honor of representing, that our greatest contribution  wasn't as the energy basin or as the breadbasket, but as the backbone  of American traditional values. I so appreciate that. Nobody was a  greater champion or a stronger voice.   We heard his background tonight. I want to thank him for his service  to our country wearing the uniform. He served at Dyess Air Force Base,  which is the largest B-1 bomber base in the country, and it is also in  my district.   Of course, he went on to serve as State representative, agriculture  commissioner, Lieutenant Governor, and, of course, the longest serving  Governor in the history of Texas.   I think Mr. Roy would agree with me that he was the quintessential  Texas Governor. He had that boldness, that optimism, that indomitable  spirit that embodied Texas. He had that Texas swagger. He was  confident, but he was humbled to know that he needed the right team and  that he needed help from everybody to take Texas to that next level.   Nobody could sell Texas like him. I mean, he recruited some of the  best and brightest talent from around the world. He brought businesses  in of all sectors from around the world. He was a true believer in the  Texas miracle, and we are all the better in Texas for his leadership.   Like all good west Texans, I would say to Mr. Roy that the bottom  line is he was a salt-of-the-earth guy, and he was a straight-shooting  guy.   Let me do a little straight shooting for the American people with  respect to what kind of nation the United States is on account of his  leadership over the last couple of years: U.S. energy production  reached a record high; the U.S. has become the largest crude oil  producer in the world; American natural gas production hit a record  high for 2 straight years, both in 2017 and 2018.   When Americans look back on this era in our history, they will know  the powerful, lasting impact of Governor Rick Perry and what he has  done in terms of handing this country to the next generation of  Americans: more prosperous, more free, and more secure. They will know  that our producers in west Texas and across this country were empowered  to unleash a new era of American energy dominance. They will know that  this kid from Haskell, Texas, was at the helm during this historic  transformation.   So from one small town west Texas boy to another, I thank Rick Perry  for his service; I thank him for the sacrifices that he has made; I  thank him for his love for this country; I thank him for his passion  for everything good about America; and I thank him for putting that on  display with the way he operated, the way he led, and just who he is-- just who he is.   Mr. Speaker, I say to Anita Perry: We know--Mr. Roy and I both, and  everybody who has been called to service understands--that she and her  children have made a tremendous sacrifice. I just want to say God bless  her in this next phase of her life with Rick. I pray that he brings  great joy to your lives and to the life of your family.   My last quote is from the first President of Texas Tech University.  It goes like this:         Everything that is done on these west Texas plains ought to       be done on a big scale. It's a part of the country that lends       itself to bigness.    Mr. Speaker, Rick Perry was a small town kid with a big heart, and he  has made a big impact on these United States. So God bless Rick Perry,  God bless this great Nation, and go west Texas.
