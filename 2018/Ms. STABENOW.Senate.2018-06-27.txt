 Mr. President, I want to concur with the comments of  our chairman, Senator Roberts. All together, I believe we have 91  amendments between the work of the committee on a bipartisan basis and  the work we have put into the substitute. We have listened and worked  together with colleagues on both sides of the aisle and put forward a  package of bipartisan amendments that will allow us to move forward in  a way that will provide certainty for our farmers and ranchers, as well  as our families.  [[Page S4462]]    Now we will take the next step, and we look forward to working with  colleagues to move this forward to get to a final vote this week.    Mr. President, I want to indicate I certainly  understand the concerns of the Senator from Florida, and we have been  looking for the last 2 days to find a resolution. There are multiple  interests on various sides of this issue on Cuba that we are trying to  work through so that we can move forward on this as well as other  amendments.   As the chairman has indicated, there are two amendments we are trying  to get pending so that we can move forward and take the next steps to  be able to come to a resolution and get to a final vote on the farm  bill, which our farmers, ranchers, and families in rural communities  are very anxious to have us do.   We will continue to work, as we have all day and as we did yesterday,  looking for ways to resolve this and to be able to move forward.  Hopefully, we can do that because there are a lot of folks really  counting on us to come together and get this done.
