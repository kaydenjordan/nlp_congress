 Madam Speaker, Captain Moises Navas and Gunnery  Sergeant Diego Pongo, both Marine Raiders, lost their lives on March 8  while on a mission to eliminate ISIS terrorists in Iraq.   I met Captain Navas last year when he spoke at a ceremony to rename a  local post office in honor of his fallen comrade, Sergeant Dietrich  Schmieman, a central Washington native.   With great poise and humility, the captain said at the time: ``We can  all sleep well and find comfort in knowing that it is Americans who  raise their hands; this Nation's defense is in the hands of guys such  as Dietrich Schmieman.''   Madam Speaker, it is imperative that we not lose sight of the fact  that, as we speak, the brave men and women of our Armed Forces are  standing guard to keep our Nation safe.   Today, I rise to echo those powerful words from a brave young  captain, pictured here alongside Sergeant Schmieman's parents at the  post office dedication, to say that we can indeed sleep soundly because  of heroes like Moises, Diego, and Dietrich.                            ____________________
