 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I got in my car and drove to  Washington, D.C., from Columbus, Indiana, on behalf of the voters in  Indiana's Sixth District.   Mr. Speaker, I am here to support President Trump and be a voice for  Hoosiers who need relief from this virus now. I have been fully engaged  in making sure that this package preserves the health and livelihood of  Americans.   We need to protect the health of Americans and get them back to work.  Congress has come together to provide relief and support for hospitals,  families, workers, and small businesses.   Mr. Speaker, I came here to fight for Hoosiers' prosperity and the  American Dream. We can't afford to wait another minute for relief.  Let's do our job and get it done.
