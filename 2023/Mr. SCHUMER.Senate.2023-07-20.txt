 Mr. President, today, the Senate will continue the  bipartisan process of passing our annual Defense authorization bill,  the NDAA.   We had a productive afternoon yesterday. We held votes on four  amendments, from both Democrats and Republicans.   We affirmed our unflinching commitment to our NATO allies by  defeating an amendment that sought to undermine our support for the  transatlantic relationship. Eighty-three Senators united to defeat this  amendment, and I thank every single one of them for standing firm. It  is a majority of both parties.   In another win for NATO, we also adopted Senator Kaine's amendment  stating that no President can unilaterally take us out of NATO without  Senate approval. Adopting Kaine's amendment was an unmistakable message  to both our friends and foes that America's commitment to NATO will not  waiver. The political winds may shift, but America's bonds to NATO will  remain unbent.   That is what passing the annual defense bill should look like: both  sides proposing and debating amendments, both sides having input, both  sides working in good faith to get this bill passed as soon as we can.   We will keep working today. After voting on the Cruz-Manchin- Fetterman amendment this morning, I hope we can agree to additional  votes. We will keep negotiating on additional reasonable amendments  that we can bring to the floor, so we can keep this process going.   Nobody thinks this kind of bipartisanship is easy, and both sides  have honest disagreements, as we do on so many issues. But that should  not prevent us from fulfilling our obligation to take care of our  servicemembers, take care of our DOD workforce, and provide for our  common defense, so necessary these days.   There is every reason in the world to get this bill done as soon as  we can. As I have said all week, the NDAA is full of provisions that  both sides can celebrate--provisions that seem incremental on their own  but together provide a strong foundation for the security of this  Nation.   We will make important progress to outcompete the Chinese Government.  We will pass the first pieces of legislation this year related to AI  oversight.  [[Page S3438]]  We will strengthen our ties to Taiwan, increase our influence in the  Indo-Pacific, make progress on the vital AUKUS partnership, and  increase the administration's power to sanction and punish  international fentanyl traffickers.   I mentioned this before, but I cannot emphasize it enough. This  fentanyl bill is a major, major help in stopping the scourge of  fentanyl from coming into this country. Members on both sides of the  aisle should celebrate that in a bipartisan way. Under the leadership  of Senator Brown and Senator Tim Scott, we were able to get this done.   All of these agreements are the result of both sides working  together, each one a good reason to keep going until the job was done.  Both sides will continue working today and into next week until we pass  the NDAA. We are making good progress, but, of course, we still have  more to do.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order to call up the following amendments to S. 2226: Lee, No. 376;  Scott, No. 510; Romney, No. 823; Sinema, No. 315; Grassley, No. 273;  Blackburn, No. 224; Moran, No. 949; Baldwin, No. 685; Cornyn, No. 931;  Rounds, No. 813; and Warnock, No. 199; further, that with respect to  the amendments listed above, at a time to be determined by the majority  leader in consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate vote on  amendments in the order listed, with no further amendments or motions  in order and with 60 affirmative votes required for adoption, with the  exception of Lee, No. 376, and that there be 2 minutes equally divided  prior to each vote, with 4 minutes equally divided for debate on the  Lee amendment.    For the information of Senators, I expect one more  rollcall vote today, which will be on the Lee amendment.   Mr. President, I am glad we are taking another step towards final  passage today, and we will keep going when we return next week.   Providing for our national defense is always one of our highest  responsibilities in Congress and something that should always be  bipartisan, and today, we are seeing that play out in the Senate.   I want to thank my colleagues. For both sides, this has been a lot of  bipartisan cooperation and back-and-forth, and I want to thank my  colleagues on both sides for their good work.   I also want to thank Chairman Menendez and Senator Scott for agreeing  to work on their differences with respect to the Scott amendment, to  work out their differences in the conference committee. I have given  both of them my assurance that I will work with them to find an  amicable solution.   I yield floor.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet),  the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Coons), the Senator from Illinois (Mr.  Durbin), the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Manchin), the Senator from  New Jersey (Mr. Menendez), and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock)  are necessarily absent.-    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, first, I am happy to talk about the 50th  anniversary of hip hop, a great artistic creation in America, and we  have a resolution celebrating that 50th anniversary. I am proud that my  resolution commemorating the 50th anniversary of hip hop will pass the  Senate. The resolution again designates August 11 as Hip Hop  Celebration Day, the month of August as Hip Hop Recognition Month, and  the month of November as Hip Hop History Month.   I would like to thank Senator Cassidy, as well as Congressman Bowman  in the House, for their work on this resolution, and I also want to  thank my dear friend LeRoy McCarthy, the historian of hip hop, who  proposed to me the idea of honoring hip hop. He deserves credit today,  as do all my colleagues who made this happen.   Hip hop was born in my hometown of New York at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue  in the Bronx. Years ago, I worked with DJ Kool Herc, KRS-One, and the  residents of 1520 to save the birthplace of hip hop when the owner  wanted to sell the building to another developer and remove its  affordable housing units to make a profit. They were going to destroy  the rec room where hip hop was first created by DJ Kool Herc.   We were able to prevent so many people from being displaced and, at  the same time, make sure that this historic landmark would forever be  honored properly. And over the decades, hip hop has transcended  language, race, age, and both geographic and socioeconomic barriers.   Many people can attest to the fact that hip hop actually changed  their lives for the better, gave them purpose and meaning. I know many  of them myself, many of whom are New York City and Bronx residents.   So hip hop is great. It is a uniquely American art form that quickly  blossomed into a global movement. And we are proud--proud, proud,  proud--today that this resolution honoring the 50th anniversary of hip  hop will pass.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 1096, which was received  from the House and is at the desk.    Mr. President, I ask further that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 305, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.
