 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks 100 days of the Trump  administration. So let's take a look.   What does that 100 days mean? It means hundreds of vacancies still  left in important agencies like State and Defense, hundreds of hours  wasted on meaningless executive orders, hundreds of miles flown back  and forth to Mar-a-Lago to play golf, hundreds of educational and  cultural programs on the chopping block, hundreds of acres of public  lands under threat, and hundreds of programs that benefit millionaires  while causing hundreds and thousands of seniors to worry about losing  Meals on Wheels, working families losing their health care, DREAMers  losing their protection, women losing Planned Parenthood, and ordinary  folks losing money out of their pocket to pay higher tax bills because  of the new proposal.   That is not much of a record, if you ask me. But what it also means  is there are hundreds and thousands of voices rising up saying: We will  resist, and we will persist.                            ____________________
