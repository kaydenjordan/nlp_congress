 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his great work  throughout this whole process leading the committee and getting this to  the finish line, but we need to push it over the finish line.   Mr. Speaker, for 56 years, this bill has been the primary way in  which Congress executes its Article I constitutional duty to provide  for the common defense. This year's bill finally begins to rebuild our  military after a half decade of cuts which slashed nearly one-quarter  of the defense budget. For 6 years, we have just been barely getting  by: cutting resources as the world becomes more dangerous, asking more  and more of those who serve, and putting off tough choices. We are at a  key decision point.   This bill will continue to save billions of taxpayer dollars while  cutting wasteful bureaucracy and streamlining acquisition, but it will  also strengthen missile defense and, in many ways, make our military  more focused on its core mission of preparing to fight and win wars.   There are so many good things in the bill, I can't go over all of  them. I sincerely ask my fellow Members to support this NDAA.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the topic of my Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor for me to come to the  House floor tonight to celebrate National Bible Week.   This is an opportunity, for the next hour, to celebrate the  tremendous influence of the Bible on the freedoms we enjoy today in  America. We are truly blessed to live in a nation where we are free to  worship and read the Holy Scriptures without fear of persecution.   There are many places throughout the world, unfortunately, where such  freedoms do not exist. Americans have the right, under our wonderful  system of government, to respect and study the Bible, or any other  system of belief, if they so choose, or even no belief at all. That is  the beauty of the American way, and I believe it is founded and goes  back to the Bible.    In 1941, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared the week of  Thanksgiving to be National Bible Week. Every U.S. President since has  followed this tradition by declaring this time of year to be National  Bible Week. The National Bible Association and the United States  Conference of Catholic Bishops have designated the specific days of  November 12 through 18 of this year as National Bible Week.   This is the week set aside to recognize the Bible as a foundational  building block of Western civilization, the Judeo-Christian heritage,  and the legacy that motivated and shaped the founding of the United  States. In this hour, we will hear from Members of Congress from  various faith traditions and denominations speak about what the Bible  means to them and what it means to the country. We are here, in keeping  with tradition, to recognize National Bible Week.   Mr. Speaker, I am just going to speak for a couple of moments about  my own personal experience and then turn it  [[Page H9248]]  over to some Members who want to share some thoughts that I think bear  worth listening to.   When I was a freshman at the University of Kansas four decades ago,  someone asked me if I knew what the Bible was about. I said, yes, I  knew what it was all about. But I realized that my answer was actually  pretty presumptuous because I had never actually read any of it.   Mr. Speaker, I wonder if this might be true for others who might be  listening tonight. The only honest thing I could do at that point was  to read the Bible for myself. I started by reading the Gospel of John  in the New Testament. When I read it, I discovered that I hadn't known  at all what the Bible was about.   In that Gospel, Jesus says: ``I am the way, the truth and the life;  no one comes to the Father but through me.'' And I ended up discovering  a personal relationship with Jesus Christ who became my Lord and  Savior.   Mr. Speaker, this is what I know from personal experience. It is  better to read the Bible for one's self and not just to take someone  else's word for what is in it. For me, it made all of the difference in  the world. My life has been totally different since then as a result.   As King David says in the Psalms: ``The unfolding of Your words gives  light; it gives understanding to the simple.''   As we celebrate National Bible Week, we remember the importance of  faith in both our private and public lives. We recognize the Bible's  powerful message of hope. We cherish the wisdom of the Bible, and we  thank God for providing this Holy Book that has truly been, in the  words of the Scripture, ``a lamp unto our feet and a light unto our  path.''   Mr. Speaker, at this point, I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri  (Mrs. Hartzler).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Missouri for her  wise words and thought-provoking words.   I yield to the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Missouri for her  wise words and thought-provoking words.   I yield to the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her heartfelt  remarks.   Many of the early American settlers came to the New World with the  express purpose of following the Bible according to the convictions of  their own consciences. One of the first acts of Congress during the  tumultuous beginning of our Nation was the authorization of an  American-published Bible. The war with the British had cut off the  supply of any Bibles from England.   Our Founding Fathers understood how important it was for the American  people to have Bibles, so, in 1782, Congress reviewed, approved, and  authorized the first known English language Bible to be printed in  America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  his wonderful thoughts. He quoted some of the Presidents in our great  country's history. I have two more quotes along with that same line.   The gentleman mentioned Ronald Reagan, ``The Gipper.'' In his own  National Bible Week declaration, he wrote when he was in office: ``When  I took the oath of office, I requested the Bible be open to 2  Chronicles 7:14, which reads: `If My people, which are called by My  name shall humble themselves, pray, seek My face, and turn from wicked  ways, then I will hear from Heaven and forgive their sin and heal their  land.' ''   The President said: ``This passage expresses my hope for the future  of this Nation and the world.''   One last quote along this line. President Abraham Lincoln once said:  ``I have but to say it is the best gift God has given to man. All the  good the savior gave to the world was communicated through this book.  But for it we could not know right from wrong. All things most  desirable for man's welfare, here and hereafter, are found portrayed in  it.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg),  who is my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those profound  and heartfelt words that he has just shared with us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those profound  and heartfelt words that he has just shared with us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his  words and for focusing our attention on the U.S. Constitution and some  other great things, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes). He won  a special election and is one of our most recently elected and newest  Members of Congress. I look forward to seeing him doing good things  here for a long time to come.    Mr. Speaker, I am going to mention something about  fulfilled prophesy. This is one of the reasons why we can believe in  and trust the Bible.   People come here to Congress with all different kinds of backgrounds,  including pastors. This diversity of background adds a valuable thread  of experience and thought that helps us all.   One reason many people respect the Bible is that so many prophesies  for telling future events have come true exactly as foretold. In the  Old Testament, there are many predictions that were given to prove  that, if a speaker were divinely inspired, those things that he  predicted would come true; it would validate the words of that prophet.   The Book of Daniel, for instance, contains scores of detailed  prophesies that were literally fulfilled. Skeptics have fallen back to  the position that Daniel must have been written after the fact and is,  therefore, not being honest.   In fact, the Book of Daniel is found in its entirety in the Greek's  Septuagint and partially in the Dead Sea Scrolls, both of which we know  predated the events that were prophesied. That means that the critics  of the dating of the Book of Daniel are the ones who are not being  honest.   The rise and fall of empires, the capture and destruction of cities,  the destiny of kings all were prophesied in minute detail. Archeology  and history have literally confirmed hundreds of such prophesies as  having come true.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Colorado (Mr.  Lamborn) for leading this Special Order tonight on National Bible Week.   Last night, several of us had the privilege to attend a preview of  the national Museum of the Bible. It was very impressive. I would urge  everybody watching tonight and who hears about it to tour it when you  get the chance here in Washington, D.C.   One of the things that struck me very early on in that tour was a  banner hanging inside the museum that says: ``The law of the Lord is  perfect, refreshing to the soul. The decree of the Lord is trustworthy,  giving wisdom to the simple''--Psalm 19:8.   That also applies to the Bible itself, the inherent and infallible  Word of God.   Jesus himself used Scripture that was written before him. Jesus never  belittled the Scripture, as some modern critics do, or set it aside,  nor did he criticize it; although he criticized those who misused it or  contradicted it, although he rejected many interpretations of it.   When we hear the Son of God's quotes to Scriptures, we need no  further testimony. He believed every word of Scripture. All the  prophesies concerning Himself were fulfilled, as my colleague, Mr.  Lamborn, said.    Time and time and time again, the timelines prove the Word of God's  prophesy. Matthew 19:4 and 19:5 were one of those that Jesus spoke of,  documented in the New Testament, accounts by those over there with  Jesus at the time.   We know Moses wrote the Pentateuch, Jonah wrote Jonah, Daniel wrote  Daniel. Jesus attests to that. He believed the Old Testament was spoken  by God, Himself, written by the Holy Spirit's inspiration, even though  the pen was held by men. That is an important point for those who ask:  How can the Bible be real, since it was written down by men?   The committed task of all writing of the Word of God, though they  were fallible men, were guided by the infallible Holy Spirit. That is a  faith we have and hold.   It does take some faith, yes, just as it takes faith for me to get on  that airliner and fly back East each week. But the faith in the Bible  is much stronger. It has never been proven wrong. All the prophesies  that were made that have occurred already have been proven true.   The Founders thought it was a key element in the founding of this  Nation, obviously. Right in this room, behind the Speaker's dais, is  the inscription: ``In God We Trust.'' Facing me right now is the only  forward-facing image in here of Moses looking over this House of  Representatives.   Lastly, I would leave with this. As you watch the machinations of the  Members of Congress, I think one of the most important guidelines we  would have I find in Proverbs 4:25 through 4:27: we uphold the honor  not only of this institution and our families, but those who walk with  God, that walk with Jesus.   In Proverbs, you see: ``Let your eyes look straight ahead. Fix your  gaze directly before you. Keep straight the passage for your feet and  be steadfast in all your ways. Do not turn to the right or the left.  Keep your feet from evil.''   That is what the Bible inspires. As I read it on the plane coming  back and forth and read it at home or at my bedside, this is what true  faith is all about, proven time and time again.   I urge everybody not just to have the Bible at your home. The  statistics are that every home has 2.2 Bibles, on average. It isn't  that there aren't enough Bibles. It is that people don't open it often  enough.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from California (Mr.  LaMalfa) for his sincere words.   When National Bible Week was started in 1941, even though that has  only been 76 years, the Bible itself has been celebrated by Americans  since the beginning of our country--in fact, before we were a country.   Our Presidents have been very vocal in their acknowledgment of the  Bible and the DNA of who we are as Americans. Several have been quoted.   Listen to what Civil War hero Ulysses Grant gave as advice to Sunday  school children: ``Hold fast to the Bible as the sheet anchor of your  liberties; write its precepts on your hearts and practice them in your  lives. To the influence of this book we are indebted for the progress  made in true civilization, and to this we must look as our guide in the  future.''   Then he finished with this quote from the Bible: ``Righteousness  exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for  being here tonight and for those thought-provoking and very well- intended words.   As our next speaker comes to the podium, let me mention the issue of  archaeology. Archaeology is one of the reasons why we can have trust in  that what the Bible says is true. There are many archaeological  discoveries which have validated Biblical accounts, giving  trustworthiness to the Bible that we acknowledge and commemorate during  this National Bible Week.   Time and time again, archaeology has shown that Biblical  personalities, locations, and events actually existed in time and  space. Claims by critics that a Biblical statement was simply made up  have been debunked by later archaeological studies more times than we  can say.   Jewish archaeologist Nelson Glueck has said: ``It may be stated  categorically that no archaeological discovery has ever controverted or  contradicted a Biblical reference.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Rouzer).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those words. It  is great that we have been hearing today from Representatives from all  over the United States: from North Carolina on the Atlantic Coast in  Georgia to California on the Pacific Coast, from Michigan on our  Northern border to Texas on our Southern border. And we have been  hearing America speak tonight, so I think that is very special.   Now, there are some who would prefer to gloss over the vital role  that the Bible has had in the founding of our Nation and the  implementation of this unique form of government, but none of our  Founding Fathers were perfect. Indeed, there are times in our Nation's  history when Biblical principles were not acted upon.   Yet, listen to what President Harry Truman said during his address to  the Attorney General's conference on law enforcement problems: ``The  fundamental basis of this Nation's law was given to Moses on the Mount.  The fundamental basis of our Bill of Rights comes from the teachings  which we get from Exodus and St. Matthew, from Isaiah and St. Paul. I  don't think we emphasize that enough these days.   ``If we don't have the proper fundamental moral background, we will  finally end up with a totalitarian government, which does not believe  in rights for anybody except the State.''   Mr. Speaker, it has been an honor, and it has been a pleasure to  commemorate National Bible Week this evening. As I said a moment ago,  we heard from colleagues from all over the United States. I am grateful  to these colleagues who have joined me to honor the Word of God. I am  also thankful to the National Bible Association for their vision for  National Bible Week and for their encouragement for our efforts today.   Mr. Speaker, the prophet Isaiah, thousands of years ago, wrote: ``The  grass withers and the flowers fall, but the Word of our God endures  forever.''   How true. Civilizations have risen and fallen in those thousands of  years since that was said, generations have come and gone, yet here  today on November 14, 2017, we are still celebrating the enduring Word  of God. We celebrate National Bible Week.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
