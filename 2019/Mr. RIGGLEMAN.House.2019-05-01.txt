 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with some great news for the  residents of my district, the Fifth District of Virginia.   Southern Virginia was selected as Microsoft's newest TechSpark  community. The goal of the TechSpark program is to accelerate economic  growth through expanding broadband connectivity, career pathways in  digital transformation.   This $5 million investment has a potential to be a game changer for  southern Virginia, and this project partners perfectly with the work I  have been doing in Congress providing rural broadband and increasing  economic opportunities in Southside Virginia.   Private investment is always encouraged and preferred, but we also  need to use private-public partnerships to expand access to broadband.   Communities in my district are in desperate need of broadband access,  and this investment in South Boston will be an example of how we can  encourage innovation and spur economic growth that will help families  around this country.                            ____________________
