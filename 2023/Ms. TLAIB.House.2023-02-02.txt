 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the survivors of gun  violence during National Gun Violence Survivors Week.   Sandy Hook, Parkland, Buffalo, and, yes, even Detroit, and Chicago.  So many now are impacted--various names and memories of loved ones  seared into our memories--in places where gun violence has traumatized  our communities and taken far too many of our loved ones.   Every day in our country, more than 110 people are shot and killed  and more than 200 people survive gunshot wounds. We are 33 days into  the new year, Mr. Speaker, and there have already been 54 mass  shootings. To every survivor of gun violence, from classmates who have  witnessed their friends die to families who have dinner at the table  with an empty seat there, we honor you always with action.   So I call on my colleagues to stand up to the corporate gun lobby and  send the assault weapons ban to President Biden's desk. There is no  reason to have weapons of war in our communities. There is no reason  that anyone needs a weapon of war that can fire up to 60 shots per  minute.                            ____________________     Desperation--so desperate to distract the American people  from their total inability to govern, the GOP is now doing what it is  best at: weaponizing hate against a Black, beautiful, Muslim woman.   Congresswoman Omar's lived experience as a refugee and a childhood  survivor of war should be welcomed on this committee. It is needed.   Madam Speaker, when you can't pass any bills that actually improve  the people's lives, then they turn Congress into a place of  fearmongering hate.   It is so painful to watch. How ironic that the so-called lovers of  personal freedom are now moving to censor Congresswoman Omar in the  same week they introduced a bill to ban Federal employees from engaging  in censorship.   Where are the free speech warriors today? The hypocrisy is obvious to  the American people. The majority is showing who they are.   I know Congresswoman Omar will not be silenced.   I say to Congresswoman Omar: I am so sorry that our country is  failing you today through this Chamber.  [[Page H650]]
