 Mr. Speaker, we can't wish away this  pandemic. We can't accept the false choice that we either reopen or  lose to the virus. No. We must protect the American people and the  institutions and values that define our Nation with action.   The HEROES Act provides us a path forward. We will save lives with  testing, tracing, and treatment. We will protect our communities by  supporting our teachers, police, and frontline workers. We will bring  relief to families by providing them financial aid, food, rent relief,  and healthcare. We will protect the sanctity of our democracy by  honoring every American's vote.   We vote today knowing we have more hard days ahead and more work to  do to ensure we don't just return to normal but that we emerge  stronger, more just, and more prepared for the challenges ahead. Today,  we vote for our heroes, for our future, and for the people.
