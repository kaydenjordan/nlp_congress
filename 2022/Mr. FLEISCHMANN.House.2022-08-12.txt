 Madam Speaker, the dying ember that is the  Democratic majority in both Houses once again seeks to burn the  American people. $80 billion for the IRS, and they champion it.   I will stand with the hardworking American people of this Nation.  Democrats, you can have the IRS.   Raising taxes at a time of recession, at a time of economic gloom, I  will stand with the hardworking entrepreneurs of America any time over  raising taxes.   Madam Speaker, the American people know better. The American people  deserve better. The American people will get better in November. I urge  a ``no'' vote on this bill.
