 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize one of the drafters and  signers of the Texas Declaration of Independence, Collin McKinney.   I was privileged to serve as the county judge in the County of  Collin, in the county seat of McKinney, obviously named for this Texas  hero.   Recently, we erected a larger-than-life statue of Collin McKinney in  his hometown of Anna, Texas. I rise to recognize this larger-than-life  hero in the State of Texas.  [[Page H906]]
