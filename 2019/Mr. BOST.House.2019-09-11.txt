 Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, for years, we have been told that we live in a  resource-poor Nation. We were also told that the domestic oil and gas  reserves were depleted. But, today, we know how wrong those predictions  are.   America is now the world leader in energy development. But don't  forget about the jobs. Oil and gas production is a jobs multiplier.  According to recent studies, more than 10 million American jobs can be  attributed to oil and gas production. For each drilling and oil job,  many more are created in manufacturing, transportation, and service  industries.   In my district, the U.S. Steel Granite City Works facility produces  the steel for Oil Country Tubular Goods. These products are used in oil  and gas production. These are good-paying jobs with great benefits.   In addition to the steel jobs in Granite City, approximately 10,000  Illinois manufacturers have jobs that have oil and gas industry ties.  According to some estimates, an additional 1 million manufacturing jobs  could be created through oil and gas development.   We need to think about this as the political fringes try to shove the  Green New Deal down our throats.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.
