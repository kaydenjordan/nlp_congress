 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise to thank and commend my colleagues for their  work on this $480 billion legislation.   On April 7, as the Speaker said, Republicans wanted $250 billion, but  no more.   After Democratic demands, Republicans finally agreed to increase the  $250 billion to $480 billion to include our priorities. An additional  $60 billion was set aside for small banks and community development  financial institutions and credit unions.   We were determined to add billions for small community lenders. We  wrote into the legislation that these loans will be forgiven if  properly used for paycheck protection.   I call on Secretary Mnuchin to follow through on his commitment to  Chairs Waters and Velazquez to ensure that these small lenders get the  money; make sure the money gets into the hands of African American,  Latino, women, and veteran-owned businesses; make sure the money gets  into the hands of nonprofits and churches.   I call on the Small Business Administration to furnish data on the  approved lenders authorized to originate these loans, provide a report  to us by race and ethnicity as to whether diverse entities are  receiving these loans and grants.
