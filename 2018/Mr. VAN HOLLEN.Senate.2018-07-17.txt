 Mr. President, I wish to start by thanking my  colleague from Connecticut for his words today and for his leadership  in protecting the integrity of our democracy and the rule of law.   When it comes to issues of national security and foreign policy, we  have had many vigorous debates in this country over the decades and  many important debates here on the floor of this Senate. There have  been deep disagreements over specific foreign policy choices that we  make as a country. But there has consistently been broad bipartisan  support for the view that the United States and strong U.S. leadership  benefit not only our interests but the interests of folks around the  world. That has been American leadership grounded in key values and  principles, including the promotion of democracy, universal human  rights, the rule of law, a free press, and the idea that America is an  exceptional nation based not on tribalism but a beacon of hope for all  people, as symbolized by the Statue of Liberty. This isn't to say that  over the decades we have always been virtuous or always consistent in  the application of these principles. We all know we have made many  mistakes and detours along the way, but until now, until this moment in  our history, the principles and values I outlined have been the  guideposts and cornerstones for American Presidents--Republicans and  Democrats alike--since the end of World War II.    With those guideposts, we have built some very important  international architecture: our alliances, international institutions,  and international agreements. But today, sadly, we have a President who  has gone absolutely rogue on the time-tested bipartisan tenets of  American foreign policy, whether it is the way he attacks or berates  our allies or when he consistently goes out of his way to praise  dictators like Vladimir Putin or Kim Jong Un or other autocrats around  the world.   I am not going to take the time today to chronicle the mountain of  evidence leading up to the events of last week that show already  President Trump's radical retreat from the kind of global leadership  that America has exercised since the end of World War II. We all know  that those views are shared by many of our Republican Senate  colleagues. Senator McCain has been very strong on that, as have other  Republican Senators. Others have said quietly what Senator McCain has  said publicly. This is a moment where everybody has to come together as  patriots, not partisans.   Including Senator McCain, we have a lot of Republican foreign policy  experts and independent groups, like Freedom House, that have raised  the alarm bells about this administration's far-reaching attacks on  fundamental institutions of democratic society, like freedom of the  press.   One thing we all know is this: We know the words and actions of an  American President have real-world consequences. Those of President  Trump leave our friends unsure if they can depend on us and create  openings and opportunities for our adversaries. They weaken our  credibility and squander our moral authority on the world stage.   Of course, the events of last week and yesterday are the ultimate  expression of this President's retreat from that bipartisan tradition  of American foreign policy--first, going to a NATO meeting and berating  some of our closest allies. All of us understand that each of our NATO  allies needs to fully contribute to NATO. In fact, these countries have  already made that commitment, but President Trump threw them under the  bus and diminished the importance of the NATO alliance.   Then, of course, he went directly from there to his meeting with  President Putin, but before that meeting, the President let us know  what his state of mind was. The President tweeted out: ``Our  relationship with  [[Page S4992]]  Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness .  . .''--not Russia's invasion or occupation of Crimea, not Russian  aggression in the Ukraine, not Russian activities around the world that  undermine peace and stability, and not Russia's attack on our democracy  in the 2016 elections.   In fact, shortly before he went to meet with Putin, he again invoked  a Stalinist expression, where he said: ``Much of our news media is  indeed the enemy of the people.'' That is something I am sure warmed  the heart of Vladimir Putin, who doesn't like any criticism, like our  President doesn't like any criticism.   Then he went in to this meeting and came out in that joint press  conference. What did he do? Standing side by side with Vladimir Putin,  he told the world that he sided with Putin over the leaders of the  American intelligence community on the question of whether or not  Russia interfered in the American elections in 2016. He said: President  Putin assures me that they did not interfere. He says it very strongly.   Then, he sided with President Putin over his own director of the CIA,  who has testified before Congress about Russian interference in 2016,  over Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, over Secretary of  State Pompeo, and over the very people President Trump said all of us  should trust in these important positions of responsibility. Yet, on a  world stage, he bowed to President Putin and said he trusted President  Putin's word over that of U.S. intelligence. I understand that today he  is trying to walk this back. He actually tweeted:         While I had a great meeting with NATO . . . I had an even       better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia. Sadly, it is       not being reported that way--the Fake News is going Crazy!    The challenge President Trump has this time is that we all watched  that press conference. The world saw it. So really, the question now  for us here in the Senate--Republicans and Democrats alike--is this:  What are we going to do? What are we going to do now that the President  of the United States has taken this position, undermining the  credibility of his own country?   We were worried before the President went to the NATO meeting, and we  passed a resolution here--that was a good thing--affirming our support  for NATO. Last year, over the objections of the Trump administration,  we passed legislation imposing sanctions on Russia.   Now we have to come together, as Senates have before--Republicans and  Democrats--to send a very strong signal that the United States stands  together in support of the bipartisan principles we have stood for  before.   We now know the President will not defend the integrity of our  democratic process. We need to do it, and my colleagues have outlined  many steps we should take. One step we should take is directly related  to future elections, because what we know from the testimony of the  head of the CIA, the head of the DNI, and the Secretary of State is  that they all expect Russia--unless something changes--to interfere in  our 2018 and future elections.   The 2018 elections are 16 weeks away. We now know the President of  the United States is not going to defend the integrity of the  democratic process. So we have to do it. One of the many things we  should do is to support legislation I have introduced together with  Senator Rubio, bipartisan legislation. It is very clear. It says to  Vladimir Putin: If you interfere in another U.S. election and we catch  you, Russia will automatically face very stiff sanctions to your energy  sector and your banking sector, and there will be a huge price to pay.  It is called the DETER Act. The whole idea is to make sure that  Vladimir Putin knows that the cost of interfering in our elections far  outweigh any benefit he may think he gets.   So I hope we will stand together as Republicans and Democrats to do  what the President of the United States will not do, and that is to  protect the integrity of our elections. Let's learn from the past.  Let's work together for the future.
