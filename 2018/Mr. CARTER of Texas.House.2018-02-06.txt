 Mr. Speaker, our fine Secretary of Defense this  morning testified before the Committee on Armed Services. He remarked  that if the military is forced to continue to operate under a  continuing resolution for the rest of the year, it will be unable to  provide pay to our brave men and women in uniform, unable to recruit  personnel we need, unable to maintain our naval ships, unable to  maintain our aircraft, unable to supply our troops in the theater of  combat, and unable to strike contracts critical toward modernizing our  force. Unable, unable, unable.   As Congress, it is our responsibility to make our military force the  most able in the world; able to keep our country safe and able to  promote the ideals of freedom across the globe.   It would be deeply irresponsible for Members of this House to vote  against providing full-year funding to the Defense Department, which  addresses the needs of today and tomorrow, not last year.   The Secretary was on the Hill to discuss something very important:  The Department's National Defense Strategy, which seeks to address the  significant challenges we face with rising adversaries in China and  Russia, along with enduring threats of a nuclear-armed Korea, a  terrorist state in Iran, a terrorist network like ISIS. And he said:  ``I regret that, without sustained predictable appropriations, my  presence here today wastes your time because no strategy can survive  without funding necessary to resource it.''   Mr. Speaker, this bill funds our military for the year with funding  that addresses the challenges we face today and separates this critical  funding from the political fights here in Washington, D.C. Our troops  need our support for this bill.    Mr. Speaker, they need what this bill provides.  Because of that, I support the bill and I urge its passage.                                time  1745
