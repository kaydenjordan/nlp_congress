 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the May 14,  2018, vote on Executive Calendar No. 780, confirmation of Michael  Scudder, of Illinois, to be a judge for the Seventh Circuit. I would  have voted yea.    (At the request of Mr. Durbin, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
