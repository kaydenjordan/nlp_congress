 Madam Speaker, I support the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020, and I, too, thank Adam Smith  for his leadership in bringing a bipartisan bill as the final NDAA to  this floor.   This bill continues the deployment of low-yield nuclear weapons to  counter Russian violations of the INF. It also supports our nuclear  modernization efforts in the DOD and the National Nuclear Security  Administration to ensure a strong nuclear deterrent.   I also want to note the strong bipartisan support for missile defense  that is in this year's bill. This year's bill demonstrates that the  protection of our homeland from North Korean missile defense is not  subject to partisan politics.   As co-chair of the Congressional Military Sexual Assault Prevention  Caucus, along with my colleague and friend Susan Davis, I am proud of  the steps this conference report takes to further our mission of  reducing instances of sexual assault in our ranks and caring for the  victims of such acts.   The conference report includes provisions to improve the safety of  military housing. Adding to enhancements included in the last year's  NDAA, the report expands the requirement for fall prevention devices  installed on the windows of base housing to protect the young children  of our servicemembers.   The fiscal year 2020 NDAA provides the members of the Armed Services  their largest pay increase in over a decade and also includes the  repeal of the widow's tax over the next 3 years, a crusade by  Congressman   Joe Wilson.   It doubles the reimbursement allowance for licensure and  certification costs of a spouse of a servicemember arising from  relocation and gives members of the Federal Government, including  military members and Federal Government workers, 12 weeks of paid  family leave to care for newborn or adopted children.   I encourage passage of this bill.
