 Mr. Speaker, travel is by far the industry hardest hit  by the ongoing fallout of the pandemic, accounting for 42 percent of  all jobs lost in the U.S. since the start of the pandemic.   No State has been hit harder by the pandemic than Nevada. I hear from  constituents each and every day about how they are impacted by the loss  of jobs and the need to get back to work safely. That is why I  introduced the Hospitality and Commerce Recovery Job Act today, to  ensure that the tourism industry has the tax incentives necessary to  get back on its feet.   This legislation will work to implement the employee retention tax  credit, support the convention and trade show industries, restore the  entertainment business expense deduction, support the restaurant  industry, and provide a tax credit for travel expenses.   This legislation is necessary to ensure a robust travel and tourism  economy that is the lifeblood of my State's  [[Page H6008]]  economy. That is why I encourage my colleagues to support the  Hospitality and Commerce Recovery Job Act, to support the tourism  economy and all the people who make it strong.                            ____________________
