 Scott Franklin).    SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I rise today on  behalf of families who will enjoy Thanksgiving with their loved ones  next week. This American tradition is an opportunity to give thanks for  all our many blessings.   Yet through no fault of their own, millions of hardworking families  are struggling to count their blessings this year. Thanks to liberal  policies enacted by the Biden administration and congressional  Democrats, inflation is soaring, gas prices have spiked more than 50  percent, and supply chain disruptions are leaving store shelves empty.  The cost of Thanksgiving dinner this year will be the highest in  history, and it will cost more for folks to drive or fly to spend their  holidays with loved ones.   American families are hurting.   My Democrat colleagues and their liberal elite mouthpieces in the  media claim to be champions of the poor and the working class, yet an  NBC correspondent claims it's a dirty little secret that Americans can  afford to pay more for their groceries because they saved money when  they were trapped in their homes during the COVID pandemic. She also  had the audacity to say that because more than half of Americans are  invested in the stock market and it has been doing well that most  people are actually better off now.   How out of touch can she be? First, clearly she has zero regard for  the half of the country that isn't fortunate enough to have a stock  portfolio. Second, good luck trying to eat your 401(k) for  Thanksgiving. Those are designed for retirement so tax penalties for  early withdrawals are harsh. Here is the real dirty little secret: She  knows that, but she is so beholden to the left that she is willing to  provide them free cover.   Washington Post and Bloomberg op-ed writers are telling us we should  lower our expectations and live more like Europeans by simply getting  used to the idea of empty store shelves. These out-of-touch elites are  channeling a let them eat cake mentality while American families are  suffering.   Recent elections have shown that Americans reject these attempts to  fundamentally change our Nation from a prosperous environmental country  into a suffering socialist regime.  [[Page H6351]]    Inflation, intrusive government regulations, and overreaching  policies have left American families with less money and limited buying  power.   No American should ever have to lower their expectations while living  in the most prosperous country in the world. As Americans, we are  blessed to live in a country where we are free to pursue economic  prosperity, even during difficult times.    Many of the economic challenges faced by American families today were  created by the policies of an out-of-touch liberal ruling class, yet we  stand on the brink of ramming through the largest and most expensive  tax and spend initiative in history.   It reminds me of the final scene in the movie ``Thelma and Louise''  when the lead characters drive their car off a cliff rather than face  the consequences of their actions. Democrat Party leaders are willing  to figuratively drive our country off the cliff if that is what it  takes to pass the build back broke program in an electric car, I am  sure.   As we prepare to celebrate Thanksgiving, I ask my Democrat colleagues  and media elites to take a long, hard look at what their policies are  doing to working-class Americans.   Just say no.
