 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about President  Biden's tax plan with some basic facts.   President Biden proposes no tax increases on 99 percent of Americans.  This chart illustrates that, with 154 million Americans, not a single  American in the 99 percent is going to pay a dime more.   In fact, they are getting a tax cut. We are giving them a tax cut  with the child tax credit. We are giving them a tax cut with the earned  income tax credit.   So the obfuscation on the other side to convince 99 percent of  Americans that somehow their taxes are going to go up when President  Biden is delivering a tax cut for them is just factually false.   What does this mean? If you work in manufacturing, if you are a  nurse, if you are a teacher, if you are a doctor, if you are a lawyer,  most likely, your taxes aren't going up. For the 99 percent--not just  in the working class, but in the middle class, in the upper middle  class--your taxes are not going up. They are going down.   In fact, the President has extended Trump's tax cut for those who are  making under $75,000.   It is important we get those facts, and I want the American people to  look at this chart. If you really fall in that sliver of the top 1  percent, your taxes are going up. If you are everyone else in the 99  percent, your taxes aren't going up. They are going down, in most  cases.   So, people wonder how, in a democracy, we wouldn't want this. How  wouldn't we want those who are going to make the most in the tiny 1  percent, why wouldn't the 99 percent want them to pay a little bit  more? It turns out that the top 1 percent--and let's just be clear, if  you make over $538,000, you are in that top 1 percent. I personally  don't know a lot of doctors or lawyers or others who are making more  than $538,000 a year.   But if you are in that 1 percent, you have made $4.8 trillion over  this pandemic--$4.8 trillion. And the over 600 billionaires, they have  made $1.6 trillion over the pandemic.   I know that because a lot of them are in my district. We have had the  digitization of the economy. They are making a lot of money. Some of  them are brilliant. Guess what they told me? They can afford to pay a  little more.    Do you know what the market cap of companies in my district is? It is  $10 trillion in Silicon Valley. That is more than the GDP of Russia. It  is more than the GDP of most countries.   I laugh when people say this tag of socialism. My district is  producing the most wealth in the world. The people there who say we  want to pay a little bit more aren't socialists. They are wealth  generators.   But here is what they know: They fall into this 1 percent, and they  are saying we have made trillions of dollars. We have made billions of  dollars. We would like to pay a little bit more so everyone can have  healthcare, education, and nutrition in this country, and we are fine  with other people in the working and middle class getting a tax cut.   That is the President's policy. It is a policy of helping working- class Americans, middle-class Americans, upper-middle-class Americans,  and asking those who have done well to do a little bit more for our  country.   It is a policy against inherited wealth because we are Americans. We  don't believe in feudal estates. We don't believe what the law is right  now, that if you buy $1 million of Facebook stock and that becomes $10  million and if you want to give it to your kids, that your kids don't  have to pay tax on the appreciation of $9 million. We don't think that  is right. We don't think you should be able to transfer wealth without  paying any tax.   That is not the American way. That is what they used to do in old  Europe's feudal estates, passing wealth generation to generation. That  is the party of aristocracy, and that is what the Republicans would  have you believe.   We are the party of free markets, free enterprise, and new  entrepreneurs. We are the party of economic growth for everyone. We are  not the party of dynastic wealth.   If you believe that everyone should have a shot in the free market  economy, that you should have economic growth for everyone and  opportunity for everyone, if you are against dynastic wealth, if you  believe those who have made $4.8 trillion can pay a little bit more and  you can have tax cuts for the working class and middle class, you  should support President Biden's tax plan.                            ____________________
