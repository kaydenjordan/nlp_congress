 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Courtney for yielding.   Connecticut farmers are in dire need of this amendment. Connecticut's  agricultural industry encompasses everything from greenhouses to dairy  farms. The greenhouse and nursery industry are the largest agricultural  production sectors in the State, and they account for about $4.7  billion in Connecticut's economy. But these are family farms, not large  corporate farms.   When they have to pay more to transport products due to unfair truck  weight limits, there is a meaningful impact on their ability to stay  afloat. For this reason, the Connecticut Legislature passed a law in  2013 to allow for the increase in truck weights within the State.   However, this change, as my colleague Mr. Courtney says, requires a  Federal fix to truly take effect. Putting Federal policy in line with  State policy would be a lifeline for my local farmers. We are not  talking about a hypothetical benefit. We are talking about real,  tangible benefits.   This amendment would achieve parity with neighboring States where  weight limits are much higher. As you heard, in Connecticut, you can  only carry up to 80,000 pounds, unlike our neighbors, Massachusetts,  which is up to 127,000 pounds, and New York, which is up to 143,000  pounds. In order to do business with those States, it requires  multiple, inefficient trips.   This amendment is not just about fairness. It is about doing what  makes sense for most of Connecticut's agricultural sector. This would  be a vital lifeline for the industry that is the backbone of my State's  economy, and they are already struggling.   I urge my colleagues to at least recognize the importance of this  amendment, and I thank my friend, Mr. Courtney, for his partnership in  this effort.
