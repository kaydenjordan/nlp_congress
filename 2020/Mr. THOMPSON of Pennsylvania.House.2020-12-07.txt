 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  enthusiastically support the Growing Opportunities in Agriculture Act,  or the GO Ag Act. The GO Ag Act combines two of my passions:  agriculture and career technical education.   The GO Ag Act would make $5 million available through the Perkins Act  to help schools launch agricultural education programs, including FFA  chapters. Students learn about the agricultural industry and how it  intersects with math, science, and technology.   Restoring a robust rural economy depends largely upon appealing to  the next generation. Investing in education is perhaps the most  commonsense way to prepare individuals who are passionate about a  career in agriculture for the workforce. The GO Ag Act is not only an  investment in agriculture education, but also the future of our  agricultural supply chain.   I am proud to cosponsor this legislation because I believe investing  in agriculture education is an important step in bolstering rural  economies and strengthening rural communities.
