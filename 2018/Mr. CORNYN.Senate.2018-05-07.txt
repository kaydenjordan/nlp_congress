 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, one of the items on our to-do list is  continuing to confirm the President's nominees, which have faced an  unprecedented level of obstruction and downright foot-dragging. It is  maddening to  [[Page S2508]]  see our Democratic colleagues insisting that we go through all the  motions and the time limits set out in the rules, when nominees are  confirmed 99 to 1 or 100 to 0. In other words, these are not  controversial nominees, in many cases, and there is simply no reason to  drag their feet and to prevent the Senate from doing other important  work, including confirming more nominees.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Georgia (Mr.  Isakson), and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain).    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:       By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Whitehouse):   S. 2795. A bill to provide for programs to help reduce the risk that  prisoners will recidivate upon release from prison, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
