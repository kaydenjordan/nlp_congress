 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman, I thank the Speaker,  and I would say to my friend on the other side of the aisle, there was  no urgency in February when this was first brought to the President's  attention.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the fourth coronavirus  stimulus. It is good to see both parties can come together to aid the  country during a national crisis.   But we must have accountability for the money that we provide, and we  must get it to the people that need it the most.   Like many Members, I was not happy to hear of small businesses that  could not get funds. We must do a better job in getting the funds to  the people that need it the most, and that should be our commitment.
