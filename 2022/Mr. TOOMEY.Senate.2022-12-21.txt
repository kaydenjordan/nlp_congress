 Mr. President, you know, it brings me no joy to rise and       say I told you so, but for nearly 5 years now, Americans have been       paying the price quite literally for the Trump-Biden tariffs on       imported steel and aluminum. Let me just remind my colleagues that a       tariff is just a word that we use sometimes to obfuscate the fact that       these tariffs are just taxes on American consumers--a tax they pay when       they purchase something that has the tariff material in it. So I want       to make three points about this today. The first is that taxes       generally and these taxes in particular do tremendous economic harm.       Second, these taxes have been imposed by Presidents from both parties       and imposed unilaterally, increasingly, and without so much as a vote       by the Congress. Third, this is all about to get much worse. This is       what happens when Congress willfully abrogates its constitutional       responsibilities over trade and tax policy to the executive branch.              Let me start with the economic cost. The fact is that there is no       serious dispute in the economic world that these            [[Page S9723]]            tariffs, these taxes, do much more harm than good.        Now, I know that supporters of these tariffs, including now the Biden       administration, will argue that this is necessary to protect American       jobs. That is what they will say. Well, there are roughly 140,000       workers directly employed in the steel industry in the United States.       That is a big number--140,000--but there are literally millions of       American workers in industries that use steel or inputs made of steel,       and their jobs are jeopardized by the higher cost that is created when       we tax these products.        By the way, these millions of Americans who work in the industries       that use steel outnumber steelworkers by a ratio of roughly 80 to 1.       That is what we are talking about here.        The Peterson Institute estimated that for every job saved by the       Trump-Biden taxes on steel, the cost to American consumers was       $650,000--obviously many times more than the average steelworker's       salary--and these costs are all paid by price increases for consumers.       They also cost people their livelihoods. By one estimate, the job       losses from these tariffs alone have been as high as 75,000 jobs. This       has included a lot of jobs--thousands of jobs--in my Commonwealth of       Pennsylvania.        So I ask my colleagues a simple question: Is it ever really fair for       the government to intervene in the economy in a way that ranks one       person's right to earn a living higher than another person's? Is that       really what this government should do--decide who gets to have a job       and who doesn't? It is not a close call. It is flat-out morally wrong       for the government to be deciding which Americans get to work and which       ones don't, and that is what is happening here.        It is also the case that the unilateral imposition of these taxes by       Presidents is being done with a completely dishonest justification.       These tariffs have been increasingly imposed unilaterally, as I said,       by Presidents who have hidden behind the national security rationale.       That is what they say. In other words, to add insult to injury, these       taxes have been imposed not through an act of Congress but by executive       fiat and an executive fiat that is based on a completely false premise.        Why is this the case? Well, because there is a deep flaw in a Cold       War-era law. The law is called the 1962 Trade Expansion Act. It has       this section called section No. 232, and that section permits the       President to impose these tariffs, or taxes, on a product if his       Commerce Secretary decides that the product is a threat to the national       security interest of the United States.        Now, that sounds like a reasonable idea, but it has been applied in       ridiculous ways. I would suggest it is ludicrous to assert that our       national security is harmed because we import mostly small quantities       of steel and aluminum from allies like Canada, Mexico, Brazil, South       Korea, the EU, Australia, Japan, and many others.        But you don't have to take my word for it; you can take the word of       someone who is absolutely an expert on national security--former       Defense Secretary Mattis. He agrees with me. In a memo to President       Trump's Commerce Secretary, he urged against imposing these tariffs on       steel and aluminum. He noted that the U.S. military's needs for steel       and aluminum are met with a mere 3 percent of America's domestic       production of those mills.        Let me put this a different way. It means what we manufacture       domestically--the steel and aluminum that we make in America--is more       than 30 times what our military needs, what our defense needs. How       could you possibly argue that these small quantities that we import, on       top of all that we make, are a national security risk? It is       ridiculous.        By the way, over the past decade, we have consistently produced       anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of the steel we consume. Let me say that       again. If you look at all of the steel that we consume in the entire       United States of America, for all purposes--and it is a very long       list--we make 70 to 90 percent of that steel. And there is a national       security threat by importing these small other quantities to supplement       what we produce? Of course, it is not. It is completely disingenuous.        Frankly, invoking national security as a justification to impose       these taxes on Americans is a slap in the face. It is a slap in the       face to small businesses that are struggling to stay afloat, those       small businesses that have to buy this steel with these taxes on it,       which they sometimes can't afford; to the manufacturing workers who are       laid off as the input cost rises and their products are no longer       competitive; and to the exporters who see their markets shut off       because foreign countries retaliate against these tariffs. It is a       terrible policy.        There is another problem with this. It is reasonable to ask the       question: If the President can falsely invoke national security for the       sake of imposing these taxes on steel and aluminum, is there anything       that he can't put a tariff on in using this justification? I mean, if       he can use a false justification, you could falsely allege that almost       anything is related to national security, I suppose. Recent court       decisions have implied that if there is a limiting factor, the       administration certainly hasn't found it.        In fact, the previous President seemed to think that, after imposing       tariffs, he could go back and double them or maybe triple them for any       reason or for no reason at all. This is what is happening. That is       exactly what the former President did when he doubled the tariffs he       had earlier imposed on Turkish steel and aluminum. When this was       challenged in a court, a majority gave him a pass, but one judge had a       very insightful dissent. He disagreed in writing and said:                   I fear that the majority's decision in that particular case            effectively accomplishes what not even Congress can            legitimately do--to reassign to the President its            constitutionally vested power over the tariff. I dissent.              That judge is exactly right. He is exactly right.        There is a separate instance wherein a judge, in wanting to       underscore the lack of any limiting principle on a President's ability       to misuse this section 232, asked during an oral argument if the       President could invoke national security under section 232 in order to       put tariffs on peanut butter. The lawyer defending the tariffs for the       administration either couldn't or wouldn't directly answer that       question.        I know why he wouldn't answer the question. The reason is, they       didn't want to acknowledge even the possibility that there could be any       limits on a President's ability to misuse the national security clause       from section 232, even if it is on peanut butter.        So where does that leave us today? Well, I regret to inform my       colleagues that this complete abandonment of any pretense that national       security actually has to matter for the purposes of imposing these       tariffs--the pretense is gone with the hypothetical case of peanut       butter, but now it has arrived in reality, and it is a lot worse than       peanut butter.        This is a whole lot like the administration is pursuing section 232       tariffs on carbon dioxide emissions. It is under the auspices of the       Trump's 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum.        The U.S. Trade Rep has just proposed a preliminary agreement with the       European Union for a ``carbon intensity regime'' for steel and aluminum       trade. Here is how this would work: The new regime would use the threat       of ultra-high tariffs on the steel and aluminum from other countries as       a way to coerce them into implementing the administration's preferred       climate policies. It is beginning to look a lot like Christmas for       climate activists.        In short, the administration's proposal creates a new trade club for       countries with so-called green steel and aluminum, and even though they       won't admit it yet, they are using section 232 to justify this. For       countries to join this exclusive club, countries need to do three       things: They need to prove that their carbon emissions for steel and       aluminum fall below some level that the administration will conjure up;       second, they need to implement low and zero emission requirements for       steel and aluminum in government procurement; and thirdly, they need to       demonstrate that they are taking a hard line on trade remedies.        If a country qualifies for this club, congratulations--your steel and       aluminum will be subject to taxes on American consumers of between 0       and 25 percent, depending on your emissions. If you don't join the club       either because you can't qualify or you don't want to be saddled with       these costs,            [[Page S9724]]            why then, Americans will be taxed much more severely. For countries       outside the club that want to sell steel and aluminum, Americans will       have to pay 25 to 70 percent taxes on those purchases.        This idea has all kinds of very serious problems. First and foremost,       it is a completely unbridled overreach of authority by the executive       branch.        The Office of the U.S. Trade Rep is clearly asserting that that       Office has power to establish carbon emissions policy for the United       States and our trading partners. The last time I checked, even the EPA       doesn't have that authority. Where does the USTR come off with this?       They are also abusing the conditionally delegated national security       powers to enact this sweeping tariff policy, which is the       responsibility of Congress.        Second is that the economic harm from this proposal is going to       significantly compound the harm inflicted by the current 232 tariffs       that are already in place. First, it will result in a regime of       increasingly managed trade in steel and aluminum that will probably       benefit a handful of select producers and be a huge loss to everyone       else. It will hit many of our allies with increased tariffs, and that       will result in retaliation against American exports. It will devastate       American manufacturers and downstream users who rely on steel and       aluminum inputs for their business. Most importantly, it is going to       dramatically raise prices for consumers at a time when inflation is       still out of control.        What makes this whole scenario really particularly egregious is that       Congress never once voted on it--not once. Not one of my colleagues in       this body or the other had the opportunity to go on record either for       or against these or, in fact, had any meaningful say on this. Now, I       suspect some of my colleagues are perfectly OK with that.        As I warned my colleagues on both sides of the aisle years ago, this       abuse of section 232 will haunt us like a protectionist Frankenstein       unless Congress reins in executive abuse of this law.        Let me be clear. It is never appropriate for a President of either       party to use national security authorities to achieve unrelated policy       goals. To be dishonest about what is really going on here is not       acceptable.        Past Presidents used to understand this. Prior to President Trump,       the last time a U.S. President used section 232 to restrict trade was       back in 1986. Since the Trump administration, we have seen these       national security investigations, which is the precursor they need to       check their box so that they can impose these tariffs. We have seen       these investigations on uranium, titanium sponge, power transformer       components, vanadium, magnets, and then perhaps most absurdly,       automobiles and car parts, because I suppose if you drive a Toyota in       suburban Philadelphia, that makes you a threat to American national       security.        As George Will asked in a 2019 column lamenting executive overreach       under this very section of our trade law--he said:                   What's next, a tariff on peanut butter?              Well, it turns out we already have pretty high tariffs on peanut       butter, but now we are going to raise tariffs--taxes--even higher on       steel and aluminum and use trade law to enact climate policy while we       are at it.        It is well past time for Congress to reassert and to accept its       constitutional responsibility over trade and tariffs. We can do that by       requiring that the new section 232 tariffs, including the Biden       administration's carbon plan--that before they go into effect, they       have to be approved by Congress. What is wrong with that? The       Constitution says it is our responsibility. Why not require an up-or-      down vote in Congress before these taxes can go into force?        I have introduced bipartisan legislation that will do exactly that.       But if we fail to act, our constituents are going to keep on paying       ever more expensive prices.        I yield the floor.         Mr. President, on behalf of our friend and colleague,       Senator Barrasso, I object.
