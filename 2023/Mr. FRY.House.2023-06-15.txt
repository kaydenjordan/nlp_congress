 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 2 p.m. Friday, June 16, 2023; and  further, when the House adjourns on that day, it adjourn to meet on  Tuesday, June 20, 2023, when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour  debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth  and Mamie Spears, who are celebrating their 80th wedding anniversary  this year.   When they first met, Mr. Spears would walk several miles each way to  visit Mrs. Spears before asking for her hand in marriage. When they  married, they decided to call Effingham, South Carolina, in the Pee Dee  home, and have been there ever since.   The couple shares a strong faith in the Lord and has raised their  large family of 6 children, 13 grandchildren, and several great- grandchildren to do the same. They have always enjoyed fishing and  farming together and now live a quiet and peaceful life.   I extend my sincerest congratulations to Mr. and Mrs. Spears and wish  them many more joyful years together.                            ____________________
