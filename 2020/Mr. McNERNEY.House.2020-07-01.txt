 Mr. Speaker, in response to the attacks on September  11, my son joined the military, and I am now the proud father of a U.S.  Air Force veteran.   I know firsthand the anxiety felt by loved ones whose family members  are called on to fight for our Nation overseas.   As the father of a former soldier, I am disgusted by the allegation  that Russia placed a bounty on our troops, and as an American citizen,  I am outraged that the Commander in Chief of our military forces has  seemingly abandoned his responsibilities.   The President has an obligation to investigate these accusations and  to protect the lives of American soldiers, but, once again, all we are  hearing from this White House is denial and deflection.   We deserve to know the truth. When was the President informed and  what action has he taken to protect the lives of our troops? Americans  should settle for nothing less.                            ____________________
