 Thank you, Mr. President. This September, at the height  of yet another contentious campaign season, Senator Orrin Hatch  authored an op-ed for Time magazine which we should all read. Its theme  was reflected in the remarks he delivered today in his farewell address  to the U.S. Senate and to our country.   With his combination of eloquence and straightforwardness that has  enlightened this Chamber for more than four decades, our colleague from  Utah called upon all Americans to embrace, as he put it, ``the practice  of true tolerance: respecting others' beliefs even, or perhaps  especially, when they differ from our own.''   Senator Hatch reminded us that our system of government, crafted by  the Founders with great wisdom and understanding of human nature, only  works when we recognize ``that the majority of our political  disagreements are not matters of good versus evil but good versus  good,'' as he put it. He concluded his important essay with these  words: ``When we embrace these virtues fully, we can heal partisan  divisions, reinvigorate the public discourse and begin to realize the  full potential of American democracy.''   To our friend and colleague Orrin Hatch, those are not just words;  rather, they have represented his guiding philosophy throughout his 42  years of service in the U.S. Senate. They are why he is such an admired  statesman here in Washington, throughout our Nation, and around the  world.   They are why he is one of the most effective legislators of modern  times. As many of my colleagues have already commented, Senator Hatch's  record of having passed more legislation than any Senator alive today  is one that demonstrates his commitment to bridging the partisan  divides to achieve and advance the common good and to improve the lives  of Americans.   I have known and admired Orrin Hatch for nearly all of his time in  the Senate. I was on the staff of Senator Bill Cohen, who joined the  Senate in 1979, just 2 years after Senator Hatch. I saw from the start,  as a staffer observing Senator Hatch, that this gentleman from Utah was  brilliant, he was kind, and he was devoted to his duty to serve others.  He truly is one who leads by example.   Senator Hatch has placed careful consideration and compromise above  partisan politics, time and again. From the landmark legislation to  create the State Children's Health Insurance Program, during my very  first year in the Senate, to the recent tax reform law to strengthen  our economy and grow jobs, I have had the great pleasure to work with  this remarkable leader.   In fact, I remember my freshman year in the Senate when Senator Hatch  came to see me in my office. He told me about his plan to expand health  insurance for the unserved children of our country. He said he was  authoring the bill with Ted Kennedy, and I thought, well, that is a  surprising combination, but then I learned it was not; that he would  work together with his colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  accomplish the goals he set. He invited me to be one of the early  cosponsors of that bill, and I was so flattered that this senior Member  of the U.S. Senate would come to me, a mere freshman, and invite me to  join in cosponsoring such legislation that has made such a difference  for millions of American children.   In addition to his accomplishments as a legislator, Senator Hatch  holds another record that is unsurpassed. In 32 of his 42 years in the  Senate, he has been either the chairman or the ranking member of a  major committee. He is held in very high esteem by his colleagues. The  Presidential Medal of Freedom that he was awarded in November  acknowledges the gratitude the American people have for his many  contributions.   There is another side of Senator Orrin Hatch. He is also a  wonderfully talented musician and successful songwriter. The beautiful  song he cowrote for the 2005 Presidential Inauguration, called ``Heal  the Land,'' includes this line that describes the mission to which he  has devoted his life: ``Keep us ever on the path of liberty.''   Of all of his accomplishments, Senator Hatch is most proud of his  family, as he mentioned today. He credits their love and support as the  key to his success, and anyone who has met his wonderful wife Elaine  will have to concede that Orrin has a point. His wife of more than 60  years, their 6 children, 23 grandchildren, and 24 great-grandchildren,  by last count, have much to be proud of as well.   Orrin Hatch has compiled an extraordinary record on issues ranging  from tax reform, education, national defense, scientific research,  criminal justice, and healthcare. In fact, it is difficult to think of  an issue where he has not left his mark. He is a dedicated advocate of  our Senate traditions and a fierce defender of our Constitution. His  wide-ranging accomplishments are united by a commitment to always move  our country forward.   Orrin, our Nation is so grateful for your service, and I am so  grateful for your wise counsel, mentorship, and friendship over the  years. I offer my best wishes to you and to Elaine for many years to  come.   Thank you    Mr. President, In his two terms in the Senate, Bob  Corker established a strong reputation as a visionary leader who  offered innovative, commonsense solutions and developed an  extraordinary expertise in foreign policy. He has served the people of  Tennessee and of America with distinction and will always be a good  friend.   He certainly was well-prepared when he came to the Senate in 2007.  His early work on a charitable mission to Haiti inspired him to serve  his home community of Chattanooga as an advocate for the disadvantaged.  He built a successful business, providing jobs and opportunity to  others. As mayor of Chattanooga, he led initiatives to improve  education, reduce crime, grow the economy, and increase accountability  in government. Those experiences and accomplishments guided his work in  the Senate.   As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Corker has  been a powerful voice for U.S. global leadership and diplomacy, a  complement to his visits to more than 70 nations since he took office  in 2007. Although he has many accomplishments worth mentioning, I  believe his leadership this year in enacting the BUILD Act, which  modernizes American development finance to drive long-term economic  growth in the developing world, may be among his most lasting  contributions to American diplomacy and global security.   Senator Corker does not seek partisan advantage, but common ground.  He has been an extraordinary Senator who always did what he believed  was right. He has contributed greatly to our country and served his  State well. I commend my colleague, Senator Bob Corker, for his  outstanding service, and I thank him for his commitment, integrity, and  friendship.                            ____________________
