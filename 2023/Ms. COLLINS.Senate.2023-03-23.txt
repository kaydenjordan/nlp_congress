 Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Success  for Rural Students and Communities Act. This bipartisan bill would help  students living in rural areas achieve their higher education goals and  connect them with the economic opportunities in their communities. I  want to thank Senator Hassan for coleading this legislation with me.   Today, employers often require something more than a high school  diploma, such as a college degree, a skilled trade credential, or a  professional certificate. Yet, rural students may face barriers to  pursuing postsecondary education. Although rural students tend to  graduate from high school at about the same rate as their suburban  peers, they go on to enroll in college at a lower rate. Rural students  also tend to have lower full-time retention rates in postsecondary  education than their urban and suburban peers.   Maine's experience is consistent with these national trends.  According to census data, two out of three Maine schools are in rural  communities, and more than half of Maine students attend those schools.  More than 86 percent of Maine students graduate from  [[Page S935]]  high school, but only about 60 percent enroll in higher education right  away. Unfortunately, an even lower percentage of Maine students go on  to actually earn a degree, often leaving them with debt and without the  credential.   The Success for Rural Students and Communities Act would help by  encouraging the creation of community partnerships to promote  strategies that make it easier for rural students to access college and  career pathways. Community stakeholders--such as local school  districts, colleges and universities, regional economic development  entities, and community organizations--would join together to help  students and their families navigate higher education opportunities and  address barriers that too often stand in their way.   For example, many of these students are the first in their families  to attend college, so they may have a more difficult time finding  information about financial aid or selecting an educational program  that meets their needs. Partnerships could work together to expose  students to college campuses, courses, programs, and internships. They  could also focus on the enrollment and completion rates of rural  nontraditional students who did not pursue or complete postsecondary  education after high school but may find they need additional  credentials to pursue their chosen career path.   To help rural students gain the skills and experience needed to enter  and succeed in the workforce, partnerships would also be encouraged to  develop strategies for putting students on pathways into the high- demand jobs available in their communities. For example, partnerships  could test various work-based learning opportunities, including  apprenticeships, internships, and a sequence of courses on the path to  a certain skill or job. By helping to connect students with good-paying  jobs where they live, this bill would also ensure that rural  communities benefit from their students' success.   In Maine's Aroostook County, the Aroostook Aspirations Initiative is  using this model to help put students on pathways to academic and  career success in their communities. The initiative collaborates with  local community colleges and universities and with area businesses to  offer seminars that guide students throughout their college educations.  These seminars cover topics like time and stress management, budgeting  and finances, goal setting, and transitioning from college to career.  Certain seminars are focused on providing a more detailed look at  various career fields, such as nursing, education, criminal justice/law  enforcement, and banking/financial services. Students can also team up  with employers in the area through internships that give them  experience in the careers they wish to pursue.   Since 2012, the Aroostook Aspirations Initiative has served over 190  students, known as Gauvin Scholars, named for Ray and Sandy Gauvin, who  started the program. According to the initiative, their students have a  94-percent college graduation rate--well above the rate for their local  colleges overall--and more than 90 percent of Gauvin Scholars remain in  Aroostook County to live and work. Students who have participated in  the initiative say it has helped them develop networking skills and  make connections with employers throughout their communities.   The Success for Rural Students and Communities Act would support  dynamic programs such as the Aroostook Aspirations Initiative and help  students across the country who are seeking to achieve their college  and career dreams. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  bill.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Success  for Rural Students and Communities Act.
