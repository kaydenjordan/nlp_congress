 Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the harmful  impacts that President Biden's policies are having on the global supply  chain and consumer energy prices.   Americans today are facing the highest increase in costs for goods  and services in over a decade, with inflation now more than 5 percent  and rising. Similarly, our workforce participation rate is stagnant.  There are still 4.3 million fewer workers today than there were in  February of 2020. Nationally, there are more than 10 million job  openings--more than in any other year.   Record high job openings, coupled with rapidly increasing consumer  demand, is causing disruptions to global supply chains and further  increasing costs, increasing inflation. Rather than working to spur  economic growth, encourage workforce participation, and return our  economy to growth, as we saw with the last administration, President  Biden and the Democrats in Congress are focused on raising taxes and  enacting harmful, job-killing policies.   A prime example of what I am talking about--harmful policies being  pushed by the Biden administration--is the Green New Deal that will  hinder domestic energy production and increase the expense for every  American household.   Affordable and reliable energy is foundational to our economy,  quality of life, and national security. Across the country and in my  home State of North Dakota, we are seeing energy prices rise across the  board. Drivers are paying more for fuel at the pump, and homes and  businesses are prepared for record high heating costs as we go into the  winter months.   Because the cost of energy is built into virtually every product we  consume, we are seeing the inflationary pressures of higher prices on  goods across the entire economy, all the way to the dinner table. For  an energy-rich nation such as ours, the situation we find ourselves in  is unacceptable, and it is certainly avoidable.   In the first week of his administration, President Biden yanked the  permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline and halted new oil and gas leases  on Federal lands and offshore. President Biden's party has also called  for new taxes and fees on American energy production.   In addition, the Biden administration is promoting foreign energy  production as he stifles energy production here at home. He has allowed  completion of Russia's Nord Stream 2 Pipeline while calling on Russia,  Saudi Arabia, and other OPEC nations to increase more oil production.  Think about that. At a time when he is holding back energy production  in our country--oil production in our country, he is asking OPEC, Saudi  Arabia, and Russia to increase oil? It defies common sense. Think about  it.   If the Biden administration continues down this path, it will not  only cause further increased prices for consumers, but it will  undermine our energy independence and harm our national security by  forcing reliance on foreign energy production.   It is time we recognized the fact that our country's vast oil, gas,  and coal resources are a strategic national security and economic  asset. As we have seen over the past decade, greater U.S. energy  production has strengthened our national security and lowered energy  prices for hard-working American families.   The fact is, we should be focused on increasing economic growth,  encouraging workforce participation, and restoring our economy to its  prepandemic highs. Support for our domestic energy production is a  vital step to bringing down prices for consumers, and we need to do it.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
