 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table H.R. 3401, with the Senate amendment thereto, and  concur in the Senate amendment. This bipartisan bill passed the Senate  with only 6 nay votes from Democrats. There is overwhelming support for  this in the Senate, and I urge my colleagues to join them in passing  this bill today and sending it to the President.
