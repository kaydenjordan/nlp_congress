 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise to speak on the need to provide certainty to  blueberry producers who have been affected by freezes.   We all know how difficult the job of being a farmer can be. So much  of their success is completely dependent on things outside of their  control. This is particularly true when it comes to foul weather and  disasters. Farmers are at nature's mercy when it comes to these events.   This past year, a number of specialty crops across the country saw  significant losses caused by freezes, particularly blueberries in my  home State of Georgia. The statewide freeze event this past March  resulted in losses that exceed $140 million.   The last time a similar devastating freeze occurred, Congress was  able to come together and provide funding for those losses.   I thank the Appropriations' Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and  Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee chair, Sanford  Bishop, from Georgia, for all of his support already for this effort.   The underlying bill includes $10 million for disasters occurring in  2022 and report language expressing Congress' concerns about the impact  of extreme weather events on blueberry producers. However, that $10  million will not be enough to assist with the damages from disasters.  Chairman Bishop has committed to continue working on this issue and to  ensure adequate funding is available to blueberry and other producers  affected by freezes in 2022.   Mr. Chair, I hope we can continue to demonstrate Congress' commitment  to not only providing relief when farmers need it the most but also  fixing the larger issue for good so we no longer need to return to this  after future freezes.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the  inspiring career of Mr. Bill Edwards, who is a native resident of  Savannah, Georgia.   After graduating from Groves High School, Bill went on to attend both  the University of Mississippi and Armstrong Atlantic State University,  completing his education with a master's in the arts and  communications.   After serving in his high school JROTC, he furthered his interest in  the Army by serving in the Army ROTC at Ole Miss and eventually joining  the U.S. Army Signal Corps. He continued this career until he reached  the rank of captain in a military intelligence unit in Savannah. Aside  from his military career, Bill was blessed with a loving wife and seven  grandchildren, whom he adores.   Once he left the service, Bill focused his energy into a successful  career in radio broadcasting, eventually becoming host of what is now  ``AM Savannah'' on News Radio. Bill's commitment was rewarded when he  was recognized by the Associated Press for sportscasting excellence and  when he won the honor of Savannah's Favorite Talk Station for 3 years  in a row.    I am so grateful for Bill Edwards and his tireless commitment to  improving his community. Bill is an outstanding Georgian, and I thank  him for all he does for his community.                            ____________________
