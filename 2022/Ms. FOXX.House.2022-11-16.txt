 Mr. Speaker, this week we celebrate the eighth annual  National Apprenticeship Week. It is the perfect time to reflect on what  is and what isn't working in our Nation's workforce development  programs.   There are more than 10 million unfilled jobs in this country and  nearly 6 million unemployed individuals. There is clearly a crack in  the education-to-workforce pipeline.   The best way to address our country's skills gap and worker shortage  is to promote workforce development programs that actually work.   I have been encouraged to see many businesses coming up with their  own workforce development programs. Time and again, employer-led  programs prove to produce the best results.   More industries are embracing apprenticeships as a solution for  upskilling and re-skilling workers. As employers realize that  baccalaureate degrees do not always prepare workers to fill needed  roles, more alternative pathways will be needed.   Many businesses are already removing unnecessary degree requirements  and are, instead, replacing them with apprenticeship programs. This is  a great development for our country and our workforce.   Americans should not have to take out mountains of crushing student  loan debt to study a subject that has nothing to do with their intended  career, only to have to start from scratch once they enter the  workforce.   For too long, the college-for-all mentality has pushed young people  into obtaining a baccalaureate degree, regardless of their intended  career. This mentality is slowly shifting, and our country will be  better off for it.   Now that more young people are turning to apprenticeships, it is  important to ensure that there are high-quality programs available.  [[Page H8511]]    We need apprenticeship programs that prepare workers for the open  positions today, not the positions that were open yesterday. We need  cutting-edge programs. One-size-fits-all, Washington-knows-best models  are not the answer.   While President Biden touts his support for apprenticeships, his  cancellation of employer-led apprenticeship programs tell a different  story. President Biden supports only apprenticeships he can control.   Since terminating employer-led apprenticeship programs, the Biden  administration has doubled down on support for the registered  apprenticeship model.   Because this system, founded in 1937, has not been substantially  updated in eight decades, it is not easily adapted for innovative  industries. Using this model to expand and modernize apprenticeships  would be like starting on a journey on an already-leaking ship. We can  push as hard as we want, but in the end, the vessel can only take us so  far before we sink.   It is time for a new system, one with employers in the driver's seat.  Job creators know the tools workers need to be successful. Washington  swamp dwellers, on the other hand, are clueless.                                time  1015    Why the Biden administration believes bureaucrats in Washington are  more equipped to run apprenticeship programs than those on the ground  is beyond me. It is no surprise that the vast majority of successful  and thriving apprenticeship programs are led by private industry.   Take Kentucky FAME, for example. The Kentucky Federation for Advanced  Manufacturing Education is a partnership of regional manufacturers that  creates a pipeline of highly skilled workers through an earn and learn  program. By the time participants are done with this program, they will  have an associate's degree, an advanced manufacturing technician  credential, and years of work experience, all with no student loan  debt.   This organization operates in 12 States and has an 85 percent  employment placement rate. This is an excellent workforce development  model that other industries can learn from.   The more employers embrace apprenticeships, the better off our  economy will be. The best way for our workforce to thrive is for the  Federal Government to get out of the way and for industry leaders to  lead the way.   So, for this National Apprenticeship Week, let's tell the Biden  administration to stop putting special interests ahead of workers;  let's recommit ourselves to empowering job creators to provide their  own solutions; and let's support those jobseekers who want an  opportunity to learn and earn at the same time.                            ____________________
