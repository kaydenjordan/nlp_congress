 Mr. President, our amendment was about ensuring that the  second step in improving the health care system for our constituents  was done in a thoughtful way. We now have assurances from leadership  that certainly is their intent and that this date is not a date that is  set in stone. In fact, it is the earliest we could do it, but it could  take longer. We believe that it might.   With that, we would like to withdraw the amendment, with assurances  that we will have this time to be able to put together something that  will, in fact, ensure that our constituents can better deal with the  broken health care system.
