 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, we can all agree that the climate is changing and we  need to take positive steps to address it. However, I oppose H.R. 9  because it is just a messaging bill that is dead on arrival in the  Senate and that the President will veto.   I oppose H.R. 9 because, among other problems, it attempts to codify  President Obama's unrealistic and unilaterally determined greenhouse  gas reduction pledge under the Paris Agreement. This pledge was  submitted on behalf of the United States without any notification,  consultation, or role for Congress.   At a recent hearing, when we asked whether any of the witnesses  agreed that President Obama should have submitted the Paris Agreement  to the  [[Page H3364]]  Senate for ratification, all four witnesses, including the three  Democrat witnesses, agreed it should have been submitted to the Senate.   In addition to not involving Congress, the Obama administration also  did not seek meaningful input from private-sector stakeholders, such as  energy companies.   Not only that, the administration provided no cost-benefit analysis  or economic justification to rationalize its pledge--its arbitrary  pledge--to cut greenhouse gases by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels  by 2025.   A recent study by the Chamber of Commerce estimates it could cost  U.S. GDP $250 billion and 2.7 million jobs by 2025. By 2040, it could  cost the United States economy $3 trillion and 6.5 million industrial  sector jobs.   But the good news is that, even before the United States entered the  Paris Agreement, the United States started making progress to  significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. According to the  EPA, from 1990 to 2014, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions per GDP declined  by 40 percent, and we are at the lowest emissions levels since 2000.   In addition, over the last decade, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions have  decreased by 14 percent, Mr. Chairman, while China's emissions doubled.  Sadly, China, the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, under this  agreement, will continue to increase its emissions through 2030 under  its unenforceable Paris Agreement pledge.   Other major greenhouse gas emitters, like Russia, have signed the  Paris Agreement but have not ratified it.   Instead of doubling down on a pledge that Congress had no role in  setting that will have a potentially catastrophic impact on the United  States economy and which will do nothing, Mr. Chairman, to address  China and other countries' growing emissions, we should work on  bipartisan legislation to boost research, advance technologies, promote  innovation, and develop real solutions.   That is why I offered an amendment calling for bipartisan solutions  to address this challenge, providing a meaningful role for Congress  regarding the Paris Agreement, and requiring our greenhouse gas  reduction commitments to undergo a rigorous cost-benefit analysis.  Sadly, this amendment failed by a party-line vote in the committee and  the Rules Committee, denying it from even being debated on this House  floor.   So for that, Mr. Chairman, and many other reasons, I oppose H.R. 9,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), a member of the  Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Wright), a member of the  Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Kevin Hern), a member of the Natural  Resources Committee.    Mr. Chairman, let me first say to my good friend from New  Jersey that there are many of us on this side of the aisle who agree  the climate is changing, and I think it is a question of how we get  there and the solutions and innovation and technology.   I hope that--it will not move forward; it will be, obviously,  vetoed--maybe we can work together in a bipartisan way on something  that can reduce emissions using innovation technology. I personally  think nuclear power should be examined as well.   With that, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New  York (Mr. Zeldin), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.                                time  1515     Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meuser).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley), who is a member of the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I just want to start off by saying that I respect the  chairman. I respect his point of view, and I respect the arguments that  have been made on this floor. I believe they are genuine. I believe  that most Members of this Chamber agree that climate change is real and  that climate change presents a risk.   I sat down with a scientist from NASA, which is in my home State. We  talked about the data. He said: I am not a policymaker. Here is the  data. Here is what is going to happen if we do nothing.   But I think, as the majority leader said, H.R. 9 does not solve this  problem.   You have heard from my side of the aisle very genuine arguments about  the cost to the economy, the fact that we have reduced our emissions  but countries like China and India have doubled theirs. We want to get  something done to solve this crisis, and I admit it is a crisis.   This bill is a messaging bill. It is a feel-good bill. It won't get  through the Senate. It will be vetoed by the White House. I submit to  all those listening to this debate that when that happens, we work on  something real, that is bipartisan.   We heard the ranking member from the new House Select Committee on  the Climate Crisis say that he found out about this bill in the press.  That is no way to lead a bipartisan effort in the Congress.   So when this fails, and it will, I submit we go back to the drawing  board and do things that we know do work, and that is let's work on  innovation, clean energy technologies, and, yes, nuclear power.   We are showing we are being a leader reducing our emissions while  other countries are not. Let's lead by example. Let's come back with  some real legislation that is going to make a difference, reduce  emissions, and get us out of this crisis.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I will close once the gentleman yields back.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, let me first say, like everyone in this  Chamber, I support human rights and climate justice, but this amendment  really does nothing to reduce our emissions. We should debate  bipartisan solutions, such as boosting research, advancing  technologies, and promoting innovation.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me first say, again, I agree with the  premise of this amendment. I met today with U.N. officials on the  refugee crisis. I have been to the camps in Jordan and Turkey, so I  agree with the premise of this amendment. But, again, it does nothing  to reduce our emissions.   We should be debating, I think, bipartisan solutions, such as  boosting research, technology, and innovation.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I will close after the gentlewoman yields  back.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me first commend my colleague, the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania, for quoting me. I do think we should  lead as a nation in the world. I support the United States leading the  world on the international challenges we face. But, again, this  amendment has nothing to do with reducing our emissions.   We should be a leader on the bipartisan approach to solutions to this  crisis, like boosting research, innovation, and technologies.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I will close after the gentlewoman closes.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me first say, I agree with the premise  of this amendment. Addressing sea level rise is a serious issue as well  as saltwater intrusion and flooding.   I am a member of the House Oceans Caucus, but, again, it does not  reduce our emissions. It is not, to me, germane to the underlying bill.   I think we should debate, once again, bipartisan solutions on  boosting research, advancing technologies, and promoting innovation.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, let me say first to the gentleman from  California, that I appreciate the Californians and the California tech  companies expanding to my home city of Austin, Texas, but I find this  amendment contrary to the premise of this bill, which prohibits  withdrawing from the U.S. Paris Agreement. In fact, it withdraws  funding.   So for that reason, I am in opposition to it, and, again, I think, as  the gentleman stated, we should be advancing--if this bill doesn't make  it through the Senate, doesn't get signed into law--advancing the clean  energy technologies I think both of our States want to advance.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to this  amendment, but I am not opposed to this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I will close once the gentleman from New  Jersey yields back.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as I stated, I am not opposed to this  amendment. I think the international community should reduce emissions.  I think the issue is that the international community is not living up  to the expectations of this agreement, particularly China and India.  While we have reduced emissions by 14 percent, they have doubled their  emissions, and they have until 2030 to reduce any emissions. That is  why fundamentally I think this is a flawed agreement.   But I am not opposed to an international consensus to reduce  emissions. I don't think this is the right way to do it.  [[Page H3388]]    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I strongly support this amendment. It has  been the thrust of our argument.   I support the U.S. Constitution Article I authority. This process  circumvented that. I do believe it required Senate ratification. But  not only that, the President didn't even consult with the Congress.  There was not one hearing on this during the Obama administration and  therefore circumventing the American people. For that reason, I  strongly support this amendment.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Chair, let me just say first, we all recognize the  oceans' ecosystems, 70 percent of the Earth's surface. I am a member of  the Ocean Caucus.   This really has nothing to do with reducing our emissions. It is  simply a finding. We ought to be focused on bipartisan solutions and  boosting research, advancing technologies, and promoting innovation.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1745     Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Chair, I will close once the gentlewoman yields  back.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, we all agree with the premise of this  amendment--food security, ending hunger. Again, this amendment does  nothing to reduce our emissions. We need to debate bipartisan  solutions, such as boosting research, advancing technologies, and  promoting innovation.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Chair, I will close once the gentleman has yielded  back.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, again, I agree with the premise of this  amendment, but it does not address reducing emissions. We should debate  bipartisan solutions, as I stated in the past.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I agree with the premise that the world  looks to the United States as a leader. Unfortunately, other countries  are not leading--China and India, for instance.   This amendment, again, does not address reducing emissions. We need  to look at leading as a nation on technology, innovation, and  bipartisan solutions.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I will close once the gentlewoman yields  back.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, again, I agree with the premise of this  amendment. Clean energy technologies are important in my hometown of  Austin.   We have a lot of clean energy in Irvine, California, a lot of clean  energy, a lot of collaboration between our two States, but this is  simply a finding and does not reduce our emissions.   I again would urge, since I do not think this will become law, that  we work on a bipartisan solution, talking explicitly about what you are  talking about. We can pass these bills out of the House; we can pass  them out of the Senate; and if we can do it bipartisanly, we can get it  signed into law.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I will close once the gentlewoman yields  back.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, again, I agree with the premise of this  amendment. Drought conditions, water scarcity are important in, I know,  the gentlewoman's home State, certainly important in my home State of  Texas. It will be--as climate change advances, the entire continent of  Africa will face drought conditions.   But, again, this is a finding. It doesn't, in and of itself, reduce  the emissions, and I would again urge bipartisan solutions to advancing  technologies and promoting innovation.  [[Page H3397]]    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
