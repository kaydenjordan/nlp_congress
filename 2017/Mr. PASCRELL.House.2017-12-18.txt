 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  United States Fire Administration, the Assistance to Firefighters Grant  (AFG) program, the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response  (SAFER) Grant program, and the Fire Prevention and Safety programs.   As an original author of these critical grant programs, I understand  their importance to the firefighting community. It is often local  firefighters who are the first on the scene before help from elsewhere  can arrive. Our first responders provide immediate assistance to those  in need; and these grants enable local firefighters across our nation  to receive the training and equipment necessary to fulfill this  important mission.   The proper training and equipment provided to local firefighters by  the AFG and SAFER grant programs and Fire Prevention and Safety  programs can often mean the difference between life and death.   It is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, that it took so long for the House to  act on reauthorizing these important federal grants. We have had nearly  an entire year for the Majority to introduce a bill, have it considered  in committee, and see action on the House floor. Or simply, we could  have just considered S. 829, which passed the Senate by unanimous  consent on August 2, 2017.   I even introduced H.R. 3881, a House version of the Senate-passed  legislation and co-led a letter with 153 members of this House to show  support for reauthorizing these grant programs. However, no action was  taken to reauthorize these critical grant programs until today.   The bill before us today makes meaningful and technical changes to  the administration of these grant programs. One important change this  bill makes, that I know is significant to my home state of New Jersey  and fire departments across the nation, is permitting the use of these  grants to permit the use of grants to change the status of part-time or  paid-on-call firefighters to full-time firefighters.   However, unlike the Senate bill, the bill before us today continues  to have a dreadful sunset clause. Typically, the Congress sunsets  programs to ensure there is an opportunity to review the importance of  a program's continuation and that there is no waste, fraud, or abuse.  Since the establishment of these fire programs, there have been no  major issues with waste, fraud, or abuse--and we certainly cannot  dispute the major benefits these programs provide. So it is a wonder  why some are insisting on sunsetting these critical grant programs in  this bill.   This sunset causes needless anxiety, which many have been feeling  this year as the House is only now reauthorizing these programs just  two weeks before they're set to expire. This is a situation where  states and localities and tens of thousands of fire departments across  our nation are left wondering about the future of critical funding they  rely on to keep their communities safe. This sunset is unnecessary and  we should eliminate it.   It is not an understatement to say that the funding provided by these  programs has saved countless lives. The federal resources these grants  have provided fire departments with the equipment, training and  staffing needed to swiftly respond to over 30 million calls annually.  These programs also have improved firefighters' response capabilities  and prevented numerous fires through safety programs targeted toward  high-risk populations.   Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues Congressman Peter King,  Steny Hoyer and Dave Reichert as co-chairs of the Congressional Fire  Services Caucus and for their tireless work on behalf of our nation's  fire service.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues in this Chamber  to support the reauthorization of these critical grant programs.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4661.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
