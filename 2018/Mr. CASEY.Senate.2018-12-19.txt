 Mr. President, I rise to join in the remarks of the  Senator from West Virginia, who worked very hard to make sure we had a  resolution that would allow us to direct the Senate legal counsel to  intervene in the lawsuit.   Of course, the lawsuit is beyond the district court. We await what  might happen in an appellate court. But the best way for anyone in this  body to express their disagreement with the removal of the protections  for those who might have a preexisting condition, if you believe that  those protections should remain the law of the land as they are now,  then you should, as a Member of the House or the Senate--even if you  wanted to be in favor and voted in favor of repealing the Affordable  Care Act, you could still argue that in the interest of preserving  those protections, without question, in the interest of providing  certainty to not just tens of millions of Americans but many millions  more than that who have these protections in law right now--did not  have those protections before the Affordable Care Act--if that is what  you believe, you could very easily say: Let's preserve them and make a  different argument in this court case, file a brief, and try to  intervene, as you could in this case.   But for some reason around here, some people think they can have it  both ways. They do television ads and campaigns or give speeches back  home saying: Oh, don't worry, I want to protect and I want to preserve  the protections for preexisting conditions, but at the same time do  nothing about it.   There is no third way here. You are either in favor of those  protections, maintaining in law the protections for those who have a  preexisting condition, or you are not. You are either for that or you  are not. If you are for it, I think you are dutybound to take action to  preserve it.   Right now, these protections are at risk. They will be in greater  jeopardy if  [[Page S7849]]  an appellate court were to agree with the district court. So I think  folks here have to make a decision: You are either for maintaining  these protections, which carries with it a responsibility to take  action to make sure that those protections are in law--are kept in law,  remain a part of our law--or you have to go to the other side, which is  you throw up your hands and say: Either I am not for those protections  or I am not going to do anything about it.   So you have to take action or not. I think that is true of people in  both parties and both Chambers, but when you consider what is at stake  in a State like Pennsylvania, we have a huge portion of our  population--more than 3 million people--who live in rural communities.  With 67 counties in Pennsylvania, 48 of them are rural.   A couple years after the Affordable Care Act passed we saw in  Pennsylvania--this is only maybe 2 years ago now, and I am sure the  numbers haven't changed that much--we had about 280,000 people who got  their healthcare through the Affordable Care Act but lived in those 48  rural counties. Of the roughly 280,000 who got coverage, 180,000 were  in rural communities. Lots of folks in rural areas are worried about  the protections they got because they were benefited by Medicaid  expansion, and the balance of those got their healthcare through the  exchanges.   If you are in a rural community and you got healthcare most recently  through the exchanges or even if you had healthcare prior to 2010 or  prior to the last several years, you have protections that you didn't  have before. Of course, in rural communities in Pennsylvania, you have  even higher incidents in many cases of those who have an opioid  problem. These healthcare decisions, these healthcare votes that we  cast, these healthcare court cases have even greater significance in  rural communities--whether it is preexisting condition protections,  whether it is having the coverage of Medicaid that allows you to get  treatment and services for an opioid problem, or whether you are just  dependent on healthcare because of your own health or that of a family  member, especially children.   I would just make a couple more points because I know we are limited  in time. Here is some data on the impact of the Affordable Care Act and  what could happen in some communities in a State like Pennsylvania that  have a high significant rural population.   We are told in one study that since 2010, 83 percent of rural  hospitals have closed, and 90 percent of these rural hospitals that  closed have been in States that have not--or have not as of that time  period--expanded Medicaid when the hospital closed. So we are talking  about a court case that would, in essence, invalidate the Affordable  Care Act. We are talking about not just healthcare loss or coverage  loss in a rural community, we are talking about job loss and  devastation.   In our State, we have something on the order of 25 rural counties  where the No. 1 or No. 2 employer is a hospital. If that hospital is  badly undermined, if they can't make the margins work because of cuts  to Medicaid or the elimination of Medicaid expansion, as some around  here want to do--not just cut it but eliminate it--you are going to  have economic devastation in those communities in addition to  healthcare devastation.   The staff of the Joint Economic Committee has estimated that if the  Affordable Care Act were struck down, which is the effect of this  Federal court case of just last week, 17 million people would lose  coverage next year--17 million people in just 1 year.   What we should be doing around here, in addition to urging a court-- or any court--not to strike it down, is to have bipartisan hearings for  a long time on lots of ideas. We need at least weeks of that, if not  longer. If there is one area or one place of consensus around here, it  is that healthcare costs for too many Americans are too high. We have  to get costs down, and people in both parties have a lot of work to do  on that.   The second thing we hear back home and across the country is  prescription drug costs especially are too high for too many families.  Neither party has done enough on that issue. We have to get those down  as well.   If we focus on the priorities of most Americans, which is not  repealing this law; it is not throwing out or ending Medicaid  expansion, which helps with the opioid crisis and helps a lot of our  rural communities especially--what we would do is focus on the  priorities of the American people: get the cost of healthcare down, get  the cost of prescription drug costs down, and deal with any other  issues that have been brought to the table for those who care about  improving our healthcare system.   If the American people see only a battle about one side wanting  repeal and the other side working every day to try to stop that, we are  not going to advance very far on their agenda. Their agenda is not that  fight. Their agenda is to protect the gains we have, make sure people  don't lose coverage, and make sure a much larger portion of the  population--virtually everyone you know--doesn't lose protections that  were put into law a couple of years ago.   If we do that and focus on those priorities, I think the American  people will believe we are beginning to do our job in both parties on  healthcare. The worst thing we can do is go back to the days when  someone with a preexisting condition was denied coverage or was charged  a higher rate because of that preexisting condition. We don't want to  go back to those dark days. We should insist that we never reverse  course on this issue.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my colleague  Senator Orrin Hatch and his more than 40 years of public service. Only  five U.S. Senators have served longer than Senator Hatch, and he is one  of the few who have served as President Pro Tempore of the Senate, an  honor given to the longest serving Member of the majority party. Some  may not know this, but Orrin Hatch was born and raised in Pittsburgh,  PA. He attended the University of Pittsburgh Law School and practiced  law in the city before moving to Utah years before his election to the  Senate.   Senator Hatch has too many legislative accomplishments to list, but I  will focus on one that is so important to our family, the Children's  Health Insurance Program. Nelson Mandela once said, ``There can be no  keener revelation of a society's soul than the way in which it treats  its children.'' The Children's Health Insurance program, known by the  acronym CHIP, is a prime example of when our Nation took an important  step forward to care for our children. Senator Hatch worked with our  former colleague Senator Ted Kennedy and others to ensure that children  from low-income families who were not eligible for Medicaid had access  to healthcare. CHIP holds a special place in my heart as well because  my father, Governor Robert P. Casey, signed into law one of the first  children's health insurance programs in the Nation in 1992.  Pennsylvania's CHIP served as the model for the national program that  today provides healthcare to nearly 10 million children.   We will miss Senator Hatch here, but he leaves the Senate knowing  that his work has positively impacted the lives of millions of  Americans. We wish Senator Orrin Hatch well as he returns to Utah.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my  colleague, Senator Bill Nelson, who will leave the Senate after 18  years of service in the Senate and over 40 years as a public official  in the State of Florida.   Abigail Adams once asked, ``If we do not lay out ourselves in the  service of mankind whom should we serve?'' Throughout his career,  Senator Nelson worked to make life better for the people of Florida and  the United States.   Florida and Pennsylvania share a distinction in having among the  largest percentage of seniors in their States and therefore millions of  Medicare beneficiaries. Through his work on the Finance Committee,  Senator Nelson pushed to guarantee that Medicare provided quality care  to our seniors and people with disabilities. Senator Nelson worked  every day to ensure that our government kept the original promise  President Johnson made in 1965 to guarantee quality, affordable  healthcare for beneficiaries.   Florida has a coastline of 1,350 miles, and Bill Nelson understood  that the beaches and the oceans needed to be protected from offshore  drilling and pollution. Current and future generations of Floridians  and others who visit the State will enjoy the benefits of Senator  Nelson's work in fighting to maintain and enhance those protections.   Senator Nelson has also been a leader in the areas of science and  space. As a former astronaut who journeyed into space in 1986 on the  space shuttle Columbia, Senator Nelson understood the importance of  exploration and discovery and never stopped imagining what is possible.   We will miss Senator Nelson in this Chamber, and we thank him for his  decades of service on behalf of the people of Florida and our Nation.  We have no doubt that he will continue to find ways to make a  difference and serve our country in the years ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my  colleague, Senator Jeff Flake. First in the House of Representatives  and later in the U.S. Senate, Jeff Flake has served the people of  Arizona and the Nation for over 15 years.   Senator Flake has a strong record of supporting democracy at home and  abroad, finding areas of compromise on difficult issues like  immigration reform and making sure our Nation keeps its promise to  veterans. Senator Flake has been a leader on immigration reform  efforts, and he has worked tirelessly to find a path forward to address  the needs of our immigration system. In 2013, Senator Flake was one of  the lead authors of bipartisan immigration reform legislation that  would have modernized our immigration system, secured our borders, and  provided a tough but fair path to citizenship for undocumented  immigrants in our country. Through his position in the Senate Committee  on Foreign Relations, Senator Flake has advocated for policies  [[Page S7915]]  that promote democracy, economic growth, and quality of life  improvements for people around the world. Here at home, Senator Flake  has helped veterans in Arizona receive assistance and recognition from  the Federal Government.   In recent years, Jeff Flake has been a leading voice in speaking up  for the institution of the Senate and its role as part of a coequal  branch of government with the executive' branch. He has sought to hold  Presidents of both parties accountable as a Member of the Senate.   We will miss Senator Flake in the Senate next year, but I have no  doubt that he will continue to find ways to serve his State and our  Nation in the years ahead. We wish him well in that endeavor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my colleague  Senator Bob Corker, who will be retiring from the Senate this year.  Senator Corker and I were both elected in 2006. He was the only  Republican in a class of 10 new Senators.   Through his years of service on the Foreign Relations Committee, most  recently as its chairman, Bob Corker worked to build a better world.  For example, Senator Corker worked with me and several of his  Republican colleagues on global food security. Senator Corker worked  with Senator Isakson and me to pass the Global Food Security Act in  2016. This bill, first introduced by Senator Lugar of Indiana in 2008,  allowed us to take a more strategic approach to foreign assistance and  how we help to combat poverty and hunger around the world. Senator  Corker's work played an important role in creating a better future for  millions around the world.   As he retires from the Senate, we thank Bob Corker for his years of  service and his commitment to the idea that America should be a force  for good in the world.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my  colleague, Claire McCaskill. Claire and I came to the Senate together  in January 2007, and she has served the people of Missouri and the  United States with distinction for the past 12 years.   Former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis once remarked, ``Sunlight  is said to be the best of disinfectants.'' When I consider Claire's  service and her work on both the Special Committee on Aging and the  Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, I am reminded of  Justice Brandeis's words. Senator McCaskill was tireless in her efforts  to shed light on policies and practices that hurt seniors, veterans,  and the vulnerable in our Nation.   For example, Senator McCaskill has been a strong advocate of  empowering veterans, giving them a voice, and holding the VA  accountable through the Veterans' Customer Satisfaction Program she  designed. This program allows veterans to provide anonymous feedback on  their healthcare treatment at VA facilities across the country.   Senator McCaskill has also been a champion for seniors. She used her  position on the Special Committee on Aging to investigate fraudulent  Medicare bills and an IRS-impersonation scheme to ensure seniors have  access to quality healthcare and a financially stable retirement. I had  the honor of succeeding her as ranking member of the Aging Committee  and have worked to continue her focus on protecting seniors from scam  artists.   Finally, Senator McCaskill's work on the Victims Protection Act of  2014 is a shining example of her commitment to protecting the wellbeing  of our servicemembers who have endured the horror of sexual assault in  the military. When many in power choose to stand down, Claire stands up  for survivors.   The Senate, and especially the class of 2006, will miss Senator  Claire McCaskill in this Chamber, but I have no doubt that she will  find a way to use her extraordinary skills to help those who are  powerless.   Thank you, Claire, for your years of public service.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to speak about my colleague,  Senator Dean Heller, who will leave the Senate at the end of this year  after more than a decade of combined service in the House of  Representatives and the Senate.   During this time, Dean Heller has worked to guarantee that our  veterans have what they need when they return home. As a member of the  Veterans Affairs Committee, Senator Heller worked to increase access to  care for veterans and fought to guarantee that the Veterans  Administration provides high-quality services across Nevada's  widespread rural communities. I worked with Senator Heller to reduce  the VA disability claims backlog and improve accountability at the  Veterans Administration.   We thank Senator Heller for his service in the Senate and know he  will continue to find ways to serve the people of Nevada.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my  colleague, Senator Joe Donnelly, who will leave the Senate at the end  of this year. During his time in the U.S. Senate, Senator Donnelly has  worked tirelessly for our seniors, our servicemembers and middle-class  families in Indiana and across our country.   I have had the pleasure of serving beside Senator Donnelly on the  Special Committee on Aging, where I have witnessed his dedication to  protecting the rights of older Americans. Senator Donnelly has worked  to protect Medicare, to guarantee senior citizens' healthcare options  are not restricted.   Senator Donnelly and I also served together on the Senate Committee  on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry where he introduced the Federal  Water Quality Protection Act to protect the interest of our farmers by  requiring the EPA to consult with them to ensure every American has  access to clean water.   Senator Donnelly's dedication to our servicemen and women was second  to none. The first bill he introduced as a U.S. Senator, the Sexton  Act, has improved mental health services by requiring all Active  servicemembers receive a yearly mental health screening.   I will miss working with Joe Donnelly in the next Congress, but I am  certain he will continue to find a way to serve the people of Indiana  and our Nation in the years ahead. We wish him well in those endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my  colleague, Senator Heidi Heitkamp, who will be leaving the Senate at  the end of this year. During her time in the U.S. Senate, Heidi never  failed to remind us that we are blessed to serve here, to help others,  and move our Nation forward.   As a member of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry,  Senator Heitkamp worked tirelessly on the farm bill, making sure it  included provisions such as crop insurance to assure continuity of the  quality American agricultural products.   Through her service on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs  Committee, Senator Heitkamp worked across the aisle, delivering  bipartisan housing finance legislation that protects Americans from  financial crises and preserves 30-year fixed mortgage rates.   Through her work on the Indian Affairs Committee, Senator Heitkamp  has been a champion for Native American and women's rights. She created  a commission on Native children to address many of the challenges faced  by Native American communities, including access to healthcare and  education. In order to combat human trafficking and violence against  women, Senator Heitkamp introduced Savanna's Act to create a platform  for data collection and sharing for best-practice response protocols.   Through her work on the Small Business and Entrepreneurship  Committee, Senator Heitkamp promoted investing in small business to  boost the American economy. One example is the SEED Act, which she  introduced to increase early stage investment to foster the growth of  small businesses and startups.  [[Page S7916]]    Senators are often described as workhorses or showhorses. Without  question, Senator Heitkamp is a workhorse, and she leaves behind a  legacy of accomplishment that will continue to benefit the people of  North Dakota and all Americans for many years to come. We thank her for  her service, and we wish her well.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to remember Judge  Richard P. Conaboy, who served the people of Lackawanna County and the  Middle District of Pennsylvania as a judge for over five decades.   Judge Conaboy was born and raised in Scranton, PA. After graduating  from the University of Scranton in 1945, he served in the Army Air  Force and became a sergeant before his discharge in 1947. He earned a  law degree from Catholic University in 1950 and practiced law in  Scranton for 12 years until he was appointed to be a judge on the  Lackawanna County Court of Common Pleas in 1962. He served on this  court with distinction for 17 years. Judge Conaboy was nominated to the  Federal bench by President Jimmy Carter and confirmed by the Senate in  1979. He went on to serve the Middle District of Pennsylvania for  nearly four decades.   Judge Conaboy also served as chairman of the U.S. Sentencing  Commission from 1994 to 1998. Notably, during his tenure, Judge Conaboy  raised concerns about Congress's decision to address the crack cocaine  epidemic by significantly enhancing penalties for crack, but not  powder, cocaine, creating a sentencing disparity that he believed was  having a profound disproportionate impact on minority communities. His  opposition to this disparity and his dedication to fairness in  sentencing presaged Congress's passage of the Fair Sentencing Act in  2010 and have continued to influence efforts to reform Federal  sentencing laws.   Judge Conaboy was known for his legal acumen, as well as his  humility, patience, and fairness. Members of the  [[Page S7923]]  Lackawanna County legal community have recalled his unique ability to  resolve disputes and bring parties to the table with his sense of humor  and deep respect for all people appearing before him. He worked  tirelessly on behalf of the people of the Middle District, and he  continued to hear matters before the court until his death.   Judge Conaboy is survived by his wife of 68 years, Marion, as well as  their 12 children, 48 grandchildren, and 49 great- grandchildren.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and  career of U.S. District Court Judge William J. Nealon.   Appointed to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of  Pennsylvania by President John F. Kennedy in 1962, Judge Nealon became  the longest serving Federal District Court judge in U.S. history on  August 28, 2018.   Born and raised in Scranton, PA, Judge Nealon attended Miami  University until he put his education on hold to join the Marine Corps  during World War II. He served his country from 1942 to 1945, and when  he returned, he earned his bachelor's degree from Villanova University  and his law degree from Catholic University.   Judge Nealon distinguished himself early on in the practice of law.  In 1960, less than a decade after joining the Pennsylvania bar, he was  appointed to the Lackawanna County Court of Common Pleas, the youngest  such judge in the Commonwealth. Less than 3 years later, on December  13, 1962, President Kennedy appointed him to the U.S. District Court  for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, and Judge Nealon became the  youngest Federal District Court judge in the country. He went on to  serve in this role for over 55 years.   Judge Nealon was a brilliant jurist, committed to fairness and  ``equal justice under law'' in every case for every party who appeared  in his courtroom. He will be remembered for his work ethic and  commitment to his family. In addition to leaving behind a legacy of  judicial and community service, Judge Nealon is survived by his wife of  70 years, Jean, 5 of their 10 children, 30 grandchildren, 26 great- grandchildren, and numerous nieces and nephews.   The Federal courthouse in Scranton, which bears his name, will ensure  that his decades of service to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and our  country will continue to inspire new generations of public  servants.                            ____________________
