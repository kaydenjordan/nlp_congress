 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, as I have done from the time he was  nominated and as I will continue to do until he is confirmed, I rise to  support the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to serve on the Supreme Court.  Judge Gorsuch is an accomplished, mainstream jurist. I look forward to  helping make sure he can receive a vote here on the Senate floor.   In the weeks since his nomination, I have spoken at length about his  qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court. I have recognized him as  a conservative champion of religious liberty, a defender of the  separation of powers, and a westerner who will bring some much needed  geographic diversity and a regional perspective to the Court.   During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary  Committee, Judge Gorsuch showed the country what it means to be a  judge.   Big or small, popular or unpopular, powerful or powerless, Judge  Gorsuch promised to render judgments based on the facts of the case,  nothing else. He also has a remarkable record of respectful cooperation  with judges appointed by Presidents of both parties.   During his decade-long tenure on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals,  Judge Gorsuch participated in more than 2,700 appeals. These comprised  some of the most difficult cases across six States. Of those cases, 97  percent of them were decided unanimously--97 percent.   Judge Gorsuch was in the majority 99 percent of the time. He was in  the majority on those cases 99 percent of the time. This is a testament  to Judge Gorsuch's ability to consider other points of view and to seek  out consensus, where possible. To try to paint Judge Gorsuch as an  ideologue simply doesn't work. Those are essential qualities for any  prospective Supreme Court Justice.   Now that we have reported Judge Gorsuch out of committee as of today,  I would like to say a few words on the obstacles that stand in the way  of his being considered here on the Senate floor.   As we proceed with Judge Gorsuch's confirmation, I would like to  explain my support for confirming him in light of what transpired in  the waning months of the previous administration.   For nearly 230 years, Presidents have been making nominations to the  Supreme Court. According to the Congressional Research Service: ``From  the appointment of the first Justices in 1789 through its consideration  of Nominee Elena Kagan in 2010, the Senate has confirmed 124 Supreme  Court nominations out of 160 received.''   I would like to reiterate that number. Out of 160 Supreme Court  nominations in our Nation's history, 124 were confirmed.   The Congressional Research Service goes on to state: ``Of the 36  nominations which were not confirmed, 11 were rejected outright in  roll-call votes by the Senate, while nearly all of the rest, in the  face of substantial committee or Senate opposition to the nominee or  the President, were withdrawn by the President, or were postponed,  tabled, or never voted on by the Senate.''   The manner in which the Senate decides to provide its constitutional  advice and consent on Presidential nominations has varied over the  centuries  [[Page S2167]]  with respect to nominations. This includes decisions not to take up  Supreme Court nominees.   As Jonathan Adler put it in his article in the George Mason Law  Review:         Much as the Senate may reject a legislative proposal that       originated in the House of Representatives by voting it down,       killing it in committee, or simply refusing to take up the       measure, the Senate may withhold its consent by voting       against confirmation of a nominee, rejecting the nominee in       committee, or simply refusing to act.    Is refusing to act the preferred outcome? I can certainly see where  some would say no, as would I.   However, the history of the Senate demonstrates that to do otherwise  in similar circumstances, as we just experienced is, in fact, a rare  exception.   To cite Adler's law review article again, he states: ``The last time  a Supreme Court vacancy arose in the calendar year of a Presidential  election and was filled prior to [the] election was in 1932.''   President Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court  in the heat of the 2016 Presidential election. When he was nominated, I  understood the frustration of those on the other side of the aisle over  the fate of that nomination.   I met Judge Garland. He is a good man and a good judge, but the  decision by the majority not to take up Judge Garland's nomination was  not inconsistent with a longstanding practice of filling Supreme Court  vacancies after elections.   This brings us today to why I support confirming Judge Gorsuch to the  Supreme Court. There is no question about the appropriateness of  confirming Supreme Court nominees during the first years of the  President's term, let alone the first 3 months. In fact, there is  absolutely no justification for filibustering a highly qualified  Supreme Court nominee put forward by the President who was just  elected. That is just unprecedented.   There was an attempt to use this tactic in 2006 with Justice Samuel  Alito's nomination to the Supreme Court, but he garnered sufficient  bipartisan support so that cloture was invoked.   Today, it appears that we will not enjoy that same rational support.  My preference would be to change the behavior of Senators rather than  change the rules of the Senate. But here we are, where a nominee who  would have received unanimous or nearly unanimous support just a few  years ago is about to be filibustered.   My question is this: If we can't confirm a judge like Judge Gorsuch  under contemporary use of Senate rules, who can we confirm?   It looks as if we will move forward later this week and make the rest  of the Executive Calendar subject to the same simple majority  threshold. Again, a change in Senate rules is not my preferred outcome,  but this rule change will simply make de jure what was de facto prior  to 2003, when filibusters were virtually never used on the President's  Executive Calendar.   Now, I want to make clear my steadfast support to preserve the  legislative filibuster. We need to distinguish between the President's  Executive Calendar, which has traditionally never been filibustered or  subject to filibuster, and the legislative filibuster, which is used  frequently here to ensure that we work across the aisle.   The Framers of our Constitution had the wisdom to create a Senate  with a strong minority to serve as a check on runaway power. If we were  to eliminate the legislative filibuster, we would cease to be that  check, and, indeed, the Senate would cease to be the Senate.   We have a qualified mainstream jurist before us. That is Judge  Gorsuch. I encourage all of my colleagues to give him fair  consideration and to advance his nomination to an up-or-down vote. I  will be voting to confirm him, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.   I yield back the remainder of my time.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have one request for a committee to meet  during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to Rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                          COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY    The Committee on the Judiciary is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate, on April 3, 2017, at 10 a.m., in SH-216 of the  Hart Senate Office Building.
