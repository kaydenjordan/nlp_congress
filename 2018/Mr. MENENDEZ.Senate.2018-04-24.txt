 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the  nomination of Kyle Duncan to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.   Mr. Duncan has spent large portions of his legal career seeking to  suppress the rights of immigrants, minorities, women, and the LGBTQ  community. In short, his values are grossly out of touch with a modern  and inclusive America.   I can't say I am surprised that Mr. Duncan has been nominated by a  President who has called Mexicans racists and drug dealers. President  Trump and Mr. Duncan share the same extreme political ideology,  especially regarding their view of immigrants. Mr. Duncan, in an amicus  brief challenging the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and  Lawful Permanent Residents, wrote that permitting DAPA--the acronym for  that program--to go into effect would exacerbate the problem of violent  crime by unauthorized immigrants. This position advances the false and  offensive narrative that a majority of immigrants are violent  criminals. In fact, DAPA was a program that would have allowed the  parent of a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident who had lived in  the United States continuously for years and passed a criminal  background check to remain in the United States with legal status and a  work permit. This program was never implemented, but it would have kept  families together, and to suggest it would have benefited criminals and  threatened public safety is just plain wrong. It fits with the  Republican Party's misleading and racist attacks on immigrants in this  country.   Mr. Duncan makes these arguments despite overwhelming evidence that  immigrants commit less crime than native-born Americans, and numerous  law enforcement entities have voiced their support for DAPA because the  program actually advances public safety by encouraging cooperation and  trust between immigrant communities and the police.   A year after voicing his opposition to DAPA, Mr. Duncan submitted  another amicus brief. This time he argued against the Deferred Action  for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA, claiming it was  unconstitutional. So we know where Mr. Duncan stands in stereotyping  immigrants, but Mr. Duncan is not just hostile to immigrants.   He represented North Carolina in its defense of a discriminatory  voting law, urging2 the Supreme Court to hear the case. In the brief,  Duncan wrote, ``The Constitution does not allow the sins of Civil  Rights-era legislators to be visited on their grandchildren and great- grandchildren.'' Yet the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals had found that  the law was enacted with discriminatory intent and ``targeted African  Americans with almost surgical precision.'' Mr. Duncan appeared to have  clearly missed the point as to who the real victims were.   In another voting rights case, Duncan argued that Texas's restrictive  voter ID law helped to ``prevent voter fraud.'' Although this myth has  been debunked over and over and over again, the Republican Party,  President Trump, and Mr. Duncan continue to perpetuate this lie to the  American people in an effort to suppress the voting rights of others.   I would be remiss if I ended these remarks without noting Mr.  Duncan's extremely troubling record on reproductive rights and his  hostility toward the LGBTQ community. He has continuously fought to  restrict women's access to contraceptives. In 2013, he criticized the  Affordable Care Act's inclusion of contraceptives as an essential  benefit for the health and economic success of society, particularly  women.   Given that he holds these views, it seems fitting that Mr. Duncan  would serve as the lead counsel in Hobby Lobby v. Burwell, in which he  argued that corporations have the right to deny contraceptive coverage  to their employees. I am sure he was pleased when the Supreme Court  agreed with him.   Yet, when the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Obergefell v.  Hodges, which recognized same-sex marriage as a fundamental right,  Duncan said that such a decision ``raises a question about the  legitimacy of the Court.'' This comment cuts to the core of my  opposition to Mr. Duncan--his disregard and contempt for judicial  precedent he disagrees with.   Even before the Supreme Court considered same-sex marriage, Duncan  warned that if the courts granted the right to same-sex marriage, then  they might have to grant the right to marry a first cousin or a 13- year-old. To clarify, this is a man who believes that the rights of a  corporation to deny employees health benefits is perfectly  constitutional. Yet granting the right to same-sex marriage will lead  us down a road to child marriage.   I know my colleagues are on a furious quest to pack the Federal bench  with conservative judges--judges who hold outrageous views, views out  of step with the American public. I do not trust, nor does his record  suggest, that once Mr. Duncan puts on the judicial robe, he will uphold  the rule of law for all Americans and not just those who share his  ideological views.   I do not believe he can be an unbiased jurist, and that is exactly  why the President nominated him and his supporters will vote for him.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the nomination of Mr. Duncan.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, 5 years ago today, the Rana Plaza  building collapsed in Bangladesh, tragically killing more than 1,100  people and injuring thousands more. Rana Plaza, a bustling multistory  commercial building in Dhaka, had housed several ready-made garment  factories, as well as banks and other businesses. When cracks appeared  in the building facade the day prior to its collapse and some stores in  the building accordingly closed up shop, owners of the garment  factories inside Rana Plaza rather told their workers not to worry and  ordered them to return for work the next day, but this was not a time  for business as usual. Thousands of garment workers, the majority of  them enterprising young women achieving new levels of financial  independence for themselves and their families, filed back into the  building the next morning. Thousands of them never made it back out.  The world was rightly stunned and horrified by the images of the  lifeless bodies of hundreds of young women being pulled from the rubble  of this manmade disaster.   The Rana Plaza tragedy could have been avoided, and it demonstrated  that ``business as usual'' in Bangladesh's  [[Page S2383]]  garment industry inordinately rewarded factory owners and managers,  while ignoring factory workers' safety and rights. In the dusty rubble  of the building collapse, it became crystal clear that the Bangladeshi  Government, factory owners and managers, and the global apparel brands  all had a grave responsibility to do more, and quickly, to secure the  labor rights of Bangladeshi workers. A simple fact remains, 5 years  later: Had the Rana Plaza workers been afforded the ability to organize  and protect their interests, the tragedy never would have happened.  With collective strength and action, they could have stood up to  employers to demand basic rights, and they could have refused to be  ordered back into the building without appropriate safety standards.  Five years later, it is also clear that a great deal of work remains to  secure these rights.   As the son of a seamstress who worked in the textile factories of  northern New Jersey, I knew from watching my mother how tiring and  strenuous such work could be, but it does not have to be fatal. The  United States' own Triangle Shirtwaist Fire more than a hundred years  before Rana Plaza, which killed nearly 150 people, galvanized a  necessary workers' movement and subsequent necessary reforms that to  this day help protect labor rights while ensuring that American  companies produce high-quality products. To this day, the AFL-CIO and  other American labor unions work tirelessly to expose the conditions  facing U.S. workers and to organize collective responses and inform  government decisions to promote worker protections. Last year, for  example, an AFL-CIO report revealed an alarming rate of workplace  deaths among Latinos and immigrants to the United States and provided  recommendations to the Department of Labor to address them. Along with  many of my Senate colleagues, I am pushing for our government to adopt  these recommendations. Put simply, the successes of American organized  labor are inextricable from the prosperity of the American economy and  have helped to boost the fortunes of countless American workers.   We know that countries and people are more secure and prosperous when  workers can operate in safety while pursuing economic success. The  proud legacy of the movement for American workers' rights demands that  we advocate for workers at risk around the globe. In the past 5 years  since the Rana Plaza disaster, we have so advocated. We have come  together in unprecedented ways to address the factors driving labor  abuses against workers in Bangladesh.   As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee at the time of the  Rana Plaza disaster in 2013, my first hearing explored the tragedy and  the consequences of a race to the bottom that had increased companies'  profit margins alongside risks to their workers. This was the first  SFRC hearing focused on labor rights in more than a dozen years. I  called another hearing early the following year to review progress in  addressing the labor rights emergency in Bangladesh and conducted  rigorous, bipartisan oversight to ensure that the U.S. Government was  doing all it could to spur change among brands, owners, and Bangladeshi  Government officials. This included a field visit and a November 2013  majority staff report that examined progress in advancing workers'  safety and labor rights since the Rana Plaza disaster and the Tazreen  factory fire. We also worked closely with our colleagues on the  Appropriations Committee to ensure that funds over 3 successive fiscal  years were designated to directly support the development and capacity- building of truly independent labor unions in Bangladesh that could  safely and effectively advocate for worker rights.   Meanwhile, major American retailers who produced apparel in  Bangladesh, including Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle Outfitters,  and Fruit of the Loom, joined the effort alongside other global brands,  governments, civil society, and labor unions to grapple with the acute  challenges facing Bangladeshi workers who produced their goods. The  risk of undermined consumer confidence and declines in brand quality  helped spur some corporations to join the Accord on Fire and Building  Safety in Bangladesh--a 5-year, legally binding compact to improve  safety in Bangladeshi ready-made garment factories through reasonable  steps to prevent future disasters. Most importantly, the accord  signatories included labor unions, who were rightly regarded as equal  and critical stakeholders in effecting needed change. Five years later,  accord brands have the opportunity to demonstrate a sustained  commitment to worker rights by signing on to the 2018 accord. This  iteration strengthens and expands the accord to cover freedom of  association. Other groups, such as the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker  Safety, have also helped to further galvanize American and  multinational brands to take greater responsibility for ensuring worker  safety in Bangladesh. In any such efforts, workers and their  representatives must have a truly equal seat at the table, for without  them we cannot make meaningful labor rights reforms.   Governments have a critical role to play as well. Following Rana  Plaza, the United States and other governments pressed Bangladesh to  take meaningful steps to improve respect for labor rights in the  country, including through removing Bangladesh from the generalized  system of preferences and conducting regular reviews of the Bangladeshi  Government's efforts to better adhere to international labor standards.  I believe the U.S. Government can and should do more to ensure that  developing countries with which our country trades are taking necessary  steps to respect labor and human rights. I was proud last year to  introduce the Labor Rights for Development Act with Senator Brown and  the Anti-Trafficking Trade Act with Senator Portman that together would  raise the labor and human rights standards countries must meet to gain  preferential access to the U.S. market.   Five years on, the progress made in Bangladesh is simply not enough.  Factories throughout the country have failed to meet their binding  commitments on workplace safety in the accord and the alliance, risking  the departure of some global retailers to other markets. Independent  unions in Bangladesh remain constrained and subject to increasing  harassment and attacks on labor rights activists, which often occur  with impunity. Amidst a growing climate of political tensions in  Bangladesh, the government too often views independent labor unions as  opposition dissenters to punish, rather than key partners that are  vital to the country's growth and prosperity.   In the 5 years since Rana Plaza, I have continued to believe that  what happens in Bangladesh to improve labor rights and workers' safety  can have a dramatic ripple effect on the global apparel industry and  that real change in working conditions there can help to change  conditions for workers everywhere in a race to the top, but similarly,  if not enough happens in Bangladesh, it sends the message that workers'  lives can still be systematically undervalued and that working to  advance labor rights is an endeavor not worth the risk. That is the  wrong message, and on this anniversary, we must recommit ourselves to  pushing stakeholders in Bangladesh--whether government, brands, or  owners--to continue a path of reform. To do any less harms not just the  workers, but also Bangladesh's economic potential, because no one will  want to wear clothes stained with the blood of workers.                            ____________________
