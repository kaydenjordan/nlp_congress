 Mr. Speaker, the House is often described as a family, but  it is a lot bigger than 435 Members. Our extended family, of course,  includes the staff of the House and the staff of each and every Member;  the Capitol Police who do such an extraordinary job of protecting all  of us; the maintenance crews that make sure the facilities function,  are open to the public; and, frankly, all those others who make the  House of Representatives a very special place.   I rise today, Mr. Speaker, to report what many of you already know,  the loss of a member of that extended family, my longtime chief of  staff, Sean Patrick Murphy.   Sean has been a professional associate and friend of mine for 19  years. He was my chief of staff for 11 years, and, frankly, we both  believed he would be the last chief of staff I would ever have.   Sean Patrick Murphy left us, unexpectedly, in February. He had based  his life on three things: his faith, his family, and his friends.   Those people who were privileged to know Sean know that he was a very  devout Catholic, and his faith was not something that was casual to  him. It was something that he lived each and every day and carried out  in each and every relationship that he had.   Nothing was more important after his faith than his family. Sean  Murphy was the consummate husband and father. He loved his family, and  he lived a life of total dedication to them.   His wife, Johannah, and his sons, Patrick, Peter, and Charlie, were  fixtures that we all heard about in our office each and every day,  particularly the boys because there would always be a funny story about  what they happened to be doing at any given moment. Sean worked hard so  Johannah could stay home and actually homeschool those three children,  so they were an extraordinarily close group.   And, finally, there were Sean's friends. No one had more, no one,  frankly, held his friends longer, and no one treasured them more than  Sean. Because of that, if you happened to attend his funeral, you saw  over 2,000 family and friends show up to remember this extraordinary  man.   As a person, Sean had all the wit, all the wisdom, all the decency of  the Irish. He was a natural leader and a loyal colleague. People  followed him because they trusted him. He was fair. He was decent. He  was selfless. He always put others first.   And if you sent spent a day with Sean Murphy, you were going to  laugh. He made people laugh partly by laughing at himself. In all the  years that I  [[Page H3922]]  knew him and all the many capacities we dealt in together, I never had  one other person come and complain to me about Sean--no constituent, no  fellow staff member, no lobbyist, no member of another office. All of  them thought they were his best friend.   Now, he was pretty good at that and would give you a pretty good  opinion later about whether they were really a friend or not, but the  point is everybody that knew him liked him, and everybody believed that  he liked them back.   Sean's lifelong profession, and, really, it began when he was quite  young, was his passion for politics. He took it first as a volunteer,  and then it did become the manner in which he lived his life.   Now, his gentle nature hid an extraordinarily competitive personal  spirit. Politics, I like to say, is an adult team sport, and Sean  played it exceptionally well. He was astute in his judgment about  people and about politics.   In all the many issues we discussed over many years, both in terms of  dealing with political campaigns and dealing with the politics of the  House, itself, both on the floor and in our Conference, I never got a  piece of bad advice from Sean. But with Sean, politics always had a  purpose, and that purpose was always to achieve some greater good, some  more important goal.   He wasn't just good at winning; he was good at governing. He,  frankly, never sold out. He had plenty of opportunities to go and make  a lot more money than I could have ever paid him, but he worked for  principle. He always put his country and his party and people above  anything that might benefit himself. And he believed in the things that  he worked for, and he worked to make a difference in this country each  and every day.   Frankly, he cherished this institution above all else. He enjoyed not  only the politics, but those rare moments of drama when great things  happen on the floor of the House; and he made sure that any Member he  worked for--and I wasn't the only one--had an opportunity to impact  those events thanks to his good advice, thanks to the wonderful staff  that he built and created, and thanks to his shrewd strategy.   All of us that knew him believed that he left us far too soon, but  that is pretty presumptive, Mr. Speaker. Who are any of us to say  something like that? God chooses the time that we come and the time  that we go. How can you be bitter when your friend went to his bed,  innocent and untroubled, and woke up in Heaven with our Lord and  Savior?   But God does allow us to miss him, and miss him we all will. He will  be missed as a husband and a father and a friend. He blessed all of us  with his life. And for me, in particular, Mr. Speaker, I will miss him  for all my days.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
