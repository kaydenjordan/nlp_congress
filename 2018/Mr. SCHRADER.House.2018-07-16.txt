 Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5554 is a bipartisan bill to  reauthorize the animal drug and animal generic drug user fee programs,  and I am proud to lead it with my colleague, Mr. Mullin.   ADUFA and AGDUFA are crucial to FDA's work to review and approve  applications for animal drugs. Over the past several years, animal drug  user fee programs have streamlined the approval process for  pharmaceuticals and eliminated the FDA's application backlog, reduced  review times, and created a more predictable process.   As a veterinarian from Oregon, I am particularly grateful to see this  bill come to the floor. I am acutely aware of the great innovations  that are occurring in the human health sphere, and I want to ensure our  four-footed friends also have access to the latest and greatest medical  innovations. That is why I am particularly pleased with this bill and  its language to expand conditional approval for animal drugs with major  uses in major species.                                time  1830    Conditional approval is a careful, deliberative process based on  similar pathways for drugs for minor uses and minor species that was  already established in 2004.   Conditional approval is critical for veterinary medicine since it is  not cost-effective for drug companies to pursue large, complete  clinical trials, given the small population of intended beneficiaries,  without some initial interest and success under the conditional  approval program.   Before being conditionally approved, drugs must demonstrate a  reasonable expectation of effectiveness and meet every other FDA  standard for approval, including safety. They still need to get  complete FDA approval within 5 years and must apply for annual renewal.   I thank Chairman Walden; Ranking Member Pallone; Mr. Green; my  colleague from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson), who worked very hard on the  bill; and certainly Mr. Mullin for his partnership in leading this way.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.
