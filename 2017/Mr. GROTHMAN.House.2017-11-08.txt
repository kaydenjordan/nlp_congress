 Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 616.    Mr. Chair, as the designee of my friend and colleague,  Mr. Pocan, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, first of all, I would like to thank the  chair and ranking member for their collaborative effort to bring this  bill forward.   This amendment, which is supported by colleagues on both sides of the  aisle, is pretty simple. It requires Federal decisionmakers in the  Department of the Interior to consider the threat of invasive species  when installing fishways.   This was brought to my attention while looking at a dam on the  Wisconsin River in Wisconsin. Below that dam, we had Asian carp, an  invasive species, a huge fish. If that fish was able to get further  north on the Wisconsin River, because of a fishway, you could wind up  with this invasive species not only in the northern part of the river,  but, and quite frankly, in dozens of lakes throughout northern  Wisconsin.   As a matter of fact, given where that dam is, if there is even  flooding, that invasive species could wind up working its way into Lake  Michigan and up the Saint Lawrence Seaway. It is very important that  before the Department of the Interior listens to certain  environmentalists, they realize that a fishway at this dam would result  in big trouble.   Because of the devastating effects invasive species can have on the  environment, local fish population, and the economy, this amendment  will ensure the Federal agencies take into account all consequences  before installing fishways.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from Alliant Energy.                                                 Alliant Energy,                                                   November 8, 2017.      Hon. Mark Pocan,      Member of Congress, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Glenn Grothman,      Member of Congress, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Pocan and Grothman: I am writing in       strong support of your invasive species amendment to H.R.       3043, the Hydropower Modernization Act of 2017, which is due       to be considered on the floor of the U.S. House today.       Alliant Energy deeply appreciates your commitment to this       pro-environment measure, and for protecting Wisconsin's       watersheds.        As you know, an Alliant subsidiary, Wisconsin Power and       Light, owns and operates a dam located in Prairie du Sac,       Wisconsin, on the Wisconsin River. The Prairie du Sac dam,       now over 100 years old, is responsible for the formation of       Lake Wisconsin, which serves as an enormous recreational and       wildlife resource for our state.        Over a decade ago, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service       sought to impose a fishway requirement on the license for the       dam, essentially calling for a ``fishway'' to be installed to       allow for the upstream migration of native fish. Since that       time, however, scientists and state officials have discovered       the existence of non-native, invasive fish species (Asian       carp) at the base of the dam. If a fishway were now       installed, it seems clear that these invasive species would       also be able to migrate--and thereby endanger native fish       populations upstream, including Lake Wisconsin.        Your amendment would ensure that, in this particular case,       the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would be required to       consider the threats posed by invasive species before       imposing a fishway condition on a hydroelectric license. We       believe strongly that such decisions should be predicated on       the most up to date information available, and your amendment       will help guarantee that invasive species are not permitted       to threaten the Lake Wisconsin watershed.        Again, thank you for offering your amendment. Please let me       know how Alliant may assist you in ushering this much-needed       provision into public law.            Sincerely,                                                  David de Leon,                               Vice President Operations--Wisconsin,                                                    Alliant Energy.     Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin.    I yield to the gentleman from Illinois.  [[Page H8634]]         Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
