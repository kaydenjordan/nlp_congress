 Madam Speaker, in recognition of Gun Violence  Awareness Month, I rise to share the story of a brave soldier named  Ben.   Ben's sister Mary is a Moms Demand Action leader in my hometown of  Berkley, Michigan.   After her brother was honorably discharged from military service,  Mary grew concerned that Ben was at risk of self-harm.   Mary and her dad begged every firearms store in the area they lived  at the time not to sell a gun to her brother. She was told Ben could  not be denied a gun, despite the risks he faced.   Ben died by suicide shortly thereafter with a gun he had bought at  one of those stores.   Had Mary been able to seek an Extreme Risk Prevention Order, Ben  could be alive today.   I am a cosponsor of the Extreme Risk Protection Order Act and the  Federal Extreme Risk Protection Order Act.   Madam Speaker, for Ben and so many others, Congress must act without  delay.                            ____________________
