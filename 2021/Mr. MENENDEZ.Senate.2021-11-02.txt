 Mr. President, I rise today to seek unanimous consent  for eight to nine nominees to critical State Department posts.   Each of them moved through the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  with bipartisan support, and the only reason the Senate has not  confirmed them is due to the political obstinacy of a couple of my  Republican colleagues. And the evidence of that is that when we have a  vote, as we had earlier today for the Assistant Administrator of AID,  it passed 59 to 40--59 to 40.   We have heard many complaints about the management of the State  Department and the conduct of U.S. foreign policy in recent months. And  while the State Department is not a perfect institution--for that fact,  no institution is--its leadership was decimated by the prior  administration.   The assistant secretaries and ambassadors who should be participating  in the rebuilding of the institution and the development and  implementation of U.S. foreign policy are instead languishing on the  Senate floor--dozens, dozens.   Nominees who should be the face of the United States at international  organizations--like the United Nations, NATO, the Organization for  Security and Co-operation in Europe--are instead waiting for the Senate  to act. The government of the People's Republic of China is watching.  Even though the majority of this body has recognized that the  Government of China represents the greatest geopolitical challenge to  the United States, we are letting China eat our lunch on the world  stage.   Our Republican colleagues have spoken at length in opposition to this  administration's handling of the situation in Afghanistan, but they  refuse to allow the Senate to vote on nominees who are critical to  dealing with the refugee situation resulting from the U.S. withdrawal  and the much-needed stabilization efforts.   By the way, a withdrawal that was already precooked by the Trump  administration when it made a surrender deal with the Taliban that said  we will leave on a date certain, we will release thousands of Taliban  prisoners--which they did, to the Taliban, who became fighting  soldiers--we ultimately will not only leave at a date certain, but we  have done nothing to get any of the promises that the Taliban made  enforced, and we reduce our troop level dramatically. That is what  President Biden inherited.    Now, I have heard a lot about the handling of the situation in  Afghanistan, but my colleagues refuse to allow the Senate to vote on  nominees who are critical to dealing with the refugee situation  resulting from that withdrawal and the much-needed stabilization  efforts.   Nominees being held by the Republicans include the Assistant  Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration; and the  Assistant Secretary for Conflict and Stabilization Operations. That  cannot stand.   And for all the talk of needing to work with our allies and partners,  how does holding our nominee to be the U.S. Ambassador to Israel or the  U.S. Ambassador to Canada actually advance U.S. interests?   It does not. It is seriously detrimental to our national security.   Before I ask unanimous consent, I understand Senator Schumer would  like to speak prior to these UC requests.    Mr. President, with that hope, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the consideration of the following  nomination: Calendar No. 239, Michele Jeanne Sison, of Maryland, a  Career Member of the Senior Foreign Service, Class of Career  Ambassador, to be an Assistant Secretary of State (International  Organization Affairs); that the nomination be confirmed; the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to  the nomination; and that the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.    Mr. President.    It is disingenuous to suggest that this can all happen  by the majority leader and 60 votes. There were no calls when  Republicans controlled this Chamber for votes on each and every  nominee. On the contrary, as the leader said, large numbers of Trump  nominees to the State Department or Ambassadorial or State Department  positions were passed on voice. They were passed on voice vote.   I don't know. In the case of NATO, I think the nominee made it very  clear before the committee--I know that our colleague is not a member  of that particular committee--but she made it very clear before the  committee that she was advocating for all of our allies to reach their  2-percent commitment.   And what better way to achieve it than to actually have an Ambassador  at NATO to pursue that goal?   But if you don't have anybody there, guess what. You can't pursue  that goal.   So let me try again.   I want to ask that it be in order to make the same request with  respect to Executive Calendar No. 327, Anne A. Witkowsky, of Maryland,  to be an Assistant Secretary of State (Conflict and Stabilization  Operations).    So we will continue to have conflict and stabilization  without anybody being be in charge.   I ask that it be in order to make the same request with respect to  Executive Calendar No. 318, Christopher P. Lu, of Virginia, to be  Representative of the United States of America to the United Nations  for U.N. Management and Reform, with the rank of Ambassador.    Here is an example. We hear we want reform at the U.N.,  but we can't put the person there in charge of helping us reform the  U.N.   I ask that it be in order to make the same request with respect to  Executive Calendar No. 462, Julieta Valls Noyes, of Virginia, a Career  Member of the Senior Foreign Service, Class of Career Minister, to be  an Assistant Secretary of State (Population, Refugees, and Migration).    All right. I heard a lot of my colleagues talk about  how we should get more SIV people from Afghanistan. This is the person  who could help us do it.   I ask that it be in order to make the same request with respect to  Executive Calendar No. 437, Julianne Smith, of Michigan, to be United  States Permanent Representative on the Council of the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization, with the rank and status of Ambassador  Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary.    I ask that it be in order to make the same request with  respect to Calendar No. 461, Marcia Stephens Bloom Bernicat, of New  Jersey, a Career Member of the Senior Foreign Service, Class of the  Minister-Counselor, to be Director General of the Foreign Service.    I can't wait to hear the next objection to someone who  would be Ambassador to Israel--to Israel.   I ask that it be in order to make the same request with respect to  Executive Calendar No. 452, Thomas R. Nides, of Minnesota, to be  Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States of  America to the State of Israel.    So we will have no Ambassador in Israel as we deal with  the challenges of Iran and others in the region. It is mind-boggling,  all of those who get up here and talk about our ally, the State of  Israel, the importance of the State of Israel, but we won't have an  Ambassador there to help us meet the challenges that Israel has.   I ask that it be in order to make the same request with respect to  Executive Calendar No. 443, Michael Carpenter, of the District of  Columbia, to be U.S. Representative to the Organization for Security  and Cooperation in Europe, with the rank of Ambassador.    Well, let's see if we get a lucky one.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  consideration of the following nomination: Executive Calendar No. 453,  David L. Cohen, of Pennsylvania, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and  Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to Canada; that the  Senate vote on confirmation of the nomination; that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to  the nomination; and that the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.    I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise today to express my  enthusiastic support for the nomination of Ambassador Isobel Coleman to  be Deputy Administrator for Policy and Programming at the United States  Agency for International Development.   As the world faces mounting challenges--from climate change, the  COVID-19 pandemic, forced migration spurred by conflict, lack of  economic opportunity, and growing food insecurity, to the emergence of  antidemocratic and authoritarian leaders--USAID's work is critically  important to the U.S. national security and global stability.   I am pleased to be supporting Ambassador Coleman's nomination, and I  am confident that her extensive development experience and her years of  distinguished public service, including at the United Nations, serving  with Administrator Power, provide her with the type of background and  knowledge required to address the challenges ahead, if confirmed. She  is a well-known and trusted foreign affairs professional, and I am  confident she will execute her duties with distinction.  [[Page S7596]]    The fact that Ambassador Coleman's nomination, someone whose  leadership is so essential, has languished on the Senate floor for  almost 3 months is a travesty.   I urge my colleagues to support her nomination and make sure that  this critical position is filled without further delay.                            ____________________
