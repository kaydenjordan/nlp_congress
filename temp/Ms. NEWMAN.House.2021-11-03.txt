 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I rise today, Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the millions of older workers  who desperately need our help.   Last year, we saw older Americans leave the workforce more than we  ever have before, in fact, more than in the last seven decades.   We are seeing tens of thousands of workers with the right  qualifications for a job being turned away all because they are 50,  maybe even 40, and considered too old. In fact, 76 percent of older  American workers reported seeing age discrimination when trying to  obtain a job.   Mr. Speaker, 76 percent. That is clearly unacceptable.   We need to pass the Protect Older Job Applicants Act to ensure  America's older workers are finally protected from discrimination. But  before we can solve that problem, we have to fully understand it.   That is why included in this bill is an amendment I put forth to  ensure the Federal Government has the resources it needs to study just  how many job applicants have been discriminated against based on age.  By doing so, we can better provide recommendations and best practices  to further prevent this issue because when we lift up all of our older  workers, we lift up our entire economy.
