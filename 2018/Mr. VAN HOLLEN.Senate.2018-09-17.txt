 Mr. President, the Senate passed 3 of the required 12  appropriations bills needed to fund the Federal Government starting on  October first. The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, Energy  and Water, and Legislative Branch appropriations bills fund vital  programs that care for our military, protect our infrastructure, and  support the dedicated Federal employees that work for the U.S.  Congress.   Within the minibus, programs and projects such as the VA's National  Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Army Corps dredging for the  Port of Baltimore, and a new paid-internship program in the Senate are  just a few of the hundreds of items funded in these bills that will  benefit the people of Maryland and the Nation. However, I do not  support the $65 million appropriated in fiscal year 2019 for a new low- yield nuclear warhead for a submarine-launched ballistic missile. I  believe this is an unnecessary new weapon that increases the risk of  miscalculation and unintended escalation.   As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I am pleased that  we have gotten this far and I look forward to working with my  colleagues on moving the other bills to final passage.                            ____________________
