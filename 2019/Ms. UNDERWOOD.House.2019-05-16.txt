 Mr. Speaker, I am here today to tell you about Gwyn  Ciesla of Aurora, Illinois. Gwyn is a wife, a mother of two, and an IT  professional with two decades of experience. She is also a transgender  woman.   Gwyn transitioned about 2 years ago. Shortly afterward, she began  interviewing for jobs to advance her career.   Gwyn was met with hesitation from potential employers. On multiple  occasions, recruiters were suddenly uninterested in Gwyn after they  conducted in-person interviews--no follow-up, no phone calls or emails,  just complete silence.   This is a horrifying reality for many people in the trans community  like Gwyn. A 2016 report by the National Center for Transgender  Equality found roughly 30 percent of trans people have been denied a  job or a promotion, or were fired, because of their gender identity.   This kind of discrimination is not only hurtful and illegal, but it  hurts our economy, which is why groups like the Chamber of Commerce and  over 200  [[Page H3852]]  major corporations support the Equality Act.   Gwyn is now employed, but there are so many others still forced to  sit on the sidelines, keeping top talent out of our workforce.   The Equality Act would ensure everyone has the opportunity to earn a  living and contribute to our economy, and it would send a message that  we do not allow discrimination in our country.                            ____________________
