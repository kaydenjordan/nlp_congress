 Mr. President, it is an honor to speak in strong  support of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to serve as an Associate Justice on  the Supreme Court of the United States. After careful review of her  record and her outstanding testimony during her confirmation hearing,  it is clear that Judge Barrett is well suited for a lifetime  appointment on the Court.   Last week, Judge Barrett firmly held her own during hours and hours  of questioning from my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. She did  not once falter during her hearing. In fact, she excelled. Judge  Barrett proved to the  [[Page S6350]]  American people that she is prepared, talented, compassionate, and, not  to mention, brilliant. Judge Barrett demonstrated that she is an  independent individual who can think for herself. She made it clear  that she is an originalist who will follow the law.   Without a single note or binder in front of her, Judge Barrett  repeatedly affirmed that she would interpret the Constitution and laws  passed by Congress as they were written--no more, no less.   During her hearing, Judge Barrett testified:         I apply the law. I follow the law. You make the policy.    The judge kept pointing out that we, the Senate, are the legislators.  She stressed that she has no mission or agenda to change the law as she  would want it. Judge Barrett made it abundantly clear that in her role  as a jurist, she has no issues with setting aside her personal beliefs  when applying the letter of the law. This mindset and legal philosophy  is exactly the type of jurist we need on our Nation's highest Court.   Not only did we hear from Judge Barrett, but we heard from her former  professors, colleagues, and students. These are the people who know her  best. These individuals were witnesses not only to her intellect but  her character as well. The testimonies on her behalf only proved her  absolute readiness for this position.   Americans should be celebrating the nomination of Judge Barrett. She  is brilliant, hard working, ambitious, and a proud mother and wife. In  a time when we need role models for our youth, Judge Barrett fills that  role.   The judge is a family-oriented woman who reveres the Constitution.  She is a representative for working women across the country and a  testament that women can have a career and family and be stunningly  successful at both.   I also appreciate that she has displayed great strength in  withstanding affronts to her faith and her family during the  confirmation process.   If confirmed--and I am confident that she will be--Amy Coney Barrett  will have the honor to be the fifth woman in history to serve on the  Supreme Court. The first judge as a mother of school-aged children, she  will be the only sitting judge on the Court to not have attended an Ivy  League law school.   We must continue to ensure that women like Judge Barrett are  represented in the highest levels of our judicial system. Judge  Barrett's life experiences as a judge, lawyer, teacher, wife, and  mother will bring a valuable and much needed perspective to the Supreme  Court.   I am proud to support Judge Barrett. Now the Senate must do its  constitutional duty and confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett as soon as  possible.   I yield the floor.
