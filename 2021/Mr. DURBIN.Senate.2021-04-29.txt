 I announce that the Senator from Washington (Ms.  Cantwell) is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Washington (Ms.  Cantwell) is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I am going to raise an issue at this point  that is not relevant to the water bill. I ask unanimous consent to be  given that opportunity.    Mr. President, we are in the midst of the worst opioid  epidemic in a generation, and one tragic aspect of this is the  widespread use of fentanyl, a deadly opioid that has killed thousands  of people in America.   In 2018, the Drug Enforcement Administration took the unprecedented  step of placing all fentanyl-related substances, also known as fentanyl  analogs, on schedule I under the Controlled Substances Act. That makes  it easier to prosecute any individual who sells or even simply  possesses fentanyl analogs, and it subjects those individuals to stiff  mandatory minimum penalties regardless of individual circumstances.  Typically, a drug is only added to schedule I after the Department of  Health and Human Services conducts a scientific study to determine if  it has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical use.   The DEA has had the temporary authority to bypass this process for 2  years. The authority was scheduled to expire on February 6 of last  year, 2020. The DEA warned us of the dire consequences if it expired.  In response, I worked with Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Feinstein  and authored legislation extending the authority for 15 months, until  May 6, 2021.   So what did the Trump administration do for the 12 months that it was  in office with this issue still looming? Nothing and neither did  Congress.   Now the Biden administration has asked Congress for an additional  extension of the DEA's temporary authority in order to evaluate this  issue. Just last week, the Senate confirmed Lisa Monaco as Deputy  Attorney General. She will oversee the Drug Enforcement Administration.  President Biden's nominee to head the DEA, Anne Milgram, is still to be  considered by the Senate, so this request now for a temporary extension  seems reasonable.   Let me add, though, at the same time as we grapple with the opioid  epidemic, we are also in the midst of a national reckoning about racism  and massive incarceration in America. We hold more prisoners, by far,  than any country in the world. This is largely due to our failed War on  Drugs, which has disproportionately targeted people of color. While the  majority of illegal drug users and drug dealers in our country is  White, the vast majority of  [[Page S2324]]  people incarcerated for drug offenses is African American or Latino.  That is a fact.   More than three decades ago--and I remember this well as I served in  the House at the time--Congress responded to the dramatic rise in the  use of crack cocaine by dramatically increasing sentences for  nonviolent drug offenders; for example, with a sentencing guideline for  crack cocaine as compared to powder cocaine of 100 to 1. Well, that was  it. We were going to get tough. We were going to send a message. It  didn't work. The overall use of illegal drugs actually increased after  we increased these penalties between 1990 and 2014, and the  availability of drugs like heroin and methamphetamine, instead of going  down, increased.   Senator Cory Booker is the chair of the Criminal Justice and  Counterterrorism Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary. He has brought  these concerns to the floor of the Senate time and again. I was proud  to join him as well as Senator Grassley and Senator Lee. We authored  the FIRST STEP Act to begin reforming our criminal justice system from  the previous effort with our War on Drugs.   Senator Booker has raised serious concerns about extending the DEA's  order when it comes to these fentanyl analogs. For example, he notes  the significant racial disparity in fentanyl analog prosecutions.  People of color comprise 68 percent of those being sentenced. He also  notes that addiction is, in fact, a public health crisis and that we  cannot prosecute ourselves out of the opioid epidemic, a lesson we  should have learned with the War on Drugs.   So there is an important debate to be had about how to effectively  combat the abuse of fentanyl, but we cannot resolve it today on the  floor of the Senate. The DEA's authority is scheduled to expire next  week, and we will be gone. Last week, the House passed a bill extending  the scheduling order until October 22. Senator Booker has agreed not to  object to the House bill so that the Senate will have an opportunity to  debate the future of this DEA authority and consider other important  reforms to our criminal justice system.   Mr. President, at this point, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2630, which was received  from the House and is at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    I announce that the Senator from Washington (Ms.  Cantwell), the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Cardin), and the Senator from  Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1500         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Rail Passenger Fairness       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         (1) Congress created Amtrak under the Rail Passenger       Service Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-158).        (2) Amtrak began serving customers on May 1, 1971, taking       over the operation of most intercity passenger trains that       private, freight railroads were previously required to       operate. In exchange for assuming these passenger rail       operations, Amtrak was given access to the national rail       network.        (3) In return for relief from the obligation to provide       intercity passenger service, railroads over which Amtrak       operated (referred to in this section as ``host railroads'')       were expected to give Amtrak passenger trains preference over       freight trains when using the national rail network.        (4) In 1973, Congress passed the Amtrak Improvement Act of       1973 (Public Law 93-146), which gives intercity and commuter       rail passenger transportation preference over freight  [[Page S2364]]       transportation in using a rail line, junction, or crossing.       This right, which is now codified as section 24308(c) of       title 49, United States Code, states, ``Except in an       emergency, intercity and commuter rail passenger       transportation provided by or for Amtrak has preference over       freight transportation in using a rail line, junction, or       crossing unless the Board orders otherwise under this       subsection. A rail carrier affected by this subsection may       apply to the Board for relief. If the Board, after an       opportunity for a hearing under section 553 of title 5,       decides that preference for intercity and commuter rail       passenger transportation materially will lessen the quality       of freight transportation provided to shippers, the Board       shall establish the rights of the carrier and Amtrak on       reasonable terms.''.        (5) Many host railroads have ignored the law referred to in       paragraph (4) by refusing to give passenger rail the priority       to which it is statutorily entitled and giving freight       transportation the higher priority. As a result, Amtrak's on       time performance on most host railroads is poor, has declined       between 2014 through 2019, and continues to decline.        (6) According to Amtrak, 6,500,000 customers on State-      supported and long-distance trains arrived at their       destination late during fiscal year 2019. Nearly 70 percent       of these delays were caused by host railroads, amounting to a       total of 3,200,000 minutes. The largest cause of these delays       was freight train interference, which accounted for more than       1,000,000 minutes of delay for Amtrak passengers, or       approximately 2 years, because host railroads chose to give       freight trains priority.        (7) Poor on-time performance wastes taxpayer dollars.       According to a 2019 report by Amtrak's Office of Inspector       General, a 5 percent improvement of on-time performance on       all Amtrak routes would result in $12,100,000 in cost savings       to Amtrak in the first year. If on-time performance on long-      distance routes reached 75 percent for a year, Amtrak would       realize an estimated $41,900,000 in operating cost savings,       with a one-time savings of $336,000,000 due to a reduction in       equipment replacement needs.        (8) Historical data suggests that on-time performance on       host railroads is driven by the existence of an effective       means to enforce Amtrak's preference rights:        (A) Two months after the date of the enactment of the       Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008       (division B of Public Law 110-432), which included provisions       for the enforcement of these preference rights, was enacted,       the on-time performance of long-distance trains improved from       56 percent to 77 percent and Class I freight train       interference delays across all routes declined by 40 percent.        (B) One year after such date of enactment, freight train       interference delays had declined by 54 percent and the on-      time performance of long-distance trains reached 85 percent.        (C) In 2014, after some of the provisions in the Passenger       Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 related to       enforcement of preference were ruled unconstitutional by a       D.C. Circuit Court, long-distance train on-time performance       declined from 72 percent to 50 percent, and freight train       interference delays increased 59 percent.        (D) The last time long-distance trains achieved an on-time       rate of more than 80 percent in a given month was February       2012.        (9) As a result of violations of Amtrak's right to       preference, Amtrak has been consistently unable on host       railroad networks to meet its congressionally mandated       mission and goals, which are codified in section 24101 of       title 49, United States Code (relating to providing on-time       and trip-time competitive service to its passengers).        (10) Amtrak does not have an effective mechanism to enforce       its statutory preference right in order to fulfill its       mission and goals. Only the Attorney General can bring a       civil action for equitable relief in a district court of the       United States to enforce Amtrak's preference rights.        (11) In Amtrak's entire history, the only enforcement       action initiated by the Attorney General was against the       Southern Pacific Transportation Company in 1979.        (12) Congress supports continued authority for the Attorney       General to initiate an action, but Amtrak should also be       entitled to bring a civil action before a Federal district       court to enforce its statutory preference rights.       SEC. 3. AUTHORIZE AMTRAK TO BRING A CIVIL ACTION TO ENFORCE                     IT PREFERENCE RIGHTS.         (a) In General.--Section 24308(c) of title 49, United       States Code, is amended, by adding at the end the following:       ``Notwithstanding sections 24103(a) and 24308(f), Amtrak       shall have the right to bring an action for equitable or       other relief in the United States District Court for the       District of Columbia to enforce the preference rights granted       under this subsection.''.

(6) According to Amtrak, 6,500,000 customers on State-      supported and long-distance trains arrived at their       destination late during fiscal year 2019. Nearly 70 percent       of these delays were caused by host railroads, amounting to a       total of 3,200,000 minutes. The largest cause of these delays       was freight train interference, which accounted for more than       1,000,000 minutes of delay for Amtrak passengers, or       approximately 2 years, because host railroads chose to give       freight trains priority.        (7) Poor on-time performance wastes taxpayer dollars.       According to a 2019 report by Amtrak's Office of Inspector       General, a 5 percent improvement of on-time performance on       all Amtrak routes would result in $12,100,000 in cost savings       to Amtrak in the first year. If on-time performance on long-      distance routes reached 75 percent for a year, Amtrak would       realize an estimated $41,900,000 in operating cost savings,       with a one-time savings of $336,000,000 due to a reduction in       equipment replacement needs.        (8) Historical data suggests that on-time performance on       host railroads is driven by the existence of an effective       means to enforce Amtrak's preference rights:        (A) Two months after the date of the enactment of the       Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008       (division B of Public Law 110-432), which included provisions       for the enforcement of these preference rights, was enacted,       the on-time performance of long-distance trains improved from       56 percent to 77 percent and Class I freight train       interference delays across all routes declined by 40 percent.        (B) One year after such date of enactment, freight train       interference delays had declined by 54 percent and the on-      time performance of long-distance trains reached 85 percent.        (C) In 2014, after some of the provisions in the Passenger       Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 related to       enforcement of preference were ruled unconstitutional by a       D.C. Circuit Court, long-distance train on-time performance       declined from 72 percent to 50 percent, and freight train       interference delays increased 59 percent.        (D) The last time long-distance trains achieved an on-time       rate of more than 80 percent in a given month was February       2012.        (9) As a result of violations of Amtrak's right to       preference, Amtrak has been consistently unable on host       railroad networks to meet its congressionally mandated       mission and goals, which are codified in section 24101 of       title 49, United States Code (relating to providing on-time       and trip-time competitive service to its passengers).        (10) Amtrak does not have an effective mechanism to enforce       its statutory preference right in order to fulfill its       mission and goals. Only the Attorney General can bring a       civil action for equitable relief in a district court of the       United States to enforce Amtrak's preference rights.        (11) In Amtrak's entire history, the only enforcement       action initiated by the Attorney General was against the       Southern Pacific Transportation Company in 1979.        (12) Congress supports continued authority for the Attorney       General to initiate an action, but Amtrak should also be       entitled to bring a civil action before a Federal district       court to enforce its statutory preference rights.
