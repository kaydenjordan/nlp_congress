 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I respect the time-honored practice  of this body which encourages new Members to listen and observe before  speaking on the floor. There is value in humility--knowing when to talk  and when to listen.   First, let me say it is a great privilege to represent the people of  Mississippi in the United States Senate. I am working hard to support  the needs of all Mississippians and to justify the confidence placed in  me by the people of my great State.   Today I rise to speak on several important topics. First and  foremost, I rise to honor Officer Robert McKeithen, a 24-year-decorated  veteran of the Biloxi Police Department who lost his life in the line  of duty this past Sunday night, May 5.   Officer McKeithen was described by his chief as ``an unbelievably  fine policeman.'' He was an Air Force veteran, a husband, and a father  who dedicated his life to serving the people of Biloxi, my State, and  our Nation. His loss is a tragedy and a stark reminder that law  enforcement officers risk their lives daily to keep us safe. Officer  McKeithen's family, colleagues, and friends certainly have my deepest  sympathy.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
