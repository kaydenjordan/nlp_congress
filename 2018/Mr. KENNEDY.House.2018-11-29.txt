 Mr. Speaker, on Monday, GM went to bed with a record  $3.2 billion in profits last quarter alone. Its shareholders went to  bed with a 5 percent surge in stock prices, plus the $10.6 billion the  company has spent on buybacks since 2015. Meanwhile, 14,000 GM workers  spent a sleepless night wondering if their jobs and livelihoods would  still be there for them the next morning.   There is no better snapshot of our country's current, toxic brand of  capitalism, where we are operating in a system that demands that  workers labor harder and harder to meet basic human needs but refuses  to share even a slice of the success that they helped create.   For those of us in this Chamber this morning, it is about more than  one company or one balance sheet. It is about 50 years of giving the  private sector explicit permission to cast workers aside. It is about  an economy that has become the antithesis of what our country stands  for: equity, decency, justice, and hard work.   President Trump has made his response to these economic inequities  very clear. His is a country of bitter rivalry between fellow citizens  forced to endlessly spar over the scraps of that system: ``My wages  can't go up unless your food stamps are taken away.'' ``Your medical  bills can't fall unless my insurance goes.'' So Americans spend their  days fighting each other over economic crumbs while our system quietly  delivers the entire pot to those at the top.   That is the reality that our new Democratic majority must address for  the coal miner in Kentucky, the daycare worker in New York, the fifth- generation farming family in Ohio, the first-generation immigrant  family in Massachusetts, the mostly White towns in West Virginia  devastated by an opioid epidemic, and the communities of color across  our country terrorized by the war on drugs.   Forget where they are from or what they look like or how they vote.  All of these Americans face an economy that does not operate for them.  They live in cities and towns that are likely to be medically  underserved, educationally ostracized from today's job market, plagued  by inadequate infrastructure, and burdened by crumbling homes or houses  that no one can afford.   They disproportionately shoulder the hard words that can make life  hurt: ``eviction,'' ``addiction,'' ``bankruptcy,'' and ``violence.''   They hail from the places where polling locations disappear, where  the biggest economic engine is a payday lender, where lead poisons  their children's water, and where injustice and insufficiency fester  for generations before a government thinks to step in.   This is the challenge of our time. It is the injustice that we have  to solve not just because of our politics, but because our system will  not survive if we don't.   I believe in that system.   American capitalism has done great good for a great number of people.  It has given the average American a better standard of living than  anywhere else in the world, lifted millions out of poverty, and powered  our globe. But its current iteration is badly broken, and the sooner we  admit it, the sooner we can strip it to the studs and build something  better.   A moral capitalism is judged not just by how much it produces, but by  how widely it shares, how much good it does for how many, and how well  it takes care of each and every single one of us.                            ____________________
