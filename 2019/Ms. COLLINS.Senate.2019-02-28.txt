 I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the resolution  that I am joining Senator Udall in introducing. It would reverse the  President's ill-advised decision to declare a national emergency and  commandeer funding provided for other purposes by Congress and instead  redirect it to construct a wall on our southern border.   I thank Senator Udall for his leadership and also recognize the  support we have received from our cosponsors, Senator Murkowski and  Senator Shaheen.   Let me be clear. The question before us is not whether to support or  oppose the wall. It is not whether to support or oppose President  Trump. Rather, it is this: Do we want the executive branch now or in  the future to hold a power that the Founders deliberately entrusted to  Congress?   It has been said that Congress's most precious power is the power of  the purse set out in plain language in article I, section 9 of our  Constitution. It reads as follows: ``No money shall be drawn from the  Treasury but in consequence of Appropriations made by law.''   Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist 72, made clear the Founders' view  that only the legislative branch commands this power, not the judiciary  and not the executive. James Madison, in Federalist 58, called the  power of the purse ``the most complete and effectual weapon with which  any constitution can arm the [ . . . ] representatives of the people.''   Congress's power was jealously guarded in the early days of our  Republic. No less an authority on our constitutional framework than  Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, in his famous ``Commentaries,''  explained that ``[i]f it were otherwise, the executive would possess an  unbounded power over the public purse of the nation, and might apply  all its monied resources at his pleasure.''   Throughout our history, the courts have consistently held that ``only  Congress is empowered by the Constitution to adopt laws directing  monies to be spent from the U.S. treasury.''   I strongly support protecting the institutional prerogatives of the  U.S. Senate and the system of checks and balances that is central to  the structure of our government.   I support funding for better border security, including physical  barriers where they make sense. I understand the President is  disappointed that the funding he requested did not pass, but the  failure of Congress to pass funding in the amount the President prefers  cannot become an excuse for the President to usurp the powers of the  legislative branch.   This is not the first time I have made this argument against  Executive overreach. In 2015, I authored the Immigration Rule of Law  Act, legislation that would have provided a statutory basis for the  Dreamer population, while rolling back President Obama's 2014 Executive  orders expanding that program.   As I explained at the time, even though I supported comprehensive  immigration reform and was disappointed that it had not passed, I  rejected the notion that its failure could serve as the justification  for President Obama to implement by Executive fiat that which Congress  had refused to pass, regardless of the wisdom of Congress's decision.   I would now like to turn to a discussion of the National Emergencies  Act. This act was passed in 1976 to standardize the process by which  the President can invoke national emergency powers and Congress can  terminate the declaration through a joint resolution such as the one we  are introducing today.  [[Page S1602]]    The act is procedural in nature. It lays out the process the  President must follow to declare a national emergency but does not  provide the President with any additional powers. Instead, it requires  the President to specify where, in existing law, he has been granted  the authority for the powers he intends to exercise.   By itself, the National Emergencies Act does not give the President  the power to repurpose billions of dollars to build a wall. The  President must look elsewhere for that authority.   In his declaration, the President cites the authority provided by  title 10, section 2808 of the U.S. Code, which relates to  ``Construction authority in the event of a declaration of war or  national emergency.'' But that authorization applies only to ``military  construction projects'' that are ``necessary to support [the] use of  the armed forces.'' I do not believe this provision can be fairly read  to bootstrap the presence of troops along the southern border into the  authority to build a wall as a military construction project.   The question isn't whether the President can act in an emergency but  whether he can do so in a manner that would undermine the congressional  power of the purse.   Here, I think we need a better understanding of what should qualify  as an emergency. One place we could turn is to a five-part test  originally developed by the Office of Management and Budget in 1991,  under former President George Herbert Walker Bush, to determine whether  requested funding merited an ``emergency spending'' designation under  our budget rules.   Under that test, a spending request was designated as an  ``emergency'' only if all five of the following conditions were met:   First, expenditures had to be necessary; second, the need had to be  sudden, coming into being quickly, not building up over time; third,  the need had to be urgent; fourth, the need had to be unforeseen; and  fifth, the need could not be permanent.   I raise this test only by way of analogy, but it is fair to say that  whether or not you agree with the President that more should be done to  secure the southern border--and I do agree with the President's goal-- his decision to fund a border wall through a national emergency  declaration would not pass this five-part test.   The President's declaration also has practical implications for the  military construction appropriations process, as my colleague has  pointed out.   Last year, in testimony before the Appropriations Committee, the  Department of Defense said that the President's budget request for  military construction funding was crucial to support our national  defense, including construction projects to improve military readiness  and increase the lethality of the force. This includes missile defense,  improved facilities in Europe to deter Russian aggression, and  infrastructure to operationalize the F-35 stealth fighter.   This also included several important efforts at the Portsmouth Naval  Shipyard in Maine that are vital to the Navy conducting timely  maintenance and refueling of our Nation's submarines. Shifting funding  away from these vital projects is shortsighted and could have very real  national security implications.   We must defend Congress's institutional powers, as the Founders hoped  we would, even when doing so is inconvenient or goes against the  outcome we might prefer.   The gridlock we have experienced on difficult issues like border  security and immigration reform is not simply a failure to get our work  done but a reflection of the fact that we have yet to reach a  consensus.   The President's emergency declaration is ill-advised precisely  because it attempts to shortcut the process of checks and balances by  usurping Congress's authority. This resolution blocks that overreach,  and I hope, regardless of our colleague's position on the construction  of the border wall, that we will join together to assert Congress's  constitutional authority in the appropriations process.   I urge our colleagues to support this important resolution.    I would be happy to.    Mr. President, I would thank the Senator for his  gracious comments. As always, it has been a great pleasure to work with  him, and I know he cares deeply about the constitutional principle that  brings us to the floor today. Let us defend the Constitution.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the resolution  that I am joining Senator Udall in introducing.
