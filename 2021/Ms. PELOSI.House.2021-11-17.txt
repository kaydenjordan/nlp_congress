 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his recognition  and for his distinguished service as the chair of the Ethics Committee.  I call it by its official name having served there for 7 years myself.   Madam Speaker, I rise today as the Speaker of the House of  Representatives, an institution that was designed by our Founders to be  the people's House, a House constantly invigorated by its  accountability to the people every year. It is a place where slavery  was abolished; a place where we have taken our men and women into  service to protect freedom and democracy throughout the world; and a  place where Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and so many  institutions meeting the needs of the American people were established.  The list goes on and on about the distinguished nature of the House of  Representatives.   Maybe 12- or 13,000 people have been elected to this body over time-- only a few hundred women--but all very distinguished, and great heroes  of our country have served in this institution including President  Abraham Lincoln. That was before the Chamber was the meeting ground.  Statuary Hall is the place where his desk is memorialized to this day.   So, Madam Speaker, when we come to this great institution, we  understand that there are 435 Members of Congress, but only one from  each district. Only one of us represents the thoughts, aspirations,  dreams, fears, and hopes of our constituents.                                time  1415    There is no bigger privilege for any one of us in the House, be it  Speaker, whip, leader, any of the titles that our caucuses may bestow  on us, that is as prestigious as saying that I speak for the people of  my district, in my case, the district of San Francisco.   So when we come here, we have a responsibility to uphold a high  standard of integrity, decency, and respect for this institution.   The Constitution charges us to be accountable to the people, and we  must represent the United States House of Representatives in a spirit  in which our constituents and all Americans should be very proud.   House rule XXIII provides for our Code of Official Conduct. This  provision of our rules requires that we ``shall behave at all times in  a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House.''   Sadly, extremely disturbing actions taken last week by a Member of  Congress, threatening another Member, wildly violate this standard.  These actions demand a response.   We cannot have Members joking about murdering each other or  threatening the President of the United States. This is both an  endangerment of our elected officials and an insult to the institution  of the House of Representatives.   It is not just about us as Members of Congress. It is the danger that  it represents to everyone in the country. If you are viewing this and  thinking, well, when you run for Congress, you get threats and the  rest. You don't expect to get them from your colleagues.   But, nonetheless, the example set in this House is one that is viewed  across the country. Women across the country particularly feel  vulnerable if insults of the nature that exist in this House are  allowed to stand. I will speak about that in a moment.   Again, when a Member uses his or her national platform to encourage  violence, tragically, people listen to those words and they may act  upon them. Words spoken by elected officials weigh a ton. People hear  them very differently.   As the resolution that the committee is putting forth states:  ``Depictions of violence can foment actual violence and jeopardize the  safety of elected officials, as witnessed in this Chamber on January 6,  2021.''   It is inconceivable that a member of our community here would wish to  repeat the violence of that dark day, that deadly day.   As a woman Speaker of the House, I want to be clear. These threats  specifically target a woman, a woman of color, which is part of, as the  resolution states, a ``global phenomenon meant to silence women and  discourage them from seeking positions of authority and participating  in public life.''   Again, this is about workplace harassment and violence against women.   Yet, the Member has never apologized for his actions. ``It's a  cartoon. Relax,'' he said.   Really? A cartoon? Relax?   And he wrote to supporters:         The hyperventilating and shrill accusations that this       cartoon is dangerous are laughable or intentionally       hyperbolic.    ``I am entitled to speak to the people and to do so in a manner that  is engaging,'' he said.   Really? Is it engaging to depict killing a colleague or anyone? It is  not just about Members of Congress; anyone, threatening anyone.   Disguising death threats against a Member of Congress and the  President of the United States in an animated video does not make those  death threats any less real or less serious. And indeed, conveying them  this way makes them potentially more dangerous by normalizing violence.   It isn't funny. And yes, you have a right to speak; and so do we have  a right to react to what you are saying when you are threatening the  lives of Members of Congress and the President of the United States.   It is sad that this entire House must take this step because of the  refusal of the leadership of the other party. Indeed, it took 9 days  before the minority leader publicly spoke out about this threat; and  when he did, he merely said:         It was not the Member's intent to ever harm anyone.    Really?   And many other Members on the other side of the aisle have refused to  strongly condemn these actions. One member of leadership said:  ``Unfortunately, in this world we are in right now, we all get death  threats, no matter what the issue is.   Death threats from our colleagues? Death threats from Members of  Congress? We all get death threats?   So Members think it is okay to use their platforms to directly  encourage more death threats against their own colleagues?   The resolution on the floor today is about accountability. It is  about integrity in this House. And it will serve as a reminder to this  Congress and to this country that the House is committed to upholding  the highest standards of decorum in all that we do, as is said in rule  XXIII, ``shall behave at all times in a manner that shall reflect  creditably on the House.''   In our actions, we must be mindful of all who make up our  congressional community, including not only Members, but also the  committees, the committee staff, the institutional staff--and thank you  for your service--the custodians of the Capitol, the Capitol Police,  and others.   As we proceed to make progress for the people, let us be guided by  our love of this institution, respect for this institution in which we  serve and, again, an example that we wish to show to the world.   Again, a threat against anyone is wrong, whether you are a Member of  [[Page H6338]]  Congress or not. So this is just about the example, again, that is  total violation by the action of the Member.   Yes, indeed, Madam Speaker, it is a sad day for the House of  Representatives, but a necessary day, so that we can, again, behave at  all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House.   Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman, again. I thank  Congresswoman Jackie Speier for her leadership in bringing this  legislation forward, this resolution forward.
