 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this critical  resolution reversing a rule tainted by conflicts of interest and  callous disregard for the communities most affected.   As hundreds of thousands take to the streets, as the cries for a  reckoning with this Nation's past and present grow louder, this  administration believes that the future is further deregulation.   Today, we reject the administration's position that it is banks that  are deserving of our time and sympathy as further relief funding is  denied to millions of struggling families.   There is no separating the history of banking from the history of  racism in this country. Wall Street, our Nation's financial capital, is  named after a structure erected by enslaved people and then served as a  site where they were bought and sold.   Today, we have predatory lenders set up in Black communities, where  systems of oppression ensure a steady stream of customers, communities  that banks have decided are simply not worth their time or their  business.   The Community Reinvestment Act reflects, and is a direct response to  this history, and aims to reverse course.   I urge all of my colleagues to acknowledge the decades of divestment  from our communities and to support this crucial civil rights  legislation.
