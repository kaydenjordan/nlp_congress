 Madam Speaker, anyone who believes in human  rights should support giving care to every infant born alive, even  after an abortion attempt.   This bill ensures that any child who is born as the result of an  attempted abortion--a child who is literally outside of the mother's  womb--is cared for just like any other newborn baby.   Regardless of our differences on the issue of life, I think all of us  can come together to protect the lives of children who are already  born.   We have seen horrible cases where the lives of children were ended  immediately after being born, or even neglected and left to die, as in  Kermit Gosnell's clinic.   Today I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and protect our  Nation's children from violence by voting for this important piece of  legislation.
