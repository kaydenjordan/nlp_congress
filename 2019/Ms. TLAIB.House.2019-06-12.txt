 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the anniversary of the Pulse  nightclub tragedy to remember those who lost their lives on that  horrific night.   It should not be lost that this happened at an LGBTQ nightclub during  Latino night and that those who lost their lives were mostly our Brown  and Black neighbors.   Just this weekend, I joined community members, advocates, and local  elected officials to demand action on gun violence in our country.  Hundreds of us gathered for this rally across the street from where  organizers were getting ready to open Motor City Pride, Detroit's Pride  celebration attracting tens of thousands of people wanting to celebrate  the community and recommit to the fight for justice for our LGBTQ  neighbors.   A few hours after the gun violence rally wrapped up and Motor City  Pride opened, armed neo-Nazis right outside of the gates of the  festival taunted attendants, creating an unsafe environment for all of  us.   I bring this up because the fight against gun violence is  intersectional. The fight against hate is intersectional.   Let us remember those who have been lost to gun violence. Let us  remember those at Pulse. Remember those at Stonewall Douglas.   I commend our people who have taken action out of the tragedy that  shouldn't have happened at all. It is time for us elected officials in  this Chamber to do what we can to stop gun violence and hate in this  country.                            ____________________
