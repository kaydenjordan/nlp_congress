 Madam President, I rise today to introduce the  Educational Opportunity and Success Act, which would reauthorize and  strengthen the Federal TRIO Programs. I want to thank Senators Tester,  Capito, and Baldwin for being original cosponsors. Senator Tester and I  are cochairs of the Congressional TRIO Caucus.   I have been a longtime champion of TRIO, which helps students get the  supports they need to prepare for, succeed in, and graduate from  college. Prior to my election to the Senate, I worked at Husson  University in Bangor, many of whose students are the first in their  families to go to college, and I saw firsthand the importance of  programs like TRIO.   Maine's 30 TRIO Programs serve more than 7,500 students throughout  the State and are focused on increasing educational opportunities for  first-generation and low-income students, as well as students with  disabilities. I have been inspired by the stories of TRIO students from  all across Maine and have seen how TRIO opens doors to the  opportunities that come with pursuing and completing postsecondary  education.   For example, Myles Ouellette, who currently resides in Van Buren, ME,  credits TRIO not only with helping him to complete postsecondary  education but also with saving his life. Myles participated in Upward  Bound and Educational Talent Search at Van Buren High School. He  enlisted in the Army after high school and developed an addiction to  painkillers following an injury. After being released from prison, he  enrolled in the University of Maine at Augusta, where he participated  in the TRIO Student Support Services Program. With help and support  from this program, Myles earned a bachelor's degree in applied science.  He then went on to complete an MBA in healthcare management from Husson  University. According to Myles, Maine TRIO helped him find his life's  purpose and empowered him to reach his full potential.   Congress created the TRIO Programs because it recognized that low- income, first-generation college students often face significant  obstacles in accessing and completing higher education. Our bipartisan  bill would reauthorize these programs, modestly increase grant sizes,  and make it easier for administrators to reach students who would  benefit from TRIO. It updates the way that programs are evaluated and  streamlines the application process. In addition, the bill would  increase stipends for students participating in TRIO Programs and  create a new stipend for veterans participating in the Veterans Upward  Bound Program.   The Educational Opportunity and Success Act would also institute a  commonsense process for correcting TRIO applications with minor errors  and prevent the Department of Education from rejecting applications  simply on the basis of formatting criteria. In 2017, the Department  initially rejected dozens of Upward Bound applications based on  arbitrary, nonsubstantive formatting criteria, such as line-spacing and  font size irregularities. One of these applications was from the  University of Maine at Presque Isle, which had used one-and-a-half  spacing instead of double spacing in text appearing in graphics on 2 of  its application's 65 pages.   The Department's bureaucratic decision would have denied 960  disadvantaged Maine high school students the chance to fulfill their  academic potential. After months of advocacy, I worked with the  Department and my Appropriations colleagues to reverse this ill- conceived policy, and the University of Maine at Presque Isle received  a well-deserved TRIO grant to serve those students.   TRIO Programs have changed the lives of first-generation students in  Maine and across the country. The Educational Opportunity and Success  Act would improve these important programs and help ensure they are  reaching the students who need them most. I urge my colleagues to  support this bipartisan bill.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to introduce the  Educational Opportunity and Success Act, which would reauthorize and  strengthen the Federal TRIO Programs.
