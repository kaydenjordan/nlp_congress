 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, if I came to the Senate floor each day and  told the story of another victim of gun violence in the city of  Chicago, it would be a full-time job. Trend lines are improving ever so  slightly, but the deaths from gun violence in that great city continue  to break our hearts. Hardly a day, a week, or month goes by that we  don't hear another story of some child, innocent bystander, infant, or  elderly person victimized by gun violence. Last week, there was an  extraordinary event which captured the hearts of the people of Chicago  and Illinois.   This Monday afternoon, hundreds of police officers from Chicago and  Northern Illinois--and some from as far away as Boston and New York-- stood at solemn attention, lining the roadways around the Shrine of Our  Lady of Guadalupe in the Chicago suburb of Des Plaines.   The night before, a powerful blizzard had dumped 7 inches of snow in  the Chicago area. It was very cold, but it was not cold air that caused  many of the officers gathered outside the chapel to feel numb. It was  grief. They had come to pay their respects to a fallen brother and  hero.   Chicago police officer Samuel Jimenez was shot and killed a week  earlier when he tried to stop a shooting at Mercy Hospital & Medical  Center on the city's South Side.   I am going to put this array of photos up because I want to address  each and every one of them, the individuals on there. This is Officer  Jimenez. He was 28 years old, married to his high school sweetheart,  the loving father of three little kids.   Killed in the same shooting were these two women: Dr. Tamara O'Neal,  an emergency room physician, and Dayna Less, a first-year pharmacy  resident. Both women worked at Mercy Hospital. The man who shot all  three of them also died, from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the  head.   Let me speak of this hero and these healers for a moment. Officer  Samuel Jimenez was 28 years old, married to his high school sweetheart,  Crystal. Together, they had three children--two little girls and a boy.  Friends said his eyes lit up whenever anyone asked him about his kids.   Officer Jimenez had been a member of the Chicago Police Department  for less than 2 years. He had already earned two honorable mentions for  exceptional performance. He and his partner were in their patrol car  around 3:30 Monday afternoon, a week ago, November 19. A call came over  the police radio about an active shooter at Mercy Hospital. The gunman  shot Dr. O'Neal in the parking lot and then ran into the hospital.  Officer Jimenez followed. He was shot and killed in the hospital lobby.   The gunman shot Ms. Less as she stepped off an elevator. He then shot  and killed himself, after first being shot by a Chicago policeman.   At the funeral, Officer Jimenez was remembered as a loving husband,  father, and friend, and as dedicated to protecting others. He grew up  in Northwest Chicago, the youngest of nine children. Before joining the  police department, he worked at Dunkin' Donuts, bused tables at  Moretti's Ristorante & Pizzeria. He even delivered mail in the suburbs.  His instructors and classmates at the police training academy  remembered him as a stellar recruit, always eager to lend a hand,  always there with a warm hello.   He completed his 13-month probationary period with the police  department just last August. Officer Jimenez and his partner didn't  have to respond at Mercy Hospital. You see, that hospital was outside  the district they were assigned to, but they went anyway, not even  hesitating for a second because they knew people were in danger.   Dr. Tamara O'Neal was an emergency room doctor. That is one of the  hardest, most stressful jobs in the hospital. Dr. O'Neal picked that  profession because she thought it was where she could do the most good  for people who needed help. She was 38 years old. She joined the staff  of Mercy Hospital less than 3 months ago, after a 3-year residency at  the University of Illinois at Chicago--the same school where she earned  her medical degree.   Her colleagues remember her for her outgoing personality and her  willingness to go out of her way to help others. They say she used to  stay long after her shift ended to make sure her patients were taken  care of. She was also a woman of great faith. She was the choir  director of her church in Indiana, and she drove there every Sunday--60  miles each way--to lead the congregation in song. Her brother was the  pastor of the church. Dr. O'Neal helped raise money every year to buy  school supplies for children in the church whose families were strapped  for money. She loved taking her nieces and nephews into the city of  Chicago to show them new attractions, new restaurants.   Dayna Less was 24 years old. Had the shooting happened 1 day later,  she would still be alive. She was leaving that next day to spend  Thanksgiving in Indiana with her family. She graduated from pharmacy  school at Purdue last May, after 6 years of study.   She was engaged to be married in June to a young man she met at  church camp when they were both just 9 years old. Dayna Less loved the  Chicago Cubs, working at Mercy Hospital, and traveling.   Before coming to Mercy, she spent 8 weeks on pharmacy rotation in  Kenya. She wrote about her experiences there in a blog. This is part of  what she wrote:         Watching patients die from things that would 100 percent be       treatable in the US is extremely disheartening.        It's been very important for me to focus on the positive       things we are doing here because it can be difficult to see       how we are making a difference. But, it's worth it when you       fight for something and it actually happens! Even if it's as       small as making sure a patient gets their medication, we are       doing something that matters.   [[Page S7149]]     Officer Jimenez, Dr. O'Neal, and Ms. Less were all doing work that  mattered and mattered greatly. All three were dedicated to helping  others--Officer Jimenez as a protector, Dr. O'Neal and Ms. Less as  healers.   Their deaths have left their friends and families, the Chicago Police  Department, and all of the city of Chicago stunned and grieving. There  is never--never--a good time to lose a family member to violence but to  lose them during the holiday season seems especially cruel. Our hearts  go out to Officer Jimenez's family and to the O'Neal and Less families.   Officer Jimenez was the second Chicago police officer killed in the  line of duty this year. Last February, the day before Valentine's Day,  District Commander Paul Bauer was fatally shot in downtown Chicago. Gun  violence against police officers is not just a problem in the city of  Chicago; it is a problem across America. It is getting worse.   We all remember the horrific ambush of Dallas police officers in July  2016. Five officers were killed and nine others were injured by a  sniper. Since then, 132 police officers have been shot and killed in  the line of duty in cities and towns across our country. These are  intentional shootings. They are not accidents.   We have seen intentional killings at churches, synagogues, schools,  and as we have learned so painfully in the city of Chicago, hospitals.  We are seeing an increase in shootings in these locations.   In 2016, U.S. hospitals spent $1.1 billion to try to make their  hospital grounds safer. Think about that: more than $1 billion--not to  cure an illness, not to alleviate suffering but to protect the patients  and professionals at hospitals across America from this horrific gun  violence that shook the city of Chicago last week. Imagine if that $1  billion would have been spent on healing and keeping people healthy.   Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich was the main celebrant at Officer  Jimenez's funeral. I want to read part of what he told the mourners who  filled Our Lady of Guadalupe. He said of those in law enforcement:         Every day they get up, leave their homes and family to       watch out for us.        I think that maybe the best way that we can console each       other and also express our gratitude for the sacrifice that       has been given in the death of Officer Jimenez is as       citizens, remember that law enforcement wants us all to live       together, to watch out for each other, care for each other,       and then maybe we will make their jobs easier.    He added:         And maybe, there will not be another death of an officer       because all of us are taking responsibility for watching out       for one another.    It is not unusual for the people of Chicago to rightfully say to me,  their U.S. Senator: What are you going to do about this? What are you  going to do to reduce gun violence in the United States?   Does the Second Amendment to the Constitution create this burden on  us today, where we have to accept wanton gun violence as part of  someone's constitutional right? Of course not. Those who misuse guns,  those who do not store them or use them properly and legally should be  held accountable. Why then can't we pass basic legislation in this  Congress? Why can't we pass a bill to keep guns out of the hands of  people who are unqualified to own them or people who are unstable and  should never be given a gun? Why can't we make certain that weapons  that are military weapons, that have little or no application when it  comes to sport or hunting, are not sold to everyone, right and left, in  the United States?   I heard recently, there were 11 million AR-15s--a military-style  weapon--that are circulating in the United States of America. Does  anyone, in their wildest imagination, think that is what the Founding  Fathers had in mind when they talked about the right to bear arms; that  people would have these deadly military weapons and they would be used  so often?   I will be very candid with you, having served in the House and served  in the Senate for a number of years, the prospects of passing  meaningful gun safety legislation are minimal. There are two things  that can make a difference. For one, if the police and law enforcement  officers across the United States stood as one and demanded of Congress  there be gun safety measures to make their lives safer, it would be  happen. Law enforcement could be the inspiration and the political  motivation for Congress to act.   Secondly, I know thousands of law-abiding gun owners in the State of  Illinois. I grew up in a family--my family and others--where owning a  firearm was considered part of life. It was what people did so they  could go hunting in a proper way, a legal way. If those legitimate gun  owners--sportsmen, hunters, and those who keep them for self-defense-- would step up and say we need to draw clear lines for those who abuse  firearms and those who are using them to kill innocent people, that,  too, could make a difference. Think of that. If the law enforcement  community and gun owners who accept responsibility for that firearm  came together and demanded Congress pass measures to keep guns out of  the hands of those who kill our policemen, threaten our law enforcement  officers, and hurt innocent people like the doctor and this pharmacy  resident, it would make a significant difference.   Until that happens, we will come and make speeches on the floor of  the Senate. We will issue press releases. We will attend funerals. We  will offer our thoughts and our prayers, but I think it is time for  more. I think it is time for this Nation to step up and do something  significant, to not just stop and demand that we bring an end to gun  violence in Chicago and other cities but make this a safer world for  our children.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, there was a classified briefing this  morning that Members of the Senate were invited to on a bipartisan  basis, Democrats and Republicans. It is rare. We don't do it very  often. We do it when there is an important issue of national security  and something else of great moment.   What we came to discuss today was Saudi Arabia, and that discussion  really focused on our guests--the Secretary of State, Mr. Pompeo, and  the Secretary of Defense, Mr. Mattis. They talked to us about our  relationship with Saudi Arabia, for obvious reasons. Hardly anyone in  the world could have missed what happened over the last several weeks  when a man named  [[Page S7158]]  Khashoggi went into the consulate for Saudi Arabia in Istanbul and  never came out.   We have a videotape that shows the Saudi citizen and American  resident entering that building. For the longest time, there was a  debate as to what actually happened to him. All sorts of stories were  manufactured and fabricated. It turned out that the Turks had access to  audio recordings of what actually happened inside that consulate. They  eventually made them public, released them to the Government of Saudi  Arabia as well as to the United States, and we came to learn that Mr.  Khashoggi, a frequent critic of the Saudi royal family, was murdered.  He walked into that consulate and never walked out alive. Some group  flew in from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, ambushed him, killed him, and, as  hard it may be to believe, brought with them a bone saw so they could  dismember him and take parts of his body out to be destroyed and buried  somewhere in Turkey.   That story eventually emerged, and President Trump was confronted  repeatedly: What are we going to do about this?   Saudi Arabia is supposed to be one of our allies. We have arms  agreements with them. We are involved in a lot of things relative to  energy and national security. For the longest time, the President was  dismissive, saying: I have spoken to the royal family, and they have  denied they had anything to do with it.   Well, that excuse worked for a while but not very long. Once the  recordings were released by the Turks, once the world came to grips  with what actually happened to Mr. Khashoggi, serious questions were  raised about this outrageous abuse of human rights at the hands of the  Saudi regime.   There is a lot of speculation back and forth about who ordered it and  who knew about it. Those questions may never be answered. But we do  know that some 15 to 17 people close to the Crown Prince in Saudi  Arabia have been implicated to the point where the Trump administration  finally acknowledged that we have to do something. We have to take a  stand even when it involves a country that has been our ally in many  circumstances.   If you read the history of Saudi Arabia's relationship with the  United States, it has a lot to do with oil. For the longest time, we  counted on the Middle East for oil. We looked the other way. We helped  them, and they made a fortune in the process. The opulence of the  royalty in Saudi Arabia rivals any royalty in the modern world, and the  lavish lifestyles of the Saudi princes as they travel around the world  has been well documented.   The United States has looked the other way many times because we  needed the oil or we needed them as a strategic ally or a strategic  partner. Those times have changed in some respects. We are becoming  more energy independent. We are not as dependent on Saudi Arabia as we  once were for energy supplies to fuel our economy.   In the meantime, something else has happened within the Kingdom.  There has been a transition of power to the Crown Prince, who is known  as MBS. He is a young man in his thirties, and he announced when he  came to power that he was going to make some real changes in Saudi  Arabia. One big breakthrough he announced was that women would be  allowed to drive cars. In the West, it is almost comical to think of  that as a concession, but in Saudi Arabia, that is progress in a  country that has been slow to give women recognition in roles they  deserve.   Then he got engaged in foreign policy and started doing things that  were hard to explain, one after the other. One of them was the decision  to take the Prime Minister of Lebanon, Mr. Harari, and, basically, to  put him under house arrest when he visited from Lebanon in the Royal  Kingdom and, then, to have a confrontational relationship with Qatar, a  country that we rely on for our military basing and support in the  region. Then, of course, there is what brings us to the floor later  this afternoon for an important--maybe historic--vote. He decided that  the Saudis would invade Yemen because they believed the Iranians were  establishing a power base there and because there was aggression from  Yemen against Saudi Arabia.   That decision to begin this war in Yemen sometime in the recent past  resulted in outcomes that no one could have predicted. There are about  28 million people who live in Yemen. We estimate that 14 million of  them, half of the people living in that country, are subjected now to a  famine that threatens their very lives. We know that over 80,000  children have been killed so far in the war in Yemen.   What is the role of the United States? Well, it is hard to define it  in specific terms. At one point--I think it has been discontinued now-- we were fueling the bombers the Saudis sent into Yemen, releasing the  bombs that killed civilian populations and other innocent people. At  one point--I think it is still the case--we were assisting them in  targeting the areas in Yemen where they were going to drop their bombs.   So the United States has not been on the sidelines. We have been  involved. Our military, the best in the world, has been involved in  helping the Saudis with this invasion of Yemen. They have discontinued,  I understand, the fueling mission, but other things continue.   The question we have to ask ourselves now is this: Why are we there?  By what constitutional authority? It is this little book here that is  supposed to guide our conduct. By what constitutional authority is this  administration and the Department of Defense waging a war in Yemen? It  isn't because of any vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate or the House  of Representatives, though the Constitution is explicit that the  declaration of war is in the hands of Congress--really, in the hands of  the American people through Congress. In this case, whatever is going  on in Yemen has never been expressly approved.   What they hearkened back to was a measure that was passed on the  floor of the Senate 17 years ago, and I remember because I was here. It  was after 9/11. Who will ever forget that? Three thousand innocent  Americans were killed by terrorists who crashed planes into the World  Trade Center in New York and into a field in Pennsylvania. Do you know  the nationality of the terrorists who were on those planes, the ones  who commandeered them and killed those innocent Americans? Saudis. They  were all Saudis.   Yet we passed this resolution saying the United States can use force  to retaliate against them, and I voted for it. We found them in  Afghanistan. We went after them. But could anyone have possibly  imagined that that vote 17 years ago gave authority to our government  today to engage in a war in Yemen?   True, there are terrorists on the ground in almost every country in  the Middle East, and you could justify our military involvement by  saying we are fighting terrorism. But let's be honest. This  Constitution did not want a generic declaration of war. It wanted us to  be careful when we chose those battlegrounds.   So today we had a briefing by the Secretary of State, Mr. Pompeo,  which I cannot recount in detail because it was in a classified  setting, but we do know this. This morning, that same Secretary of  State authored an article in the Wall Street Journal about this issue.  It is entitled ``The U.S.-Saudi Partnership is Vital,'' by Secretary of  State Mike Pompeo. I would like to read the opening paragraph of  Secretary of State Pompeo's statement. When it comes to our  relationship with Saudi Arabia and the war in Yemen, here is what he  wrote:         The Trump administration's effort to rebuild the U.S.-Saudi       Arabia partnership isn't popular in the salons of Washington,       where politicians of both parties have long used the       kingdom's human-rights record to call for the alliance's       downgrading. The October murder of Saudi national Jamal       Khashoggi in Turkey has heightened the Capitol Hill       caterwauling and media pile-on. But degrading U.S.-Saudi ties       would be a grave mistake for the national security of the       U.S. and its allies.    It is a long article. Read it in its entirety and draw your own  conclusions, but the first paragraph sets the tone. We are not  discussing our role with Saudi Arabia in the salons of Washington. We  are discussing them on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Why? Because we  were elected to do just that.   The American people entrust us with the foreign policy of the United  States and decisions that need to be made  [[Page S7159]]  about whether we commit American tax dollars or American lives in a  military conflict. It isn't some group of academics in a salon. It is  Members of the U.S. Senate, duly elected, who are facing their  responsibility to debate it today.   Listen to these terms that the Secretary of State uses: ``The October  murder of Saudi national Jamal Khashoggi has heightened the Capitol  Hill caterwauling and media pile-on.''   ``Caterwauling''--you don't run into that word much, do you? I went  to look it up to make sure I understood it. It is the shrieking of cats  when they are in a fight.   So the national reaction--the international reaction--to the cold- blooded murder of an American resident, a Saudi citizen and the  dismemberment of his body and its disposal in ways we couldn't even  explain is ``caterwauling''? To me, it is a reflection of your values,  and, rightfully, people around the world are protesting that this sort  of activity could happen.   That is why we are bringing this measure before the Senate this  afternoon. I see my colleague from Indiana is here. I thank him for his  leadership.   I will close with this. I am reluctant to display this picture,  though it was on the front page of a major newspaper in the United  States. But I want those who wonder why we are in this debate and why  we are caterwauling about this assassination of Mr. Khashoggi to  understand what is really the issue that we are debating and voting on.   Amal Hussain died at the age of 7 in Yemen. ``My heart is broken,''  her mother said. She died just a few days after the picture was taken.  She is a victim of famine in Yemen. This is what the decision is all  about on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Will we continue to expend  American taxpayer dollars--even American lives--in support of the Saudi  regime and their invasion in the war in Yemen?   I understand the threat of Iran, and I understand we have to stand up  to their aggression when and where it takes place. But did we enlist in  this war? Did the American people have a national debate about this  war? Did we vote in the Senate to engage in this war? The answer is,  clearly, no.   I will be supporting this resolution that will be coming before us  this afternoon. I thank my friend from Indiana for waiting an  additional moment while I completed my remarks.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3671         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
