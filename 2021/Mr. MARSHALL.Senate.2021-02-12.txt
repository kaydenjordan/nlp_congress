 Mr. President, I send a question to the desk.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas, Mr. Marshall, has  a question for the counsel for the former President.   The clerk will read the question.   The legislative clerk read as follows:         The House Managers' single Article of Impeachment is       centered on the accusation that President Trump singularly       incited a crowd into a riot. Didn't the House managers'       contradict their own charge by outlining the premeditated       nature and planning of this event and by also showing the       crowd was gathered at the Capitol even before the speech       started and barriers were pushed over some 20 minutes before       the conclusion of President Trump's speech?    Mr. Counsel VAN DER VEEN. Yes. The House managers contradicted their  own charge by outlining the premeditated nature and planning of this  event and by also showing the crowd gathered at the Capitol, even  before the speech started, and barriers were pushed over some 20  minutes before the conclusion of President Trump's speech. The answer  is yes.   And I want to take the rest of my time to go back to the last  question because it was completely missed by the House managers.   Brandenburg v. Ohio is an incitement case. It is not an elected  official case. That is Wood and Bond. And the whole problem that the  House managers have in understanding the First Amendment argument here  is that elected officials are different than anybody else. He is  talking about fire chiefs. Fire chiefs are not elected officials.  Police officers aren't elected officials.   Elected officials have a different, a higher standard on the holdings  that I gave you--the highest protections, I should say. It is not a  higher standard. It is a higher protection to your speech because of  the importance of political dialogue. Because of what you all say in  your public debate about policy, about the things that affect all of  our lives, that is really important stuff, and you should be free to  talk about that in just about any way that you can.   Brandenburg comes into play, from a constitutional analysis  perspective, when you are talking about incitement. Is the speech  itself inciteful to riot or lawlessness--one of the two--and the answer  here is no.   In Brandenburg, through--again, Bible Believers require you to look  at the words of the speech. You actually can't go outside the words of  the speech. You are not allowed to in the analysis.   So all the time they are trying to spend on tweets going back to 2015  or everything they want to focus on that was said in the hours and the  days afterward are not applicable or relevant to the scholastic inquiry  as to how the First Amendment is applied in this Chamber in this  proceeding. So, again, we need to be focused on what is the law and  then how do we apply it to this set of facts.   So it is important to have that understanding that elected officials  and fire chiefs are treated differently under First Amendment law, and  that is to the benefit of you all, which is to the benefit of us all  because we do want you to be able to speak freely without fear that the  majority party is going to come in and impeach you or come in and  prosecute you to try to take away your seat where you sit now. That is  not what the Constitution says should be done.   But, yes, they do. They do contradict themselves, of course.   Thank you.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.
