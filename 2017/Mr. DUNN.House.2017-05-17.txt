 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Thin Blue Line  Act, which will make murder or attempted murder of a law enforcement  officer, or first responders, an aggravating factor in death penalty  determinations.   The officers of the thin blue line put their lives at risk every day  and are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice so that we can rest easy  at night. Our law enforcement and first responders run into danger so  that others can run away from it. They do this despite the rise in  violence against them.   We have witnessed a 167 percent increase in ambush-style killings of  police officers in 2016 alone. This is tragic, and it is unacceptable.   The Thin Blue Line Act will hold cop killers accountable and seek  justice for those murdered in the line of duty, and it will show our  resolve as citizens to protect the officers who have sworn to protect  us.   During this week, National Police Week, we can also show our  gratitude to law enforcement and their families by passing the Thin  Blue Line Act. It is an honor to represent them in Congress.
