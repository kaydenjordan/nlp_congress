 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my disappointment  [[Page H8943]]  that, once again, Congress is kicking the can down the road and putting  off properly funding the government by another month.   I urge my colleagues to recognize government funding affects the  lives of millions of Americans: USDA officials inspect our Thanksgiving  turkeys; postal workers deliver our holiday cards and packages; TSA  agents and air traffic controllers keep us safe to fly home for the  holidays. Not to mention, millions of Federal employees rely on a  steady income, especially during the expensive holiday season.   This is unfair to Americans. Clearly, all Americans are affected by  Congress' inability to pass a budget. That is why I introduced the End  Government Shutdowns Act, which safeguards against the damaging  consequences of shutdowns. It lifts the shutdown burden from the  shoulders of Americans and incentivizes lawmakers to reach across the  aisle and do our jobs.   Americans want to see us come together and find bipartisan solutions  to our Nation's most challenging funding problems. My bill does just  that.                            ____________________
