 Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate advanced H.R.  2430, the FDA Reauthorization Act. This bipartisan, bicameral  legislation ensures Americans will continue to have access to safe  medications and the FDA has the tools they need to continue our  Nation's approval process remains the gold standard. I am also pleased  to see tropical disease priority review voucher state that a sponsor  qualifies for a neglected tropical disease priority review voucher  under existing law until September 30, 2017, so long as they submit at  least one portion of a human drug application by that date.   I would like to ask Senator Isakson if it is our intention to allow  for sponsors who have been working in good faith with the Food and Drug  Administration on a human drug application for a product that addresses  a neglected tropical disease to qualify for a priority review voucher,  as long as they begin a rolling submission to the agency by September  30, 2017?    Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Isakson,  for clarifying the language. It is important to provide this clarity to  ensure products, for which at least one portion of the application is  submitted in accordance with Section 506(d) of the Food, Drug &  Cosmetic Act by September 30, 2017, qualify for the vouchers under  current law.
