 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to tell the story, very  briefly, of little 4-year-old Maleah Davis, who has now been missing  for almost 2 weeks.   Just a few days ago, it was said that her dad was taking her and her  younger brother to the airport. All of a sudden, he says she was  kidnapped.   This is a little girl who was taken away from this family by CPS last  year and, unfortunately, returned to that family by a judge at the  beginning of this year. The little girl was abused and had brain  surgery.   All of a sudden, after being kidnapped, the story that was told by  the father was that he was unconscious from Friday to Saturday evening  at 6 p.m.   My heart has gone out to that family and that little girl.   I thank law enforcement in Texas and in Houston, along with Texas  EquuSearch and other volunteers who poured their hearts out to find  this little girl.   We now know that this individual is under arrest. Blood has been  found in the apartment. Other items or activity suggest that maybe that  wasn't the true story.   I believe, as the chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, we  must define how CPS returns children to their families, and there must  be national standards.   I pray for the little girl, and I pray for those who love her.                            ____________________
