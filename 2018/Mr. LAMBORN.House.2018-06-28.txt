 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the people of  Iran, who are sick and tired of living under the mullahs' rule and have  courageously taken to the streets across their country to demand  freedom and sound governance.   The Ayatollah's regime duped the Obama administration into a nuclear  deal in which they received a tremendous payout. The people of Iran  expected to benefit financially from the deal, but the regime  squandered everything on foreign wars at the expense of their citizens.   The Islamic regime funds the ongoing deadly tactics of Hamas and the  Palestinians, supports Bashar al-Assad of Syria, finances the ongoing  war in Yemen, builds rocket factories in Lebanon and Syria, and I could  go on and on.   Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are ideals that America  champions, the same ideals that the Iranian protestors are risking  their lives to achieve.   To this end, I support the Iranian people, as do the Trump  administration and the free world.                            ____________________
