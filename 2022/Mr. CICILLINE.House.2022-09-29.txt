 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Childhood  Cancer Awareness Month, to honor all those suffering and all those who  have lost loved ones, and to pay tribute to a remarkable Rhode  Islander.   Carrigan Nelson was diagnosed with a rare bone cancer, osteosarcoma,  in 2019. Unfortunately, her story is not unique. Every 3 minutes a  family receives the devastating news that their child has been  diagnosed with cancer.   And yet, Carrigan nearly lost access to her lifesaving care when she  lost her mother's employer-sponsored health insurance 1 month before  her chemotherapy was scheduled to end.   However, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, Carrigan's family was  able to enroll in Rhode Island's health insurance exchange, allowing  her to complete her treatment plan.   As we raise awareness about childhood cancer this month, and the  importance of screenings, early detection, and care--we must recommit  ourselves to ensuring that every single family has access to  affordable, quality care, and ensuring protections for individuals with  pre-existing conditions so that survivors like Carrigan will never be  denied the coverage and care they need.    I am honored to know and represent such a brave young woman and will  not stop fighting for Carrigan and every young person battling cancer.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   H.R. 3843 is a modest yet critical first step to modernizing the  antitrust laws. It generates revenue; it makes foreign adversarial  interests in transactions more apparent; and it allows more streamlined  antitrust enforcement by State attorneys general.   On the first issue, I think there is general agreement that the fees  that are involved in mergers haven't been raised in decades. This  simply allows smaller mergers to pay less and larger mergers to pay  more.   There is no question about it--this issue came up at the Committee on  Rules--this bill does not fund a single additional dollar to any  agency. This is a revenue generator. There is no appropriation. The  appropriations process will require that this be treated like any other  revenue the Federal Government generates, in that the Appropriations  Committee, in regular order, will decide how to spend the money.  [[Page H8255]]    People should also not be concerned because, under the Consolidated  Appropriations Act of 2022, the DOJ Antitrust Division's use of  appropriated funds is limited to ``expenses necessary for the  enforcement of antitrust and kindred laws.'' There is already a  limitation.   It doesn't provide any additional funding. It simply generates  revenues and shifts burdens to the largest transactions so that the  taxpayers don't have to be responsible for their review.   In recent decades, the rising tide of economic concentration has  given rise to monopolies that exercise outsized influence over our  democracy and our political institutions. At the same time, the budgets  for antitrust enforcement agencies have not kept pace with the demands  placed on them.   As Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council,  explained: ``It is unacceptable for these agencies' resources to lag so  far behind the growth of the economy they are charged with  protecting.'' That is why the Biden-Harris administration issued a  Statement of Administration Policy in support of this bill.   We can have the fight about whether additional resources are  necessary during the appropriations process. This bill simply raises  the fees, gives smaller businesses a break, and doesn't appropriate a  single dollar.   Title III of the bill strengthens antitrust enforcement by preventing  the State antitrust actions from being dragged into private litigation  in another venue.   This legislation enjoys wide support among the States. Last year, the  National Association of Attorneys General and every single State  attorney general in the United States wrote a letter urging Congress to  pass the bill's amendment to the multidistrict litigation statute ``as  soon as possible so that our citizens can benefit from more efficient,  effective, and timely adjudication of antitrust actions.''   Mr. Speaker, I, too, urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this  legislation, and I applaud them for their sponsorship. I thank Mr.  Buck, who has been a tremendous leader on this package of bills. There  should be no question. Senator Lee, Senator Cotton, and Senator  Grassley have said that this package represents ``a strong bipartisan  consensus.''    These bills improve antitrust enforcement without appropriating any  more funds. You don't have to believe me. Those are your Republican  colleagues who made the same point.   In addition to that, this multijurisdiction litigation robs State  attorneys general who bring a Federal antitrust action in Federal court  from the ability to litigate in that court, which often, by dragging  them to another State, is a great benefit to the big corporations, to  the monopolists, but it is harmful to their own constituents, their  consumers, their businesses, which is why they support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a number of items to reflect the  broad support enjoyed by H.R. 3843.   First, is a strong Statement of Administration Policy, which makes  clear this legislation is necessary to support the President's mission  to enforce the antitrust laws, to combat the excessive concentration of  industry, the abuse of market power, and the harmful effects of  monopoly and monopsony.   Second, is a letter of support for the State Antitrust Enforcement  Venue Act of 2021, signed by every attorney general in the United  States, including California's Rob Bonta, who makes clear that:  ``States should accordingly be on equal footing with Federal enforcers  in deciding where, when, and how to prosecute cases'' and not subject  to a system where their enforcement actions ``may be subject to  transfer to a multidistrict litigation at the request of the  defendant,'' where the cases are typically ``postponed and may be  joined with other lawsuits brought by private plaintiffs.''   Third, is a letter from a broad coalition of 36 labor, consumer, and  public interest groups, including Public Citizen, Public Knowledge,  Open Markets Institute, AFL-CIO, Teamsters, and SEIU, which states:  ``This bipartisan, bicameral legislation represents a critical first  step for Congress to reverse the course of lax antitrust enforcement  that has proved to be destructive to small businesses, workers,  communities, and innovation.''   Fourth, is a statement from Chris Jones of the National Grocers  Association, who says that: ``This bipartisan bill does not change the  antitrust laws; it takes the simple step of helping enforcers have a  better shot of deterring abusive marketplace conduct that American  consumers cannot afford right now.''   Finally, a statement from Diana Moss, president of the American  Antitrust Institute, states that: ``Additional resources are needed to  enable the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division and the  Federal Trade Commission to review and investigate billion-dollar  deals.''   For all of those reasons, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to  support this commonsense package that will help to enhance competition,  give us the ability to improve our economy, and benefit consumers,  workers, innovators, and small businesses.                    Statement of Administration Policy,   H.R. 3843--Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022--Rep. Neguse, D-                          CO, and 39 cosponsors         The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 3843, the       Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022.        Open, fair, and competitive markets are essential to the       welfare of American families, workers, farmers, and       businesses. As the President stated in his Executive Order on       Promoting Competition in the American Economy, ``it is the       policy of my Administration to enforce the antitrust laws to       combat the excessive concentration of industry, the abuses of       market power, and the harmful effects of monopoly and       monopsony.'' The Act would support this critical mission in       three important respects.        First, to vigorously enforce the antitrust laws, the       Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission       (FTC) need the resources to do their jobs. Yet even as the       number, size, and complexity of mergers has grown, the amount       oft he filing fees that parties must pay in advance of       premerger review by the DOJ and the FTC has not kept pace.       Moreover, both agencies' annual appropriations support many       fewer employees today than they did in 1979, even though the       economy has grown significantly since then, and even though       the agencies' core missions involve bringing complex cases       against some of the best-resourced companies in the world.        The Act would update the regime for merger filing fees to       make it fairer and better targeted. The Act would reduce the       size of the fees required for smaller transactions, while       raising them for the largest mergers that often require the       most extensive reviews.        Second, the Act would respect the important role of State       Attorneys General in Federal antitrust enforcement by       harmonizing the process for transferring antitrust cases       filed by State Attorneys General with those filed by Federal       agencies. This would increase the efficiency and efficacy of       antitrust enforcement.        Third and finally, the Act would require disclosure of       merger subsidies by foreign adversaries. Requiring disclosure       of foreign subsidies, such as by Chinese and Russian       entities, in the premerger notification process would assist       the DOJ and the FTC in preventing anticompetitive       transactions through which adversaries could gain influence       over important parts of the economy.        The Administration encourages the House to pass the       bipartisan Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022 and       looks forward to working with Congress on this important       legislation.                                   ____                                              National Association of                                               Attorneys General,                                      Washington, DC, June 18, 2021.

Re Support for the State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act of           2021         Dear Chairs Klobuchar and Cicilline and Ranking Members Lee       and Buck: We write to express our strong support for the       State Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act of 2021; H.R. 3460, S.       1787. State attorneys general around the country are actively       pursuing significant antitrust enforcement actions on behalf       of consumers in their respective states. Although these law       enforcement actions are brought in the public interest, they       may be subject to transfer to a multidistrict litigation at       the behest of defendants, where the cases are typically       postponed and may be joined with numerous other lawsuits       brought by private plaintiffs. Enforcement actions filed by       the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission on       behalf of the United States, however, cannot be transferred       to a multidistrict litigation. 28 U.S.C.  [[Page H8256]]       Sec. 1407(g). Federal enforcers are entitled to select and       remain in their preferred venue and pursue relief without       undue delay and distractions caused by the particularized       interests of private plaintiffs. State antitrust enforcement       actions should be extended the same protections from transfer       as those brought on behalf of the United States.        As Congress has recognized, the states play an essential       role in the enforcement of competition laws in the United       States. States should accordingly be on equal footing with       federal enforcers in deciding where, when, and how to       prosecute cases. We appreciate your sponsorship of the State       Antitrust Enforcement Venue Act of 2021 and advocate for its       passage as soon as possible so that our citizens can benefit       from more efficient, effective, and timely adjudication of       antitrust actions.

Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: We are writing to       urge you to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 3843, the Merger Filing Fee       Modernization Act of 2022. This bill will strengthen       enforcement of our antitrust laws by helping to inject much-      needed funds to the antitrust enforcement agencies, the       Department of Justice's Antitrust Division and the Federal       Trade Commission, and allow them to properly fulfill their       role safeguarding the economy and consumers from       anticompetitive conduct and harmful mergers. We task our       antitrust enforcers with a duty to protect us, and it is only       right we give them adequate resources to do so.        This legislation contains a package of important bipartisan       and bicameral proposals:        Title I: Modernizing Merger Filing Fee Collections: The       parties to a merger over a certain size pay a nominal fee to       the agencies when they seek merger review and this will       remain the case after the Merger Filing Fee Modernization       Act. The current fee structure is outdated; it has not kept       pace with the growth of the economy or with inflation. The       number of mergers has skyrocketed: notifications doubled from       2010 to 2020. The bipartisan, bicameral Merger Filing Fees       Modernization Act would lower fees for the smallest mergers.       Fees would be raised on only the very largest mergers or       acquisitions involving companies that can easily and       equitably pay the increase. The bill also indexes the fees to       inflation, to help them keep up with a growing economy over       time.        Additionally, the bill contains a reporting requirement, so       Congress will have information on how the bill has affected       agency budgets and its overall efficacy in strengthening       sound and effective enforcement of our antitrust laws.        Title II: Disclosure of Subsidies by Foreign Adversaries:       This will require merger notification filings to include       information about any subsidies the merging parties have       received from countries or entities that are ``strategic or       economic threats to the United States.''        Title III: Venue for State Antitrust Enforcement: This bill       would give state attorneys general the same ability that       federal antitrust enforcers have to stay in the court of       their choosing when bringing a federal antitrust suit rather       than have a defendant seek to move a case to a more favorable       venue.        While we believe much more must be done this year, this       bipartisan, bicameral legislation represents a critical first       step for Congress to reverse the course of lax antitrust       enforcement that has proved to be destructive to small       businesses, workers, communities, and innovation. While we       continue to support the broader antitrust reforms put forward       in the House and Senate, we recognize that antitrust       enforcers should urgently have the resources they need, and       it is imperative that the legislative package included in       H.R. 3843 move forward in the House.        This carefully crafted bill is bipartisan and not       controversial. Enacting it now will give a much-needed       funding boost to antitrust enforcement and the open, vibrant       marketplace it promotes and protects, benefitting us all:       consumers, workers, entrepreneurs, and communities. We ask       you to vote yes on H.R. 3843, the Merger Filing Fee       Modernization Act of 2022.

Dear Representative: On behalf of the National Grocers       Association (NGA), I am writing to urge you to VOTE YES on       H.R 3843, the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022. We       believe this bipartisan legislation will deliver important       results for consumers, workers, and independent grocers who       rely on the benefits that flow from free and fair       competition.        Vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws is a necessary       component of American free enterprise. H.R. 3843 gives the       federal enforcers and State Attorneys General critical tools       and resources needed to address abuses of market power in the       grocery industry that intensifies food price inflation and       reduces consumer access to critical products.        Today, dominant retail companies and e-commerce giants       wield unprecedented economic power with little to no       antitrust oversight or enforcement. These companies exercise       their power over the marketplace to dictate discriminatory       terms and conditions to suppliers, including by demanding       more favorable pricing and price terms, more favorable       supply, and access to exclusive products. This economic       discrimination has only worsened in the current environment       of supply chain disruption and increasing inflation.        Independent community grocers play a crucial role in       ensuring food access, especially in smaller, rural       communities as well as high density urban ones where       independents tend to locate. Unfortunately, these communities       have suffered the most recently as independent grocers face       declining supply delivery rates and share a disproportionate       burden of wholesale food price increases.        Antitrust enforcers at the State and Federal level play a       critical role in restoring the free play of competitive       markets, but they must have the resources and tools at their       disposal to address abuses of market power that harms       consumers. This bipartisan bill does not change the antitrust       laws, it takes the simple step of helping enforcers have a       better shot of deterring abusive marketplace conduct that       American consumers cannot afford right now. For these       reasons, we urge you to vote YES on H.R 3843.            Sincerely,                                                       Chris Jones,           Senior Vice President of Government Relations & Counsel,                                      National Grocers Association.                                    American Antitrust Institute,                                                 September 27, 2022.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: The       American Antitrust Institute (AAI) writes to support a       proposal under H.R. 3843, the Merger Filing Fee Modernization       Act of 2022, that is integral to increasing the transparency       and public analysis of  [[Page H8257]]       merger enforcement in the United States. Transparency and       public analysis are critical in promoting stronger       enforcement of Section 7 of the Clayton Act, at a time of       mounting concerns over declining competition, increasing       concentration, and cadence of the harmful effects of past       mergers on consumers, workers, and innovators.        AAI supports the proposal under H.R. 3843 to delineate new       categories of merger filing fees for billion-dollar mergers       that are outlined in Title 1, Section 101(1)(D)(4-6),       ``Modification of Premerger Notification Filing Fees.'' Under       the proposal, merger filing fees would account for major       categories of mergers worth $1 billion and up. These include       fees for mergers valued between (1) $1B-$2B ($400K filing       fee); (2) $2B-$5B ($800K filing fee); and (3) more than $5B       ($2.25M filing fee).        AAI recently released the white paper, What Does the       Billion-Dollar Deal Mean for Stronger Merger Enforcement? The       findings in the AAT paper strongly support the Title 1,       Section 101(1)(D)(4-6) proposal for more specificity in       filing fees for billion-dollar mergers and additional agency       resources. Additional resources are needed to enable the U.S.       Department of Justice Antitrust Division and the Federal       Trade Commission to review and investigate billion-dollar       deals.        The AAI white paper unpacks the advent of the billion-      dollar merger in the 1990s and the growth of billion-dollar       transactions over time. Supported by empirical analysis of       enforcement data, the paper analyzes the outsized impact of       billion-dollar deals on enforcement and associated       implications for the allocation of scarce agency resources.       This resource allocation issue extends to early-stage       inquiries (i.e., second requests) and late-stage inquiries       (i.e., investigations). Importantly, it also extends to how       the agencies resolve challenged, illegal mergers though       settlement, versus forced abandonments, restructurings, and       injunctions.        The AAI white paper contains a number of important       recommendations. One is that the antitrust agencies be       required to report data for multiple categories of mergers       above $1 billion in their annual reports to Congress under       the Hart Scott Rodino Act. A second recommendation is the       need for more resources to enable the agencies to review       billion-dollar deals. A third recommendation is that the       agencies undertake a review of resource allocation for both       early-stage and late-stage inqurnes involving billion-dollar       deals. A fourth recommendation is that the agencies review       their own successes and failures in past settlements of       challenged, billion-dollar mergers.        In sum, the recommendations set forth in What Does the       Billion-Dollar Deal Mean for Stronger Merger Enforcement? are       necessary to enable competition research, education, and       advocacy organizations like AAI, to analyze merger       enforcement data and to render policy recommendanons that are       responsive to changing trends that directly impact the vigor       of merger enforcement.        We appreciate your attention to AAI's comments in regard to       H.R. 3843.            Sincerely,                                                 Diana Moss, Ph.D.,                           President, American Antitrust Institute.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman again for yielding.   I just want to make clear, once again, that this bill does not  appropriate money to the FTC, and I think the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee and I will continue to advocate for more funding. But this is  not an appropriations bill. The ultimate decision about whether money  will be appropriated to the FTC or the Department of Justice will be  made like every other appropriation: by the Members of the Congress of  the United States after a robust debate, and the Congress will decide.   This generates revenue and makes certain that big mergers are paid  for by gigantic near monopolies of big corporations and not by our  constituents, and it lowers the price for merger reviews on smaller  transactions. So that is all it does.   Secondly, it is important to remember that, as Mr. Buck said, this  isn't a Republican or Democrat bill.   I want to read to you a statement from Senator Klobuchar and Senator  Durbin:   ``The Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act is the product of years of  bipartisan work in both the House and  [[Page H8263]]  Senate to improve the enforcement of our antitrust laws and protect  competition and consumers. This package of bills will update merger  filing fees and help ensure that the Federal antitrust agencies can be  properly funded, that information on foreign subsidies is made  available to Federal enforcers, and that State antitrust enforcement  can proceed more efficiently and without needless delays.''   I have a statement from Senator Lee, Senator Cotton, and Senator  Grassley--Republicans in the Senate--who say: ``This package represents  a strong, bipartisan consensus approach to strengthening enforcement of  the Federal antitrust laws, against both Big Tech and other bad  actors.''   So this is widely supported by Republicans and Democrats in both  Chambers, and I think it is an example of where we can work together  collectively to respond to a serious problem: the consolidation of  economic power. Antitrust is important because we know competition is  the single greatest driver of innovation. Without competition you don't  have innovation, and innovation produces more choices, better quality,  and lower prices. It benefits consumers, small businesses, and workers.    I say again, this is about supporting competition with  some very commonsense proposals that have strong bipartisan support in  both Chambers.   We can finally let Big Tech know that the time in which they can do  whatever they want and continue to behave as monopolists is coming to  an end.   Overwhelmingly, the American people support reining in Big Tech--over  70 percent in poll after poll.   But one other thing I wanted to just mention is that with  concentrated economic power often comes concentrated political power.  That is one of the dangers of monopoly. They have too much political  power. Let's prove them wrong and pass this bill.
