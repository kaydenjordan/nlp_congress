 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, in her 1993 Nobel lecture, Toni Morrison-- no conservative--told a story of an old woman who was approached by a  group of kids, mocking her and asking her to offer her conjecture:         Old woman, I hold in my hand a bird. Tell me whether it is       living or dead.    The blind, old woman was revered for her wisdom and experience.   She responded:         I don't know whether the bird you are holding is dead or       alive, but what I do know is that it is in your hands. It is       in your hands.    The old woman, of course, meant whether the bird is alive or dead is  the responsibility of the person who holds it.   Morrison said:         The blind woman shifts attention away from assertions of       power to the instrument through which that power is       exercised.    Now, Morrison could have been talking about Congress. I will leave to  your judgment who in Congress is a mocking youth and who is the old  woman, but in politics it is the instrument of power rather than the  assertion of power that matters.   Just this last week, the instruments of power were used, despite  assertions otherwise, to quietly pave the way for the Democrats'  ``Destroy America'' bill, which they have called Build Back Better.  Congress used a novel procedure to pass a bill, giving Democrats a  blank check to raise the debt ceiling to pay for Build Back Better.  Procedural jujitsu is hardly the stuff of base-motivating campaign  rhetoric, but it is the instrument of power.   Now I will describe how this happened, but a bit of background is  necessary.   Like most legislation in the Senate, raising the debt ceiling, which  has been done now 99 times since the end of the Second World War,  ordinarily requires 60 votes, which, in an evenly divided Senate, means  Democrats and Republicans have to work together to find an acceptable  outcome.   There is, of course, an exception that would allow Democrats to use a  special budget reconciliation procedure to raise the debt ceiling  without Republican help, with a simple majority vote--a simple majority  vote that they could achieve if all 50 Democrats cast their votes. If  there is an evenly divided vote at the end of the day, it can be broken  by the Vice President. But they didn't want to use this special  procedure, and I believe they didn't want to use it for two independent  reasons.   First, it was inconvenient. The special reconciliation procedure  would require too many steps and too much time for their tastes. Still,  I don't know of a single Republican Senator, myself included, who would  unduly stall the Democrats from proceeding to its consideration. In  fact, under the rules, if they follow the right steps, it is, more or  less, a guaranteed outcome, one that doesn't require a supermajority  and, at the end of the day, can be accomplished with a simple majority.   Second, I suspect that Democrats didn't want to bear the political  cost of raising the debt ceiling without some Republican cover. This  would ordinarily mean using the standard 60-vote process, but that is  not how it happened. Instead of Democrats and Republicans working  together to find consensus on the appropriate way to raise the debt  ceiling, likely in exchange for spending reforms, some combination of  Senate and House leadership concocted a new mechanism.   On a 60-vote bill, Republicans agreed to let Democrats pass an  entirely separate bill to raise the debt ceiling--without any  Republican votes--by whatever amount they want. So, rather than  negotiating a reasonable number, Republicans agreed to ensure that the  debt ceiling was increased by as many trillions of dollars as the  Democrats might need to fulfill their agenda. There is an actual blank  space in the bill where Democrats can write in whatever number they  want.   In exchange, Republicans would be protected from scrutiny for  insisting that Democrats follow the established rules for raising the  debt ceiling through the reconciliation procedure and would be able to  launder this vote to appear as something other than helping Democrats  raise the debt ceiling, which they had publicly committed--in writing,  no less--not to do.  [[Page S9136]]    To make matters worse, congressional leadership tied this to a bill  preventing automatic Medicare cuts. This sent a clear message: Give  Democrats a blank check or there would be Medicare cuts. Some of my  Republican colleagues couldn't allow them to shoot that hostage, that  hostage being held captive by Democrats.   The playbook is written. The idea that this is a onetime thing or is  somehow similar to other expedited procedures--for example, those found  under the Congressional Review Act to disapprove of executive Agency  rules--is preposterous. The comparison doesn't work. These are very  different creatures. I am sure this vicious tactic, the one used here,  has not seen its last use--far from it. I am certain it will be used in  the future to enact other progressive agenda items, including many that  are simply unable to garner the 60 votes necessary under the normal and  transparent Senate filibuster rules.   With a blank check and a new special procedure, Democrats are able to  raise the debt ceiling by whatever amount they deem necessary to  accommodate their ``Destroy America'' bill, which they call Build Back  Better. They have set that price--and we know this now as of just the  last few hours--at $2.5 trillion. This is the behemoth bill that would  seek to grant a form of amnesty to illegal aliens; to further the Green  New Deal agenda; to overturn State right-to-work laws; to increase  vaccine mandate fines on private employers to $700,000; to infuse  critical race theory indoctrination into medical care; and to grow the  IRS by 87,000 agents. That isn't even the tip of the iceberg.   The blank check to remake America was a gift to progressives from  those within the Republican Party who decided to grant it. I regret  deeply their decision to do so, and the filibuster--the major  instrument of power preserving the unique identity of the U.S. Senate-- was all it cost.   As to who was the old woman and who were the mocking children from  Toni Morrison's story, I can't say, but America is the bird.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, it is an honor to stand here today  to recognize and celebrate the career of Police Chief Michael C. Nelsen  of the Brigham City Police Department. For the last 42 years, he has  diligently served and protected the people of Brigham City. His  positive impact on the lives of many will be remembered as he  transitions into retirement.   I wonder if, as a young pre-law student at Rick's College in Rexburg,  ID, Mike Nelsen ever sat back to imagine the impact his life would have  on so many others? I wonder if, as a student of criminal, justice  administration at Brigham Young University, Mike Nelsen ever dreamed of  leading a police department to new heights and great successes?  However, I hope that at the sunset of an impressive career, Chief  Nelsen realizes the significance of the mark he has left on the lives  of countless others and the new heights and great successes he has  achieved.   During his career as a police officer, Chief Nelsen climbed through  the  [[Page S9160]]  ranks. He rose from corporal, to sergeant, to lieutenant, and--most  notably--to chief. Yet, despite the grandeur of his rise through the  ranks, he always remained a faithful and committed public servant.  Humility, sacrifice, and character have all been exemplified during his  years of police work.   Early in his career, Chief Nelsen earned a reputation for being  willing to go the extra mile. From day l, he set a standard for  community engagement outside of day to day policing. Perhaps the best  example of this extracurricular community engagement is Chief Nelsen's  avid support of the Special Olympics.   Despite his many responsibilities as a police officer, Chief Nelsen  has dedicated hours of service to his role as the director of the Box  Elder Torch Run for the Special Olympics. For his service, he has had  the honor to run in the International Torch Run for the Special  Olympics in Alaska and to carry the Olympic Torch for the 2002 Winter  Olympic Games in Salt Lake City. He has been an emissary of Brigham  City and of Utah to the world.   Public servants like Chief Nelsen deserve high praise. Their  dedicated and faithful service sets an example for those who follow in  their footsteps. I know that Chief Nelsen will be missed. However,  thanks to the foundation that Chief Nelsen has laid over the last four  decades, I have no doubt that the department will continue to flourish.   I am grateful to Chief Nelsen for the commitment he has shown to a  difficult, but meaningful job. Without individuals like him willing to  shoulder this responsibility, our communities would not prosper as they  do. Both he and his family have faithfully made sacrifices for the good  of their community for decades. I thank them for their dedication. As  Chief Nelsen transitions into retirement, I hope he does so knowing  that his community has prospered as a result of his service and the  memory of his servant leadership will live on.                            ____________________
