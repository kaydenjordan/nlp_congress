 Mr. Speaker, on Sunday, ESPN celebrated Women's History  Month by putting out a tweet celebrating swimmer Lia Thomas. The only  problem, Lia Thomas is not a woman.   Lia, whose real name is William, is a man pretending to be a woman,  ranked about 400 in men's swimming, but now about number 1 in women's.   This individual identifying as a woman was allowed to compete in  women's swimming for the University of Pennsylvania. Consequently, this  [[Page H1541]]  person won a national title that should have gone to a female athlete.   Instead of denouncing this farcical nonsense, ESPN decided to  celebrate it. It is a sad day for women's sports when our Nation's  premier sports broadcaster chooses to celebrate biological males  competing in women's sports.   The evidence is overwhelming that males have competitive athletic  advantage over females. It, therefore, makes zero sense to allow men to  compete in women's sports.   Do you call this progress? Certainly not for women athletes.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I thank our chairman for his diligent work  on H.R. 1 and the amendments that are going with it. I appreciate it.   Madam Chair, I rise today not only to support H.R. 1, that will make  long overdue changes to our permitting system and allow time-sensitive  projects to be considered and approved in a reasonable timeframe, but I  am also in support of two amendments that I am very pleased to see  included.   The first amendment is No. 23, otherwise known as the Combustion  Avoidance along Rural Roads Act, or the CARR Act. The CARR Act is named  after the 2018 devastating wildfire that occurred in Redding,  California, that started from a flat trailer tire igniting roadside  vegetation. This fire coined the term ``firenado'' as it occurred there  with the deadly winds that whipped that fire into what became a  230,000-acre blaze that also took eight lives.   This bill would waive time-consuming requirements under NEPA and the  ESA for wildfire mitigation activities conducted within 300 feet of a  roadway. These wildfire mitigation activities would include thinning,  hazardous fuels reduction, prescribed burning, and vegetation  management, and be overseen by the Department of the Interior or USDA,  and be conducted on Federal land as administered by the National Park  system, the Bureau of Land Management, or the Forest Service.   Roadways, of course, can be a higher risk area for combustion. It  only makes sense to do the type of thinning and management along  roadways to vastly reduce that risk. Had this been in practice already,  the Carr fire likely would not have happened.   I hope we can have this kind of common sense be applied toward our  roadsides under the CARR Act.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I am disappointed that this would be deemed  a wish list item, indeed, when the eight lives lost and the families  affected in the Redding area would look at this as something critical.   The categorical exclusions do not go far enough, obviously, or they  would have been utilized in a fashion that would be making a wide  enough swath around our roadways to make them safe from fire and our  forests safe from fire.   Madam Chair, I urge, please, an ``aye'' vote on this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Madam Chair, I conclude by asking that we not have more  scenes that look like this--similar to this--that happened in Redding,  and that we be allowed to do the work effectively along our roadways,  which are risk zones with traffic, et cetera.   Madam Chair, I ask for an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, amendment No. 24, also known also the CLEAR  Zones Act, is an enhancement of the Electricity Reliability and Forest  Protection Act. This amendment would extend the hazard zone around  power lines to allow utility companies to clear trees that pose a  danger to transmission infrastructure.   It also gives automatic approval of vegetation management plans after  60 days, which keeps these plans moving forward while still giving  adequate time for reasonable review instead of needless delays in these  critical fire risk zones.   During debate, I have heard some of my colleagues refer to this  amendment and other proposals in H.R. 1 as a giveaway, in this case, to  utility companies, or a trashing of the environment. That is  offensively untrue. Indeed, the environment suffers much more by the  massive amount of fire we are talking about.   Both of my amendments are a direct response to wildfires that have  already occurred in my district. Had they been in place, largely, the  Camp fire that destroyed the town of Paradise, 153,000 acres and took  85 lives, would not have happened, as a fire caught from foliage that  was underneath a power line.   Also, the million-acre Dixie fire that occurred in my district from  what looked like a healthy tree falling into  [[Page H1610]]  a power line, destroyed two towns additionally, Greenville and  Canyondam. I was there at Canyondam 5 minutes before it was lost  completely.   Unlike most environmental regulations, this policy is not just about  potential future effects, it is also about the fires that have already  happened. They have already destroyed homes, already taken lives. This  is a message to those folks that your suffering was not needless.   It is about stopping these wildfires from happening again by having  wise management around our power lines so that the odds of fire  occurring from these power lines existing in our rural areas is reduced  greatly.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim my time.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Madam Chair, I ask that people really stop and think  about what we are asking here. This is not unreasonable where power  lines interface with forested areas. Precautions like we are talking  about would have directly, in these two cases, saved three towns, over  1.1 million acres, and at least 85 lives had they had the ability to  thin properly around power lines. It is that basic.   As long as we are going to have electricity come from rural areas, we  are going to have these needs to be able to have safety around our  power lines by doing commonsense management around them.   Madam Chair, I ask Members to vote ``aye'' on amendment No. 24, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
