 Madam Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to David LeBlanc of  Nottingham, New Hampshire, who passed away on this day 6 years ago.   A lifelong New Hampshire resident, David was born and raised in  Manchester and worked in the line department at Public Service of New  Hampshire for over 30 years.   He was an avid runner, whose legacy lives on through the Greater  Manchester Running Club, which he founded with his wife, Cheryl, in  1980.   David honorably served the State and his country as a member of the  New Hampshire Army National Guard. Today, he will be reinterred at the  New Hampshire State Veterans Cemetery, something that is only possible  because we changed the law this year.   I was proud to sponsor this legislation that ensures all of our  veterans, including members of the National Guard and Reserves, can be  laid to rest in State veterans cemeteries.   The National Guard and Reserves are a critical component of our  military and sacrifice so much to keep us safe.   As we honor the memory of David LeBlanc, let us honor the service of  all of our veterans and ensure they are not forgotten.                            ____________________
