 Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I would like to wish my  daughter Genevieve a happy 18th birthday.   It is with great respect and sincere admiration that I rise today to  celebrate Black History Month and its 2021 theme, ``The Black Family:  Representation, Identity, and Diversity.''   This year's theme reflects on the unwavering resilience of the Black  family as a nurturing and loving foundation for Black excellence, even  as it continues to face systemic racism and significant disparities in  our society. The Black family has positively impacted our Nation  throughout its history, and it is important to acknowledge and affirm  that Black history is American history.   Today, I would like to take a moment to honor a Black family that has  played an instrumental role in public service in Indiana, and that is  the family of former State Senator Earline Rogers and Earline's late  husband, Louis Charles ``Chuck'' Rogers.   Chuck and Earline married in 1955 and had two children, Keith and  Dara, as well as many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. From  working selflessly as a public schoolteacher to Earline's decades of  service in the Indiana General Assembly, and Chuck having been a  dedicated firefighter and first responder, the Rogers family is an  exemplary pillar of the northwest Indiana community.    In her pursuit for education, Earline graduated with honors and as  senior class president from Roosevelt High School and later went on to  earn both a bachelor and master of science in education from Indiana  University.   After earning her degrees, Earline's early career included teaching  in the Gary Community School Corporation and being an active member of  the American Federation of Teachers, which subsequently encouraged her  to run for office.   Earline went on to serve in numerous roles during her time in public  service and was one of Indiana's most accomplished and effective  legislators, working with all her colleagues, including my father,  State Senator Frank Mrvan, in a bipartisan fashion to improve the lives  of all Hoosiers.   One of her many accomplishments is her legislation to address child  exploitation. A decade ago, Indiana had the second highest rate of  girls being sexually assaulted in grades 9 through 12, with Black and  Latino students among the most vulnerable. These devastating statistics  prompted Senator Rogers, along with my father and countless other  advocates, to champion Heather's Law, which requires the Indiana  Department of Education to develop a program for Indiana schools to  better educate students about predators and sexual abuse.   I am especially proud to note that when I was first beginning my  career in public service, I had the opportunity to intern for Earline  in the Indiana General Assembly. I am proud to call Earline one of my  mentors. As a legislator in the U.S. House of Representatives, I will  continue to strive to be as dedicated as Earline in improving economic  opportunity and prosperity for all residents of northwest Indiana.   I would also like to honor Chuck, who recently passed away, on  December 7, 2020. He will be remembered as a loving father, a  supportive husband, and a great public servant.   Chuck attended East St. Louis High School in Illinois and went on to  graduate from Indiana University. After school, Chuck held several  esteemed positions, including as a member of the U.S. Army, a high  school sports coach, and a high school educator of Black studies.   Chuck was also a dedicated firefighter, as he eventually earned the  title of fire battalion chief of the Gary Fire Department, where he  served for 40 years.   Chuck also served as a precinct committeeman in Indiana's Third State  District, where he played an essential role in Earline's career as a  State senator.   As we recognize and celebrate the contributions of the Rogers and  others, we must also acknowledge and address the structural factors  that continue to create challenges for the Black family.   In the last year, the COVID-19 public health emergency and the tragic  killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and so many others have  exposed these inequities.   Regarding the pandemic, I would note that, regrettably, minorities  account for more than 50 percent of all hospitalizations and deaths  from COVID-19 in the United States. We must remedy the early  governmental failures to distribute COVID-19 vaccines in an equitable  manner to the communities that have suffered the most.   Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate Black History Month, let us recognize  the indelible contributions of Black families to the strength of our  communities as well as recommit ourselves to fighting the pernicious  influence of systemic racism and ameliorating the ongoing harms  experienced by too many Black families in our society.                            ____________________
