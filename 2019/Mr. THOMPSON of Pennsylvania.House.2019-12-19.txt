 Madam Speaker, after nearly 400 days  since President Trump signed the agreement, we are finally voting on  USMCA to deliver real results for the people who make up the backbone  of the American economy. This includes our farmers, ranchers,  manufacturers, and each and every American family who depends on these  industries.   USMCA will bring more than $68 billion in new economic activity,  176,000 new jobs here at home, and an increase of $2 billion a year  annually in agricultural exports. These numbers don't lie, and that is  only the beginning. Passing USMCA is a big win for the American  economy.   Lastly, I can't talk about USMCA without mentioning how big of a win  it is for American agriculture, particularly our dairy farmers. Under  this agreement, our dairy producers will no longer be subject to  Canada's class 6 and class 7 milk pricing programs, policies that have  unfairly limited our export potential for years.   Madam Speaker, USMCA is a good agreement. It is a fair agreement, and  it is a bipartisan agreement. I am pleased that we are finally voting  on this crucial piece of policy and that we can deliver on this  promise. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''    Madam Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate the life and the incredible military legacy of Morton  ``Shea'' Landy.   Morton passed away on November 25 at the age of 90 in Curwensville,  Pennsylvania.   Morton was a longtime resident of Clearfield County, Pennsylvania,  although his military service took him across the world throughout his  career.   After enlisting in the Marine Corps in 1946, Morton would go on to  serve in Japan shortly after World War II, in the Caribbean during the  Cuban Missile Crisis, and in Vietnam during the height of the Vietnam  war, to name a few.   After 32 years of faithfully serving our Nation both domestically and  abroad, Morton retired from the Marine Corps. He would finish his  military career with not only the highest enlisted rank possible, but  as the second highest sergeant major in the Marines.   Even still, Morton's service did not stop there. In retirement, he  spent much of his time volunteering on behalf of the Clearfield County  Historical Society, his local VFW, and the Marine Corps League.   The passing of Morton Landy is a profound loss, and I offer my  sincerest condolences to Morton's family and to those who were forever  touched by his commitment to service.                            ____________________
