 ROE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute.)    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring  attention to an important veterans' initiative that I am proud to lead  with Chairman Takano. It is essential that we recognize and commend the  selfless sacrifice veterans have made to protect our most precious  freedoms.   That is why Chairman Takano and I have challenged all Members of  Congress to participate in the Library of Congress' Veterans History  Project by submitting at least one of their veteran constituents'  stories to the project prior to Veteran's Day.   The Veterans History Project gives our Nation's heroes a platform to  share and preserve their personal stories about their time in uniform  to help Americans understand military service and its importance to our  country's history. We can think of no better way to honor the men and  women who fought for our freedoms in the weeks leading up to Veteran's  Day than by ensuring that their unique stories of service are forever  memorialized for future generations of Americans.   Madam Speaker, I would also like to associate my remarks with those  about Elijah Cummings and wish his family God's blessings.                            ____________________
