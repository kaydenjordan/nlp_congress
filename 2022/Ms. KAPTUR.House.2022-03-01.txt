 Mr. Speaker, I rise in solidarity with the people of  Ukraine who are under horrific siege. Ukraine's valorous President  Volodymyr Zelensky and the courageous Ukrainian forces and its people  are defending their homeland in what truly is a battle of David versus  Goliath.   Putin is unleashing hell on Earth through cluster bombs and vacuum  bombs on innocent civilians targeting women, children, and the elderly,  and striking hospitals and orphanages in a murderous rampage.   This is the work of war criminals. But more war is not the answer.  The top leaders of every nation in our world--not just their  ambassadors but every leader of every nation--this week must create an  historic surge of diplomacy to engage with Vladimir Putin to end this  massacre.   Work it out. Work it out.   Please stop the killing. Stop the fear. Stop the massacre. Build  forward. Invite Vladimir Putin toward a new world of peace and  opportunity for all in that damaged and struggling part of our  beleaguered world.                            ____________________
