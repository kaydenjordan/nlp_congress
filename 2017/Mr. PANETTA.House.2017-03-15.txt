 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to advocate for a national  infrastructure plan.   I represent the central coast of California, and this winter we got  rain. We got a lot of rain. So much so that it caused millions in  damage to the area, including the closure of the famous Highway 1 in  Big Sur, with major mudslides in the south and the loss of the 315-foot  Pfeiffer Canyon Bridge in Big Sur.   That damage has left 450 people isolated: kids can't get to school;  families are separated; and employers and employees are suffering,  including the loss of $8 million in 1 month in the off-season.   But the effects of that damage extend beyond Big Sur to the  surrounding towns, counties, and, actually, the entire State of  California. People from all over the world come to Big Sur. They drive  down from San Francisco. They drive up from Los Angeles. They patronize  towns all along their way to Big Sur.   We understand why. It is the most beautiful place in the world. It is  my home. And we want it to be open to all of you.  [[Page H2063]]    It is time that the Congress and our President help Americans by  investing in our American infrastructure.                            ____________________
