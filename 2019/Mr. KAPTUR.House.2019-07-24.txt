 Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure today that I rise  in support of strong, bipartisan passage of the Butch Lewis Act.   The Butch Lewis Act will provide the economic security this body  ripped out from under millions of hardworking Americans.   Across our country, 1.3 million workers and retirees face serious and  significant threat of cuts to their hard earned multiemployer pension  plans, through no fault of their own. Several of these plans are large  enough to take down the entire Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation,  threatening the guaranteed security of 10 million Americans.   I have heard the message time and again from retirees in my district  and across this nation: they worked for decades to earn these pensions.  Now they are too old, or their health too unstable, to return to the  workforce. The stress and anxiety are sapping their will. Some have  taken their own lives.   The Butch Lewis Act will provide much needed and long-overdue relief.   The Butch Lewis Act keeps the promises made to retirees. It  guarantees pension benefits they have earned into the future. It does  so by allowing troubled pension plans to borrow the money needed to  remain solvent in 30-year, low interest loans. The plan will repay.   Pensions-have afforded millions of middle-class Americans the  opportunity to enjoy their golden years with economic peace of mind.  Let us restore this peace with swift and just passage of the Butch  Lewis Act.
