 Mr. President, last week the Senate Judiciary Committee  held hearings on Judge Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court.  Everything we heard from this nominee confirmed what has been clear  from the beginning: Judge Gorsuch is the kind of judge all of us should  want on the Nation's highest Court.   Judge Gorsuch obviously has a distinguished resume. He graduated with  honors from Harvard Law School and went on to receive a doctorate in  legal philosophy from Oxford University, where he was a Marshall  scholar.   He clerked for two Supreme Court Justices--Byron White and Anthony  Kennedy--and he worked in both private practice and at the Justice  Department before being nominated to the Tenth Circuit Court of  Appeals, where he has served with distinction for 10 years.   He is widely regarded as a brilliant and thoughtful jurist and a  gifted writer whose opinions are known for their clarity. Most  importantly, however, Judge Gorsuch understands the proper role of a  judge, and that role is to interpret the law, not make the law; to  judge, not legislate; to call balls and strikes, not to rewrite the  rules of the game.   It is great to have strong opinions. It is great to have sympathy for  causes or organizations. It is great to have plans for fixing society's  problems, but none of those things has any business influencing your  ruling when you sit on the bench. Your job as a judge is to apply  [[Page S2028]]  the law as it is written--and here is the fundamental thing--even when  you disagree with it.   ``A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad  judge,'' Judge Gorsuch said more than once. Why? Because a judge who  likes every outcome he reaches is likely making decisions based on  something other than the law. That is a problem. Equal justice under  the law, equal protection under the law--these principles become  meaningless when judges step outside of their role and start changing  the meaning of the law to suit their feelings about a case or their  personal opinions.   Judge Gorsuch's nomination has attracted support from both sides of  the political spectrum. I think the main reason for that is because  both liberals and conservatives know they can trust Judge Gorsuch to  rule based on the plain text of the law, irrespective of his personal  opinions. Here is what Neal Katyal, an Acting Solicitor General for  President Obama, had to say about Judge Gorsuch:         I have no doubt that if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch will help       to restore confidence in the rule of law. His years on the       bench reveal a commitment to judicial independence--a record       that should give the American people confidence that he will       not compromise principle to favor the President who appointed       him.    The Colorado Springs Gazette recently highlighted a letter signed by  96 prominent Colorado lawyers and judges and sent to the senior Senator  from Colorado. Here is what those individuals had to say about Judge  Gorsuch:         We hold a diverse set of political views as Republicans,       Democrats, and Independents. Many of us have been critical of       actions taken by President Trump. Nonetheless, we all agree       that Judge Gorsuch is exceptionally well qualified to join       the Supreme Court. We know Judge Gorsuch to be a person of       utmost character. He is fair, decent, and honest, both as a       judge and a person. His record shows that he believes       strongly in the independence of the judiciary.    A former law partner and friend of Judge Gorsuch--a friend who  describes himself as ``a longtime supporter of Democratic candidates  and progressive causes''--had this to say about the judge:         Gorsuch's approach to resolving legal problems as a lawyer       and a judge embodies a reverence for our country's values and       legal system. The facts developed in a case matter to him;       the legal rules established by legislatures and through       precedent deserve deep respect; and the importance of       treating litigants, counsel and colleagues with civility is       deeply engrained in him. . . .        I have no doubt that I will disagree with some decisions       that Gorsuch might render as a Supreme Court Justice. Yet, my       hope is to have Justices on the bench such as Gorsuch . . .       who approach cases with fairness and intellectual rigor, and       who care about precedent and the limits of their roles as       judges.    Again, that is from a self-described ``longtime supporter of  Democratic candidates and progressive causes.''   During his years on the bench, Judge Gorsuch has had a number of law  clerks. On February 14, every one of Judge Gorsuch's former clerks,  except for two currently clerking at the Supreme Court, sent a letter  on his nomination to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate  Judiciary Committee. Here is what they had to say:         Our political views span the spectrum . . . but we are       united in our view that Judge Gorsuch is an extraordinary       judge. . . . Throughout his career, Judge Gorsuch has devoted       himself to the rule of law. He believes firmly that the role       of the judge in our democracy is to apply the laws made by       the political branches--that is, to adhere to our       Constitution and statutes our elected representatives have       enacted, and not to confuse those things with a judge's own       policy preferences.        As law clerks who have worked at his side, we know that       Judge Gorsuch never resolves a case by the light of his       personal view of what the law should be. Nor does he ever       bend the law to reach a particular result he desires.        For Judge Gorsuch, a judge's task is not to usurp the       legislature's role; it is to find and apply the law as       written. That conviction, rooted in his respect for the       separation of powers, makes him an exemplary candidate to       serve on the nation's highest court.    That is the unanimous opinion of 39 of Judge Gorsuch's former law  clerks, whose political views in their own words ``span the spectrum.''  Unfortunately, no amount of testimony in favor of Judge Gorsuch will  ever be enough for some Senate Democrats.   The Senate minority leader took to the floor last week to announce a  determination to oppose Judge Gorsuch's nomination. He also announced  his determination to push for a filibuster of Judge Gorsuch's  nomination. The minority leader's reasons? Well, for starters, the  minority leader apparently doesn't trust that Judge Gorsuch will use  the bench to implement the leader's preferred policies. He disagrees  with some of Judge Gorsuch's decisions, and he apparently considers  that sufficient grounds to bar Judge Gorsuch from the Supreme Court.  The minority leader demonstrated little interest in whether Judge  Gorsuch's legal interpretations were correct. For the minority leader,  judging is about getting one's preferred outcome, irrespective of what  the law actually says.   The minority leader also mentioned another reason for opposing Judge  Gorsuch: He doesn't trust the judge to be independent or impartial,  even though liberals and conservatives alike have praised Judge  Gorsuch's independence and impartiality as two of his defining  characteristics.   The minority leader also made the laughable claim that Judge Gorsuch  is somehow out of the judicial mainstream. Well, let me quote what the  Wall Street Journal said on this subject. In February, the Journal  wrote:         Judge Gorsuch has written some 800 opinions since joining       the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006. Only 1.75 percent       (14 opinions) [out of 800] drew dissent from his colleagues.       That makes 98 percent of his opinions unanimous even on a       circuit where seven of the 12 active judges were appointed by       Democratic Presidents and five by Republicans.    Let me repeat that last line: ``That makes 98 percent of his opinions  unanimous even on a circuit where seven of the 12 active judges were  appointed by Democratic Presidents and five by Republicans.''   Well, I wonder if the minority leader intended to suggest that the  entire Tenth Circuit is composed of extremist judges or that all of the  judges on the Tenth Circuit lacked impartiality or independence,  because, logically speaking, if you are going to suggest that Judge  Gorsuch is an extremist, then you would have to argue that his  colleagues who agreed with his opinions 98 percent of the time are  extremists too.   The truth is, Democrat opposition to Judge Gorsuch has zero to do  with whether Judge Gorsuch meets the qualifications of a Supreme Court  Justice. It is obvious that the judge has all the qualifications one  could want in a Justice. Democrats are opposing Judge Gorsuch because  they are mad. They are mad that their party didn't win the Presidential  election, they are mad that their party doesn't have control of  Congress, and they are mad that they are having to consider a judge  nominated by a Republican President. It doesn't matter how qualified  Judge Gorsuch is, how impartial he is, how independent he is, some  Democrats are just going to oppose him anyway.   This isn't the first time Judge Gorsuch has been before this body.  Back in 2006, the Senate considered Judge Gorsuch's nomination to the  Tenth Circuit. At that time, the judge's nomination sailed through the  Senate. Both of his home State Senators--one a Republican and one a  Democrat--supported his nomination, and he was confirmed by unanimous  vote. Then-Senator Obama could have objected to the nomination, but he  didn't. The current minority leader, who was serving in the Senate at  that time, could have objected to the nomination, but he didn't.  Senators Biden or Clinton could have objected to the nomination, but  they didn't. Why? Presumably because they saw what almost everybody  sees today: that Judge Gorsuch is exactly the kind of judge we want on  the bench--supremely qualified, thoughtful, fair, and impartial. It is  incredibly disappointing that some Democrats are now planning to oppose  this eminently qualified Supreme Court nominee simply because they  can't deal with losing an election.   The Senate has a 230-year tradition of approving Supreme Court  nominees by a simple majority vote. There has never been a successful  partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nominee in 230 years, and the  only ones who have ever attempted one are the Democrats. Well, some  Democrats may follow the minority leader in opposing Judge Gorsuch. I  am hopeful that others will listen to the many voices, liberal and  conservative, speaking out in support of his nomination.  [[Page S2029]]    There is no good reason to oppose Judge Gorsuch, and there is every  reason to support him. It is time to confirm the supremely qualified  judge to the Supreme Court.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries.)
