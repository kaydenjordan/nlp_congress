 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to  Congress' failure to show support for our allies abroad before leaving  town for the holidays and ask that this body return to vote as soon as  possible to secure the additional national security funding President  Biden is requesting.   This week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy made a trip to the  United States to lobby directly for the aid his nation needs as they  continue to fight on the front lines of the free world.   While addressing U.S. officers at the National Defense University,  President Zelenskyy said: You can count on Ukraine, and we hope just as  much to be able to count on you. Putin must lose.   He is right. Putin must lose. The world is not only watching how we  respond to Ukraine right now but whether or not we will stand with our  ally Israel, the only liberal democracy in the Middle East, and whether  or not we are prepared to buttress Taiwan as they face increased  hostility from the Chinese Communist Party.   As our allies are looking to us for support, our adversaries are  waiting with bated breath to see if we will fail to meet this moment in  history. This week, the Speaker wasted the House's time on a baseless  impeachment inquiry, but he still can't put a bill on the floor to fund  our democratic allies.   We cannot hand a Christmas present to Putin, Hamas, or Xi Jinping. We  must press President Biden's request for supplemental foreign aid. If  that means coming back from the holidays early to vote on it, so be it.                            ____________________
