 Madam President, just as I came to the floor, I saw an  announcement by the Attorney General of the United States that he was  appointing U.S. Attorney Durham as a special counsel under the same  provisions under which Robert Mueller was appointed as a special  counsel. While, ordinarily, I am no fan of special counsel  appointments, I think this one is important for a very simple reason.   With the election of a new administration and the peaceful transfer  of power anticipated on January 20, it is important to the country that  the Durham investigation--wherever it may lead--be concluded in a  nonpolitical and nonpartisan fashion and that, with whatever is  disclosed about the efforts made at the FBI under the direction of Mr.  Comey--under his leadership--and the actions of his subordinates at the  FBI, it is important to the country and to the ongoing reputation of  the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that  the facts be known and not be swept under the rug.   So I congratulate the Attorney General for making that appointment,  which ensures that the public, the American people, will finally learn  what the facts are and not have them filtered through the media, which,  unfortunately, has taken on some of the partisan polarization that is  reflective of our larger society in a way that, I think, has prevented  the facts from being fully known.   Inspector General Horowitz, at the Department of Justice, has done a  great service in his investigations, but the Durham investigation is,  perhaps, the single most important investigation being conducted and  one that, I hope, when it is concluded, will once again help to restore  public confidence in those great American institutions known as the  Department of Justice and the FBI.
