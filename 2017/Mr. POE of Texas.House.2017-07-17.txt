 Mr. Speaker, a new soccer stadium in St.  Petersburg, a luxury apartment complex in Moscow, all brought to Russia  by North Korean slaves. That is right. These slaves get almost no  wages, no holidays, with little food or sleep.   Little Kim not only enslaves his own people at home, he runs an  international slave trade. The slave network brings in $2 billion to $3  billion every year to the North Korean military complex and helps  little Kim evade sanctions. This is state-sponsored human trafficking  and slavery.   The slaves are not just sent to Russia. It is troublemakers like  China and Qatar, too, that are slave destinations.   Secretary Tillerson has called upon all countries to fully implement  U.N. Security Council resolutions to sever or downgrade diplomatic  relations with North Korea in order to financially isolate that  country. It is time these countries comply with the United Nations  resolutions, and we must send a united message to North Korea: End your  slave trade and stop the saber rattling.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
