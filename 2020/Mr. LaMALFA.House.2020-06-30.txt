 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to recognize my good  friend Kim Chamberlain for her service to Shasta County.   Kim was born and raised in a pear orchard just out of Seoul, South  Korea,  [[Page H2680]]  during the Korean war. She is a refugee and a survivor of the war. Kim  eventually married a U.S. Army medic, Paul Chamberlain, and came to the  United States in 1971.   As a new resident, Kim's goals in America were to learn English,  drive an automobile, and get a job. After working as a strawberry  trimmer at Lassen Canyon Nursery for several years, Kim went to school  and earned her cosmetology license in 1978. In 1981, Kim opened a  beauty salon, a shop she owned until 2012. I wish it were still open  right now.   In 2012, Kim was diagnosed with breast cancer, but she is a fighter  and a survivor in getting through it--very admirable. After entering  remission, Kim became a local cancer awareness activist, helping others  and meeting with other breast cancer survivors for encouragement and  support.   As the wife of a veteran and a war survivor, you won't find a bigger  champion for veterans' issues than Kim Chamberlain. I don't know of  anybody who works harder to advance the causes for our veterans and be  sure they are properly honored on Veterans Day and Memorial Day.   She is one of the fiercest advocates for bringing a veterans clinic,  a veterans cemetery, and a veterans home to northern California in  Shasta County. She helped raise funds for an endowment that actually  pays for landscaping at the Northern California Cemetery and served on  a nonprofit board that built a memorial chapel there.   A 29-year member of both the VFW Auxiliary and Northern California  Korean War Veterans chapter, Kim hosts an annual luncheon to honor and  thank Korean war veterans in the area. They come from far and wide to  be part of this. I have taken part in several of those.   2020 marks the seventieth anniversary of the beginning of the Korean  war, and this year would have been the 30th annual luncheon Kim would  have hosted to show appreciation for the Korean war veterans.  Unfortunately, this is yet another event that has been wiped out by the  coronavirus pandemic.   Kim's work on behalf of veterans has been recognized by the city of  Anderson, the Anderson Chamber of Commerce, Shasta County, and even the  Prime Minister of South Korea.   Kim's story embodies the American Dream. She has worked hard and is  always working to help her community many, manyfold over.   More than her contribution to local veterans or support of local  cancer survivors, Kim is a wonderful friend to me, to many, all who  come in contact with her. She, indeed, is a blessing to us who know her  and those who have come in contact with her and have been helped by  her.   I wish her all the best, and God's blessing upon Kim in everything  she does as a neighbor in northern California.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, voter fraud and all-mail ballots are going  to be quite a problem this year if we don't have safeguards in place.   In my home State of California, more needs to be done in order to  clean up the voter rolls. That doesn't mean voter suppression, as all  the caterwauling we hear around here. It means that you are taking  people off who are no longer at a particular address or deceased. That  way, you will have more confidence in who is voting.   Look at what happened recently in Paterson, New Jersey, where voter  fraud caused 19 percent of the ballots being tossed out, by four  different people being involved with that, including a city council  member.   So, what do we have? An issue where all-mail ballots are going to be  the solution this year? No.   In many States, including my own, you can request an absentee ballot,  but at least there is some type of a paper trail of a person asking for  a ballot and receiving it, versus willy-nilly sending ballots to every  name that is on the rolls that are not cleaned up.   If you have ever campaigned in an apartment complex, for example, so  many people are no longer even at the name that is on the list on the  door. So, you have ballots being sent in heaps to these areas where no  one is even living anymore. So, you have a big problem with the  availability of fraud when you have that.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, of the many problems with this  hyperpartisan bill, one of the most troublesome is the price tag: $1.5  trillion. Yet it completely ignores the need for how we are going to  pay for it.   So the majority has decided the President must come up with a way to  pay for it, like: Hey, here is our shopping list right here. We are  going to send it out of the House and maybe out of the Senate without a  way to pay for it. You find it, Mr. President. You figure it out.   But it has never been the President's job to decide how we pay for  our highways. No member of the administration or Cabinet is charged  with that responsibility.   Constitutionally, it is assigned to us here at the House of  Representatives. If the Democrats are serious about fixing our  infrastructure, they would find a way to finance it by working with us,  the Republicans.   Now, there are going to be some hard ways to figure it out. Is it to  raise the gas tax? Is it making people pay for every mile they drive or  some other mechanism, or, especially in my home State of California  with the highest cost of doing anything, adding yet more taxes? A new  one kicks in tomorrow on Californians.   That said, we are supposed to be here to discuss it. We are supposed  to have a little interaction. This bill, unfortunately, has not.   So we push another partisan wish list onto this floor, make the  President figure it out. Unfortunately, it doesn't have much chance to  work this way.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Missouri for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, once again, we all faithfully submitted to the Rules  Committee, and our Republican amendments largely were ignored. So, we  have in this en bloc amendment policy that hasn't really been fully  thought out.   One I would like to highlight here is one sponsor that looks at a  single issue with hauling waste by rail and tries to apply a solution  to the entire rail industry. But one size doesn't fit all, as we see  time and time again in this business.   Seeing one issue with waste transported by rail and deciding the  solution is to cover every single waste railcar with a type of a  covering should be a flashing red light to everyone. Again, because you  have different types of waste, you have different railcar equipment.  But then Congress just ruling, ``Well, all of them should be covered,''  what does that drive? Cost, expense--already difficult, sometimes, in  hauling freight.   And we have a mandate coming out of D.C. that hasn't been discussed  or really vetted fully with the rail industry. Where does it make  sense? Where does it not?   The extra cost associated with retrofitting every railcar can result  in waste simply traveling by truck instead. Now, everybody likes  trucks, right? Well, at least I do. But the most efficient means of  moving is the one that is most cost-effective and takes the most amount  of material the longest distance, and rail fits that mold very well  when we are talking about long distances with high amounts of material.   Instead, this will decimate rail funding and send the waste to the  same highway system that Democrats have refused to properly fund in  this bill, looking for, instead, pie-in-the-sky green-type things.   Why don't we take time, consult with the industry that would like to  sit down at the table, and say: We have ideas on how we could haul  waste more efficiently, or recovery that might fit certain types of  material but doesn't fit everything.   We would like to have a bipartisan process in that, too, because  Republicans have been largely left out of the discussion, which is sad,  because we want to be successful with this legislation and other  related legislation later in the year that have to get done and be able  to take it over to the Senate side and, ultimately, the White House.   This does not look like that type of collaboration. It looks more  like, again, one that is an election-year-type of collaboration, a  noncollaboration, and not one designed to succeed, which I don't  understand.   With everything we have going on in this country, we need that kind  of cooperation. At home, in my own State of California, we have budget  problems now. We have issues to deal with. In another part of this  bill, there is still more funding for high-speed rail.   In my home State of California, with budget problems, with highways  that are crumbling, with the water system, our infrastructure needs to  be focused on things that are successful for the people of the State,  and high-speed rail in California is not it.   In this situation here, just simply willy-nilly saying that ``all  waste cars have to have coverings on them now,'' again, that might be  noble in certain cases.   Talk to the industry. Talk with the industry. Come up with ideas that  actually makes sense for them and for the costs, because everything  that they bring, every item they bring, is something that somebody  needs or somebody has discarded and needs to be disposed of properly.  It is going to cost somehow into the whole chain, ultimately, the  consumer--not government, not rich people, not big companies, the  consumer, the low-income, middle-income consumer, especially where they  have so much hitting them these days, trying to maintain their jobs,  get their kids to school, whatever it is.   We keep hitting more and more mandates that don't make any sense and  don't have any idea what the size and scope of what they are putting  upon an industry is.   Mr. Speaker, with this piece in this particular en bloc, it just  again shows that this hasn't really been a serious process and why H.R.  2 should not be supported.
