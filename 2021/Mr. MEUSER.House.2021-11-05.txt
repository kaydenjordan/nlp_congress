 Madam Speaker, after elections where the American people  rebuked the left's tax, spend, and Big Government control agenda, our  Democrat colleagues are doubling down on failed and unpopular policies  that will exacerbate inflation, workforce and supply shortages that are  hurting everyone, including waste, abuse, and fraud.   Madam Speaker, this reconciliation bill has no return on investment  for the American people. In fact, independent analysis shows it  decreases GDP and it will weaken U.S. economic strength worldwide.   The bill raises $420 billion in taxes on small businesses while  giving a massive tax break for high earners in high-tax states.   It gives amnesty and driver's licenses to illegal immigrants while a  crisis rages at the border. It spends big on entitlements that  disincentivize work and, as stated, are ripe for fraud. As well, it  misses any mark for pay-for by $2 trillion to $3 trillion.   This irresponsible spending bill, coupled, by the way, with a  bipartisan  [[Page H6222]]  Transportation and Infrastructure bill, has made it very,  unfortunately, impossible to support both, because the net effect of  these dependent bills is detrimental to our economy, national security,  and global competitiveness.
