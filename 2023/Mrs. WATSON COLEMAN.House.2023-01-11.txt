 Madam Speaker, I rise because I am appalled that  this is how my Republican colleagues have chosen to start this  majority.   It appears that actually legislating is too great a challenge for my  colleagues, who have no apparent plan to address the real issues facing  our country, including the rising tide of violent extremism.   H. Con. Res. 3 condemns violence against anti-abortion organizations.  It says nothing about the violence against abortion providers that has  gone largely unaddressed for nearly 50 years. Last year, I supported  legislation that offered real solutions to rising violence against  abortion providers.   Madam Speaker, I would be happy to work with my colleagues on fixing  H. Con. Res. 3 to actually acknowledge the rising violence, but I  cannot and will not support it in its current form, and I encourage my  colleagues to vote ``no.''
