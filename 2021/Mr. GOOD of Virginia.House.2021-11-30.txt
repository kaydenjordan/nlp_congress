 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Lamborn for  doing this very important work that we are doing here tonight.   As a born-again Christian, I am proud to let everyone know that the  most important thing in my life is my faith. When I ran for Congress a  year ago, I identified as a Biblical and constitutional conservative  and was told I was too conservative to win. I start each day very early  in the morning--I am a 4:30 riser--with 30 minutes in God's Word before  I spend my time in prayer from there.                                time  2000    Why did FDR declare it National Bible Week 80 years ago on the eve of  the entrance of the U.S. into the greatest existential crisis that it  would ever face, World War II?   Because the Bible is the source of all truth, containing God's  complete revelation of all that He wanted us to know, everything  pertaining to this life and next.   There is a reason why it is the number one, all-time best seller,  with far more original manuscript evidence than any publication in  human history, despite the efforts by oppressive regimes to try to ban  it and stamp it out.   The Bible is God's love letter to us. The Bible is God's guidebook to  us on how to live. The Bible is our map on how to get to heaven and how  to have eternal life. It contains the Gospel, the good news of Jesus  Christ and His death and resurrection that makes salvation possible.   It is the Bible that tells us that we are created in God's image,  male and female, that He knows us in the womb, even before our mother  knows we are there, and He has unique plans for each one of us.   It is the Bible that tells us of God's laws and design for morality,  for marriage, for the family, the very foundations of our society.   Having been written between 2,000 and 4,000 years ago, the Bible is  still the tool that God uses to change lives today. It contains a story  of a man named Jesus, born 2,000 years ago, who had no formal  education, never traveled more than a few miles from His hometown,  never held public office, had no media or social media to help Him get  His message out, and was executed at age 33 after 3 short years of  public ministry.   He had a small group of disciples, all of whom were martyred for  their faith and their personal witness to what they saw Him do,  including His resurrection from the dead.   And this Jesus has hundreds of millions of followers around the world  today because they were introduced to Him through the Bible, God's Holy  Word.
