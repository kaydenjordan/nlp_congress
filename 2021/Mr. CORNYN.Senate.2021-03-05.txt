 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I have a motion to commit at the desk, and  I ask that it be reported.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes of  debate equally divided.    Mr. President, the United States is facing a brewing  humanitarian crisis at the border. At the same time, we are  experiencing a global pandemic. This motion will help make sure we are  prepared.   In January 2021, the Border Patrol recorded about 75,000 encounters  on the southwest land border. That is a 60-percent increase over the  last year, which was just before the last major migrant surge.   The Department of Homeland Security is reportedly projecting that it  will apprehend 117,000 unaccompanied children this year. The Department  of Health and Human Services and the Office of Refugee Resettlement are  struggling to maintain enough bed space to shelter all of these  unaccompanied children transferred into their custody. It is estimated  the COVID-19 restrictions have reduced their capacity by about 40  percent.   The Biden administration has reactivated a facility at Carrizo  Springs, TX, to handle this influx of unaccompanied children, and press  reports indicate that an additional facility may be necessary.   So this motion, simply put, would commit the bill to the Committee on  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions with instructions to provide  adequate funding for the Office of Refugee Resettlement to address this  brewing humanitarian crisis.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
