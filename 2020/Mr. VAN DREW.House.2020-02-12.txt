 Madam Speaker, I would like to recognize the Egg Harbor  Township High School's mock trial team from south Jersey.   Egg Harbor Township High School unseated reigning Atlantic County  trial champion Mainland Regional in the county final.   Led by coaches Michael Martirone, Trevor Zompa, and Dara Quattrone,  the Egg Harbor mock trial team won for the first time in 9 years.   Students take on roles of prosecutors, defense attorneys, witnesses,  and jurors before New Jersey judges and attorneys at the New Jersey Law  Center. Egg Harbor's team will now compete in the semifinals, with the  final competition being in March.   I am going to mention all of their names: Raza Abbas, Tyler Weller,  Madeline Coyle, Annette Diaz, Michael Donchey, Gabriela Garcia, Malini  Gulati, Tasmiah Haque, Megan Herbin, Jason Hill, David Lee, Matthew  Levine, Nicholas Seppy, Ethan Saul, Carina Sharra, Danielle Sharra,  Evan Shuttleworth, Isabella Spena, and finally Skyler Szilagyi.   Congratulations, and good luck. We look forward to big things from  all of you. We are so unbelievably proud of you.                            ____________________
