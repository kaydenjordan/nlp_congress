 Madam Speaker, the America COMPETES Act is about creating  jobs and spurring innovation all across our country. It is about  recognizing that America can't compete if it leaves communities behind  and that we need to get all of our best players on the field if we are  going to win economically.   Today's bill includes a pilot version of my RECOMPETE Act, which  would provide some flexible, long-term support to empower communities  that have struggled so that they can grow jobs and strengthen their  economies. For some communities, that may mean investments in workforce  development; for others, broadband; for some, support for  entrepreneurs.   I grew up on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State, and now I am  proud to represent it. We have amazing assets and outstanding people,  but there is a real concern in some communities that their town's main  export may be young people, as prospects for the future often seem  brighter someplace else.   But with today's vote, we are saying that we don't believe in leaving  communities behind. We are saying that people should have economic  opportunity regardless of what ZIP Code they live in, and we are saying  that we can't wait.                            ____________________
