 Mr. Speaker, as we speak today, America is  facing a drug crisis that is crippling our communities.   During the month of October, over 800 pounds of fentanyl were seized  at our southern border. The drug crisis of our Nation and what we are  experiencing is a direct result of the failed border policies that have  been put in place by the Biden administration.   Recently, I spoke with the Chambersburg police chief, Ron Camacho,  who said more and more deadly drugs like fentanyl are responsible for  overdoses in our Pennsylvania communities.   In my district alone, we saw a 30 percent rise in overdose deaths  between 2019 and 2020, and sadly, that number is on the rise again. Now  is the time for Congress to take swift and decisive action.   We must ensure that law enforcement has the tools that they need to  save lives, protect our communities and keep this lethal drug off of  our streets.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and for holding this Special Order to highlight the importance  of prayer as we work in the 117th Congress.   As we speak today, we know that God and not man has the final  authority. If Congress is going to govern successfully, then we must  rely on Him to do so.   Perhaps one of our Founding Fathers from Pennsylvania said it best.  At the Constitutional Convention, Benjamin  [[Page H6707]]  Franklin asked rhetorically: ``If a sparrow cannot fall to the ground  without his notice, is it probable that an empire can rise without his  aid?''   That question has the same implications today as it did in  Philadelphia those 200-plus years ago. We know that those who build  without the Lord, they labor in vain.   In this body, we must strive to ensure that we are asking for God's  guidance as we work to solve the difficult issues that we face here  every day.   Just yesterday, I spoke with Pastor Gary Dull, from the Faith Baptist  Church of Altoona, who said if we are going to know the will of God for  our Nation, we must go to Him in prayer. In everything that we do, we  must seek his will.   As we begin the final month, let us remember, let us together humbly  pray.
