 Mr. Chairman, I strongly support my friend, Mr. Lieu's  amendment.   The Constitution bans the very self-dealing behavior that we are  seeing this President engage in on a regular basis. President Trump  illegally profits every time he and his staff visits his properties,  every time he hosts foreign and domestic officials, every time he plays  golf on his golf courses, all paid for by the American taxpayers.   We are setting a dangerous precedent while those seeking influence  and favor with the Trump administration merely spend more time at his  properties with his name on them.   Let's take a significant step to counteract the self-dealing, corrupt  behavior, by banning taxpayer funds flowing through the Department of  Defense to go into the President's pockets.    Mr. Chairman, I would just like to add a personal  perspective.   I was raised in Washington, D.C., and I remember fondly my father and  mother packing the six kids in the station wagon with the blankets, but  it was never a partisan affair. It was about Democrats and Republicans  and families in our Nation.   I had hundreds and hundreds of my constituents at the Lincoln  Memorial say that this was the most egregious display of personal ego  they have ever seen.
