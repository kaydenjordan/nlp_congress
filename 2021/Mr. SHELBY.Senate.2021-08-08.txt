 Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would  ask unanimous consent now that the Senator modify his request to  include my amendment No. 2535, and I will speak to that briefly.   The underlying bill includes billions of dollars for all manner of  infrastructure investments in the United States. However, it fails to  address critical infrastructure needs to support our national defense.  This amendment that I am bringing forth would rectify that.   I believe that we cannot, in America, continue to spend hand-over- fist on domestic priorities--a lot of them are important--without  investing dime one in our national defense infrastructure. This would  rectify that, and I would ask that it include my amendment in this.
