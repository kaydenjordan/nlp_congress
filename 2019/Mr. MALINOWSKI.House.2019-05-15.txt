 Madam Speaker, today I rise to highlight the struggle  that rail commuters in New Jersey's Seventh District face each day.   Public transportation is vital to my State, where twice as many of us  depend on it than the national average.   Right now, though, the 23,000 people who rely on the main rail line  that cuts through the heart of my district, the Raritan Valley Line,  are the only commuters in northern New Jersey without one-seat ride  access to Manhattan during peak hours. To get to New York, they must  transfer to Newark, adding at least 25 minutes to their commutes.   Now, you might ask, why am I bringing this local issue to the House?  Why can't New Jersey solve it by itself?   Well, I will tell you why. Because every rail passenger trying to get  to work along this economic corridor that is so vital, not just to my  State, but to the economy of the United States, must squeeze through a  crumbling, 110-year old bottleneck of a tunnel under the Hudson River  that is owned and operated by the Federal Government, and the Federal  Government won't fix it.   The Raritan Valley Line Mayor's Alliance, representing over 30  mayors, has been working to get one-seat ride. We need to do our part  by passing an infrastructure bill this year that will fund the Gateway  tunnel.                            ____________________
