 Madam President, I am delighted to rise today in full  support of Katherine Tai, President Biden's nominee to be our next U.S.  Trade Representative.   As my colleagues are well aware, trade is an issue that impacts every  corner of our country and, indeed, every corner of our globe. Roughly  75 percent--listen to this--75 percent of the world's purchasing power  and over 95 percent of the world's consumers lie outside of our  country's borders. If the United States is going to continue to be  successful, we need to be able to tap into those markets and expand  trading opportunities while ensuring a level playing field for American  businesses and, I might say, for American consumers as well.   In Delaware, the First State, and throughout our Nation, trade  policies affect how American businesses, both large and small--be they  financial services, tech companies, workers, farmers, manufacturers-- can compete in the global economy. But thanks to President Trump's  haphazard trade wars over the last 4 years, American farmers,  manufacturers, producers, and consumers too often have been left  hanging in the balance--a situation that has been exasperated by this  pandemic.   Now more than ever, all of them are in need of greater certainty and  predictability. For the last 30, 40 years that I have served as  Delaware's Treasurer, Congressman, Governor, and Senator, when I ask  businesses what they want or need, more often than not, they say  ``certainty and predictability.'' For the last 4 years, we have had too  little of both.   Instead of the chaotic approach of the last 4 years, we need  strategic and thoughtful trade policies. That is why President Biden  has nominated Katherine Tai, an experienced public servant and trade  expert, to serve as our Nation's top trade official. Katherine will be  a steady hand at the U.S. Trade Rep's Office, and as a key member of  the Biden administration, she will make sure that our trade policies  benefit all Americans and leave no one behind. She will work hard to  help jump-start our economy and ensure that American goods and services  can reach international markets and that we can compete on a level  playing field.   Katherine comes to this role with an exceptional breadth and depth of  relevant trade expertise. She has earned a remarkable reputation as an  expert in her field and is a leader who is respected by Democrats and  Republicans alike in this Chamber and in the House of Representatives.   In her previous role, Katherine was chief trade counsel for the House  Ways and Means Committee. There, she was a lead negotiator on the  USMCA, U.S.-Mexico-Canada-America Trade Agreement, which notably passed  Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support, in no smart part because  of her efforts.   Members of my own staff are grateful for the opportunity to work with  Katherine to secure historically strong environmental provisions,  including new monitoring and enforcement tools in the USMCA, which will  help make sure  [[Page S1542]]  that alleged environmental violations will be investigated and remedied  in a timely manner. These new tools and resources will help ensure that  environmental protections are not just words on a piece of paper but  policies that will actually be put into practice and consistently  maintained well into the future.   As chairman of both the Environment and Public Works Committee and  the Finance Subcommittee on International Trade, I look forward to  working with my colleagues and with Katherine Tai and her team to build  on the progress that was made in the USMCA.   Another immense trade challenge that we face now is to effectively  counter China's unfair trade practices and its expanding influence in  international trade. Since joining the World Trade Organization, the  WTO, in 2001, China has proven to be a bad actor time and again. I  believe that, working with our allies in the Pacific Rim in a spirit  similar to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, we can more effectively  ensure that China adheres to its trade commitments with us and with the  rest of the world.   Katherine has the expertise to help make that happen. Her prior  experience as U.S. Trade Rep's Chief Counsel for China Trade  Enforcement, where she led efforts to hold China accountable at the WTO  for its unfair trade practices, is going to prove to be a tremendous  asset for our Nation.   We would be lucky to have Katherine Tai, a committed public servant,  represent our Nation on the world stage. As a daughter of immigrants  and the first woman of color to be nominated to serve as U.S. Trade  Rep, Katherine often cites her parents, also both public servants, as  her inspiration.   In her testimony to the Finance Committee that I serve on, Katherine  said--I want to quote her. Here is what she said. Speaking of her  parents, she said:         I am proud of their service to the nation that welcomed       them. And I am proud to live in a country where, in just one       generation, their daughter could grow up to represent the       United States and our interests around the globe.    Those are her words.   I, too, am proud to serve in a country where this is possible.   Simply put, Katherine has decades of experience in trade, years of  experience working in trade in a bipartisan fashion, and a keen  understanding of the role Congress can play alongside the  administration to implement successful trade policies.   As the world grapples with the greatest economic downturn since the  Great Depression, it is more important now than ever to have a leader  at the U.S. Trade Rep's Office who will work with Congress to advance a  trade agenda that uplifts American workers in every corner of our  country, spurs domestic manufacturing, and improves environmental and  labor standards throughout the world.   Given Katherine's track record and many years of experience working  across the aisle in Congress, I am confident that she has the broad  support necessary to be a highly skilled and effective U.S. Trade  Representative as she takes on the many trade challenges that we face,  and I invite my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm Katherine  Tai to serve as our next Trade Representative.   If I could, do I have a few more minutes to speak?    Madam President, my legislative director is a woman named  Xiao. Lucy is her first name, Lucy Xiao. She said to me several months  ago, after the election--Joe Biden was elected--she said: You know, we  were working on the USMCA last year. We worked with a woman who was a  very senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee staff to help  make sure the environmental provisions in the law are not only strong  but enforceable.   She said: The woman we worked with is a top staff person on the House  Ways and Means Committee. Her name is Katherine Tai.   Lucy said to me: I think that Katherine Tai might make a good U.S.  Trade Rep and may make a very interesting human story as well.   I have huge respect for Lucy's judgment, and I turned around and I  called on the phone the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, an  old colleague from my days in the House, Richard Neal.   I said: Richard, does the name ``Katherine Tai'' mean anything to  you?   He said: Oh, yes. She is a great member of my staff.   I said: She has been suggested as someone who might serve as the U.S.  Trade Rep. What do you think?   He said: She would be excellent. She would be excellent.   The next call I made was to Ted Kaufman, former U.S. Senator, former  chief of staff to Joe Biden for many years, and the interim Senator in  this body for 2 years after Joe was elected Vice President. I called  former Senator Kaufman, who was in charge of the transition for the  Biden team, and I said: Ted, I think I have a good name for Trade Rep.   I explained who Katherine Tai was and her history and her work  experience and what Chairman Richard Neal said about her.   I said: She might be a keeper.   A week later, he called me and he said: We are getting all kinds of  great comments about Katherine Tai.   He said: You know, I think you don't always have the best judgment,  Tom Carper, but I think in this case, maybe you are like a blind  squirrel that occasionally finds a nugget.   And I think maybe in this case, I have, with the strong support and  help of Lucy.   So that is the story. That is my Katherine Tai story. She is a  keeper, and we are lucky to have her. She will succeed if confirmed.  She will succeed Robert Lighthizer and Michael Froman, our immediate  past two Trade Reps. Those are big shoes to fill, but she is very well  prepared to fill them.   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
