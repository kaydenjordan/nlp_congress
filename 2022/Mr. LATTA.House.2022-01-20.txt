 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from New Jersey for  his years of unending work for the unborn. He has been so steadfast  that, from the bottom of my heart, I thank him for all he has done.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the tragedy of abortion is the  greatest human rights issue of our day. The right to life is the  foundation upon which all other rights are built. The science is clear:  Abortion ends a human life.   Studies have proven chemical abortion puts the life of the mother in  great danger. In 2015, one in three women who took the abortion drug  ended up in the emergency room within 30 days. Let me repeat that. One  in three women who took the abortion drug ended up in the emergency  room within 30 days.   Congress must do more to provide women and their unborn children with  care and support. I am proud that my legislation, the SAVE Moms and  Babies Act, would prevent the FDA from approving new abortion drugs and  would stop these dangerous pills from being dispensed through  telemedicine.   I would like to thank everyone in Washington, D.C., this week who is  offering their unwavering dedication to defending the unborn despite a  culture that often marginalizes pro-life values.
