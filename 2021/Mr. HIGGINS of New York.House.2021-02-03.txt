 Mr. Speaker, the past year has tested  America's resolve and steeled our character. We enter a new year  optimistic with still much work before us.   The pandemic has taken much from us, but it has also shown us the  best of our country: Americans helping one another through acts of  charity and kindness; health workers going nonstop to treat, test,  trace, and vaccinate; teachers, firefighters, police, and sanitation  workers serving the public at great risk to their own health.   Vaccines are being distributed and administered. Hope is in sight.  But many Americans are still in peril, and Congress must act.   President Biden's American Rescue Plan is the bold initiative which  meets this critical moment. Now is the time to go big, to guarantee  every family has food and shelter over their heads; to safely get our  children back into the classrooms; to protect our small businesses,  restaurants, and workers who braved this pandemic; and to invest in  [[Page H299]]  our State and local communities that have fought this virus on the  front lines.   I strongly urge my colleagues to support this budget resolution. Only  through bold action can we crush this virus, return to normal, and  build a stronger Nation.
