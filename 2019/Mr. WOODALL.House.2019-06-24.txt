 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, if you had granted me more than 5 minutes,  I would have spent much more of that time talking about how good it was  to see you there in the chair, but you will just have to know I am  feeling it here, even though I can't belabor that point.   I serve on the Transportation Committee, Mr. Chairman, and my  amendment proposes to strike jurisdiction that belongs to the  Transportation Committee from the appropriations bill. Now, as you  know, clause 2 of the House Rules prohibits legislating on an  appropriations bill, but the House Rules Committee waived those rules  as this bill came to the floor, so the only alternative I have is to  come and try to strike that provision.   The truth is that we have not had a single hearing on this provision  in the Transportation Committee, Mr. Chairman. We have not had a single  witness testify in the Transportation Committee. We have had bills  sitting in the Transportation Committee that purport to deal with this  topic since January and have not called a single bit of activity  directed in this direction, despite having moved a whole host of bills  to the House floor already this year.   I see that my friends, the chairman of the Transportation Committee  and the chair of the subcommittee, have put out a Dear Colleague  encouraging the defeat of this amendment, surrendering this  jurisdiction of the Transportation Committee to the Appropriations  Committee.  [[Page H5048]]    Mr. Chairman, there are times that we do have to legislate on  appropriations bills, those times that we can't have a functioning  authorizing process. That is not the case with Chairman DeFazio. It is  not the case with Chairwoman Holmes Norton, and I cannot imagine, for  the life of me, why this House would choose to tuck into the back of an  appropriations bill language that should be heard by the full  authorizing committee.   If we strike this language today, my commitment is to work with all  my friends in the House to try to move language forward through the  regular authorizing process and have that back on the House floor this  year.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would have said in the realm of common  sense that the authorizing committee should be allowed to authorize.   I would have said the realm of common sense would have been that, if  we have a committee that is functioning, we should allow that committee  to function.   I would have said in the realm of common sense, if the committee  chairman supports it and the subcommittee chairman supports it, that  perhaps we should have had a hearing where we at least talked about it.   I ask, Mr. Chairman, when 80 percent of the TIFIA money goes to only  10 States, what impact does this have on smaller States?                                time  1530    I would yield to anyone who knows, but we don't know because this  isn't the authorizing committee.   The cardinal is absolutely right: He provided additional money in CIG  dollars this year. But when there are projects on the horizon that  would, by themselves, as a single project, Mr. Chair, consume not 1- year's worth of funding, not 2-years' worth of funding, but 3-years'  worth of funding, leaving nothing for any other projects in the Nation,  what is the impact of having a mandatory authorization?   I see my friend, the chairman, at the desk. I love working with my  friend, the chairman, in the committee. In his Dear Colleague that he  and Eleanor Holmes Norton sent last year, he pointed out exactly what I  am concerned about today, Mr. Chair. He said: ``As you know, the CIG  program's statutory language is not like a typical discretionary grant  program. . . . It is a pipeline program where eligible projects that  meet the statutory criteria . . . are funded subject only to continuing  appropriations.''   The ``may'' language my friend from North Carolina cited, rather than  ``shall'' language, is included specifically because there is no  discretion to prevent the large projects from sucking all the money out  of the funding stream.   I have that concern, and I would love to be able to share that  concern and talk about that concern in the committee of jurisdiction.  Again, I commit to working with any Member who wants to move such  language forward.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chair, I know my friend from Oregon, when he talked  about rotten politics and those motivations, wasn't talking about me. I  know that he was not. If he had been, we would have taken that  conversation a different direction. I know that he was not because my  concern is sincere.    The fact that so much of that conversation centered on the White  House does make me wonder whether or not politics is at play here.  [[Page H5049]]    To have the authorizing chairman say on the floor of the House that  there is no statutory difference between the Secretary ``may'' and the  Secretary ``shall'' is the most shocking thing I have heard in 2019. It  is the definition of a categorical difference.   We put ``may'' in there for a reason, and that is to prevent a  perversion of the process, the perversion that I am concerned about,  the perversion that my friend from Oregon could dismiss if only we  would hold a hearing in the committee and allow me to hear from some  experts about it.   My concern is sincere, and the concern of communities in my State is  sincere. There is a reason the House rules prohibit doing this on the  House floor because our shared concerns are sincere.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
