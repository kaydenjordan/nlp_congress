 Madam Speaker, earlier this week, I led my Democratic  and Republican colleagues in introducing legislation to eliminate  discrimination against parents and guardians with disabilities.   Together with Representatives Bass, Bacon, Fitzpatrick, and Lawrence,  I introduced the Equality for Families with Disabilities Act, just 2  weeks before the 32nd anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities  Act.   Today, there are 4.1 million parents with disabilities raising  families here in the United States. Yet, parents and guardians with  disabilities face excessive scrutiny and disproportionate targeting for  unwarranted intervention from child welfare agencies.   The research is clear: Children raised by parents with disabilities  do not exhibit stunted development or worse outcomes than their peers.  In fact, the opposite is true. Children raised by parents with  disabilities demonstrate greater compassion, tolerance, problem-solving  skills, and other positive characteristics.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to end discrimination against parents and  guardians in State child welfare proceedings once and for all.   Thirty-two years since Congress passed the Americans with  Disabilities Act, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this  urgent legislation.                            ____________________
