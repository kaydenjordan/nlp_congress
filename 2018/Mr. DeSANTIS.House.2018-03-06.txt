 Mr. Speaker, in the private sector, if an employer is  going to hire somebody, a lot of times they will do a Google search,  they will check social media postings to try to learn a little bit more  about this prospective employee.   It may be hard to believe, but the Federal Government often fails to  conduct a simple internet search on individuals before they are trusted  with a security clearance.   Publicly available social media is one of the best ways to understand  an individual's interests and intentions, but our investigatory process  still focuses on interviewing the applicant's family, friends, and  neighbors. For over a decade, various agencies, including the Office of  Personnel Management, have conducted studies and pilot programs to  assess the effectiveness of social media checks in security clearance  investigations. Congress has not been provided those results.   What this bill will do is it will require these agencies to identify  best practices so that we can use this going forward to make sure that  the people who are employed by this government, armed with a security  clearance, who have access to sensitive information that puts the  security of the country at risk, that these are people whom we want to  have there and they are not folks who have ulterior designs.   A lot of times it is going to be much more informative to look at  their publicly available writings than to talk to somebody who may have  lived next door to them in an apartment 10 years ago.   I think that this bill is overdue.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) for  cosponsoring it for me, and I am proud to be here today as the sponsor.  I think this should have bipartisan support. I think it will give us  some good answers and we can move forward and modernize this process.
