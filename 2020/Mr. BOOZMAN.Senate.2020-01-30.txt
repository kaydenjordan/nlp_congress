 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Arkansas.    I send a question to the desk on behalf of myself,  Senators Cotton, Ernst, Young, Hawley, Risch, Fischer, and Hoeven.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Senator Boozman and the other Senators pose a question to both sides:         In the House Managers' opening statement, they argue that       it is necessary to pursue impeachment because ``The       President's misconduct cannot be decided at the ballot box.       For we cannot be assured that the vote would be fairly won.''       How would acquitting the President prevent voters from making       an informed decision in the 2020 presidential election?    The President's counsel goes first.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the  Senate.   That is exactly who should decide who should be President, the  voters. All power comes from the people in this country. That is why  you are here; that is why people are elected in the House; and that is  why the President is elected. It is exactly who should decide the  question, particularly in a case like this, where it is purely  partisan.   Here is the other thing, when we are talking about impeachment as a  political weapon, they didn't tell you what they told the court over  the holidays when they were waiting to deliver the Impeachment  Articles. They went and told the court: They are actually still  impeaching over there in the House; did you know that? They are  actually still impeaching.   They are coming here, and they are telling you: Please do the work  that we didn't do, where we had 2 days in the House Judiciary  Committee; we had to rush delivery for Christmas; and then we waited  and waited and waited. But now we want you to call witnesses that we  never called; that we didn't subpoena. They want to turn you into an  investigative body. In the meantime, they are saying: By the way, we  are still doing it over there. We are still impeaching. And they want  to slow down now. They don't want to speed up. They want to slow it  down and take up the election year and continue this political charade.  It is all so wrong. It is all so wrong.   Let's leave it to the people of the United States. Let's trust them.  They are asking you not to trust them. Maybe they don't trust them.  Maybe they won't like the result. We should trust them. That is who  should decide who the President of this country should be. It will be a  few months from now, and they should decide.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, I appreciate the  question.   President Trump must be removed from office because of his ongoing  abuse of power. It threatens the integrity of the next election.   As we saw from the video montage, the President has made no bones  about the fact that he is willing to seek foreign intervention to help  him cheat in the next election.   Now, counsel for the President says the next election is the remedy.  It is not the remedy when the President is trying to seek to cheat in  that very election. This is why the Founders did not put a requirement  that a President can only be impeached in their first term. Indeed, at  that time, of course, there weren't term limits on the Presidency.   If it were the intent of the Framers to say that a President can't be  impeached in an election year, they would have said so. Now, they  didn't for a reason, because they were concerned about a President who  might try to cheat in that very election.   Now, counsel--as I was getting to a moment ago--made the argument: If  you make the decision as impartial jurors that the President has  violated the Constitution, he has abused his power, he should be  convicted and removed from office, that the country will not accept it.  I have more confidence in the American people than that. But I will  assure you of this: If you make the decision that a fair trial can be  conducted without hearing from witnesses, the American people will not  accept that judgment because the American people understand what goes  into a fair trial, and they understand that a fair trial requires both  sides to have the opportunity to present their case.   We would like to present our case. We would like to call our  witnesses. We would like to rely on more than our argumentation.   There are few things about this trial that Americans agree on, but  one thing they are squarely in agreement on--well, two. They believe a  trial should have witness testimony, and they want to hear from John  Bolton. That is the overwhelming consensus of the American people, and  it is consistent with common sense.   Let's give the country a trial they can be proud of. Let's show that  at least the process worked and that we followed the Founders' intent  that a trial have witnesses. I don't think anyone can quarrel with the  fact, when you look at the history of this body and evidence of  impeachment--   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Virginia.
