 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts and  the gentleman from Pennsylvania, both friends of ours, for their words.   On this very important day, St. Patrick's Day, we are acknowledging a  very important anniversary. Anybody who knows much about Irish history  knows that anniversaries are very important. The acknowledgment of  certain events that occurred throughout the sometimes perilous history  of this small country of 6 million people, north and south, are  reminded of just how grim Bloody Sunday was.   I knew those families. I recall when the former Prime Minister of the  U.K., David Cameron, acknowledged years after in a public statement, in  a speech that he made on the floor of the House of Commons, the then- Prime Minister acknowledged that Bloody Sunday had victimized innocent  bystanders.   For a long time, the argument had been made that these were  paramilitaries on both sides. It was only the test of history that  fully acknowledged the truth of what happened on that day.   Their civil rights movement in the north was modeled, in some  measure, upon the civil rights movement here in America. I knew John  Hume very well. He was a great man at a great moment. I have known  Gerry Adams and others who participated in these very difficult events.  But out of this tumultuous time came something else, and that was the  Good Friday Agreement.   We are now coming upon the 25th anniversary of that agreement.  America is a guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement. Successive  Presidents of the United States, Democrat and Republican, have all  embraced the Good Friday Agreement as the way forward, the path,  understanding as well that the success of the Good Friday Agreement  came about because everybody had to give up something.   The Republic of Ireland gave up Articles 2 and 3 of its Constitution,  which laid claim to the six counties of the north, and the United  Kingdom gave up the border, which was a huge issue. Strand 2 of the  Good Friday Agreement reinforced the idea of a growing relationship  between Dublin and Belfast.   Let me lay this out in perspective, in the time I have remaining.   Thirty years ago, in the north of Ireland, there were 30,000 British  soldiers in an area geographically the size of the State of  Connecticut. You couldn't go anyplace. It was a militarized zone. The  Friends of Ireland, which is 40 years old--always Democrat and  Republican, we made sure of it--the success of the Good Friday  Agreement came about because of the goodwill of the men and women who  live on that island.   We should be celebrating the outcome of the Good Friday Agreement.  But part of it is also acknowledging these perilous moments in Irish  history. I suspect that we will be discussing for years to come  Americans' dimension to bringing about the Good Friday Agreement.   Just think of it: Two generations of children have now grown up in  this small, six-county area not knowing anything about the violence.   It was the reach and the role of the United States, an honest broker,  that helped bring about that agreement, which, even with bumps, people  have fully acknowledged it has worked. So the template is there.   As we celebrate the ancient culture of St. Patrick's Day, there is  something else for people of subjugation, occupation, An Gorta Mor, as  the Great Famine is known, or civil wars, risings, and revolutions,  that indomitable spirit on that tiny island, which we just celebrated,  Republican and Democrat, with the President of the United States, last  evening with the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister of Ireland, talking  about the lasting bond between the two countries.    I hope that people will use the example of what the gentleman from  Massachusetts and the gentleman from Pennsylvania have done today,  because they have acknowledged this very important moment.   What happened on Bloody Sunday, the world had a chance to witness,  and it helped shape world opinion. Thank you both for doing this today.  There is not a better way to honor St. Patrick than what you two have  laid out today.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7108) to suspend normal trade relations treatment for the  Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7108         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Suspending Normal Trade       Relations with Russia and Belarus Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The United States is a founding member of the World       Trade Organization (WTO) and is committed to ensuring that       the WTO remains an effective forum for peaceful economic       engagement.        (2) Ukraine is a sovereign nation-state that is entitled to       enter into agreements with other sovereign states and to full       respect of its territorial integrity.        (3) The United States will be unwavering in its support for       a secure, democratic, and sovereign Ukraine, free to choose       its own leaders and future.        (4) Ukraine acceded to the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing       the World Trade Organization (WTO Agreement) and has been a       WTO member since 2008.        (5) Ukraine's participation in the WTO Agreement creates       both rights and obligations vis-a-vis other WTO members.        (6) The Russian Federation acceded to the WTO on August 22,       2012, becoming the 156th WTO member, and the Republic of       Belarus has applied to accede to the WTO.        (7) From the date of its accession, the Russian Federation       committed to apply fully all provisions of the WTO.        (8) The United States Congress authorized permanent normal       trade relations for the Russian Federation through the Russia       and Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of       Law Accountability Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-208).        (9) Ukraine communicated to the WTO General Council on       March 2, 2022, urging that all WTO members take action       against the Russian Federation and ``consider further steps       with the view to suspending the Russian Federation's       participation in the WTO for its violation of the purpose and       principles of this Organization''.        (10) Vladimir Putin, a ruthless dictator, has led the       Russian Federation into a war of aggression against Ukraine,       which--        (A) denies Ukraine and its people their collective rights       to independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity;        (B) constitutes an emergency in international relations,       because it is a situation of armed conflict that threatens       the peace and security of all countries, including the United       States; and        (C) denies Ukraine its rightful ability to participate in       international organizations, including the WTO.        (11) The Republic of Belarus, also led by a ruthless       dictator, Aleksander Lukashenka, is providing important       material support to the Russian Federation's aggression.        (12) The Russian Federation's exportation of goods in the       energy sector is central to its ability to wage its war of       aggression on Ukraine.        (13) The United States, along with its allies and partners,       has responded to recent aggression by the Russian Federation       in Ukraine by imposing sweeping financial sanctions and       stringent export controls.        (14) The United States cannot allow the consequences of the       Russian Federation's actions to go unaddressed, and must lead       fellow countries, in all fora, including the WTO, to impose       appropriate consequences for the Russian Federation's       aggression.       SEC. 3. SUSPENSION OF NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS WITH THE RUSSIAN                     FEDERATION AND THE REPUBLIC OF BELARUS.         (a) Nondiscriminatory Tariff Treatment.--Notwithstanding       any other provision of law, beginning on the day after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the rates of duty set       forth in column 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the       United States shall apply to all products of the Russian       Federation and of the Republic of Belarus.        (b) Authority to Proclaim Increased Column 2 Rates.--        (1) In general.--The President may proclaim increases in       the rates of duty applicable to products of the Russian       Federation or the Republic of Belarus, above the rates set       forth in column 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the       United States.        (2) Prior consultation.--The President shall, not later       than 5 calendar days before issuing any proclamation under       paragraph (1), consult with the Committee on Ways and Means       of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance       of the Senate regarding the basis for and anticipated impact       of the proposed increases to rates of duty described in       paragraph (1).        (3) Termination.--The authority to issue proclamations       under this subsection shall terminate on January 1, 2024.       SEC. 4. RESUMPTION OF APPLICATION OF HTS COLUMN 1 RATES OF                     DUTY AND RESTORATION OF NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS                     TREATMENT FOR THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE                     REPUBLIC OF BELARUS.         (a) Temporary Application of HTS Column 1 Rates of Duty.--        (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law       (including the application of column 2 rates of duty under       section 3), the President is authorized to temporarily       resume, for one or more periods not to exceed 1 year each,       the application of the rates of duty set forth in column 1 of       the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to the       products of the Russian Federation, the Republic of Belarus,       or both, if the President submits to Congress with respect to       either or both such countries a certification under       subsection (c) for each such period. Such action shall take       effect beginning on the date that is 90 calendar days after       the date of submission of such certification for such period,       unless there is enacted into law during such 90-day period a       joint resolution of disapproval.        (2) Consultation and report.--The President shall, not       later than 45 calendar days before submitting a certification       under paragraph (1)--        (A) consult with the Committee on Ways and Means of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the       Senate; and        (B) submit to both such committees a report that explains       the basis for the determination of the President contained in       such certification.        (b) Restoration of Normal Trade Relations Treatment.--        (1) In general.--The President is authorized to resume the       application of the rates of duty set forth in column 1 of the       Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to the       products of the Russian Federation, the Republic of Belarus,       or both, if the President submits to Congress with respect to       either or both such countries a certification under       subsection (c). Such action shall take effect beginning on       the date that is 90 calendar days after the date of       submission of such certification, unless there is enacted       into law during such 90-day period a joint resolution of       disapproval.        (2) Consultation and report.--The President shall, not       later than 45 calendar days before submitting a certification       under paragraph (1)--        (A) consult with the Committee on Ways and Means of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the       Senate; and        (B) submit to both such committees a report that explains       the basis for the determination of the President contained in       such certification.        (3) Products of the russian federation.--If the President       submits pursuant to paragraph (1) a certification under       subsection (c) with respect to the Russian Federation and a       joint resolution of disapproval is not enacted during the 90-      day period described in that paragraph, the President may       grant permanent nondiscriminatory tariff treatment (normal       trade relations) to the products of the Russian Federation.        (4) Products of the republic of belarus.--If the President       submits pursuant to paragraph (1) a certification under       subsection (c) with respect to the Republic of Belarus and a       joint resolution of disapproval is not enacted during the 90-      day period described in that paragraph, the President may,       subject to the provisions of chapter 1 of  [[Page H3803]]       title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.),       grant nondiscriminatory tariff treatment (normal trade       relations) to the products of the Republic of Belarus.        (c) Certification.--A certification under this subsection       is a certification in writing that--        (1) specifies the action proposed to be taken pursuant to       the certification and whether such action is pursuant to       subsection (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section; and        (2) contains a determination of the President that the       Russian Federation or the Republic of Belarus (or both)--        (A) has reached an agreement relating to the respective       withdrawal of Russian or Belarusian forces (or both, if       applicable) and cessation of military hostilities that is       accepted by the free and independent government of Ukraine;        (B) poses no immediate military threat of aggression to any       North Atlantic Treaty Organization member; and        (C) recognizes the right of the people of Ukraine to       independently and freely choose their own government.        (d) Joint Resolution of Disapproval.--        (1) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term       ``joint resolution of disapproval'' means only a joint       resolution--        (A) which does not have a preamble;        (B) the title of which is as follows: ``Joint resolution       disapproving the President's certification under section 4(c)       of the Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and       Belarus Act.''; and        (C) the matter after the resolving clause of which is as       follows: ``That Congress disapproves the certification of the       President under section 4(c) of the Suspending Normal Trade       Relations with Russia and Belarus Act, submitted to Congress       on ___'', the blank space being filled in with the       appropriate date.

(4) Floor consideration in the house of representatives.--        (A) Reporting and discharge.--If a committee of the House       to which a joint resolution of disapproval has been referred       has not reported such joint resolution within 10 legislative       days after the date of referral, that committee shall be       discharged from further consideration thereof.        (B) Proceeding to consideration.--Beginning on the third       legislative day after each committee to which a joint       resolution of disapproval has been referred reports it to the       House or has been discharged from further consideration       thereof, it shall be in order to move to proceed to consider       the joint resolution in the House. All points of order       against the motion are waived. Such a motion shall not be in       order after the House has disposed of a motion to proceed on       a joint resolution with regard to the same certification. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       motion to its adoption without intervening motion. The motion       shall not be debatable.

The motion to       proceed is not debatable. The motion is not subject to a       motion to postpone. A motion to reconsider the vote by which       the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in       order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the       joint resolution of disapproval is agreed to, the joint       resolution shall remain the unfinished business until       disposed of.        (D) Debate.--Debate on the joint resolution of disapproval,       and on all debatable motions and appeals in connection       therewith, shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, which       shall be divided equally between the majority and minority       leaders or their designees.

An amendment to, or a motion       to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of       other business, or a motion to recommit the joint resolution       of disapproval is not in order.        (E) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage shall occur       immediately following the conclusion of the debate on the       joint resolution of disapproval and a single quorum call at       the conclusion of the debate, if requested in accordance with       the rules of the Senate.        (F) Rules of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the       decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the       rules of the Senate, as the case may be, to the procedure       relating to the joint resolution of disapproval shall be       decided without debate.        (G) Consideration of veto messages.--Debate in the Senate       of any veto message with respect to the joint resolution of       disapproval, including all debatable motions and appeals in       connection with such joint resolution, shall be limited to 10       hours, to be equally divided between, and controlled by, the       majority leader and the minority leader or their designees.        (6) Procedures in the senate.--Except as otherwise provided       in this subsection, the following procedures shall apply in       the Senate to a joint resolution of disapproval to which this       subsection applies:        (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a joint       resolution of disapproval that has passed the House of       Representatives shall, when received in the Senate, be       referred to the Committee on Finance for consideration in       accordance with this subsection.        (B) If a joint resolution of disapproval to which this       subsection applies was introduced in the Senate before       receipt of a joint resolution of disapproval that has passed       the House of Representatives, the joint resolution from the       House of Representatives shall, when received in the Senate,       be placed on the calendar. If this subparagraph applies, the       procedures in the Senate with respect to a joint resolution       of disapproval introduced in the Senate that contains the       identical matter as the joint resolution of disapproval that       passed the House of Representatives shall be the same as if       no joint resolution of disapproval had been received from the       House of Representatives, except that the vote on passage in       the Senate shall be on the joint resolution of disapproval       that passed the House of Representatives.        (7) Rules of the house of representatives and senate.--This       subsection is enacted by Congress--        (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate       and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such       are deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively,       but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be       followed in that House in the case of legislation described       in those sections, and supersede other rules only to the       extent that they are inconsistent with such rules; and        (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of       either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the       procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and       to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that       House.       SEC. 5. COOPERATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE WORLD TRADE                     ORGANIZATION.

(2) Clerical amendment.--The table of contents in section       2(b) and in title XII of division A of the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328)       are each amended by striking the items relating to section       1265.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, yesterday morning, Congress heard directly from  Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. He showed us the absolute horrors that  Russia is inflicting on the Ukrainian people in full view of the world,  and he pleaded for us to do more.   With the legislation that stands before us at this hour, we intend to  answer his call. Ranking Member Brady and I have been united in our  desire to end permanent normal trade relations with Russia. And I must  say that Mr. Brady has been very consistent as we have discussed this  legislation.   With the House passage of H.R. 7108 today, we will take that  impactful step and place even greater economic pressure on Putin and  his brutal regime. We must do everything in our power to hold Russia  accountable for the atrocities it is committing hourly in the nation of  Ukraine.   This is an unprovoked horror that the world is seeing. Our partners  and allies are joining with us in this effort, taking similar steps to  further isolate Putin and his regime from the rest of the civilized  world.   I urge every single one of our colleagues today to support the  Ukrainian people, punish Russia for its ruthless aggression, and vote  to advance this measure.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), the chairman of the Trade Subcommittee who has  been a real leader on this issue.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett), who has been a real leader on this issue as well.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), who has had a longstanding interest in  human rights.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle), a champion of human rights  everywhere.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), whose entire career has been consistently  based on the advancement of human rights everywhere.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), who has had a long history as a  champion of human rights.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee ) who has been a consistent champion of human  rights.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) whose work on human rights is well known.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), our distinguished majority leader who, again, has  been a consistent champion of human rights.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, as I close, I thank Mr. Brady for his partnership in  this effort to hold Putin accountable and for his support for the  Ukrainian people.   I also was moved by the gentlewoman from Indiana's testimony just a  few minutes ago about Ukraine when she said this is not normal  behavior. This is not the regularization, we hope, of normal behavior,  a return to the old Soviet empire.   Madam Speaker, I applaud the terrific work of the Committee on Ways  and Means Trade Subcommittee staff, particularly Alexandra Whittaker,  Katie White, and Sofia Ferber. Their expertise and dedication made this  legislation possible, and I thank them for their contributions.   Madam Speaker, I think in the many years that I have been in this  House, one of the most moving moments occurred yesterday when we heard  the President of Ukraine, Zelenskyy--duly elected, incidentally--talk  about the pain and anguish but also the courage of the Ukrainian  people. To witness the bombardment and the murder and killing of  innocent children by this Russian dictator, I hope all the world, like  this Congress today, will abhor that.   Madam Speaker, it is not enough just to applaud and to talk about the  challenges that Russia has presented to the civilized world. We have to  do something about it.   Coming on the heels of the oil embargo, I believe this will also  receive broad bipartisan support today, and it will swiftly move from  Congress to President Biden's desk. There is no time to waste.  [[Page H3810]]    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7108, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
