 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Wildfires are a huge problem in our country. They are becoming more  frequent and more intense, and they pose a growing threat to public  safety and local economies.   But, instead of taking steps to reduce wildfire threats, this bill  tries to scare us into weakening environmental safeguards and giving  away public land management to States and localities.   I agree with the bill's sponsor that overgrown vegetation and falling  trees can spark forest fires. However, government data shows that this  accounts for less than one-third of 1 percent of fires in the past 5  years.   Why are we focusing on this minor problem when it is clear that real  wildfire solutions require treating these fires like the disasters that  they are under the law, and allowing the Forest Service to use its base  budget for preventing wildfires, not just fighting them?   Given what we have seen from Republicans in the Natural Resources  Committee, the answer is simple: to chip away at the National  Environmental Policy Act, NEPA; shut expert Federal agencies and  concerned citizens out of the land management process; and allow Big  Business to profit at the expense of taxpayers and our public lands.   The bill lets State and local electricity reliability standards trump  public land management rules. There is not even any requirement that  the standards are based on sound science or principles of risk  assessment.   If a county says it needs to clear-cut a half mile into a national  forest to protect power lines, this bill would allow it, and the Forest  Service could only watch. Further, there is no prohibition on selling  timber harvested during these operations.   The bill also mandates the Forest Service and BLM use its NEPA  categorical exclusion authority, even when vegetation management  projects could cause environmental damage. This means that people who  value public lands would be completely shut out from the management  process. So much for transparency and public input.   Adding insult to injury, the bill waives liability for companies that  start forest fires or cause other damage. This is nonsense and shifts  an incredible burden and risk onto American taxpayers.   The bill also fails to deal with the root causes of our fire crisis,  including the fact that the Forest Service cannot afford mitigation  work to prevent wildfires because it spends half of its budget fighting  them.   I support legislation making wildfire disasters eligible for disaster  assistance under the Stafford Act, and I know many of my colleagues,  both Republicans and Democrats, do as well. I am disappointed that we  are not passing a bill to do that today, and, instead, are here just  pretending to do something about a very serious problem.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, let me repeat: We are talking about  caution and what is causing fires; and 0.03 percent of fires caused by  transmission lines is the data that is available to us. I know facts  sometimes don't matter, but they should matter in something as  important as this; and 0.03 percent is the cause by transmission lines  of fires in the forest on public lands.   We are generalizing the huge wildfires that we have seen to make a  case for this bill when the case is about transmission lines, rights- of-away; and it is 0.03 percent as the root cause of those fires over 5  years.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Costa).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Schrader).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   An example that supporters of this legislation use is from Oregon. It  is from 1984. In the 33 years since then, I am aware of no example of a  Federal agency refusing to allow a company to do vegetation management  work and then holding the company liable for the damages.   In fact, as the committee report for this bill states, the issue of  land managers allowing access to rights-of-way was largely resolved by  language in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, stating:         Federal agencies responsible for approving access to       electric transmission and distribution facilities located on       lands within the United States shall, in accordance with       applicable law, expedite any Federal agency approvals that       are necessary to allow owners and operators of such       facilities to comply with any reliability standard approved       by the Commission under section 215 of the Federal Power Act       that pertains to vegetation management, service restorations,       or any situation that imminently endangers the reliability or       safety of the facilities.    If the utility companies feel that BLM and the Forest Service are not  complying with the law, they should seek resolution in the court.  Instead, they are coming after a backdoor opportunity to affect our  public lands.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   At a hearing on similar legislation in the Natural Resources  Committee last Congress, both the Forest Service and BLM testified in  opposition and explained how they work with utility companies to  address vegetation management issues.  [[Page H5026]]    In addition to entering into voluntary vegetation management plans,  the Forest Service testified that the agency's 2013 vegetation  management guide specifies for field staffs the procedures and  practices that should be included in operation and maintenance plans  for power lines. This guide states that, where vegetation conditions  inside or outside the authorized right-of-way pose an imminent threat  to power line facilities, utility companies may remove those threats  immediately, without prior approval from the Forest Service.   For its part, BLM testified that, under the terms and conditions  typically included in a right-of-way grant, a utility company may  conduct minor trimming, pruning, and weed management to maintain the  right-of-way of a facility after simply notifying BLM. The utility  company can often obtain BLM approval for removal of hazardous trees  through a streamlined process. For an emergency situation causing an  imminent hazard, no BLM preapproval would be necessary.                                time  1530    I understand that some of the companies believe they should be able  to do whatever they want whenever they want, but the land does not  belong to them. It belongs to the American people, and Federal agencies  have a responsibility to all Americans to ensure that those lands are  not abused.   Again, facts do matter, and 0.03 percent of fires in public lands  were caused by trees falling on transmission lines in the last 5  years--0.03 percent. So we continue to exaggerate the common sense  behind the facts that I just laid out.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   My colleague from California (Mr. Costa) brought up one of the real  causes of wildfire, and that was climate change, the lack of  mitigation, and the situation within the Forest Service budget in which  half of the revenue dedicated to that department is used to suppress  wildfires.   This administration has denied the existence of climate change,  scrubbed it from its vocabulary, from its science, from its study. If  we are going to look at the causes of wildfires, if we are going to  look at strategies and how we protect the urban and forest interface,  if we are going to look at really addressing the subject, then the very  salient point that Mr. Costa brought up regarding climate change has to  be part and parcel of the discussion.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   You know, this legislation, with a few modifications, could help  prevent the 0.03 percent of wildfires that are caused by electricity  infrastructure, but the majority refused to work with us on those  modifications.   Most importantly, the failure to make vegetation management plans for  utility rights-of-way mandatory negates any positive impact this bill  might have had. As we have heard from Forest Service and industry at a  hearing on similar legislation last Congress, voluntary vegetation  management is already allowed and is quite common. This includes the  ability for rights-of-way holders to access these areas and conduct  vegetation management without notifying Federal land managers until  after the fact. This is current law.   The majority claims we need this bill to address delays caused by the  approval of unplanned work and delays  [[Page H5027]]  associated with removing dead trees on public lands outside of rights- of-way.   Without an up-front planning requirement, I can see authorizing  limited activity for utility companies to do targeted vegetation  management adjacent to rights-of-way. But instead of offering the  commonsense trade off, the bill before us today simply cuts Federal  agencies out of the process of managing the American people's land by  requiring the Forest Service and BLM to approve plans with no option to  modify or reject them if the plans are inadequate.   So whatever the company turns in--the utility company turns in, that  is the plan that will become the management plan for that vegetation,  regardless of any opinion by Forest Service or BLM.   Further, the bill does not define ``adjacent,'' meaning that  companies could cut trees that are well outside the rights-of-way on  public lands. This makes public lands vulnerable to a level of abuse  that no one who values them would be willing to support.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let me just say that this legislation is a solution without a  problem. And as I mentioned earlier several times, facts do matter.   When we are doing a whole-scale change of how we manage rights-of-way  on public lands because of 0.03 percent of the causation by utility  lines of fires on public lands, that is a heavyhanded way to approach  doing legislation. There have been opportunities and modifications,  opportunities of expediting the process, but those were not allowed as  part of this legislation.   If we, indeed, are going to look at both the wildfire situation, the  budget stress on Forest Service to suppress those fires, and this  rights-of-way issue, which is miniscule compared to the bigger issues,  then I think this legislation has to be rejected, and work on a piece  of legislation that has consensus, that is bipartisan, and that  addresses the real problems with wildfires in this country, not this  utility giveaway that we are doing here today.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
