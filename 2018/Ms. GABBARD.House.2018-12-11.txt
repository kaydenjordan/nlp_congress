 Mr. Speaker, today I am rising to recognize Special  Olympics Hawaii celebrating 50 years of service to our community. Since  its founding in 1968, Special Olympics has changed lives and served as  an indispensable source of strength and empowerment for so many people.   Across our State today, it is serving 4,700 participants with the  support of nearly 12,000 coaches and volunteers delivering 10 Olympic- type sports and more than 50 competitions throughout the year.   They have taken on issues like inactivity, injustice, intolerance,  and social isolation by encouraging and empowering people with  intellectual disabilities. They have had an impact on our entire  community and our State. They are combating negative stereotypes,  bringing joy and a sense of achievement and creating a culture of  respect and inclusion.   Mahalo to Special Olympics Hawaii and congratulations on reaching  this 50th anniversary year.                            ____________________
