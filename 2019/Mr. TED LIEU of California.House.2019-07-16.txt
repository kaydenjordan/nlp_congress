 Madam Speaker, I am an immigrant; I am a  person of faith; and I served on Active Duty in the United States  military because I love America.   Yet, throughout my life, I have had people tell me to go back to  China or Japan or North Korea. And like many immigrants, when I get  that ``go back'' insult, it is hateful. It makes me feel like I don't  belong here in this country.   And make no mistake, when people tell me to go back where I came  from, that is a racist insult that is based on race. If I were White,  they would not tell me to go back to China. I experience that insult  because my race happens to be Asian.   But the good news is that Americans, at record high levels, support  immigrants. We are not going anywhere. America is our home. And I will  still be standing here long after the occupant of the White House  leaves.                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
