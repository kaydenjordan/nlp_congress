 Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask my friends in the  majority to think about this from a different perspective: It is June,  and you all have defaulted on America. Millions of people have lost  their jobs. Our economy is in shambles.   Madam Speaker, you would look back and say to yourself: There were  things we could have done. We should not have left. We should not have  left D.C. We should not have left the Capitol.   There are solutions. There is a discharge petition behind me. Two  hundred thirteen Members have signed it. We just need five more, and we  have a vote.   There is a bipartisan solution from the Problem Solvers Caucus. We  could vote on it early next week. You could lock leadership in a room,  negotiate, and finish this thing.   It requires, however, folks to come back to work.   Gavel us back in, and protect millions and millions of people from  losing their jobs. Come back.                            ____________________
