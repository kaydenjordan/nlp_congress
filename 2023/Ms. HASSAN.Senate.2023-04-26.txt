 Madam President, today it is my esteemed pleasure to  honor MAJ Sara Miller for her outstanding military service and her  exemplary work in my office for the people of New Hampshire. Sara is  truly a servant leader who excelled in her year in my office and then  for a year and a half as an Army liaison with the Office of the Chief  Legislative Liaison. A dedicated mother, wife, and soldier, Sara is  leaving her current assignment and--with her husband Daniel, who is  also an Army major--heading to Fort Carson, CO, for their next duty  assignment. As a dual military family, the Millers know service and  sacrifice better than most.   MAJ Sara Miller was born in Lancaster, PA, and moved to Marietta, GA,  in 1997. A natural athlete, Sara was recruited out of high school where  she earned a scholarship to play soccer at Newberry College in  Newberry, SC. After graduating in 2010, her Army career began when she  was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army's Adjutant  General's Corps.   Over the past 13 years, Sara's primary responsibilities have been  ensuring that units under her purview met all personnel readiness  requirements to accomplish a variety of critical missions. Her duty  assignments included  [[Page S1379]]  Fort Bragg, NC, and Fort Carson, CO, before she began her time here in  Congress. Sara has served in a variety of Adjutant General's Corps  positions at the battalion, brigade, and division level. She also  served as commander for Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 4th  Psychological Operations Group (Airborne), at Fort Bragg.   During her deployments overseas, Sara has consistently shown courage,  dedication, and leadership. She served during four deployments to the  Middle East, including tours to Qatar in 2012, 2013, and 2015, where  she helped support Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Inherent  Resolve. Her last deployment was to Afghanistan in 2019 as part of the  4th Infantry Division Headquarters, where she was second in charge of  personnel for U.S.                            ____________________
