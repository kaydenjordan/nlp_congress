 Madam President, all of us in this body mourn the recent  passing of former Senator Paul Sarbanes. Those of us who served with  him have known him as one of the finest and most accomplished Senators  with whom we have served. And what a great pleasure it was to work with  him, on so many issues.   In addition to his impressive legislative accomplishments, Paul  Sarbanes was one of the Senate's keenest interrogators and one of the  Senate's finest orators. In the Senate community, most of all we knew  him for his wit, for his warmth and kindness, and for his decency.   I would like to call to the Senate's attention an insightful  remembrance of Senator Sarbanes by Paul Glastris that was published  this month by the Washington Monthly.   I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Monthly, Jan. 1, 2021]                         Remembering Paul Sarbanes    How wit, integrity and expertise made America's first Greek American            Senator a behind-the-scenes Washington power player.                             (By Paul Glastris)         There have been many fine tributes to former U.S. Senator       Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, who passed away December 6 at age       87. These encomiums invariably note the near universal high       regard he enjoyed in Washington for his intelligence,       integrity, humor, and accomplishments--the latter consisting       mostly of liberal legislation he managed, via his other       attributes, to get Republicans to support. They include,       while a young House member, the articles of impeachment       against Richard Nixon and, in the Senate, the Sarbanes-Oxley       Act of 2002, which toughened regulations and created       government oversight of corporate accounting practices after       the Enron debacle. He also served on the Senate Foreign       Affairs Committee for decades with Joe Biden and was a boss       and mentor to a number of the president-elect's senior       advisors, including Antony Blinken, his nominee for secretary       of state.        But I want to focus on another set of his deeds, ones       associated with his role as the leading Greek American in       Congress. They begin with what has come to be known as the       ``Sarbanes Rule.''        The rule dictates that ``any Greek American awards dinner       should conclude on the same day it begins.'' The Senator       devised this dictate after patiently sitting through       countless such dinners. They would go on interminably due to       the fact that the organizers, wanting to acknowledge as many       benefactors as possible, would bring to the podium a speaker       (usually a wealthy Greek-American businessman) whose job it       was to introduce another such speaker, who would then       introduce another speaker, who would finally present the       award to the person who would then speak, typically at some       length (these are Greeks we're talking about).        Since multiple honors were bestowed on any given evening,       the result was awards ceremonies that began with cocktails at       6 PM but wouldn't end until well after midnight. At which       point the priest would give the benediction, the color guard       would march the U.S. and Greek flags out of the ballroom, the       bouzouki band would come out, and everyone would dance for       several more hours. Having attended these events regularly in       DC from the 1990s until COVID-19, I can attest that after the       Senator introduced his rule about a decade ago, the       proceedings tightened considerably, with the dancing       commencing at a more civilized 10 PM.        It was at one of these dinners that I got to know Sarbanes       personally when my late wife Kukula found herself seated next       to him. She asked him what kind of cocktail he liked and went       to the bar to fetch it. The two of them spent the rest of the       evening animatedly chatting about foreign affairs--Kuku, a       journalist and the daughter of a diplomat, had strong and       informed views on the subject. Our hosts Manny and Marilyn       Rouvelas must have noticed, because the next year the place       cards showed that Kuku was again seated next to the Senator.       When she saw Sarbanes walk into the ballroom, she went to the       bar and, remembering his drink of choice (it was one of her       superpowers), had it waiting for him when he arrived at the       table. He was charmed and delighted; she felt the same about       him. For years thereafter the two of them were annual dinner       mates. There were far more powerful people in the room than       Kuku, but the fact that Sarbanes was content to spend the       evening talking with her told me everything I needed to know       about his character.        ``Unlike many of his contemporary officeholders, Mr.       Sarbanes was uncomfortable with the backslapping, glad-      handing and grandstanding that often go with public office,''       his Washington Post obituary reads. ``He avoided the social       and party circuit in the nation's capital and rarely spent a       night in Washington, preferring instead to drive home to his       wife and children in Baltimore.'' At these Greek dinners,       however, Sarbanes was in his element. While other politicians       would drop by (it was a target-rich donor environment), he       would stay for hours, chatting with the scores of people who       would come to the table to meet him, then eventually excusing       himself to work the room, table by table, shaking every hand.        The way he brought order to those dinners with his Sarbanes       rule is a small illustration of what made the Senator       effective and respected in Washington. Born to Greek       immigrant restaurant owners in 1933, Sarbanes earned       scholarships and degrees from Princeton, Oxford, and Harvard.       He had an intellectual gift for getting to the heart of       knotty problems and formulating wise solutions with a wit       that put his colleagues at ease. He deployed this genius       throughout his career, often in the service of selling       unpopular but vitally necessary policies like the return of       the Panama Canal. As former Democratic Senate leader Thomas       Daschle told the New York Times, when ``trying to persuade       the caucus to do something difficult, I would use Paul to       bring it home, to close the argument.''        In the Greek American community he is most remembered for       spearheading--along with another young Greek-American       congressman, John Brademus--a 1974 House effort to cut off       U.S. arms sales to Turkey after that country invaded and       occupied the independent majority-Greek-speaking nation of       Cyprus. The Nixon and Ford administrations fiercely opposed       the legislation because Turkey, a NATO ally, shared a       militarized border with the Soviet Union. But Sarbanes,       Brademus, and others in the newly-activated Greek American       community countered on not only moral but legal grounds: U.S.       statute, they correctly noted, specifically required the       administration to cut off arms sales to any country that used       such weapons offensively.        Several of the multiple House votes to pass the embargo and       then override a presidential veto succeeded by only a one-      vote margin, recalls Andy Manatos, then an aide to Senator       Tom Eagleton, who was successfully championing similar       embargo legislation in the Senate. ``It would never have       passed in the House without the esteem Paul and John       enjoyed,'' says Manatos, now the dean of Greek-American       lobbyists, adding that Sarbanes and Brademus were two of the       three Rhodes Scholars then serving in that body.        The Turkish arms embargo--the first time in modern U.S.       history that Congress successfully overturned the White House       on a major foreign policy issue--lasted three and a half       years before the Carter administration managed to get it       repealed. But it was replaced by an agreement in Washington       to sell arms to Greece and Turkey on a 7-to-10 basis in order       to achieve a military balance in the Aegean, an agreement       Sarbanes vigorously defended for years after.        Being seen as a fierce advocate for your own minority       ethnic constituency can be risky for any politician seeking       higher office. Sarbanes managed to pull it off in 1976 when       he became the first Greek American elected to the U.S. Senate       (he would be followed by Paul Tsongas and Olympia Snowe). He       was hardly a radical on the issue. ``I met today with a       number of Cypriot foreign ministers'' he would joke to       friends after rebuffing, say, a group of Greek diner owners       demanding he take stronger actions than the Cypriot       government itself wanted. But over the subsequent decades,       through constant study and engagement with experts on the       region, he built a reputation as the man to see on anything       regarding the Eastern Mediterranean--from Turkish air threats       to Greek territory in the Aegean to the besieged Greek       Orthodox patriarchate in Istanbul. Greek prime ministers       sought his counsel. So too did U.S. presidents, secretaries       of state, and senior diplomats. ``In that cerebral way of       his, he would analyze the whole situation and explain to       people what to do, who to talk to, what to be careful of,''       recalls Manatos. ``He was hands down far ahead of anyone else       in Congress in his thinking about these issues.''        People underestimate, especially in the age of Trump, the       degree to which knowledge can be power in Washington.       Sarbanes did not. He ``studied issues himself rather than       rely on staff talking points,'' recalls John Sitilides, who       worked with the Senator as a GOP staffer on the Senate       Banking Committee before starting the Western Policy Center,       a security think tank focused on the Eastern Mediterranean.       His mastery of substance gave Sarbanes ``the freedom to argue       and discern based on his own knowledge,'' says Sitilides,       which in turn earned him the confidence of Senators on both       sides of the aisle. That kind of power is typically witnessed       only by insiders, though public glimpses of it can sometimes       be caught. Nick Larigakis, executive director of the American       Hellenic Institute, notes that Sarbanes could be ``relied       upon to ask the tough and probing questions'' on issues       important to Greek Americans at confirmation hearings for US       ambassadors to the region--an effective way to keep Foggy       Bottom on its toes.        If Sarbanes' mind was legendary, so too was his rectitude.       He managed a 40-year career in politics--from his first       election to the Maryland House of Delegates in 1967 to his       retirement from the U.S. Senate in 2007--without a hint of       personal scandal. That's no small feat for someone who rose       through the often-corrupting culture of Maryland politics       (Spiro Agnew, another Greek American politician from       Maryland, was not so careful). Sarbanes enjoyed a 48-year       marriage to his wife Christine, who passed away in 2009.  [[Page S127]]       And he was famously averse to raising money, even for his own       campaigns. (His son John Sarbanes, who represents his       father's old congressional district, has carried on that       tradition by sponsoring the House's leading campaign finance       reform legislation.) Indeed, much of the Senator's career       success was due to his savvy longtime chief of staff Peter       Marudas, another Greek American who could not only go toe to       toe with Sarbanes on the issues but ably manage the more       transactional demands of his office.        Joe Biden has spoken optimistically--naively in the opinion       of many--about his ability as president to work productively       with Mitch McConnell and other Republicans on substantive       issues. To the degree he honestly believes that, it is       because he has done so in his own career, and watched others,       like Paul Sarbanes, do so as well.        After the Senator died, Biden tweeted: ``Paul Sarbanes and       I served together on the Foreign Relations Committee for 30       years. There was no one sharper, more committed, or with       firmer principles. And he, too, returned to his family nearly       every night. They meant the world to him. Rest In Peace,       Paul.''                            ____________________     Madam President, what our Nation witnessed and what  Members of Congress and the dedicated staff that work in the Capitol  witnessed on January 6 was a deadly attack on one of our most sacred  and historic constitutional duties: the count and final certification  of the results of our Presidential election. The violent insurrection  that occurred in the Capitol, which took the lives of five people,  including an officer of the U.S. Capitol Police, was an attack on our  democracy. The votes cast in the 2020 Presidential election were  counted and recounted. The results were challenged in the courts and  ultimately were certified in every single State. Yet, citing the  baseless chant that the election was ``stolen,'' an angry and violent  mob stormed the Capitol in an effort to suspend the democratic process,  overturn the will of the American people, and ensure that now-former  President Trump remained in office. These insurrectionists vandalized  the very heart of our government and threatened and harmed those sworn  to protect it.   In a column in the VTDigger, Haviland Smith, a Vermonter and the  first chief of counterterrorism operations for the Central Intelligence  Agency, makes the strong case that the insurrection on January 6 was an  act of domestic terrorism. I am certain that the FBI and the Department  of Justice will continue to investigate and, where appropriate, to file  charges and hold these people to account. But in this Chamber, we must  heed Mr. Smith's wisdom. As legislative body, as public servants, we  must reckon with the lies and anti-democratic discourse that fueled  this attack and work to ensure that such an act of domestic terror  never occurs again.   I ask unanimous consent that the piece written by Haviland Smith,  titled ``Domestic Terrorism in the Capitol,'' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     [From the VTDigger, Jan. 8, 2021]                     Domestic Terrorism in the Capitol                            (By Haviland Smith)         It is a fact that the best, noblest political movements       often attract the worst kind of violent participants. These       people barge in and commit the kinds of violent acts that       ultimately change the focus of a previously benign movement       to violent terrorist activities. These are viewed quite       differently and are generally punished more severely than       normal criminal activities.        That is what we are seeing today in the United States.       Whether you agree with their goals or not, the vast majority       of Trump supporters are non-violent Americans who seek basic       changes in American life. They plan to reach their goals by       supporting Trump. Right now, that means demonstrating       peacefully on his behalf and agreeing with and backing his       claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election which he       lost to Joe Biden.        The other part of this picture is the violent one. There is       unquestionably a smaller group or groups who, for whatever       reasons, see these peaceful demonstrations as an opportunity       to raise havoc, to partake in the only form of protest that       turns them on--violence.        What none of these folks seem to realize is that in the       commission of felonies (entering the U.S. Capitol forcefully,       etc.) in the pursuit of political goals (the illegal       participation in maintaining Trump in power) they qualify       nicely for classification as terrorists.        At one point during the invasion of the Capitol, it was       announced by the TV commentators that the invaders were       beginning to leave the area. Careful examination of the TV       footage at the time shows that the people leaving the area       were old, often female--a less fit, less bellicose group. In       fact, they were the Capitol invaders who had no intention of       getting involved in what clearly was becoming a potentially       violent situation. They simply were not up to it politically,       mentally or physically.        On the other hand, who stayed behind? Those who were       actively interested in becoming involved in violence. Did you       notice how many of them wore helmets? The only reason you       wear a helmet is to protect yourself from violent attacks on       your head and that is clearly what they were doing. They       anticipated participating in violence. In addition, the stay-      behinds were a major cut in age below those who were leaving.       They were the sort who could climb vertical walls, break       through windows and throw projectiles at the protecting       police force. The fact that 5 people died, over 80 were       arrested, and 50 police officers were injured bears eloquent       testimony to the fact that this was a terrorist invasion       encouraged by the sitting President of the United States, his       family members and Republican colleagues.        Ever since the results of the November election became       known, the President has created and maintained the fiction       that widespread fraud was involved in the Biden win. Whether       Trump knows that his major premise is all lies (which would       make him a calculating criminal) or doesn't know that his       positions are all lies (making him deranged) is almost       irrelevant. In either case, calculating or deranged, he is a       strangely questionable choice for leader of this country.        Terrorism is the use of fear (terror) and acts of violence       to intimidate societies, governments or ideologies. Domestic       terrorism is a form of terrorism in which victims within a       country are targeted by a perpetrator with the same       citizenship'' as the victims.        It is worth noting that in the middle of the January 6       invasion, the FBI became involved, presumably on the basis of       a logical conclusion that they were looking at an act of       domestic terrorism. The FBI's definition of domestic       terrorism is ``violent, criminal acts committed by       individuals and/or groups to further ideological goals       stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a       political, religious, social, racial or environmental       nature.''        It is clear that the invasion of the Capitol building       involved criminal activity. It is equally clear that if the       criminals are to be identified and tried for their crimes, as       has been clearly stated by all the government elements       involved, it will be the FBI that will lead the way. They       are, after all, the premier law enforcement organization in       the United States. As such, they are most likely to be the       only organization capable of resolving the many complicated       issues involved in this crime, most emphatically including       the issue of domestic terrorism, its initiators, motivators       and perpetrators.                            ____________________     Mr. President, amid the chaos of the last 4 years, it is  almost difficult to parse out the particular challenge that was 2020.  Faced with deadly pandemic wrought by COVID-19 and the ensuing economic  crisis, millions of Americans lost their jobs and found themselves in a  newfound state of uncertainty and instability. Hundreds of thousands of  Americans have died from the pandemic, and millions have been infected.  Meanwhile, families across the country have lost their homes and  businesses due to worsening hurricanes, floods, and wildfires brought  on by intensifying climate change. And there are socioeconomic  challenges, too, that linger and grow due to inequality, political  division, and racial injustice, all things that have defined the last  year.   George Will poignantly wrote on January 1 in the Washington Post  about the challenges we faced throughout the past year and will  continue to face moving forward. In his piece, Mr. Will highlights a  greater overarching challenge as well: that we, as humans, do not have  all encompassing control over our circumstances. There are greater  forces in play; yet our choices and decisions can dictate to some  degree the impact of those forces.   As we begin our work in the 117th Congress, I hope we can come  together to better equip our families, communities, and society to  respond to our current challenges and prepare our country to  effectively combat similar challenges in the future.   I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Will's column, ``2020 was a booster  shot against human hubris,'' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  [[Page S128]]                       [From the Washington Post, Jan. 1, 2021]                2020 Was a Booster Shot Against Human Hubris                              (By George Will)         The plague year 2020 was yet another brutal rejoinder to       the belief that brute forces can be pushed to the margins of,       and eventually out of, humanity's experience. When today's       pandemic recedes, what should linger is a quickened       appreciation of the fragility of life and social       arrangements. And an awareness that things much worse than       covid-19 have happened before, and will continue to happen.       The human story is not entirely about human choices.        The 1918-19 ``Spanish flu,'' which began in Kansas, killed       between 50 million and 100 million people worldwide, lowered       U.S. life expectancy by 12 years, and did not spare, as       covid-19 largely does, the young. The Black Death--the       bubonic plague--of 1346-1353 was much worse, killing 10       percent of the world's population, and more than one-third of       Europe's, including 40,000 of London's 70,000 residents.        In the 1980s, AIDS was so shocking because it refuted the       complacent belief that infectious disease epidemics had been       banished. In 2019, however, 1.7 million people were newly       infected with the AIDS virus, and 690,000 people who were       already infected died. But of the 38 million living with the       virus, 25.4 million were controlling it with antiviral drugs.        Astronomy lowered mankind's self-esteem (we are not the       center of the universe), then biology did (our species has an       undistinguished pedigree). Geology, too, has disturbed our       sense of mastery. Genesis enjoins us to ``subdue'' the Earth,       but this slowly cooling residue of the Big Bang gets a vote.       As its continents wander--half an inch to four inches a year,       according to plate tectonics--the planet's interior of       boiling gas and molten rock occasionally is heard from.        Volcanic eruptions at what is now Yellowstone National Park       some 630,000 years ago covered half of what is now the       continental United States with ash. When the Indonesian       volcano Krakatoa erupted in 1883, sea surges, which killed       most of the eruption's eventual 36,000 victims, were felt in       the English Channel. Krakatoa, was, however, only one-tenth       as powerful as the April 1815 eruption of Indonesia's Mount       Tambora, which killed 10,000 instantly--incandescent ash       flowed 100 miles per hour--and generated winds that uprooted       trees. Particulate matter blocking the sun's rays cooled the       Earth: Water froze in some American cisterns on July 4.       Today, a large majority of the one-eighth of the nation's       population that lives in California resides near the San       Andreas fault, and the question is not if but when it will       lurch catastrophically.        A U.S. satellite poised between Earth and the sun can       provide perhaps a 45-minute warning if the sun is going to       plunge the planet into darkness. On Sept. 2, 1859, before       there were light bulbs, a coronal mass ejection (CME) of 100       million tons of charged particles thrown off by the sun only       produced spectacular sunsets. If--actually, when--it happens       again, it can produce chaos in our thoroughly electrified,       digitized world by induced electric currents: no functioning       satellites, telephonic communications, water pumps, financial       transactions, hospitals. No Netflix. That got your attention.        On March 13, 1989, a CME solar storm turned out the lights       in the entire Canadian province of Quebec. Three days       earlier, a NASA astronomer says, scientists had noticed ``a       powerful explosion on the sun. Within minutes, tangled       magnetic forces on the sun had released a billion-ton cloud       of gas. It was like the energy of thousands of nuclear bombs       exploding at the same time. The storm cloud rushed out from       the sun, straight towards Earth, at 1 million miles an       hour.'' This geomagnetic storm struck the Earth the evening       of March 12, creating ``electrical currents in the ground       beneath much of North America,'' crashing Quebec's power       grid.        There are those who believe in a benevolent God because       Earth, as they see it, is ``biophilic,'' meaning friendly to       life. They must, however, reckon not only with non-biophilic       things (saber-toothed tigers, volcanoes, typhoons, viruses,       etc.), but also with the fact that this (meaning: everything)       is not going to end well. The universe will either continue       to expand, ending in life-extinguishing cold, or will       collapse into incinerating heat.        Meanwhile, here is some (sort of) good news, from the       Economist. In history's bloodiest century, the last one, 100       million to 200 million people died as a result of war.       Measles killed in the same range, influenza near the top of       the range. Smallpox, however, killed 300 million to 500       million.        The eradication of smallpox, by globally coordinated       vaccination campaigns, ``stands as one of the all-time-great       humanitarian triumphs.''        Human choices cannot subdue all the brute forces that       always lurk. Choices can, however, make a difference. And       they can dignify us, a thinking, coping species.                            ____________________
