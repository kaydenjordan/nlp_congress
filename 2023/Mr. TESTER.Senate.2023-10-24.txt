 Mr. President, today I would like to honor the  life and service of a distinguished Montanan and Vietnam veteran,  Lieutenant Colonel Robert Whaley.   Bob is a native son of the Treasure State and graduated from Missoula  County High in 1954. He had a successful college football career at  Carroll College, where he also served as president of the student body  council. After graduating from Carroll, Bob answered the call to serve  and enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps for Aviation Office Candidate  School. He shortly commissioned as a second lieutenant and spent the  next 18 months at Pensacola flight school training in Florida, flying  both fixed-wing aircrafts and helicopters.   In April 1962, Bob was a member of the first Marine aircraft unit to  serve in South Vietnam. Soon after arriving in Vietnam, he also  participated in the Vietnam war's first night medevac mission.  Throughout his first two tours of Vietnam, Bob flew medevac  helicopters, where he rescued wounded American troops. While flying a  Huey gunship to support transport helicopters in 1965, Bob's aircraft  was shot down. He and the rest of his crew miraculously survived the  crash, but they sustained serious injuries and were evacuated stateside  to recover. After recovering, he began training replacement pilots at  Camp Pendleton and eventually returned to Vietnam in 1968, 3 weeks  after marrying his wife, LaWana. There, he got back in the Huey and  flew hundreds of recon and rescue missions. When Bob finally returned  to the U.S. from Vietnam for the last time in 1969, he had logged more  than 800 missions and earned 40 Air Medals, two Distinguished Flying  Crosses, a Bronze Star, and a Purple Heart. He continued his service in  the Marine Corps for another decade and eventually retired in 1979 as a  lieutenant colonel and the executive officer of Marine Air Group 39 at  Camp Pendleton.   After retiring, Bob returned to his native Missoula and began working  as a financial adviser. Eventually, he retired for good so he and  LaWana could enjoy the mountains outside of Missoula. Sadly, LaWana  passed last December, after 54 years of marriage.   Today, it is my honor to commemorate Bob's incredible service to our  country. On behalf of myself and a grateful nation, I commend  Lieutenant Colonel Whaley, and extend our deepest appreciation to him  and his family. His exemplary service in the Marines is what makes our  country the greatest in the world and Montana the Last Best Place. He  is a true patriot who has made Montana proud, and we owe him a deep  debt of gratitude.                            ____________________
