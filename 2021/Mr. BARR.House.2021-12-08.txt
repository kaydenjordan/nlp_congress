 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of an issue that is  obviously very personal to me, my legislation, the Cardiovascular  Advances in Research and Opportunities Legacy Act, or the CAROL Act.   I am just overwhelmed and so grateful to my friends and colleagues on  both sides of the aisle. I thank them for their kindness, their kind  words about Carol, and their advocacy for this very important  legislation.   I do ask for the indulgence of the House and my colleagues to speak  about a topic that is very personal. I have become, unfortunately, very  passionate about it.   My life and my girls' lives were changed forever when we lost Carol,  who was my best friend, and that was a sudden cardiac event on June 16,  2020. She was only 39 years old. This was just a few weeks before her  40th birthday.   The end of her life didn't define her life. When people hear about  the CAROL Act, I want them to know not just about the legislation. I  want them to know about Carol, the woman who inspires it, because so  much of her life really continues to make a positive impact on all of  us.   First of all, Carol was obviously a beautiful person, but her beauty  on the outside was not as much as it was on the inside, as beautiful as  she was as a person.                                time  1615    She was an amazing friend and daughter and wife. She was so  supportive. Everybody who serves in this body knows it takes so much  support from a spouse, and I witnessed that every day both in this job  and out of this job and in the 12 years that we were married.   She was a supporter. She was a selfless giver. And she was a giver  not just to me and my girls, she was a selfless person with everyone,  with her friends, with her family. She was always going out of her way  to do for others and put others ahead of herself.   Professionally she was incredibly accomplished. She worked in the  pharmaceutical industry. She was a planner, a list maker, a detailed  organizer, which was great for me because I wasn't any of those things.  She complemented me. She kept me going. She kept me on time and  organized. I was not a list maker, and she was. She was a go-getter.   As my friend, Whip Scalise, said, she had this great saying, and she  said it to me the weekend before she passed away: ``Just get it done.''   But of course, her greatest legacy was her motherhood. She was  defined by her motherhood of our girls, Eleanor and Mary Clay. She was  the best mother in the world. Now, she only had 9 and 7 years, but she  packed it in, and she left a great mark on those kids, and they are her  greatest legacy. I am so proud of our girls. And my youngest, Mary  Clay, always says: ``Daddy, when  [[Page H7521]]  you give those speeches, why don't you talk about me? And, Mary Clay, I  am talking about you, and I am talking about your sister, Eleanor,  right now because you are your mother. You shine through, and your  mother will continue to shine through you all.   So what is Carol's story?   At a young age, in seventh grade, she was diagnosed with an  underlying condition called mitral valve prolapse or floppy valve  syndrome. This is a typically benign condition that results in sudden  cardiac death in only 0.2 percent of the cases.   The odds were decidedly in her favor, and she knew that, and she  talked about that, and her physicians talked about that. They said it  was no big deal. She said it was no big deal. I said it was no big deal  because everybody thought it was no big deal. We just had to monitor  it, and we did.   And Carol sadly was one of those unlucky people in that 0.2 percent  category. She did have a near fainting episode, and she got a Holter  monitor, and in early 2020 she sought help from a cardiologist, and in  the medical notes the cardiologist said, yes, we need to further  investigate this. Not urgent, but we need to investigate this. We need  to get an echo stress test after the virus resolves.   And there was no incident. There was no chest discomfort after that.  There was nothing between March and, sadly, June 16 when I came home  that night.   So what factors placed Carol in the 0.2 percent versus the 99.8  percent category?   That is what we don't know. That is what we need to know for other  families.   So in my discussions with top cardiologists, medical experts,  researchers, and advocates following Carol's passing, I learned the  extent to which the medical community seriously lacks answers to this  critical question.   And sadly, over 25,000 Americans die each year from heart valve  disease primarily due to underdiagnosis and undertreatment of the  condition.   So inspired by the extraordinary life of my wife and also many  experts, the cardiologists who contributed to this work with the help  of experts at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, we  introduced the CAROL Act to better equip our medical community with the  resources needed to develop predictive models, inform communities, and  save the lives of other loved ones.   So specifically, the CAROL Act authorizes a grant program  administered by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to  support research on MVP.   This legislation marshals the full power of 21st century medical  innovation and encourages the utilization of technological imaging and  precision medicine to generate data on individuals with valvular heart  disease.   It is through this research that we can help identify Americans at  high risk of sudden cardiac death from valvular heart disease and  develop prediction models for high-risk patients, enabling  interventions and treatment plans to keep these patients healthy  throughout their lives.   Additionally, the CAROL Act will instruct the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention to increase public awareness regarding symptoms  of valvular heart disease and effective strategies for preventing  sudden cardiac death.   Madam Speaker, I am honored and so grateful that this bill, the CAROL  Act, has earned the bipartisan support of over 180 Members of this body  and all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have been  critical to bringing this legislation to this point. The speakers here  today, I am so humbled and grateful to them. To my good friend,  Congressman Guthrie, who was a dear friend of my wife, to Minority  Leader Kevin McCarthy and Whip Scalise, both of whom knew and counted  Carol as one of their friends, my good friends, Kathleen Rice and    Jimmy Panetta on the other side, who have been just awesome to work  with on this. Chairman Pallone, I really appreciate your leadership and  Leader Hoyer, as well; my good friends Brad Wenstrup and Bill Huizenga,  who have been really helpful to me in this difficult time. And I am  also grateful for my friend and fellow Kentuckian, Senate Republican  Leader Mitch McConnell, who is leading the companion bill in the  Senate, and Arizona Senator Kyrsten Sinema, who I served with in my  class here; sadly, Kyrsten lost a sister to a similar condition, and  they are leading the companion legislation in the Senate.   And, finally, I acknowledge and thank the over 20 medical groups who  supported our bill, including the American Heart Association, the  American College of Cardiologists, and WomenHeart, and the scores of  doctors that we consulted who really were instrumental in helping us,  and I will just say a few: Dr. Mary Sheppard, Dr. Alan Daugherty, and  Dr. Nezar Falluji in the district that I represent at the University of  Kentucky; also Dr. Gary Gibbons and his team at the National Heart,  Lung, and Blood Institute; Dr. Francesca Delling at the University of  California, San Francisco; and Dr. Bonow at Northwestern. They were all  instrumental in crafting this legislation.    Madam Speaker, in conclusion, Carol Barr's greatest legacy will  always be our two daughters, and she wouldn't have wanted this. She  doesn't want this as her legacy. She wanted to raise our kids. But I  will tell you this, even though the doctors said that her heart gave  out, you know, because of her life and her legacy and this bill, she is  going to be remembered as having the most powerful heart of all, of  anyone we have ever met. I hope my colleagues in the House will help me  move one step closer to enshrining that legacy in a way that will help  others avert this tragedy that has so profoundly affected my family.   And, honey, we are getting it done.
