 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the story of Marco,  a DREAMer in Portland, Oregon, and to continue to urge Speaker Ryan to  put forth a clean Dream Act bill.   In 1995, Marco was brought to the United States when he was only 3  years old. As a teenager with dreams of going to college, Marco  realized he didn't qualify for financial aid because of his immigration  status, but he did not allow this to deter him. Instead, Marco worked  hard in various minimum wage jobs, allowing him the ability to attend  college part-time.   In 2012, after applying for DACA, Marco was granted a work permit,  making it possible for him to earn a job with a law firm in Portland,  where he worked his way up from the mailroom to be a legal assistant.  His salary from the law firm enabled him to enroll in more classes and  finally complete his bachelor's degree in accounting.   Marco now works as an accountant for an Oregon nonprofit that helps  benefit youth.   This President claims to want only the best. I have news for him: we  already have the best and brightest, and it is time we stopped treating  them like second class citizens.   Mr. Speaker, we need to pass a clean Dream Act bill.                            ____________________
