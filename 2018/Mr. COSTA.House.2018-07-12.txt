 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call upon my colleagues to  join me in addressing our Nation's rising debt. As of this week, our  national debt is  [[Page H6120]]  over $21 trillion, with a T. When we allocate that to each man, woman,  and child, it is $64,600--Mr. Speaker, $64,600 for every man, woman,  and child.   We are this far in debt because of irresponsible governing and a lack  of political courage, regardless of which party has been in control in  recent years.   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released its long-term  budget outlook last month. It showed that the Federal debt held by the  public will approach 100 percent of our gross domestic product within  the next 10 years if we keep heading down this path.   Sadly, this Congress has chosen to continue this irresponsible,  unsustainable fiscal course. It is irresponsible.   The tax cut legislation that our Republican colleagues rammed through  Congress last December is projected to add over $1.45 billion to the  deficit over the next 10 years and $2.2 trillion to our national debt.  Some estimate that it will even be more. This is unsustainable.   That is an additional $2.2 trillion that our children will have to  pay unless we do something different. We cannot ask future generations  to carry the weight of our shortsighted decisions and political  cowardice. Not only is it unfair, but it is just plain wrong.   Yes, reining in our spending will be hard. It is always hard and  difficult to make choices. We will get attacked by other political  organizations and interest groups who dislike or disagree with our  choices, but that is why we are here.   This happened in 2012, when the House had the opportunity to address  the rising debt and deficit and supported a budget resolution by my  colleague and good friend Congressman  Jim Cooper from Tennessee. The  resolution was similar to the recommendations made by the bipartisan  Simpson-Bowles Commission, and it would have reduced our debt by over  $4 trillion over 10 years. It would just start to bend the curve. I  stood with Congressman Cooper and 36 other House Members who supported  the resolution, and a lot of groups attacked us.   President Kennedy, many years ago, wrote a book called ``Profiles in  Courage,'' in which he wrote of individual Members of Congress who made  politically tough choices. Unfortunately, there are not a lot of those  political profiles in courage in Congress these days, sadly.   We were sent here to serve the American people, even when faced with  difficult choices. We are not sent here to do the easy thing. We are  sent here to try to do the right thing and to come together in a  bipartisan fashion. That is the only way you are going to get these  things done.   We must find the political courage to make the tough choices and  create smart and fiscally responsible policies that will have real and  lasting effects in reducing our national debt. This will require,  again, that Democrats and Republicans work together, which is, in  itself, sadly, too often in rare supply these days.   But if we don't put our partisan bickering and electoral fears aside  long enough to do what is right for America, then when will we?   If we don't make decisions now to get the Nation's fiscal House in  order, the programs on which Americans rely--important programs that  most of us support like Social Security, like Medicare--will be  impacted.   Mr. Speaker, on this day in 1974, the Congressional Budget and  Impoundment Control Act became law. Forty-four years ago, the 93rd  Congress came together to pass this law to strengthen our budget  authority and to increase the capacity to make informed and independent  decisions regarding America's budget to, in essence, put our fiscal  house in order.   I stand here today, 44 years later, calling on the 115th Congress to  use that information and capacity that we now have to make these  difficult choices and have the political courage to put our Nation's  fiscal house back on a responsible path. It is what our country needs;  it is part of America's future; and, my fellow Americans, it is the  right thing to do.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this  time, and I rise to support this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I remember very clearly when President Clinton asked  Vice President Gore to conduct an effort to reorganize government at  the Federal level, to make it more efficient, to look for ways in which  we could cut down on bureaucratic red tape and to try to find other  efficiencies that exist. This was but one of many recommendations that  Vice President Gore and his group came up with.   Mr. Speaker, the success of the Bureau of Reclamation to convert  portions of the arid West into the largest and most advanced  agricultural economy in the world cannot be overstated.   Nowhere is that more evident than in California's San Joaquin Valley,  the most productive agriculture region in the world. We grow 60 percent  of the Nation's fruits and vegetables, healthy diet, good nutritional  food for America's dinner table, besides leading in so many other  commodities that we grow.   As a matter of fact, it helps the balance of payments. California's  agricultural economy, 44 percent of it, is part of our international  trade.   It would not be possible, though, without the complex and well- planned set of dams, canals, and other structures that have operated  successfully for generations--generations.   However, over time, the aging infrastructure needs to be repaired. It  needs to be updated. Many of the reclamation projects, when they were  originally authorized by Congress and the funds were appropriated, were  intended to be turned over to local districts to operate once the  projects were repaid, and that is an important caveat. Clearly, there  was a requirement in the authorization that these projects be repaid,  and many of these projects around the country are in various states of  being repaid.                                time  1530    After the project's operation and maintenance responsibilities have  been fully transferred, the actual ownership would then be transferred  as well.   The transfer of title to local operators, I think, has numerous  benefits to water users and to the taxpayers. It can reduce paperwork,  staff time--both at the Federal and local levels--reduce Federal  backlog of infrastructure repair projects, and help improve the  environment for public safety because, yes, the environmental laws  would still be in place.   I can tell you, in California, our environmental laws are stronger  than at the Federal level, so I don't believe that is truly an issue.   And, frankly, we know what the status of our debt in this country is,  and we know that so many of our departments and agencies--and in the  case of Federal reclamation projects, there is not sufficient funding  to do the repair and maintenance that is necessary. It is just very  simple: The money is not there, and yet these aging projects are  continuing to try to operate as best they can.   A transfer can also provide more flexibility to finance local  upgrades and repairs because it provides an asset to be used as  collateral.   When we passed the settlement agreement from the Friant water users,  as an example, with the NRDC, part of the caveat was that Friant water  users would be able to repair the Friant-Kern Canal.   Keeping water facilities in good condition, particularly those that  recharge groundwater, is critical not only to the San Joaquin Valley  that I represent that grows this abundant and incredible cornucopia of  food that is on America's dinner table every night, but today there are  large sections of the Friant-Kern Canal that stretch from the Friant  Dam all the way down to Bakersfield that have less than 60 percent of  their capacity to move water through.   So last year, when we had an abundance of water, almost 200 percent  above average, that water could have been used to recharge the  groundwater in parts of Tulare and Kern Counties. But because we  couldn't move the water through that portion that has subsided, that  has cracked, and that is badly in need of repair, we were not able to  move the water that the facility initially had capacity to move.   That is one example. There are any other examples.   Importantly, a title transfer does not ultimately change the way  facilities are operated; it just doesn't.   Since 1995, the Bureau of Reclamation, working with interested  stakeholders, has worked to improve the title transfer process. But I  believe it is very important to note that, however, specific  congressional authorization--which this legislation attempts to provide  some authorization--is still needed to transfer the title of any  facility, no matter how small, unless a separate administrative process  is established by law to allow the transfer of such ownership. That is  what this legislation attempts to do.   This legislation, therefore, creates an administrative process while  maintaining the ability of Congress to have the final word, and that is  to disapprove of any proposed transfer by passing a resolution of  disapproval.   So if the Secretary, in fact, worked such an agreement, moves forward  with a transfer of the title, and Congress says, ``No, we want to  determine these on a case-by-case basis,'' this legislation will allow  that to happen. It gives Congress the final word.   And a NEPA-like process must be a part of that administrative effort  to, in fact, successfully transfer the title. So it has got to be  repaid; you have to have a NEPA-like process; and--guess what--Congress  has the final word.   This legislation would significantly streamline the title transfer  process, divest the Federal Government of unnecessary liability, and  allow these projects to run, I think, more effectively and with better  outcomes when local water districts that are publicly owned, that have  their own elected boards, have their own fiduciary responsibility to  provide water to the area they serve, to make good, cost-effective  decisions on behalf of the water interests that they serve, whether  they be farmers or whether they be communities. And it is all of the  above.   So this legislation is supported by many organizations, it is  bipartisan, and I thank the author of the legislation for helping  facilitate legislation that will allow reclamation to improve a title  transfer process, which is not a new idea. It goes back to the Clinton  administration.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I support this legislation, I urge my  colleagues to do the same, and I thank the gentleman for yielding me  time.
