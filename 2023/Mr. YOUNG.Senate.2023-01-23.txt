 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. Scott  Robison, who is retiring after more than 40 years educating Hoosier  children.   Dr. Robison hails from New Albany, IN, and earned his bachelor's  degree in education from Indiana University in 1980. His career began  as an elementary teacher in New Albany-Floyd County schools, as well as  MSD Pike Township in Indianapolis. He then served as a principal in  Southwest Allen Schools in Fort Wayne and as the founding principal of  Pike Township's New Augusta K-8 Academy. He later became assistant  school superintendent in Westfield Washington Schools before becoming  superintendent of Marion-Adams Schools in Sheridan. In 2006, he was  named superintendent of Zionsville Community Schools. After 16 years in  the district, he is retiring this month.   Dr. Robison is an innovative leader. In the 1990s, he pioneered  practices such as in-district school choice, alternative school  calendars, multi-age classrooms, and parent/community partnerships that  are now well-established practices in schools across the State. He is  known as a tremendous recruiter and developer of educators, many of  whom have benefited directly from his wisdom and inspirational  leadership.   Throughout his tenure, Dr. Robison has never lost his own love of  learning. He earned an M.S. from Indiana University in 1986 and a Ph.D.  from Purdue University in 2003. He has also served on countless boards,  commissions, and committees throughout the years and even refereed high  school and college basketball games for 20 years. It is my honor to  thank Dr. Robison for his tireless devotion to the children of Indiana,  and all Hoosiers join me in wishing him a restful retirement.                            ____________________
