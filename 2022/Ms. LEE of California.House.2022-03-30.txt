 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  incredible contributions of one of my constituents, Matt Kreutz. He is  the CEO of Firebrand Artisan Breads, which is a fixture in our East Bay  community.   Earlier this month, I had the pleasure of Matt virtually joining me  at President Biden's State of the Union address. Matt founded Firebrand  in 2007 as a socially conscious organization focused on making  opportunities available for the unhoused, formerly incarcerated people,  and others who may be experiencing difficulties getting hired. In  recent years, he expanded Firebrand into a business that employs 85  people at its cafe in uptown Oakland and at its production facility in  Alameda. Firebrand has become a beating heart in my community.   As the pandemic raged on, Matt managed to keep Firebrand open by  securing a loan from the Paycheck Protection Program, which was made  possible by the American Rescue Plan. Since receiving the PPP  loan, Firebrand continued expanding operations and growing into a major  source of employment for many.  [[Page H4003]]    Madam Speaker, on behalf of the 13th Congressional District of  California, we thank Matt for sharing his story and for enriching our  community.                            ____________________
