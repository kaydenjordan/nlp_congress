 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand  a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, the American people sent a clear  message that they want action to lower the cost and improve the quality  of healthcare. I am pleased that, over the past month, this House has  done exactly that.   It is a stark contrast to the 8 years under the previous majority  with one attempt after another to repeal the Affordable Care Act and  deny coverage to Americans with preexisting conditions.   Last week, we passed legislation to help address the rising cost of  prescription drugs by increasing the availability of generic drugs.   This bill also curbs the Trump administration's expansion of junk  insurance plans and funds programs to help more Americans enroll in  coverage.   Earlier, we voted to reverse the Trump administration's dangerous  effort to allow States to waive lifesaving protections for people with  preexisting conditions.   I urge the Senate to take up these bills that will have immediate,  positive effects on our Nation's healthcare, and I look forward to  working with my colleagues to make even more, further progress.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the SECURE  Act.   A secure and dignified retirement is a critical part of the American  Dream, but for too many seniors, this aspiration is falling  increasingly out of reach.   I am pleased that this House is taking action today in response. Our  bill will help more Americans save for retirement by allowing workers  to participate in 401(k) plans.   Additionally, the legislation makes it easier for small businesses to  offer retirement plans to their employees and help small businesses set  up automatic enrollment programs. It replaces antiquated barriers  slowing the adoption of multiemployer plans and improves the quality of  service providers.   The AARP estimates that these changes will lead to more than 700,000  new retirement accounts.   Finally, as we approach Memorial Day and reflect on the ultimate  sacrifice made by fallen servicemembers and their families, I am  pleased this legislation fixes a provision in the 2017 Republican tax  law that increased taxes on survivor benefits paid by families. Our  Gold Star families already deal with the unimaginable loss of a loved  one; they should not also be facing a tax increase.   Madam Speaker, I am so proud this legislation was a bipartisan effort  in the Ways and Means Committee, and I urge my colleagues to support  this important bill to improve retirement security.
