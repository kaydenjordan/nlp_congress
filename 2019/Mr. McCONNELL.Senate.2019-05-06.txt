 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, over the weekend we were given yet  another tragic reminder of the daily  [[Page S2626]]  threats that face our friends and allies in Israel.   While American families enjoyed a spring weekend, those who make  their home in the border regions of the Jewish State were subjected to  a barrage of hundreds of rockets and other projectiles launched from  within Gaza.   The attacks were carried out by Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic  Jihad. They targeted civilian populations. They killed a worker at a  cement factory, a truckdriver in a border village, a man in the yard of  his own home, and a rabbi as he left his car to run for cover.   They caused countless Israeli citizens to scurry to bunkers for  safety, unsure whether rockets would rain upon their farms, apartment  buildings, schools, or hospitals. These attacks, we should remember,  are targeted at Israel's innocent civilians. They are intended to kill,  to maim, and to terrorize.   In the face of such brazen acts of terror, it is of course Israel's  right to take swift and decisive action to defend its people. Frankly,  it is an existential necessity.   And it is the responsibility of every peaceful nation to condemn the  terrorist organizations behind them and to continue to expose those  governments and private entities that provide illicit support for their  actions. Foremost among them is Iran, which has become a critical  lifeline for the terrorist activities of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic  Jihad.   I know my colleagues will join me in expressing sympathy for the  families of the victims and for the communities left to rebuild the  wreckage of these latest attacks. Furthermore, I hope this weekend's  attacks could at least spur some action here in Congress, where Senate- passed legislation to renew and strengthen our partnership with Israel  is still sitting over in the House, where it has not been permitted a  vote. That thoroughly bipartisan legislation contains several  provisions to strengthen our security ties to Israel and also to combat  the scourge of anti-Semitism.   Behind these attacks lurks the same hatred that motivated the  violence at Chabad of Poway last month and the Tree of Life synagogue  last year--the same ugly bigotry that takes refuge within the BDS  movement while masquerading as a legitimate political stance. It is the  same tide of discrimination that an overwhelming majority of European  Jews report is on the rise in their own communities, even as the  Holocaust remains a vivid living memory. This disturbing trend has  already taken its toll on communities of faith and on peaceful Jews in  Israel and around the world, but when America does any less than our  level best to confront it, we further undermine the cause of our  friends and allies in this free Jewish State.   I hope this terrible violence can again spur my colleagues in the  House to act on the bipartisan legislation that has been languishing  over there for weeks. It was the first item we took up this year.   Clearly, the need to reaffirm our commitment to the safety, security,  and sovereignty of Israel is just as important as it ever was.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee be discharged from  further consideration of S. Res. 162 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 190, submitted earlier today.    I know of no further debate on the measure.    I ask unanimous consent that the preamble be agreed to  and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 191, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I understand there are two bills at the  desk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.    I now ask for a second reading, and I object to my own  request, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  May 7; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour  be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  morning business be closed, and the Senate proceed to executive session  and resume consideration of the Bianco nomination; further, that the  Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly  conference meetings; finally, that all time during recess, adjournment,  morning business, and leader remarks count postcloture on the Bianco  nomination.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:53 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, May 7, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
