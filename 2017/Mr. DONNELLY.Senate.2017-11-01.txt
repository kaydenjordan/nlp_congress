 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize College Wood  Elementary School of Carmel, IN, for being named a 2017 National Blue  Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education.   Established in 1982, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program  recognizes schools that have demonstrated a vision of educational  excellence for all students, regardless of their social or economic  background. Since its inception, this program has allowed schools in  every State to gain recognition for educational accomplishments,  particularly in closing the achievement gaps among students.   College Wood's mission is to provide opportunities for all students  to realize their potential. College Wood students have consistently  ranked among the top 10 percent in annual standardized testing. By  encouraging every student to strive for excellence, explore  opportunities, and realize their full potential, College Wood students  are equipped to succeed and graduate.   College Wood strives to provide a quality, well-rounded education and  teach students the traits of successful leaders and communicators. To  that end, the school includes social and emotional learning in its  curriculum. Social Thinking and Superflex lessons instill social  awareness, emotional management skills, and perspective-enhancing  experiences.   The school also seeks to help teach students about the importance of  service and helping others. Through several philanthropic endeavors,  College Wood students, parents, and staff work closely together to give  back to the community. Several donation drives throughout the year lead  up to the school's biggest annual event to benefit the Leukemia and  Lymphoma Society.   I am proud to recognize College Wood Elementary School principal  Kathryn Olssen, the entire staff, the student body, and their families.  The effort, dedication, and value you put into education has led not  only to this prestigious recognition, but will benefit you and the  Carmel community well into the future.   On behalf of the citizens of Indiana, I congratulate College Wood  Elementary School, and I wish the students and staff continued success  in the future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize White Lick  Elementary School of Brownsburg, IN, for being named a 2017 National  Blue Ribbon School by the U.S. Department of Education.

Since its inception, this program has allowed schools in  every State to gain recognition for educational accomplishments,  particularly in closing the achievement gaps among students.   White Lick Elementary School currently serves over 600 students and  offers a variety of education and extracurricular opportunities for its  students.

The school also prides itself on the professional development of its  staff. Teachers are given the chance to learn and grow through weekly  meetings with their professional learning communities. In these  meetings, teachers come together to analyze test scores and other data  as they discuss how to better meet the needs of their students.   The school's investment in students is reflected in the diverse  opportunities it offers. Whether it is through the ``Step-a-thon,''  where students participate in a physical challenge to help raise funds  for various school programs or the numerous afterschool clubs, White  Lick has excelled in offering resources and programs beyond the  classroom.
