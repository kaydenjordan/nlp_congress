 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the 77 Kentuckians  who lost their lives to the horrific tornadoes that devastated our  Commonwealth this December. May we continue to lift up all of those who  were affected by these storms and support the rebuilding of homes,  businesses, and livelihoods.   We lost 17 Kentuckians in my district, all in my home county of  Warren County. We must ensure their memories are never forgotten, and I  ask that Americans keep these families and these names in their  prayers: Alisa Besic, Alma Besic, Elma Besic, Samantha Besic, Selmir  Besic, Nariah Brown, Nolynn Brown, Nyles Brown, Nyssa Brown, Rachel  Brown, Steven Brown, Terry Jayne, Say Meh, Cory Scott, Victoria Smith,  Mae White, and Robert Williams, Jr.   May they rest in peace.                            ____________________
