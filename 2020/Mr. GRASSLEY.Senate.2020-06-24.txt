 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for  30 seconds in morning business.    Madam President, the Senate will soon cross the  milestone of 200 judicial confirmations since President Trump came to  the Presidency in 2017. These have been nominees in the molds of  Justice Scalia, just as the President promised nearly 4 years ago. They  will strictly interpret the Constitution and Federal statutes. Their  decisions will be driven by what the law actually says, not their own  personal policy preferences.   This landmark achievement is the result of the President keeping his  word and the unwavering determination of Leader McConnell, Chairman  Graham, and the Republican conference.   In the hands of these many strict constructionist judges, the future  of American jurisprudence is very, very bright.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle voted to block consideration of the JUSTICE bill. This  happened to be the first major piece of police reform legislation in  years.   To be clear, this vote wasn't a vote to pass the bill in the Senate.  It wasn't even a vote to limit debate on police reform. It was a vote  on whether we could simply begin debate on police reform.   We are standing now on the floor of what is called the world's  greatest deliberative body, the U.S. Senate. Yet my colleagues on the  other side wouldn't even entertain a debate on an issue that has  stirred our Nation and shaken it to its core.   We know why we are here. There was a murder of a citizen in  Minneapolis--George Floyd. There have been peaceful demonstrations all  over the country since then, and Congress's time to respond probably-- probably should have responded years ago, but this has brought to a  head that we need police reform.   Yes, we are in the world's greatest deliberative body, we are told.  The Senate's legacy and prestige are built on our ability to debate and  discuss legislation, to address the most pressing issues before our  country. My colleagues on the other side have robbed the American  people of the opportunity to pass meaningful police reform.   On the other side, they argue that the JUSTICE Act doesn't go far  enough and that their version of police reform is the only bill worth  considering. All the brains in the U.S. Senate are on the other side of  the aisle, is more or less what they are saying. I want to remind them  that we live in a country with diverse ideas and varying opinions.  Debating those differences is the only way to make meaningful reform.   Democrats complain that their views weren't represented in this bill.  Well, the JUSTICE Act contains a number of proposals that actually have  bipartisan support. Even if that wasn't enough for them, every Democrat  would still have an opportunity to make additional changes.   On our side, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina led this effort for  all of us. Forty-six of us are joining him. I hope the other seven will  join in as well. But that is just Republicans, and this is a bipartisan  bill--presumably not bipartisan enough to satisfy the other side but  still bipartisan--and they wouldn't let us move ahead.   Senator Scott made clear when the bill was introduced last week that  he was interested and willing to discuss changes. Leader McConnell  pledged an open amendment process. Even Speaker Pelosi noted that she  welcomed the opportunity to conference the Democratic House police  reform bill with Senator Scott's JUSTICE Act.   Instead of letting our time-honored legislative process work, my  colleagues sent a letter calling the JUSTICE Act ``unsalvageable.''  Let's remember--these are the same Senators who insisted that the  Senate consider a police reform bill before the July recess, which  starts next week. Now that they are getting what they asked for, they  say they don't want it anymore--at least that is what their vote tells  me today.   My question is, What are they afraid of? Are they afraid of losing  control of  [[Page S3196]]  the process if it goes to a vote? Well, then, they are afraid of  democracy. They are afraid of the American people who elected each  Senator in this body and trusts each Senator to represent them by  voting on legislation.   Are they afraid that their ideas won't be adopted? The JUSTICE Act  has many similarities to the Justice in Policing Act. We want to find a  way forward on a bipartisan basis. If ideas have merit, they will have  to be voted on and be included.   Are they somehow afraid that if we make progress, it will be  perceived as giving the President and his party a win? I have been  around here long enough to know that in an election year, it gets  harder and harder to get things done because neither party wants the  other to get any credit for anything or have an advantage. But on an  issue as important as this, it is the height of cynicism and hypocrisy  to prevent progress to gain political advantage.   I am reminded of a Scripture: ``For what shall it profit a man if he  shall gain the whole world but lose his soul?''   The American people expect better. I know that my fellow Iowans  expect better. Frankly, I expect better as well.   I hope my colleagues reconsider their obstruction and let us get on  with crafting a bipartisan police reform bill. I know my colleagues on  the other side share our desire to deliver for our constituents. I  don't doubt their sincerity about wanting to address inequities in the  communities or unfairness in policing. I don't doubt they would have  had legitimate ideas on how to improve this legislation if it had come  before the Senate. But at the very least, we can't accomplish any of  those things unless we start debate.   We have done it before on other issues. Only 18 months ago, this  Chamber passed the FIRST STEP Act, the most significant criminal  justice reform bill in a generation. That was a strong bipartisan bill.  It wasn't easy, but Senator Durbin and I and Democrats and other  Republicans in addition to the two of us found a path forward and are  giving thousands of Americans a chance to improve their lives when they  leave prison.   I am frustrated that the Senate can't consider this JUSTICE Act, but  I promise Iowans and the American people that this partisan exercise  doesn't represent my last hope for meaningful change. I stand ready to  work with any Democrat or any Republican on the issue of police reform,  and, for sure, I am not alone in the willingness to do that.   In fact, at the Judiciary Committee, just last week, the issue was  police use of force and community relations. At that meeting, Chairman  Graham indicated that he wants to hold more hearings on this issue.   So I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle not to let today's  vote be the end of the story. There is and has been an evergreen issue.  George Floyd's murder was the spark that ignited a national outcry. We  must rise to the occasion. We cannot let election-year politics and  differences of opinion prevent us from even discussing how best to  improve justice and safety in our community.                             Flynn Investigation    Mr. President, I will speak just a short period of time on another  issue that was resolved today by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.  Finally, justice has been done to a person that has been very unjustly  treated, a person by the name of Lieutenant General Flynn, who served  this country 33 years in the military.   Today, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ordered  the district court to grant the government's motion to dismiss the  Flynn case. Remember, this has been going on for almost 4 years.   I am pleased the appeals court upheld what it rightfully called  ``clearly established legal principles.'' The appeals court said that  the first ``troubling indication'' of the district judge's ``mistaken  understanding'' of his role was to appoint a former judge, and now a  private citizen, to argue against the government's proposal to District  Judge Sullivan to dismiss the Flynn case. Remember, the reason for that  was that he was mistreated in the first place.   As the majority opinion said: ``The court has appointed one private  citizen to argue that another citizen should be deprived of his liberty  regardless of whether the Executive Branch is willing to pursue those  charges.''   The DC Circuit is ordering an end to this charade, and let Lieutenant  General Flynn get back to his life and his family. Remember, this is a  case where we set up--and you saw the emails from people that were  going to prosecute him. Is this to get him fired--to get Flynn fired?  Or is it to get him prosecuted? That is how open it was, but we didn't  know about that until a few months ago.   So, today, Flynn's legal team released Strzok's notes regarding a  meeting between Obama, Biden, Comey, Sally Yates, and Susan Rice. These  notes appear to show several important things. The first one is, Comey  said the Flynn calls with the Russian Ambassador ``appear legit.'' Two,  President Obama ordered Comey to ``look at things.'' Three, President  Obama directed that ``the right people'' investigate Flynn. Four, Vice  President Biden appeared to raise the Logan Act.   Those four things lead to these questions. Well, if it was legit,  then, why ``look at things''? If it was legit, why would Biden mention  the Logan Act? These notes raise legitimate questions. For example, did  President Obama and Vice President Biden deliberately take steps in the  final hours of their administration to undermine the incoming  administration? It sure looks like that is what they were up to.   It also is reasonable to question the extent of President Obama's and  Vice President Biden's knowledge about Russia and the Flynn  investigation. I give this to you as an example. We know that on  January 4, 2017, the same day that Strzok allegedly wrote the meeting  notes, the FBI wrote a closing memorandum on Flynn, who was code named  ``Crossfire Razor'' by the FBI, that said the intelligence community  could find no derogatory information on him.   So they couldn't find any derogatory information on him, a person who  had served in the military for 33 years, got out as a lieutenant  general, and was going to be the National Security Advisor for this new  administration. They could find no derogatory information, but for the  next 3\1/2\ years, he has been fighting for his freedom. Then, on that  very same day, January 4, 2017, the FBI was ready to close this Flynn  case--probably based on the fact that Comey said that all this  connection between Flynn and the Russian ambassador was probably legit.   But that doesn't matter to somebody by the name of Strzok, who was  kind of leading all of this. He asked another FBI agent: ``Hey if you  haven't closed Razor don't do it yet.'' The case was still open at the  moment and Strzok asked that it be kept open ``for now.'' Strzok then  messaged his lover, Lisa Page, saying that Razor still happened to be  open because of some oversight and said to her--I don't know whether  this is tongue in cheek or whether it was real serious, but he said:  ``Yeah, our utter incompetence actually helps us. . . . ''   So what is helping us? It seems like any excuse to keep going in  getting Flynn. At that point, we all know the case should have been  closed, but 3\1/2\ years later, it is just solved by a decision of the  DC Court of Appeals. So, instead, even in light of Comey apparently  saying that the calls between Flynn and the Russian Ambassador appear  legit, President Obama--still President of the United States--directed  Comey to ``look at things'' and make sure ``the right people''  investigate it.   That has kind of been questionable, the extent to which President  Obama was involved in this, but it seems like those quotes make it  pretty clear. And then, at this very same conversation, Vice President  Biden chimed in as well by bringing up the Logan Act, which was used as  a pretext to interview Flynn weeks later. Mind you, all of this  happened after the election. Now people are raising questions about:  Why are you worried about things that happened 3 years ago? An  injustice was done to Flynn, and if you let people run wild over the  freedoms and liberties of the American people, if it can happen to a  lieutenant general, it can happen to anybody else, and we saw it happen  to George Floyd. He was murdered because of justice and the  constitutional rights of people not being followed.  [[Page S3197]]    So then we have the incoming Trump administration and all this going  on, having no idea that Obama, Biden, Comey, and Strzok were busy  setting the stage for what would become a multiyear struggle to show  that Trump didn't collude with the Russian Government--so much for a  peaceful transition of power from one President to another and from one  political party to another. It was something that for 240 years we  prided ourselves in, but not in this case. Ever since the election,  November of 2016, think of all the things that have been done to get  Trump out of office, and it started even before he was sworn in.   Well, thankfully, the DC Circuit stepped in to restore a bit of  justice after the government's multiyear campaign to destroy Flynn's  reputation. The FBI and the Department of Justice's actions to frame an  American citizen, drag that citizen into court, setting him up to plead  guilty to lying, and then doing everything they can to cover up their  transgressions should never happen and should never have happened  either. Let's all hope it never happens again   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
