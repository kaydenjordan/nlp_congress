 Mr. Speaker, Congressman Bowman is a brilliant,  committed, progressive Member who has dedicated his life to equity and  opportunity for kids. He is a leader in economics, education, and  racial justice. He is a leader of the Green New Deal for public  schools, and legislation to pay artists what they are worth.   He made a mistake. He apologized. He paid the fine. The Ethics  Committee declined to further investigate this matter. That should be  the end of this.   However, what are we doing here? Republicans would rather waste time  with political stunts and demonizing a Black Member. They want people  to forget that they want to strip healthcare from Americans. They want  people to forget that they want to cut Social Security and Medicare,  the two most important and trusted programs in the country. They want  people to forget that they are denying election results on that side,  your right to vote.   Right now they will do anything to distract from what they are really  doing. There is nothing to show for the majority but chaos, infighting,  and cruelty.    I just have to end with this. Just a few weeks ago,  Congressman Chip Roy stood on the floor of this Chamber and called for  his fellow Republican colleagues to ``come explain to me one material,  meaningful significant thing the Republican majority has done. . . . `'   The answer is obvious. Nothing.   Oppose this resolution.
