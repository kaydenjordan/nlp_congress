 Mr. President, on September 25, President Biden tweeted:         My Build Back Better Agenda costs zero dollars.    That is right. According to the President, a series of new, permanent  entitlements and a massive expansion of government, the biggest  expansion of government, at least, since the New Deal, is going to cost  zero dollars--that from the President of the United States.   And the President has now been doubling down on that claim. On  Monday, he once again tweeted:         The fact of the matter is my Build Back Better agenda costs       zero dollars.    Well, no, Mr. President, the fact of the matter is your Build Back  Better agenda costs $3.5 trillion, at least. That is the minimum  number. The Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, where the  President's Treasury Secretary served on the board before joining the  administration, estimates the cost at $5 trillion or more.   Leaving that aside, even if the President has been merely trying to  claim that his plan is fully paid for by tax hikes and other measures,  to say that it would cost zero dollars is beyond ridiculous.   I mean, think about it. Let's say your college education was  completely paid for by your parents. Did it then cost zero dollars? Of  course not. It costs a lot of money--money that your parents likely  were able to pay only because of a lot of hard work and sacrifices.   What if you saved up for a couple of years for your dream vacation,  and now you have all the money that you need, down to the cost of your  Ubers and your hotel breakfasts, does that mean that your vacation is  going to cost zero dollars? Of course, it doesn't.   The same thing applies when it comes to the Democrats' legislation.  Even if Democrats add all the money they need to pay for every dollar  of their massive spending spree, the pricetag still wouldn't be zero  dollars. I mean, it just absolutely doesn't pass the sanity test for  Americans.   The pricetag for this proposal is, at least minimum, $3.5 trillion  and likely much, much more. Presumably, what the President has been  referring to when he makes the absurd claim that his spending bill will  cost zero dollars is his assertion the bill won't add to the debt.   The problem is that isn't true either. Because the pay-fors in the  Democrats' bill won't actually pay for the bill in its entirety. The  tax hikes in the Democrats' legislation will actually only pay for  about two-thirds of the bill's ostensible $3.5 trillion pricetag.   The other revenue-raising components in the bill won't make up the  difference. What are those other revenue-raising components? Well, a  substantial part is increased IRS enforcement. Democrats claim they can  get $700 billion in more revenue by closing the tax gap, the difference  between taxes owed and taxes paid.   There is no question that individuals shouldn't get away with  cheating on their taxes. And there are, undoubtedly, reasonable  measures we can take to strengthen enforcement and narrow the gap.  Unfortunately, Democrats haven't proposed any reasonable measures.   Instead, the Democrats are proposing to, A, double the size of the  IRS and, B, have the IRS snoop on Americans' bank accounts. That is  right. Democrats want to double the size of the IRS and force banks,  credit unions, and other financial institutions to provide details of  individuals' spending to the Federal Government. Under the  administration's proposal, once your withdrawals or deposits for the  year exceed a certain amount--and that amount, by the way, if the  President has his way, is $600--your bank or credit union would be  forced to report the details of your activity to the Federal  Government.   So the Federal Government could end up with a record of every time  you eat dinner out or pay your rent or buy a new jacket or a toaster  oven. The invasion of privacy being talked about here is absolutely  staggering.   We already have a mechanism in place to allow the IRS to view large  transactions that might indicate potential criminal activity. We do not  need the Federal Government monitoring every purchase that law-abiding  Americans make from the App Store or how many times Americans buy a cup  of coffee, not to mention the incredible demands this reporting  requirement would place on community banks and credit unions. Banks and  credit unions around the country are worried about how they would  manage to comply with the bill's reporting requirements.   Let's not forget that the Agency that would be receiving all of this  information has a reputation for mishandling private data. In fact, the  IRS was subject to a massive leak, or hack, of private taxpayer  information mere months ago--information that somehow ended up in the  hands of advocates at ProPublica--and neither Treasury nor the IRS has  provided meaningful followup about that data breach, much less any  accountability. Giving an already troubled Agency access to reams of  additional private taxpayer information is a very bad idea.   Even if we granted that this massive invasion of privacy were worth  it, the truth is that all of this additional enforcement still wouldn't  provide the money that Democrats are claiming it would provide.  Democrats claim that they can get $700 billion from the bill's  increased tax enforcement measures. The reality is more likely to be  about $200 billion lower, according to an analysis from the Wharton  School of business. So Democrats would be doubling the size of an  Agency with clear management issues and implementing a staggering  invasion of taxpayer privacy to pay for a tiny fraction of their  spending spree.   As I said, no taxpayer at any income level should be able to avoid  paying the taxes he or she owes. I have actually signed on to cosponsor  legislation that would look at responsible ways to strengthen IRS  enforcement efforts. But Democrats' proposal to double the size of the  IRS and track taxpayer spending should never--never--have seen the  light of day. Even former IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, who served  under Presidents Obama and Trump, said he thought that $80 billion for  the Agency was too much.   Taken together, the IRS enforcement on steroids and Democrats'  massive tax hikes will still not be enough to pay for their  multitrillion-dollar legislation, partly because the tax hikes may not  bring in as much as the Democrats claim but also because Democrats have  used a lot of budget gimmickry to disguise the true costs of their  bill.   The standard method for analyzing the cost of a bill is a 10-year-- 10-year--budget window. So you look at what your bill would cost over  10 years, and that is how you get the cost of your bill. That is  normally the way that it works around here.   Well, that is not exactly what the Democrats are doing. That child  allowance in the Democrats' bill? Democrats have only counted the cost  of that allowance through the year 2025. That allows Democrats to claim  that the cost of that provision is around $500 billion instead of the  $1.1 trillion the measure would actually cost over a decade.  [[Page S6929]]    All of those tax hikes are, of course, just for covering the costs of  the bill over a 10-year or shorter window, but in reality, the new  government benefits the Democrats are putting in place are not going to  expire in 10 years. This bill is effectively instituting multiple  permanent--permanent--entitlement programs. The long-term cost of those  programs is not going to be covered by the tax hikes Democrats are  currently proposing, as massive as those tax hikes are.   I have talked a lot about the dollar costs of this bill, which are  massive--the biggest expanse of government in, literally, my generation  in history. I could spend just as long talking about the bill's other  costs, like the fact that the bill is likely to cost workers jobs and  opportunities by increasing the tax burden on American businesses and  depressing economic growth, or the cost to American families, who are  going to be facing higher energy bills and higher prices as a result of  this legislation, but I am going to stop here for today.   One thing is for sure: Democrats' massive spending spree is going to  cost a lot more than zero dollars. And American taxpayers? Well, the  American taxpayers are going to be paying a heavy price for this  legislation for a very long time to come.   I yield the floor.
