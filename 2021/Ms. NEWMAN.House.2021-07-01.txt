 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise on behalf of the thousands of  Palestinian families in the West Bank that face the prospect of  eviction, demolition, and displacement from their homes by the Israeli  Government.   We have received word that demolition orders have already begun for  homes in the al-Bustan neighborhood of Silwan in East Jerusalem. A few  months ago, families in Sheikh Jarrah and other neighborhoods faced a  similar fate. Tomorrow, others will also.   After the devastation and bloodshed of the past few months and the  continued toll of the coronavirus pandemic on Palestinian families, we  cannot allow these evictions, demolitions, and displacements to further  exacerbate this humanitarian crisis.   No individual or family should ever be forcibly removed from their  home, not in the West Bank, not in Gaza, not in Europe, not in Asia,  not really anywhere. It is wrong.   This crisis must end now. This is about human rights, dignity, and  respect. If we are ever to achieve peace in the region, a true two- state solution, there must be a mutual understanding.   I once again urge the Biden administration to do everything in its  power to stop the evictions.                            ____________________
