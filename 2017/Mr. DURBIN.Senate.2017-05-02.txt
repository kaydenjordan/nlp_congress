 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the  votes on the nomination of Jay Clayton to be a Member of the Securities  and Exchange Commission, Executive Calendar No. 36.   On vote No. 118, had I been present, I would have voted nay on the  confirmation of the Clayton nomination, Executive Calendar No.  36.                            ____________________
