 Madam Speaker, I rise to reflect on what could have been  accomplished in the past 9 months on this House floor.   The list is staggering: border security and illegal immigration  reform; lower drug costs and lower premiums and deductibles for  families; correcting surprise billing; making the middle class tax cut  permanent; passing a robust infrastructure transportation bill;  promoting free, fair, and reciprocal trade globally; and passing the  United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and other America-first, but not- America-alone, trade agreements, which will grow our domestic industry  and agricultural exports.   Democrat leadership has, however, wasted the last 9 months focused on  [[Page H8076]]  fruitless investigations aimed at relitigating the 2016 Presidential  election. Every one of these investigations has produced the same  result: nothing.   The majority party has wasted its own time and, much more seriously,  the time of the people who sent us here.   House Democrats are now grasping at one last desperate effort: an  impeachment inquiry over a baseless, secondhand account. This farce,  which chooses to push a presumption of guilt where evidence is  nonexistent, is nothing short of a constitutional embarrassment for our  country.   May God continue to bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
