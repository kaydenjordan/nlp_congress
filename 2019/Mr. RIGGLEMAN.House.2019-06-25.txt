 Madam Speaker, I rise today as a small business owner  [[Page H5090]]  concerned about the PRO Act, a bill that will harm both job creators  and their employees.   The PRO Act would amend the National Labor Relations Act and repeal  right-to-work laws. Right-to-work laws protect employees from being  fired for not paying monetary support to a union they don't want to  join.   The PRO Act also takes away employers' rights in National Labor  Relations Board cases by taking away their standing and giving  employers no recourse to the NLRB.   My district is home to over 2,100 small franchise business owners  that could be negatively impacted by this bill. It will hurt businesses  like Arrington Enterprises, Inc., which operates Dairy Queens,  Bojangles' Famous Chicken `n Biscuits, and Exxon stores in Franklin  County.   Aside from delivering a quality product, Arrington Enterprises, Inc.,  has collected close to $18,000 for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals  and donated $4,800 to local schools so far this year.   In closing, this bill would hurt local businesses and local workers.                            ____________________
