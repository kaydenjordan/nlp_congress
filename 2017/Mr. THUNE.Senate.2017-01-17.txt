Mr. President, today I recognize Dr. Erica Towle, a Knauss  Sea Grant fellow on the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation, for all of the hard work she has done for me, my staff,  and other members of the committee over the past year. Dr. Towle  received her Ph.D. in coral reef ecology from the University of Miami.  In her postgraduate work, she has used her scientific expertise to  inform public policy. I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to  Dr. Towle for all of the fine work she has done. I wish her continued  success in the years to come.                            ____________________
