 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  legislation because there are many reasons to vote for the American  Rescue Plan.   If you want to ensure that schools can reopen safely and make up for  lost time in the classroom, vote for the bill.   If you want to provide relief for institutions of higher education  and their students, vote for the bill.   If you want to save our childcare system from collapse, vote for the  bill.   If you want to protect workers against the virus and increase their  wages, vote for this bill.   If you want to maintain access to affordable healthcare for workers  who have lost their jobs, vote for the bill.   If you want to prevent more than a million retirees from losing their  hard-earned pensions, vote for this bill.   Finally, if you want to keep children and families from going hungry,  prevent domestic and gender-based violence, and protect older Americans  during this pandemic, you must vote for this bill.   The American people need to know that help is on the way. I urge my  colleagues to support the bill.
