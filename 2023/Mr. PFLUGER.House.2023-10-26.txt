 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, it is unfortunate that we have to be here  to talk about this. As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee,  as the Representative of one of the most important energy production  areas in the country, this is a national security issue.   The Biden administration's assault on our baseload, dispatchable  generation of electricity has resulted in record-high prices for  consumers and looming resource inadequacies throughout the country, and  it has threatened our grid reliability.   Just a few weeks ago, the Department of Energy's Assistant Secretary  for Electricity, Mr. Rodrigues, testified before the Energy and  Commerce Committee regarding policies to enhance the reliability and  efficiency in powering American homes. I am sad to say that at this  hearing, Mr. Rodrigues, who is the head of electricity at the  Department of Energy, had no idea how much electricity the United  States uses each year. He stated that the reason he was chosen for this  position was not because he was a subject matter expert.   It saddens me to be standing here, but that is just not an acceptable  position, and this glaring lack of knowledge is not okay. It is  unacceptable from the head of the Department of Energy's electricity  division.   This administration has worked every day to transform energy  industries and to push a green agenda that doesn't work, that is not  reliable, that doesn't take into account reliability. Their own named  Assistant Secretary doesn't know how much electricity we use.   When you look at examples of what they have pushed for--a substantial  increase in electric vehicles and other policies--you have to ask the  question: If they don't know how much electricity we currently use,  then will they know how much electricity we would require with their  mandates for electric vehicles?   In Texas alone, if all of our cars were electrified today, just as an  example, the State would need approximately an additional 110 terawatt- hours of electricity per year, the average annual electricity  consumption of 11 million homes. The added electricity demand would  result in a 30 percent increase over current consumption. That is the  kind of example that I expect Mr. Rodrigues and others within the  Department of Energy to know.   This is a gigantic increase in demand. This administration continues  to put American producers and consumers in a bad situation. It is  critical that we have good leadership at DOE.   Let me make this clear: I want the Assistant Secretary to be  successful. We should all want these people in leadership positions to  be successful. If he succeeds, our country wins. However, when you are  the Assistant Secretary for Electricity and don't know every detail  about electricity in the United States, then you are not succeeding.   It is for that reason that I recommend this amendment to reduce his  salary to $1 and remind DOE of their core mission, which is to help  Americans with reliable and affordable energy.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Fleischmann).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, the most important tool our country has is  energy. It is the underpinning of our economy. It forms a foundational  piece of our national security. We see this playing out in all parts of  the world right now.   The prosperity of our country rests on the abundant natural resources  that we have that no other country has. We are blessed to have those  natural resources.   This has been reaffirmed as Americans have seen the events unfold in  places like Ukraine. Make no mistake, the single biggest important  impetus for Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine was the belief that  Vladimir Putin would not weaponize energy, and he did.   We recognize the critical importance of secure, abundant, affordable  resources and affordable energy better than anywhere else. Because we  know what it takes to produce it, we understand how devastating it  would be to lose it, and we see the potential before us if we had the  opportunity to unleash our full energy capabilities.   Our Nation is blessed with natural resources and a strong, innovative  spirit that encapsulates the American character. Nowhere is this more  evident than in my own district with the Permian Basin, which produces  over 40 percent of the country's oil production.   While climate alarmists scream that oil and gas are bad, I feel  confident in saying that if they were serious about reducing carbon  emissions, we would actually produce it here, where we do it much  cleaner, much better, more efficiently, and with higher labor standards  than anywhere else. Don't export that to our adversaries.   Unfortunately, this administration has done just that. They would  rather look to our adversaries for energy than embrace the innovation  that is being done right here at home.   When looking to supply the energy needs for Americans, I respectfully  ask that the President call the mayor of Midland, Texas, not OPEC, for  our energy needs.   At a time when our world is increasingly destabilized, our Nation  needs us to lead from the front. Our domestic energy production is too  important an asset to be left out of our national security toolkit, and  we must use this unique asset not only for our benefit here  domestically but around the world.   LNG, much of which is produced in the Permian Basin--10 percent, by  the way, worldwide--will play the leading role in helping reach  developing nations to provide them with clean, affordable, reliable  energy to power their economies.   Global demand for LNG will continue to increase, with estimates  nearly double what it is now in the next 20 years.                                time  1430    This is a massive opportunity for our country to lead, and if we  don't have advisers in this administration who think critically about  American energy as a national security tool, the consequences will be  severe.   Under this administration, senior advisers have praised China as a  leader in clean energy, begged OPEC to produce more oil than doing it  here domestically and tried to sabotage the credibility of American  producers here.   That is why I am leading an amendment to reduce the salary of Andrew  Light, the Department of Energy's Assistant Secretary for International  Affairs, to $1. We need the administration to focus on our own  strength, our own inventions, and our own capabilities.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and the  legacy of Mr. Jim Henry.   Mr. Henry's legacy is one of true innovation and foresight. His  pioneering work in the Permian Basin oilfields, particularly in opening  the Wolfberry play, laid the groundwork for the shale revolution that  reinvigorated the entire region. His dedication, expertise, and  tireless efforts transformed not only the industry but also the lives  of countless families throughout America and beyond.   Beyond his professional accomplishments, Mr. Henry was known for his  generous spirit and philanthropy. He understood the importance of  giving back to the community that had given him so much.   As a prominent businessman in Midland, Texas, said, he was a legend  and a sweet man at the same time, a rare combination.   His legacy will be forever woven into the fabric of the Permian  Basin, a testament to the power of vision, hard work, and dedication.  [[Page H5156]]    Mr. Henry's family and loved ones are in my prayers and in my  thoughts. Our community will continue to honor Jim's remarkable  achievements and his positive impact on the world.                            ____________________
