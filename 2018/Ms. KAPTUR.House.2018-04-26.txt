 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call attention to National  Prescription Drug Take Back Day this Saturday, April 28.   While prescription opioids may be a short-term, safe treatment for  extreme pain management, misuse and addiction can become a tragic side  effect and are extremely common, unfortunately. Ohio is second in our  Nation in opioid overdose deaths per capita.   According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 6.4 million  Americans abused controlled prescription drugs in 2015. About half of  the people over the age of 12 who misused prescription pain relievers  obtained the drugs from a friend or relative.   Americans of sound mind and body must do more to reduce this number  and mitigate misuse by taking action. Please join your fellow citizens  in participating in National Prescription Drug Take Back Day this  Saturday, April 28. Proper disposal of drugs can save lives.   Remember that you can go to a collection site any day of the year to  deposit unused or extra pills and prescription drugs. Get rid of them.   You can find a collection site near you by visiting  takebackday.dea.gov.   Do your part to prevent accidental poisoning misuse and overdose  today. Your vigilance matters.                            ____________________
