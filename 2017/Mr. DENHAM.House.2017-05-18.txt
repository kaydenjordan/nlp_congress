 Mr. Speaker, it is a great honor today to introduce to  the House our guest chaplain, Glen Berteau of Modesto, California.   Glen is the senior pastor of The House in Modesto, a church of more  than 8,000.   Supporting his community is a priority, and, under Glen's leadership,  The House Modesto has established programs to fight against human  trafficking, provided groceries on a weekly basis to those in need,  repaired bicycles for the homeless, and developed mobile medical and  dental clinics that provide services free of charge.   The House was also recently recognized by the city of Modesto for  their annual event, Unity Matters, which honors law enforcement and  first responders.   Glen is originally from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and has called  California his home for over 24 years. He and his wife, Deborah, have  been in ministry for over 40 years, have been married for 42 years, and  they have 3 children, 5 grandchildren.   Glen is a gifted speaker, teacher, and evangelist and has ministered  at conferences, churches, and conventions all over the world.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in welcoming Pastor Glen  Berteau. We thank him for offering today's opening prayer in the United  States House of Representatives.                            ____________________
