 Madam Speaker, I stand before you 2 days before the third  anniversary of the mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando,  Florida, to tell this body, the people's House, that we have work to  do.   The Pulse shooting shook us all to our core, and for so many in the  LGBTQ community, these wounds may never fully heal.   We honor the memory of those whose lives were taken, but for those 49  people, their families, and, importantly, their chosen families,  thoughts and prayers will never be enough.   ``Orlando Strong'' and ``Never Again'' are only words until we take  action.   We are united by the power our constituents have given to us to make  laws. We must use that power to stop gun violence.   What does it say to the victims at Pulse, Marjory Stoneman Douglas,  Sandy Hook, Las Vegas, Aurora, Virginia Beach, and too many others to  list? Do we not care?   Making life safer for our constituents is not right versus left; it  is right versus wrong.   Madam Speaker, I urge action on this national epidemic.                            ____________________
