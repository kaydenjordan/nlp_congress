 Mr. Speaker, racism persists in America today, and its  poison pervades our institutions, creating barriers that magnify  inequality and injustice.   To Black Americans and communities of color, this comes as no  surprise. But, unfortunately, it has taken many Americans too long to  acknowledge this truth. We cannot ignore how the remnants of slavery  and the Jim Crow era have maintained a stronghold on our institutions.   Our criminal justice system disproportionally penalizes Black  Americans and people of color with almost blanket immunity for those  who disregard human life and dignity. But, today, we have an  opportunity to right these wrongs and to tell the world that the U.S.  House of Representatives believes that Black lives matter.   The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act would make much-needed  reforms, from holding police accountable to combating racial profiling.   When this law passes, this will make a real difference in American  life. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this essential  legislation.
