 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  Equality Act.   As the first LGBTQ woman in Congress from the State of California and  the second openly bisexual woman to serve in Congress overall, I could  not be prouder to support this landmark legislation.   Throughout my run, I got so many questions about why I chose to be  honest about my sexuality. I am married to a man, I am from a purple,  historically Republican, district, and everyone said it would be easier  for me to hide who I am. But the reality is that representation  matters, especially for the LGBTQ community, when so many of our basic  rights are still at risk.   Through my work on the issue of homelessness, I have seen how  disproportionately our community is affected by discrimination still.  The Equality Act will provide basic protections in terms of employment,  housing, education, and more. Everyone should have a fair chance to  earn a living and provide a home for their families without fear of  harassment or discrimination.   I could not be prouder to be part of a new generation of leaders who  will be the ones to finally pass the Equality Act and fight for true  freedom and equality for all.                            ____________________
