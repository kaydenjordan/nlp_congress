 Mr. Speaker, recent news has indicated that an  individual in the United States has been designated with the  coronavirus who has not been assessed to have traveled in any of the  countries that have been listed for travel advisories and has not been  listed as having had any of the normal processes or patterns of getting  this particular virus.   With that in mind, I think it is extremely important that Congress  plays a major role, in addition to its role of discerning the kind of  funding.   With that in mind, we will be organizing a coronavirus task force  that is bipartisan and that will assess how we  [[Page H1244]]  reach effectively, as Members of Congress, all of our constituents who  are dependent on information that we receive: the waiters and  waitresses, the traveling public, the aviation persons, the public  hospital providers, all of those persons in our districts.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to join the task force. Let us  work together because it is a crisis. We are in a position to help the  American people in the best way that we can, and that is with  information.                            ____________________
