 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Dr. James Cameron on what would have been his 108th birthday. James  Cameron was born in La Crosse, WI, on February 25, 1914. A civil rights  pioneer, Dr. Cameron fought his entire life to create an accountable  and equitable world. Dr. Cameron left an indelible mark on our country  as the only known person in the United States to survive a lynching, an  event in 1930 at the age of 16 which would inevitably change his life.   Dr. Cameron was an early activist for the Civil Rights movement,  desegregating the movie theater in the Indiana town where he and his  wife, Virginia, lived. He worked with the NAACP, founding branches in  Madison, WI, as well as Muncie and South Bend, IN. He also served as  Indiana's director of civil liberties.   In 1952, the Cameron family came to Milwaukee. Over the years, he  acquired pieces like Ku Klux Klan robes, as well as a piece of rope  that had been used during his own lynching. After visiting Yad Vashem,  the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Israel, he set out to create  a museum with these pieces to educate the public about the injustices  Black people faced in America. At age 74, he founded America's Black  Holocaust Museum in the historic Bronzeville neighborhood of Milwaukee.  Three years later, in 1991, Indiana Governor Evan Bayh gave him the key  to the city of Marion where he had miraculously survived the lynching  61 years prior.   Dr. Cameron so rightly believed that only by sharing the hard truths  about our Nation's history, could we move forward together to promote  racial repair, reconciliation, and healing. The best word to describe  Dr. Cameron was ``survivor'' and his life's work and legacy will now  live on with the Grand Reemergence of America's Black Holocaust Museum  in Milwaukee on February 25, 2022. With a mission to build public  awareness of the harmful legacies of slavery, lynching, and Jim Crow,  America's Black Holocaust Museum is guided by a vision of a society  that remembers its past in order to shape a better future, a nation  undivided by race where every person matters equally. This will be a  home for others to take the lesson that, in order to create an  equitable world, we must first create a world willing to grow.                            ____________________
