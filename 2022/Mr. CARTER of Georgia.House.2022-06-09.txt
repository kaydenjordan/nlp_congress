 Madam Speaker, I rise today in memory of Jimmy  Guy Burke, Jr., a loving father and husband, servant, leader, and  veteran from the great State of Georgia.   Jimmy was born in Savannah in 1935 and grew up in Tybee Island where  he lived and served throughout his life. He was devoted to his family  and community and showed pride in being a true Irish Savannahian.   His Irish heritage was very close to his heart, as shown by him  serving as a member of the St. Patrick's Day Committee for 65 years. He  was even selected to be the distinguished grand marshal of the St.  Patrick's Day parade in 1993.   He served in many ways, such as being the founding member of the  Irish Heritage Society, being elected to the Tybee Island City Council,  and serving as the president of the Tybee Island Republicans. Jimmy  also served his country in the United States Marine Corps Reserve for 8  years and the 117th Georgia Air National Guard for 3 years.   He will continue to smile down on Savannah and Tybee Island through  his family and his noble service to the Irish community.   Jimmy will surely be missed by all who knew him.                            ____________________
