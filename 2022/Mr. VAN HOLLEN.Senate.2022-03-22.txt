 Mr. President, I just wanted to take a few moments to  respond to some of the remarks made by my colleague from Wyoming.   I think we all saw a jump in big gas prices when Putin invaded  Ukraine. Then this body called upon the President, in a bipartisan  manner, to say that we don't want to import any Russian oil into the  United States because we don't want our dollars going to Putin to help  fund his war. That was the right thing to do. That also increases gas  prices.   We also know that there are thousands of leases on public lands that  are not being used today and drilled by oil companies that have those  leases. In fact, the Senator from Massachusetts, the Presiding Officer,  has said we should have a law saying use it or lose it. And I support  that position because instead of using it, you see oil companies  exploiting the current situation to have windfall profits and use those  profits not to reinvest in war production but to engage in stock  buybacks to help their CEOs while they keep the prices high.                                   Ukraine    Mr. President, I am here today on the floor as we mark day 27 of  Vladimir Putin's unprovoked war against Ukraine.   Each day that the war grinds on, Putin's brutality exceeds the last.  As his advances against major cities like Kyiv have slowed, his  barbaric war crimes have mounted. Americans have seen the harrowing  images of Russian strikes hitting schools, hospitals, maternity wards,  and designated humanitarian quarters, indiscriminately killing  children, women, and men.   The horror of each day is amplified by the fact that this is not a  war of necessity. This is a war of choice, a war chosen by Vladimir  Putin. And that choice grew out of Putin's fear of democracy, his fear  of freedom of expression.   Just today, Putin's crony court sentenced Russian democracy activist  Alexey Navalny to 9 years in a maximum security prison. First, they  tried to poison Navalny; now they want to silence him with 9 more years  in jail.    So you see the lengths to which Putin is willing to go to silence one  man. You can imagine how he fears a democracy of 44 million Ukrainians  on his border. He is scared of the example it sets to the Russians that  he keeps under his authoritarian thumb. He wants to extinguish--snuff  out--the flame of liberty in Ukraine before it catches fire in Russia.   So he started a war, a brutal war. Now, Vladimir Putin has shown the  world who he really is: a scared tyrant who thinks he can snuff out  democracy and freedom by brute force. But he is wrong. He can kill a  lot of people, and he has; but whether it is a matter of weeks or many  months, Putin will not be able to kill the aspirations of the people of  Ukraine. We see proof of that fact every day in the defiant words and  heroic actions of Ukrainians everywhere.   Amidst the horror, the blood, and the misery, we have seen amazing  strength. The people of Ukraine are fighting for their homeland, for  their freedom, and for the power to control their own destiny.  Ukrainian men and women of all backgrounds and ages have joined in this  cause, blocking the path of Russian tanks with their bodies, making  Molotov cocktails, tending to the wounded, and taking up arms. Their  courage speaks to the very best of the human spirit.   Like most Americans, I am deeply inspired by their resolve and their  fortitude, and the whole world should learn from their determination  because the stakes in this war go far beyond the borders of Ukraine.  This is a fight for the future of democracy itself.   As President Zelenskyy said in his address to Congress last week:         Russia has attacked not just us, not just our land, not       just our cities. It went on a brutal offensive against our       values . . . against our freedom, against our right to live       freely in our own country, choosing our own future--against       our desire for happiness, against our national dreams--just       like the same dreams you have, you Americans.    That was President Zelenskyy last week before Congress. He spoke of  self-  [[Page S1283]]  determination. He spoke of individual liberty and freedom. Those are  values enshrined in America's own founding documents.   So Putin is not just trying to take over Ukraine; he is, as President  Zelenskyy said, trying to destroy the notions of democracy and freedom  that we hold dear. Putin wants to see freedom fade and democracy fail,  and he is not alone in that effort.   Just before the Winter Olympics in Beijing, Putin traveled to China  and met with another autocratic leader, President Xi Jinping. Putin and  Xi signed an agreement stating that relations between Russia and China  had ``no limits,'' ``no limits.'' On that day, they formed a pact of  autocracy. And, today, China's state-run media parrots Putin's lies as  Russian tanks encircle Ukrainian towns.   President Xi is watching closely to see if Putin's model of autocracy  by conquest might work in other places, might work in Asia. China has  already violated its international obligations by stomping out freedoms  in Hong Kong. Now, the Chinese Communist Party is eyeing their own  democratic neighbor, Taiwan. As Beijing weighs the risks of trying to  forcefully unite Taiwan with mainland China, its leaders are monitoring  Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and they are watching closely how we and  the world respond.   Mr. President, the good news is the United States has rallied our  NATO allies and partners in Europe. Even partners beyond the West have  responded with unity and resolve, including Japan, South Korea,  Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, and Singapore. One hundred forty-one  countries voted at the United Nations to condemn Putin's war.   Support has come not only in words and votes but also in deeds and  help. Last week, President Biden signed the $14 billion emergency  Ukraine legislation passed by the Senate and the House. The United  States, our NATO partners, and others are supplying Ukrainians with the  weapons they need to fight Putin's army. We are providing millions of  Ukrainian refugees in Poland, Romania, and other neighboring countries  with humanitarian assistance, and we are delivering aid to the millions  more displaced within Ukraine itself.    The United States has also worked in concert with our allies to  unleash sweeping, punishing sanctions at a speed the world has never  seen; and these sanctions are aimed right at the heart of Russia's  economy, at Vladimir Putin, and at his cronies. We have cut off  Russia's financial system from the world. The ruble is in shambles. The  ill-gotten gains of the oligarchs are being seized at this very moment.   The unity we see today among democracies in the face of Putin's  aggression marks a double triumph. Not only does it allow us to form a  united front against Putin, it also undermines his strategy of  weakening democracies. He has long conspired to erode support for NATO  from within its member countries. He believes freedom means unending  chaos, and he wants to see us bicker ourselves into oblivion. When NATO  and our key democratic allies are divided, Putin and authoritarians can  win. When we are united, we win.   When it comes to Putin and Russia, Members of Congress on both sides  of the aisle have known this for years. Even when the former President  attacked NATO and belittled our democratic partnerships, lawmakers on  both sides of the aisle united to reaffirm our support for the  alliance. In 2018, a bipartisan group of Senators reestablished the  NATO Observer Group to keep an open line of communication with our NATO  partners. I am proud to be a member of that group.   In 2019, the Senate passed a resolution reaffirming our support for  NATO in the face of the former President's attacks. That same year,  Speaker Pelosi invited NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg to address a  joint meeting of Congress. She did that on behalf of a bipartisan  group. That was the first-ever such address by a NATO Secretary  General.   President Biden pledged that he would strengthen that tradition of  unity, rebuild U.S. relations with our allies, and stand up for  democracy, and that is what he has done. On day 1, he got to work  repairing our tattered alliances after the beating they took during the  last administration. He organized the first of two summits for  democracy last December to rally global partners, and the Biden State  Department organized dozens of diplomatic missions to countries around  the world to foster democracy.   So let's be clear: This speedy, severe, and synchronized response  from the United States and our partners did not come about by chance.  It wasn't random. Our unity came from the deliberate strategy of this  President and his administration. President Biden understands that  there is a global contest between autocrats like Putin and Xi, who want  democracy to die, and those like Zelenskyy, who want it to flourish;  and he has shown that democratic unity is the strongest instrument we  have against the forces of autocracy.   Mr. President, that unity was on full display in February when I  traveled to the Munich Security Conference with a bipartisan group of  lawmakers from both the House and the Senate. We met in Munich on the  eve of Putin's invasion. And because President Biden had the foresight  to share our intelligence about Putin's intentions with the world,  NATO, the European community, and members of the G-7 had time to  prepare and coordinate our response. It allowed us to plan the rapid  delivery of weapons and the imposition of unified, crushing sanctions-- unity in action.   I hope we can maintain that unity of purpose here at home. There was,  as the Presiding Officer knows, a time in American life when politics  stopped at the water's edge. I realize that era is for the most part  over, but I hope--I hope this country is strong enough and wise enough  to put aside our politics at least for the purpose of making common  cause to support democracy and stand up against Putin, as long as it  takes.    That unity will be tested. I already see divisions in Congress over  the administration's response to this invasion. Sometimes Members of  the Senate or the House will have an idea to help Ukraine or an idea to  punish Putin that they want implemented immediately. I often have the  same impulse. But let's be clear: The success of the President's  strategy has been the rapid coordination of our steps with our allies,  whenever possible. That is how we pack the biggest punch.   There are also some measures where the President has asked for  immediate action and Congress has delayed. Five days ago, the House of  Representatives passed a bill to strip Russia of its most-favored- nation trading status. It passed 424 to 8. When is the last time we saw  a vote like that in the House of Representatives?   That bill is sitting right here in the Senate right now. We should  and could pass it today. We should certainly pass it before President  Biden leaves Wednesday--tomorrow--to meet with NATO allies and leaders  from the European Union and G-7.   Sometimes around here, if the President announces a sanctions measure  a day after somebody else thinks about it, he gets criticized for it  being too late; but here, the Senate has been sitting for days on the  House bill, and every day that goes by is another day that Russian  producers and exporters make more money, make more dollars. Every day  that goes by provides some relief to Putin's cronies and the Russian  economy. So let's stand together in this Senate and act on that  legislation now.   I also appeal to my colleagues--especially on the Republican side--to  speak out against those here at home who are spreading Putin's  propaganda. A case in point has been the fast-spreading lie that the  United States and Ukraine have bio labs in Ukraine to help develop  bioweapons. That is just flatout false, but that lie has been fueled in  part by some in the rightwing media.   On March 3, the Kremlin circulated a memo to Russian media saying it  is ``essential'' to feature Tucker Carlson, who has been spreading this  kind of misinformation about Putin's war on his show. The lie about the  so-called American and Ukrainian bioweapons labs was also picked up and  peddled by China's state media.   So, Mr. President, all of us should stand up and speak out against  this misinformation. American media figures can say what they want.  That is their right. But so can we as Members of Congress, and I would  argue we have a duty to make our voices heard and  [[Page S1284]]  join in the chorus of those calling out Russian lies across the globe.   Every day, we see thousands of Russians flood the streets, from St.  Petersburg to Siberia, to protest Putin's war. The world witnessed  Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova speak out against the invasion  on live, state-sponsored TV, with a sign calling out Putin's lies.   These heroes are carrying on knowing full well the risk that they put  themselves in, the risk that they will be thrown in jail or worse. The  least we can do in Congress is to stand up to lies here at home that  aid and abet Putin's propaganda machine.   Make no mistake, even in unity, there will be spirited debate here.  We will have disagreements over how to best respond to Putin's  aggression, but we should never ever disagree about who the true enemy  is. Vladimir Putin is to blame for this attack on democracy. Vladimir  Putin is to blame for death and destruction in Ukraine. Vladimir Putin  is the enemy--not one another; not the other party; not the President.   There are plenty of things for us to fight about, but in the current  battle for democracy and freedom in Ukraine and the larger fight for  democracy and freedom around the world, the stakes are simply too high  for us to fall back on partisan games. Let's come together. Let's stay  together. And if we do, I am confident that democracy and justice will  prevail.   To those countries and leaders around the world who stand on the  sidelines, I say that neutrality in the face of evil is complicity. In  the end, freedom and the dignity of the human spirit will prevail over  subjugation and oppression every single time. They need to get on the  right side of history.   I yield the floor.
