 Mr. Speaker, January is School Board Director  Recognition Month, and I want to take a moment, as a former school  board member and school board president, to recognize the contributions  of these unpaid but essential community servants.   In the best of times, being a school board member is challenging,  requiring community members to step up and address issues ranging from  child development to HR, and from transportation and construction to  nutrition and natural disasters. There is never enough money to do  everything we would like to for our children, and the number of  regulations, mandates, and laws that must be met seems to be never- ending. It often seems like every choice is between two bad  alternatives.   As school directors are facing these outsized challenges compounded  by a pandemic and political polarization, and the mental health  challenges both have brought, I want to acknowledge their Herculean  efforts to keep our children, our teachers, and our staff safe and give  them every opportunity to succeed.   I want them to know how much their efforts on behalf of our children,  our schools, and our communities are appreciated.                            ____________________
