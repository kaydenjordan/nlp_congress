 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the Senate's first order of business  this week will be confirming a thoroughly well-prepared nominee to a  post of vital national importance. Later today, we will vote to advance  the nomination of Dr. Mark Esper to serve as Secretary of Defense, and  we will vote on his confirmation tomorrow.   When Dr. Esper was nominated in July of 2017 to serve as Secretary of  the Army, he already possessed an impressive record that spanned public  service, the private sector, and, of course, his distinguished service  in uniform. As a student, he excelled at West Point. He served  honorably in combat during the Gulf war as an infantry officer with  Kentucky's own 101st Airborne, the Screaming Eagles. He then later  obtained a master's degree from the Kennedy School at Harvard and a  Ph.D. from George Washington University.   In the years since, Dr. Esper has continued to serve his country,  compiling an outstanding record in public service. He has served as  Deputy Assistant Secretary at the Pentagon; as a Senate-appointed  member of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission; and,  of course, as a trusted staff expert right here in the Capitol.   As a result, many of our colleagues have been familiar with this  nominee for more than a decade. Members on both sides remember Mark  Esper from his time on staff with our former colleague Chuck Hagel.  Some knew him during his tenure with the Foreign Relations Committee or  with what was  [[Page S4958]]  then the Governmental Affairs Committee, and many of us inevitably  crossed paths with the smart and level-headed national security adviser  for Majority Leader Bill Frist.   So, when President Trump first nominated Dr. Esper to be Secretary of  the Army 2 years ago, my colleagues and I were well acquainted with his  expertise, his professionalism, and his patriotic dedication to the men  and women who serve to keep us safe. It is no wonder that this body  confirmed him to that post by an overwhelming bipartisan margin. Since  then, Secretary Esper has continued to impress. He has continued to  earn the praise of experts and colleagues from every corner of the  national security landscape.   ``He's highly regarded inside the Army. Soldiers like him.''   He is ``someone who can work across the aisle . . . somebody who can  work with Congress.''   Additionally, he is ``superbly well qualified by experience and  temperament for the position.''   Another quote: ``The nation would be lucky to have Mark serve in any  capacity . . . He is particularly well-suited to step into one of the  most important jobs in the world.''   This is high praise from former Pentagon officials of the Obama years  and from widely recognized national security professionals. Just last  week, our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee offered a ringing  endorsement of their own by voting by voice to favorably report his  nomination to the floor.   It would be hard to draw up a more compelling case than the one in  front of us for confirming Dr. Mark Esper, and it is hard to imagine a  more persuasive argument for doing it right away--with no further  delay--than the front pages of newspapers all around the world every  day.   The world is full of serious threats to America, to our allies, and  to our interests. Not the least among them, obviously, is Iran's  insistence on continuing to ratchet up tensions in the Middle East.  Having a Senate-confirmed Secretary of Defense, especially one of this  quality, could not have come a moment too soon.   In closing, when Secretary Esper took his last job, he wrote Army  personnel a letter that laid out three priorities: readiness,  modernization, and reform. Since then, he has played an active role in  this administration's efforts to restore the primacy and lethality of  America's fighting forces, and the success of defense authorizations  and ongoing operations abroad bear his fingerprints.   We are reminded every day that this work continues, and we are  reminded why. My colleagues should be proud to join me today in voting  to advance the Esper nomination and in putting the right man on the  job.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, on this recent Father's Day, Dr. John  [[Page S4962]]  Logan's granddaughter wanted to publicly honor his lifetime of service  and success in western Kentucky. I have had the privilege to call John  a friend for more than three decades, and I enjoyed reading the stories  of his youth, his early medical career, and his many contributions to  his community and our Commonwealth.   Growing up, John's baseball talent was apparent at an early age. In  fact, he was still in middle school when he caught the local high  school coach's attention. As the varsity team's catcher, John quickly  stood out. One sports reporter even called him the best catcher in all  western Kentucky. His skill was matched only by his passion for the  game, even a broken elbow didn't stop him from playing in the 1955  State tournament.   During his senior year of high school, however, John began to hear a  calling to help other people. It was a drive that took him away from  the diamond and into medical school. After graduating from Western  Kentucky University, John earned a rural medical scholarship to study  at Vanderbilt University. His career in medicine began with a  commitment to serve rural Kentucky communities most in need.   As a doctor, John and his new wife Jackie made a home in Sebree, KY,  where his gifts were in high demand. Caring for Kentuckians across  three counties, John quickly honed his skills and provided quality care  to those in need. During his time in this small community, John learned  that a physician must treat more than a patient's body. He began  getting involved in a number of community organizations, and has  dedicated his efforts to projects through the years to make Kentucky a  better place.   Moving to Henderson and opening a private family practice, John also  began working with the Henderson Fine Arts Center, the Depot on the  Riverfront, and the YMCA. He worked to help provide scholarships for  young people to attend college, paying forward the aid he received to  fund his studies years before.   Many of Henderson's landmarks simply wouldn't exist without John's  leadership. One of them, the Henderson Riverwalk, gave me a chance to  join John's team to get the project done. It now bears a plaque  recognizing his lasting imprint on this community. When this honor was  unveiled, I was proud to recognize his life spent working for others.  As he enjoys his well-deserved retirement, John continues to inspire  others to contribute to their communities and improve our beloved  Commonwealth.   I would like to thank Ashton Brooks Logan, John's granddaughter, for  sharing these stories about his many achievements. It is my pleasure to  recognize my dear friend today. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me  in thanking Dr. John Logan for his years of dedication to western  Kentucky, which is better because of him.   The Gleaner in Henderson, KY, recently published a profile of John's  remarkable life. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     [From the Gleaner, June 15, 2019]        John Logan Went From Chasing Home Runs to Making House Calls                          (By Ashton Brooks Logan)         In the summer of 1950, there wasn't much to do in       historical Edmonson County, Kentucky, other than get a few       local kids together and enter a baseball tournament, in       Bowling Green.        ``We didn't have equipment, we didn't have uniforms, and we       didn't have a coach, we just had nine guys,'' Dr. John Logan       said recently.        But John's quick arm attracted the eye of Louis Durbin, the       Brownsville High School's baseball coach, when the team was       short a catcher.        Logan was just in the sixth grade when Coach Durbin gave       him an offer to play on their varsity team in 1951.        ``I started without a mask and I still have the scar under       my left eye to prove it,'' Logan said. Logan's passion for       baseball, paired with an eye for throwing out players who       stole second base, led him to play for the Bowling Green       American Legion team.        Even now, his eyes brighten and cheeks lift with a smile as       he talks about his time on the team. He believes his claim to       fame was the 1955 state tournament when he played three games       with a broken right elbow--without ever letting the fact on       to the other team.        ``I couldn't even warm up the pitcher. I could barely step       in front of the plate and flip it to him,'' he said. ``The       coach and I had a little plan and it was unbelievable, but it       happened.''        To his advantage, his team had already faced its opposition       in the previous year's state tournament and won. He can't       remember how many runners tried to steal second in that first       go-round, but he recalls throwing out every one of them.        Apparently they were still scared of Logan's arm.        ``Now tell me somethin','' the opposing coach said a little       later in the hotel lobby, after Logan's team won the       tournament. ``I don't recall you throwin' a single ball to       second base, you got a problem or something?''        John simply looked at him, smiled and said, ``Well, just a       broken elbow, but other that I'm fine!'        Later that year, a sports reporter wrote in a local paper       that he believed Logan was the best catcher in all of Western       Kentucky.        Logan was at a crossroads. He had a passion to play ball       but a burning drive to help those around him.        Dr. Eugene Farmer, a family physician in Brownsville took       Logan under his wing, allowing him to shadow his work at a       young age. And after transferring to Bowling Green High       School his senior year, Logan buckled down on his studies.        A week following his graduation from BGHS, he was enrolled       in summer school at Western Kentucky University in 1955. He       then went straight through undergraduate, graduating in 1957       and that fall enrolled in medical studies at Vanderbilt       University.        He was on a rural medical scholarship that clearly stated       for every year he attended school, he must spend a year in       rural Kentucky. So he settled in Sebree, Kentucky, the       Webster County hometown of his new wife, Jackie Barnett       Logan, and opened his own practice.        ``I made house calls and took care of three different       counties . . . I admitted patients to hospitals that were 16       miles away on a two-lane road,'' Logan says. ``I must have       aged 15 years in that period of time.''        He recalls times that he had no idea what he was coming up       on.        Remembering a time that a woman called him to a car       accident outside of her house, he describes jumping in his       car and riding to the scene to see a car turned over in a       ditch and hearing a child's cries.        Working his way in the ditch, he immediately saw a child's       leg hanging out of the door and thought to himself, her limb       has been severed.        Finally, after laying the child on the bank and checking       her vitals, he looks at the child's face only to realize it       was his second eldest daughter, Sarah. His initial fears were       unfounded; she walked away that day with nothing more than a       few bruises.        ``Talk about something shocking,'' Logan said. ``We dealt       with things that you never thought would happen.''        After leaving his practice in Sebree in 1967, he and Dr.       Kenneth Eblen formed a partnership to open a private family       practice in Henderson.        In 1986 Logan moved to hospital administration at Methodist       Hospital where he held the position of medical director.        During his time as medical director he started and managed       the intern and resident program among various other duties       until he retired in the spring of 2018.        Dr. Logan still has an passion for playing ball, and those       who also share a love for the sport.        While still practicing medicine in Sebree, he was       approached by a man who was interested in baseball and wanted       to better the current field in the county. Almost 50 years       later and the baseball park is still functioning, seeing       hundreds and hundreds of ball players coming through its       diamonds in the years.        ``I feel strongly that professional people, too many times,       in their own community use the excuse of not helping out in       community organizations because they are too busy,'' Logan       said.        ``(But) these things made an impact. These things made an       impression. These things help people's lives. That is what       you feel good about as well as helping people, physically.''        Logan has been deeply involved in the community of       Henderson through major projects such as the Henderson Fine       Arts Center, the Depot on the Riverfront the Riverwalk, the       YMCA, and the Colonels to College scholarship that ensures       students graduating from Henderson County High School will       get to attend two years of college.        According to Logan, baseball taught him so much more than       how to throw out the runner at second base.        ``One of the biggest things, sugar, is discipline.       Sometimes you go when you feel like you can't go but you've       to do to get job done and baseball, to me was that'' Logan       said.        ``It was a team effort to reach a certain goal and my goal       in life and what I went into medicine for, was to help       people. I've done a lot in the community that has nothing to       do with medicine because it's the same thing. I think       everybody owes something back and that, I think, is a driving       force.''        Dr. Logan is now retired and resides in Henderson with his       wife Jackie. He still serves on various charitable boards and       loves to spend time in his garden when he isn't busy catching       crappie on Barkley Lake.
