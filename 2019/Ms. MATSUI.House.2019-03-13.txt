 Madam Speaker, a year ago we said good-bye to Louise  Slaughter, our dear, dear, friend.   Louise Slaughter was a titan of Congress. She was unforgettable.   When I first joined the Rules Committee after getting elected, I was  immediately drawn to Louise. Louise took me under her wing. She even  made fun of people that I thought were really wonderful, and she  laughed because she knew we shared a joke.   Honestly, Louise was somebody who even made the late hours in the  Rules Committee fun, too, with her wittiness and her intellect and the  fact that, beneath it all, she absolutely loved serving in this  wonderful House.   Louise lived in perfect balance. She was charming, yet intense;  witty, yet resolute.   After spending time with Louise, you knew her heart was with the  people of western New York, and you knew she wasn't going to back down  from her beliefs.   She loved her family. She loved her district as if they were her  family, also. And we loved Louise because she loved everyone and gave  support.   We miss you, Louise.                            ____________________
