 Mr. Speaker, what is the message?   I rise today because I am fighting for Medicare, and I oppose any  attempts to balance the budget on the backs of seniors by privatizing  Medicare.   For over 50 years, Medicare has guaranteed health care to all  Americans 65 years or older and continues to do so for more than 50  million Americans today. Seniors, like my constituent Linda and her  mother, who rely on Medicare for their healthcare needs, do not want  Republicans to dismantle it.   What is the message, Mr. Speaker?   In my home State of Ohio, about 2 million seniors and disabled  individuals, including 1 million women, 260,000 African Americans, are  at risk of losing their Medicare benefits if Republicans privatize it.   Mr. Speaker, I am here to fight for Linda, her mother, for Janet and  Mary and Robert and many other seniors who count on Medicare for their  doctor's visits, their prescription assistance, and many other medical  needs.   Mr. Speaker, what is the message?  [[Page H404]]    We cannot let our seniors down. Democrats will fight to preserve  Medicare to protect our seniors for generations to come.                            ____________________
