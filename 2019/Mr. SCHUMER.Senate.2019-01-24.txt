 Mr. President, President Trump has kept the government  shut down for 34 days, and the pain inflicted on the American people  and their government is getting deeper and deeper every day.   Our economy is suffering. First quarter GDP is in the tank. Consumer  confidence has fallen.   Our national security is suffering. FBI agents attest that criminal  and anti-terrorism investigations are severely constrained. Border  patrol, TSA, and hundreds of thousands of homeland security personnel  are working under limitations. These people are all part of our  security.   President Trump keeps saying that we need the wall for security. Most  people disagree with that, but even if we did agree, it is not going to  be built for years. Our security is suffering today because of the  Trump shutdown. It is so bad that five former DHS Secretaries wrote a  letter to President Trump, urging him to end the shutdown without the  wall, including his former Chief of Staff John Kelly, a loyal soldier  if ever there were one. Kelly knows and they all know that this  shutting down of the government for the President's wall, which most  Americans believe we should not build, is wrong. The President's former  Chief of Staff is telling President Trump that his position on the  shutdown is wrong, that his position on the shutdown is a threat to  national security--I would argue far more than not building a huge,  ineffective wall.   Yesterday, a joint statement from the air traffic controllers,  pilots, and flight attendants unions issued a dire warning: ``In our  risk averse industry, we cannot even calculate the risk currently at  play, nor predict the point at which the system will break.''   Mr. Donald Trump, President, if you cared about security, you would  open the government now. You are the only one standing in the way. We  know most of our Republican colleagues want the government opened. They  are, in a positive way, loyal to you and, in a negative way, afraid to  buck you, but they all know it. Everyone knows it.   Of course, 800,000 Federal workers are on the cusp of missing their  second paycheck--a month's share of pay. Some require the assistance of  food banks to get by. That is so disheartening. Hard-working people who  just want to help their families have a decent life have to go to a  food bank. They did nothing wrong. President Trump is using them as  hostages. Here is how callous this administration is. When asked about  that fact this morning, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, a billionaire,  said ``I know they are, and I don't really quite understand why.'' He  argues that it is easy for furloughed workers to get a loan.   Those comments are appalling and reveal the administration's callous  indifference toward the Federal workers he is treating as pawns.  Secretary Ross's comments are the 21st century equivalent of ``Let them  eat cake.''   Many of these Federal employees live paycheck to paycheck. Secretary  Ross, they can't just call their stockbroker and ask them to sell some  of their shares. They need that paycheck.   We need to end this shutdown now. There is only one way to do it.  This afternoon, for the first time since President Trump shutdown the  government in December, the Senate will have a chance to vote on a bill  that reopens the government.   Leader McConnell says that President Trump's bill is the only way to  reopen the government. Bull. He claims that our bill will not pass  because President Trump will not sign it. Has he ever heard of a veto  override? Has he ever heard of article I?   The bill that President Trump has put together can't pass the House  and can't pass the Senate, so it has no chance of passing. For Leader  McConnell to say the only bill that has a chance of opening up the  government is President Trump's bill--where he puts in a $5.7 billion  wall, undoes many of the asylum provisions, and is broadly unpopular-- is false. It is just wrong.   The two bills that are on the floor are not equivalent votes. My  friend on the other side and some in the media who are being lazy  called the two votes ``dueling proposals,'' as if there is one  Republican proposal and one Democratic proposal and they are sort of  equal. It is just not true.   The President's plan demands 100 percent of what the President  wants--$5.7 billion for a border wall plus radical new changes to our  asylum system before reopening the government. For the Republican  leader to call this a compromise is laughable. There was no Democratic  signoff--not from me, not from Senator Durbin, not from any other  Democrat. It is a harshly partisan proposal that essentially codifies  [[Page S543]]  the President's position that government funding is a bargaining chip.   A vote for the President's plan is an endorsement of government by  extortion. If we let him do it today, he will do it tomorrow and  tomorrow and tomorrow. The whole structure of our government will  change, and the chaos that we now see will be magnified.    Even some of my Republican friends have admitted that the President's  plan is not a serious offer. A few days ago, my friend from Oklahoma  called it ``a straw man proposal.'' I think that says it all. The  President's plan is a straw man, not a serious offer. It is merely a  way to save face.   The second vote is the opposite. It demands nothing before we reopen  the government--nothing. There are no partisan demands, not things we  want or we will shut down the government. We don't do that. Only Trump  does that, and our Republican colleagues go along. Our proposal allows  us to open the government and then, after the government is opened,  settle our differences over border security. I know it is not partisan  because every single Republican supported the same basic idea just 1  month ago when we voted on it. When President Trump changed his mind  and said no, everyone did a sort of 180-degree reversal, including my  friend the Republican leader. He knows it.   So the two votes are not the same. They are not flip sides of the  same coin. The first vote is harshly partisan and one-sided. The second  vote is down the middle and seeks to reopen government and has received  overwhelming support from both sides before President Trump said he  wouldn't do it. Calling the two votes equivalent is not an attempt to  simplify but to mislead.   Nonetheless, in a few hours, we will take these two votes. The Senate  will have a chance to say no to the President's hostage-taking, and  then the Senate will have a chance to send a clear message that  Congress is ready to reopen the government.   To my Republican colleagues, even if you are for the wall--all of  those who have said ``I may be for the wall, but I want to keep the  government open'' have a chance to do it on the second vote. Let's see  how they vote.   Throughout this debacle, I have not heard one good reason why 800,000  Federal employees must be held hostage for us to discuss border  security. Democrats are happy to discuss border security under regular  order with the government open. We support stronger border security.  President Trump believes the best way to do that is an expensive and  ineffective wall. We disagree sharply with that, but there is no reason  we can't negotiate and figure it out. What we can't allow is the  President to hijack our government and hold it hostage every time we  disagree over policy, which he will do if he wins this one.   The votes this afternoon are about more than just a shutdown. They  are about how we govern in a democracy.   We are allowed to come here and disagree over policy. In fact, our  system of government was designed to allow for progress, despite our  large and sometimes raucous differences. But when one side--in this  case, the President--throws a temper tantrum and uses the basic  functioning of our government as leverage in a policy argument, our  system of government breaks down. If every President decided to shut  down the government when they didn't get a policy from Congress,  America would careen from crisis to crisis, an endless spiral of  gridlock and dysfunction.   So the votes this afternoon are not about border security. These  votes are about ending a manufactured crisis, a self-inflicted wound  that is bleeding our country out a little more each day. I hope and I  pray that the Senate rises to the occasion.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, reserving the right to object,  President Trump is responsible not only for thousands of Coast Guard  personnel not getting paid but also for hundreds of thousands of other  Federal employees not getting paid.   Last week, I met with Coast Guard Commandant Schultz, and I told him  to press Secretary Nielsen, who could press the President to stop  holding innocent Federal employees hostage in wall negotiations.   Last month, as we all know, the Senate voted unanimously to keep the  government open into February so all Federal employees would get paid  and the President and Congress could separately negotiate border  security.   Today, the Senate will again have a chance to vote on the same  measure that we passed unanimously in December. I expect that those who  care about getting our Coast Guard paid will support passing H.J. Res.  31, a continuing resolution for the Department of Homeland Security,  and H.R. 648, which are the conference bills for FSGG, Interior,  Environment, Agriculture, T-HUD, SFOPS, and CJS.   Will the Senator from Louisiana modify his request to include the  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of H.J. Res. 648 and H.J. Res. 31 en bloc; that the  measure be considered read a third time and passed en bloc; and that  the motion to reconsider be made and laid upon the table with no action  or debate? That will pay all Federal employees who deserve to be paid.    If the Senator would yield, it is mutual.    If the gentleman will yield, we don't do that in  Brooklyn.    Madam President, I object to the original request  because the Senator from Louisiana has not allowed the rest of the  Federal Government to get paid. I would remind him, whether it is  squirrel, jackrabbit, or armadillo, that we are the article I branch of  government, and because President Trump says no, we have veto override  power, and we could get the workers paid even if he will not sign it.   I object.    Madam President, once again, I would simply remind my  dear friend from Mississippi that we could do a whole lot more good by  funding and opening up the government for everyone. President Trump has  claimed 25 times he wants to shut down the government for his wall, and  he has gotten this Chamber to reverse itself when it had originally  passed funding for the whole government. We could do a lot more good if  my amendment to the proposal by my friend from Louisiana were adopted.  That is how it is.   Now, on a different issue, I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion  to proceed to S. 1.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, in a moment, the Senate will proceed to  two amendments: one on the President's proposal and one on a 2-week  continuing resolution that opens up the government, with disaster  assistance.   Let me be clear: The two votes are not alike. The President's  proposal makes radical changes to our asylum laws and demands that  American taxpayers fund a border wall in exchange for reopening the  government. The second vote demands nothing--no partisan demands, no  ransom. It reopens the government for 2 weeks and provides long overdue  disaster aid, and then it leaves room for us to debate how to best  secure our border.   My Republican friends can fall in line behind the President if they  choose, but it does not have the support of the House or the Senate.  Contrary to what  [[Page S557]]  the Republican leader says, that there is only one bill that will  become law, that is not so. His bill will not pass the Senate and will  not pass the House. It is not the only way for us to make a law.   After the first vote fails, Republicans will have a chance to vote  with us to reopen their government. The second vote determines whether  you want to reopen the government or not. The second vote determines  whether you are willing to reopen the government without taking  hostages, without hurting 800,000 workers, and without hurting America  but open the government with no conditions. We can send that bill to  the President's desk. It has already passed the House.   The President may choose to veto it, just as we may choose to  override that veto. My dear friend from Louisiana missed that point. If  we act with 67 votes, even if the President doesn't like it, it can  pass.   We all know it was the President who threw us into this turmoil when  he changed his mind and opposed a bill to reopen the government without  conditions--just like the one we offered in December and the House  wouldn't go forward with, even though the Senate voted for it  unanimously.   Our bill should not be controversial. Our amendment is nearly the  same bill Republicans all voted for a month ago. It shows that the one  cause of this shutdown is the one person who bragged he wanted it-- President Donald Trump.   Last month, the Senate unanimously passed the short-term bill to keep  the government open. It was Leader McConnell's idea. Everyone thought  the President would support it, but President Trump buckled to the most  extreme voices in his party and reversed his position at the eleventh  hour. That is how the government shutdown began, sadly and  unfortunately. Since then, we tried to negotiate with the  administration to no avail. When the President's deputies made offers,  the President almost immediately retracted them. The President even  rejected an idea by Senator Graham, one of his staunchest allies in the  Senate, to reopen government temporarily while we debate border  security.   Now the President is back with a ``straw man'' proposal, as the  Senator from Oklahoma called it, that makes the same demand he has been  making all along: $5.7 billion taxpayer dollars for a border wall he  promised Mexico would pay for, and it adds a new radical change to our  asylum laws. What the President calls concessions to Democrats are the  protections for DACA and TPS recipients that the President himself  rescinded and have been subsequently protected by the court.   Calling this a reasonable compromise is laughable. It is a starkly  partisan proposal that perfectly encapsulates the President's hostage- taking of the American government. This is what the President could be  saying in this bill: Give me everything I want in exchange for  reopening the government. A vote for the President's plan is very  simply an endorsement of government by extortion. Enough is enough.   I know that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  agree with me. They understand that holding our government workers  hostage for a policy goal is no way to govern. I know they feel that  way. I urge them to vote yes on the second vote.   Supporting our amendment doesn't mean you don't support stronger  border security. To the contrary, it starts funding that effort once  again. Voting for this amendment means you agree with the vast majority  of the American people that the government should open without  precondition. Voting for this amendment means you recognize that  holding millions of Americans hostage is not a way to run our  government. Voting for this amendment means that you believe members of  the Coast Guard, the TSA, the DHS, and the FBI should be paid for their  work protecting our country. Voting for this amendment means you  support our air traffic controllers, food inspectors, and the men and  women who work at our national parks. And yes, voting for this  amendment means that you support border security. It means you support  a way out of this shutdown where we can sit down and rationally hash  out our differences. If we can't do that, if we can't agree today that  the way to solve disagreements over policy is through debate and  consideration in Congress where it belongs, then we are staring down a  very long and very dark tunnel.   Our system of government was designed to allow space for  disagreements, even vociferous ones, but when one side--in this case,  the President--uses the basic functioning of our government as leverage  to extract policy concessions, our entire system of government breaks  down. It is a recipe for gridlock, dysfunction, and paralysis, not only  now but on into the future.   I believe there are men and women of good faith on both sides of the  aisle who want to see this senselessness come to an end today. Let the  Senate come together now. Let the Senate rise to the occasion as it has  done so often in the past. Vote yes on the second amendment. Open the  people's government.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Reserving the right to object, I heard my good friend  from Wisconsin say, give him one good reason to object to the Coast  Guard. No, there is not one; there are 760,000, if that is the right  number--the number of non-Coast Guard workers who are not getting paid.   Similarly here, it will be easy for any Member to get up and pick and  choose and say: Pay these. Pay those. Don't pay these. Don't pay those.   Our position on this side is simple: They should not be held hostage.  They should not say: We are not going to pay you unless we get our way  on the wall--which is exactly what President Trump is doing and exactly  what my colleagues, with some exceptions, have decided to do on that  side of the aisle, including my good friend from Wisconsin. That is not  fair. Everyone deserves to be paid. These are all hard-working people.  They have done nothing wrong. They all get up on Monday morning, even  if they have a fever or something, to go to work because they believe  in what they are doing. They are government workers. To pick and choose  some and not others is the wrong way to go and would lead to a  cacophony. Every one of us could get up and say: Maybe we should, say,  just pay the workers in Brooklyn, NY. It doesn't make any sense at all.   So I would modify my friend's request and expand it to all of our  Federal workers, which is only fair.   Reserving the right to object, would the Senator modify his request  to ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of H.J. Res. 28, which has been received from the House,  making further additional continuing appropriations through February  28; that the joint resolution be considered read a third time and  passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate?    I object to that. I am in the middle of an objection.    Leader McConnell has requested I go to his office. I  think that is more important than some of these activities. I am going  to object.    I object.
