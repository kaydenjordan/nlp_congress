 Madam Speaker, we are failing our youth, and they know  it.   I rise today to share the voices of our children, the voices of those  who attend schools where, once again this week, young lives were lost  to gun violence that Congress refuses to prevent.   My office runs a Congressional Youth Cabinet, a nonpartisan program  that gives high school students the opportunity to learn about our  government and share their views. We meet every couple of months during  the school year, and they select topics for discussion at each meeting.   Last weekend, the topic was gun violence. The next day, six people  were slaughtered in yet another school shooting. Three of them were  only 9 years old.   As I struggled to find words to convey, once again, the urgency that  Congress act, I turned to the students in my youth cabinet. I asked  them what  [[Page H1534]]  they would say if they had the opportunity to address Congress. Here  are their voices, the voices of America's youth.   Claire: ``It is terrifying to see another school shooting on the  news, and even scarier that this is an almost normal thing. As  students, we just want to be safe to learn and grow. . . . I feel, and  I have heard this from a lot of kids, I can't walk down the hall  without looking for a safe place to hide in case something happens. It  really messes with your head.''   Zeyan: ``Gun violence feels normalized and ingrained. My school had a  lockdown drill today, yet afterward, we went on with our day like the  need for a lockdown drill is trivial and not disturbing. I hope  legislators understand how drastically gun violence can alter students'  daily lives and thoughts.''   Tyler: ``It is really hard to stay optimistic as a young person when  we see these tragedies again and again.''   Lindsay: ``All those kids did today was go to school on a beautiful  Monday morning. But instead of making paper cutouts of Easter bunnies  or painting eggs, they were shot and murdered. [That] school is a  private Christian school. Prayer takes place in every single one of  those classrooms, including where third graders were shot to death.  Prayers did not stop our children [from being slaughtered with] guns. A  lock on the door did not stop the killer from coming in. Legislators .  . . can stop this.''    Several observed that easy access to guns is a major driver of school  shootings.   Kiona said: ``These situations happen so frequently, it makes me  question how easy it is to get a firearm or assault weapon in this  country. We could have prevented more of these situations.''   Quin: ``For me, gun violence is personal. Lives like ours are on the  line. On the news, time and time again, I see my own communities  attacked, from the Lunar New Year Monterey Park mass shooting to the  Club Q nightclub shooting. Our schools are not safe. It is clear that  gun violence targets vulnerable people of color and LGBTQ+ people. . .  . Guns are the leading cause of death among children and teens.''   Noah: ``We need to stop treating shootings like isolated events and  think of them as part of a whole. It wasn't just one person with a gun  today in Nashville or in Colorado Springs or in Uvalde. It was a web of  corporate greed, insufficient legislation, and hatred.''   Eliot: ``I am a senior in high school, and I have been directly  affected by four separate instances of gun violence in the past year. I  was in lockdown . . . during the Highland Park shooting . . . at the  same time my close friend was hiding in a church [during an active  shooter situation] at a concert. . . . Our school recently lost a  classmate to gun violence, and we had a lockdown because of a threat of  a shooting. . . . The lack of action is alienating my generation. We  are supposed to be the `future of our democracy.' Our experiences of  gun violence are more common than instances of legislative progress. We  are told we are supposed to save democracy, to save the planet, but no  one is saving us, and we notice that.''   This last line really sticks with me. Our kids are being asked to put  our democracy and our collective future first, but their country and  their Representatives in Congress are not putting them first.   It breaks my heart to hear the fear, anger, cynicism, and  hopelessness in our children's voices. We are failing our youth, and  they know it.   Doing nothing is unacceptable. If you don't have any solutions, then  you need to get out of their way.   Our kids deserve action now.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 1,  and I urge my colleagues to vote against this dangerous and  irresponsible bill.   With extreme weather events becoming more and more frequent, and  climate change impacting our communities, agriculture, homes, and even  our national security, we need to work together to advance climate  rescue measures that move the U.S. away from fossil fuel dependence,  protect workers and communities, and strengthen environmental  protections, all while reducing costs to the American people.   This can't happen overnight, but instead of building upon the  historic, deficit-reducing provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act,  Republicans are trying to roll back that historic bill, and in the  process they are putting polluters over people and the planet.   H.R. 1 restricts community input by gutting NEPA. It forces the sell- off of public lands and undermines the health of all Americans by  compromising air and water quality, all while adding billions to our  national debt.   Of particular interest in my district is that this bill would block  the EPA from requiring refineries to study alternatives to the use of  hydrofluoric acid--or HF--in fossil fuel processing. HF has the  potential to form a poisonous, killing aerosol cloud which can travel  for miles if it is released.   There have been dozens of accidents involving HF in recent years,  including a devastating 2019 explosion and fire at a refinery in my  district. That explosion put U.S. steelworkers and tens of thousands of  nearby residents at serious risk of death and serious harm. An  inspection found that the refinery lacked adequate inspection and  safety protocols to prevent a catastrophe. Essentially, it was a  miracle that no one died that night.   To safeguard against future accidents, I offered a commonsense  amendment to this bill that would require refineries with a history of  accidents or Clean Air Act violations to study alternatives to HF, but  my Republican colleagues refused to allow the amendment.   This refusal to consider past disasters to create necessary safety  standards tells us exactly what this bill is about: empowering the  fossil fuel industry at the expense of worker and community safety.   Again, I urge my colleagues to vote against this reckless bill.
