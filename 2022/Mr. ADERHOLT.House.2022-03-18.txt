 Madam Speaker, I rise this morning to recognize the six  teams from Alabama's Fourth Congressional District who recently won  State titles in high school basketball. There were a total of 14 that  were up for grabs, and schools from the Fourth Congressional District,  which I have the privilege to represent, won almost half of them.   In the girls finals, Marion County High, located in Guin and coached  by Scott Veal, won the State title 1A.   Deshler High School, located in Tuscumbia and coached by Jana Killen,  won the State 4A title.   And Guntersville High School, located in Guntersville and coached by  Kenny Hill, won the State 5A championship.   Over on the boys' side, Covenant, located in Tuscumbia and coached by  Bret Waldrep, won the 1A title.   Plainview High School, located in Rainsville and coached by Robi  Coker, won the State 3A championship.   And Cullman High School, located in Cullman and coached by Stu  Stuedeman won the State 6A title.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate all of these teams, all their schools,  and all their communities.                            ____________________
