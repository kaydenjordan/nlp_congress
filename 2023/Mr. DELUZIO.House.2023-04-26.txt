 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule to advance  this bill. I am opposed to the bill.   This bill includes massive cuts to veterans' care, 30 million fewer  medical visits for my fellow veterans. We are going to see my fellow  veterans wait longer to have their claims heard. They are going to see  telehealth get worse, mental health services get worse, and  homelessness issues get worse. This bill is a betrayal of the  obligation this country has to everyone who served.   I have seen my fellow veterans used as props on folks' websites and  in their ads, people wrap themselves in the flag.   Guess what? You don't get to claim you are here for veterans,  standing up for veterans when you cut their care. That is what this  bill does. It is a disgrace. Everyone in the country ought to know it.  We ought to vote it down.
