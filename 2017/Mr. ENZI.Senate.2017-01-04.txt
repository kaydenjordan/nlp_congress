 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess until 2:15 p.m. for the weekly policy lunches.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 1:21 p.m., recessed until  2:15 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer  (Mr. Rounds).                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be  equally divided between the two sides during quorum calls.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the  duration of the Senate's consideration of S. Con.  [[Page S32]]  Res. 3, the majority and Democratic managers of the concurrent  resolution, while seated or standing at the managers' desks, be  permitted to deliver floor remarks, retrieve, review, and edit  documents, and send email and other data communications from text  displayed on wireless personal digital assistant devices and tablet  devices.    I further ask unanimous consent that the use of calculators  be permitted on the floor during consideration of the budget  resolution.    Mr. President, today we have a new Congress. Soon we will  have a new President. For the first time in years, hardworking  Americans will have their voices heard as we take the first steps to  repair the Nation's broken health care system--steps to remove  Washington from the equation and to put control back where it belongs-- with the patients, their families, and their doctors.   The President's health law has pushed insurance markets to the brink  of collapse. Premiums for hardworking families are soaring, while  patients' choices are dwindling. I urge my friends on the other side of  the aisle to face the facts that ObamaCare has failed to deliver on its  core promises and is hurting far more than it is helping.   I know our colleagues on the other side of the aisle share our goal  of a robust health care system for hardworking families, and I truly  hope they will work with us to find common ground that delivers more  choices and lowers costs. I welcome the input from all the Nation's  lawmakers as we endeavor to listen to the American people in this  pursuit. But first, it is important to remember how we got here so that  the actions that we will be taking this year are considered in proper  context.   After the 2008 election, Democrats controlled the Presidency and had  a majority in the House and a supermajority in the Senate. This allowed  Senate Democrats in 2009 to pass a health care plan without any  Republican support, which is exactly what they did. House Democrats had  initially approved a health care reform bill with several important  differences. So congressional Democrats needed to address these  concerns in a conference committee. But plans to iron out the  differences between the House and Senate versions were derailed in  early 2010, when Democrats lost their filibuster-proof majority with  the Massachusetts special election that resulted in placing Senator  Scott Brown in the seat formerly held by the late Senator Ted Kennedy.  He had held that seat since 1962.   With the filibuster-proof majority lost, Democrats in the House  approved the Senate-passed health care bill without any Republican  votes and sent it to the President, while vowing to use the budget  reconciliation process to address their colleagues' concerns with the  Senate legislation.   Subsequent budget reconciliation legislation was passed by Democrats  and signed into law by President Obama. Combined with the initial  health care bill, ObamaCare was created.   Now, I share this brief history of ObamaCare only as a reminder that,  while my colleagues will surely complain about using the reconciliation  process to untangle the country from this unworkable, unpopular, and  unaffordable law, they should remember they actually employed the exact  same procedure to secure the passage of ObamaCare.   Recent headlines show the ObamaCare problem is only getting worse and  discourages people from seeking so-called coverage. Last October, at  Bloomberg's The Year Ahead Summit in New York, the CEO of Aetna  discussed the issues surrounding their decision not to participate in  ObamaCare exchanges, saying:         As the rates rise, the healthier people pull out because       the out-of-pocket costs aren't worth it. . . . Young people       can do the math. Gas for the car, beer on Fridays and       Saturdays, health insurance.    Now, if you are young and healthy, ObamaCare has made it an easy  choice to opt out of health coverage. But if you are not so fortunate-- for those who must have coverage--it quickly becomes a frightening  reality. I have constituents in Wyoming who have written to me, with  worry and concern about their surging health insurance premiums. I  recently heard from a young woman who is experiencing the worst of this  law. She said:         Dear Senator Enzi,        I am writing with concerns specifically in the way that our       country is heading in respect to healthcare services.        I am a 25 year old with no medical conditions, I rarely       need a doctor visit, however as I looked into the health       insurance for me and my 8 month old son, also without health       problems, I have found insurance to be incredibly expensive.       Based on the cost of our health care last year, which       included a C-section and the birth of our son, our family       would spend less on health care if we paid for medical       expenses out of pocket and did not have health insurance.       However, in order to obey the law this is not an option.        I have researched and calculated the most cost effective       health care option for our family. We are looking at paying       almost $800 a month for our insurance, even with my husband       receiving insurance through work. This is almost 1/3 of our       family's monthly income. . . . Insurance is becoming a huge       burden for our family.    Now, that is the reality for many of our constituents across the  country. She is trying to do the right thing for her family's health,  but the law is crippling them financially. Our answer must be to not  ignore these problems. For many Americans caught up in ObamaCare's  tangled and expensive web of regulations, the situation is grim and  only getting worse by the day. It is time to act.    One of the most disturbing parts of this law is that Americans are  now paying more in taxes to pay for the very health law that is driving  up their insurance premiums. The law will saddle American households  with $1 trillion--$1 trillion--in new taxes and penalties over the next  10 years, unless Congress acts. ObamaCare's crushing regulations mean  smaller paychecks for families, while holding back small businesses  from expanding and hiring new workers. For every American, ObamaCare  has meant more government, more bureaucracy, and more rules and  regulations, along with soaring health care costs--along with soaring  health care costs.   It is time to lift the burdens and higher costs this law has placed  on all Americans. The Senate is poised to pass a repeal resolution that  will set the stage for true legislative relief from ObamaCare that  Americans have long demanded, while ensuring a stable transition in  which those with insurance will not lose access to health care  coverage.   Let me repeat that. The Senate is poised to pass a repeal resolution  that will set the stage for true legislative relief from ObamaCare that  Americans have long demanded, while ensuring a stable transition in  which those with insurance will not lose access to health care  coverage. This will allow us to move step-by-step on a new set of  reforms, listening carefully to the advice of the millions of Americans  affected and to do our best to make sure that we proceed wisely and do  no harm.   Fortunately, America now has a President committed to repealing  ObamaCare and moving toward a system that offers more choices, lower  costs, and more individual control for millions of hardworking  Americans.   The American people have endured a lot under ObamaCare and its broken  promises. As a Presidential candidate not so long ago, then-Senator  Barack Obama, a Democrat from Illinois serving here, promised Americans  they could keep their health plan if they liked it. Millions soon  learned they couldn't, and others soon wouldn't. This is because  ObamaCare has drastically reduced Americans' choice of health care  plans through a Federal takeover of the insurance marketplace. In fact,  the President's promise that ``if you like your plan, you can keep it''  has proven to be one of many unfulfilled and unattainable promises of  ObamaCare.   In Wyoming, we have seen the real impact of ObamaCare on our health  insurance market. Wyoming now only has one health insurer in the  individual market, both on and off the ObamaCare exchange. Many States  are experiencing a similar issue of having insurers leaving the  exchanges entirely. So for Wyomingites, the Obama administration's  talking points about ``choice'' were in the end just more empty  promises.  [[Page S33]]    Americans were also promised lower health care costs, but even the  administration admits that ObamaCare is failing to address costs, with  average premiums rising by 25 percent for silver-level plans on the  Federal exchange. That is in 1 year. This means that families have to  decide whether to purchase unaffordable insurance or to pay a fine. In  most cases, they are literally paying more money for less control over  their health care.   Health care costs in Wyoming continue to be among the highest in the  Nation, with other States not far behind. ObamaCare's mandates and  taxes on employer-sponsored health plans are not only leading to higher  out-of-pocket expenses but also to fewer choices and fewer services for  the 150 million Americans with employer-sponsored health benefits. Let  me repeat that: The mandates and taxes on employer-sponsored health  plans are not only leading to higher out-of-pocket expenses but to  fewer choices and services for the 150 million Americans with employer- sponsored health benefits.   According to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, individual  employees who have job-based insurance have seen their out-of-pocket  expenses climb by hundreds of dollars year after year. Employees  working for small businesses now have deductibles of over $1,800 on  average. Since ObamaCare became law, several large employers have  stopped offering benefits to part-time employees altogether.    Over the past 50 years, our Nation has made great strides in  improving the quality of life for all Americans, but these  transformative changes are always forged in the spirit of bipartisan  compromise and cooperation. These qualities are essential to the  success and longevity of crucial programs such as Medicare and  Medicaid.   This is a crucial time for health care in America. We do not have the  luxury of ignoring the growing problems in the health insurance markets  and the crushing premiums faced by families across our country. That is  why we are doing this first. The failures of ObamaCare have  metastasized since its passage.   We must act now to repeal ObamaCare and provide relief to the  millions of Americans who have been harmed by this law. Relief will  require a stable transition period, which ensures those with coverage  today continue to have access to health care tomorrow. Unwinding this  tangle of partisan gridlock to make meaningful changes will not be  easy. Our goal is to create a health care system where Washington makes  fewer decisions and families are empowered to control their own health  care with more choices and lower costs.   This is where we find ourselves today. Congress and soon the new  President will be in a position to begin the process of repealing  ObamaCare. Passing this resolution is just the first step on a path to  repair health care for millions of hard-working Americans whose  experiences with ObamaCare have meant broken promises, higher costs,  and fewer choices.   This is the budget resolution we are debating now. As far as the  budget part of it, all this is, is a statement of where we are at the  moment. This budget went into effect last October. It has been changed  a few times in the meantime, and this is a reflection of the changes  that have been made up to this point.   The difference is in title II, which is where the reconciliation can  take place. You will notice that it is a very simple title. There is  not much to it. It requires that the Committee on Finance of the Senate  shall report changes in laws within its jurisdiction to reduce the  deficit by not less than $1 billion for the period of fiscal years 2017  through 2026. The Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  will report changes in laws within its jurisdiction to reduce the  deficit by not less than $1 billion for the period of fiscal years 2017  through 2026. There is no specificity in this as to how the  reconciliation will take place. That is up to the Finance Committee and  the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on the Senate side  and the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Committee on Ways and  Means on the House side to come up with the reconciliation bill, which  has to pass a lot of Senate rules in order to be done, but you will  notice that there isn't any specificity in here on how to do that.   That comes later. That will be another budget debate we will have,  but it sets the stage so that can be done. Hopefully, it will be done  quickly and we will be able to find solutions for the hard-working  Americans whose experiences with ObamaCare are broken promises, higher  costs, fewer choices. I hope our Democratic colleagues will join us in  this effort so that we can come up with solutions so that Americans can  afford the insurance they want and need.   I remember when we started this debate, I think there were 30 million  people uninsured. Today, I think there are 30 million people uninsured.  It is a different 30 million, though: The 30 million who couldn't get  insurance now have insurance, and 30 million people who had insurance  now can't afford their insurance. It is time for us to take care of  both 30 millions and not just one. We will have that opportunity if we  pass this concurrent resolution to fix ObamaCare.   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask  unanimous consent that the time be divided equally.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time in the  quorum call be equally divided between both sides.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Tara Shaw and  Matt Giroux from my staff be given all-access floor passes to the  Senate floor during consideration of the budget resolution, S. Con.  Res. 3.
