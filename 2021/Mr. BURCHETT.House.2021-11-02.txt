 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Pastor Gerald McGinnis as  Tennessee's Second District Veteran of the Month.   Pastor McGinnis, a very dear friend of mine, served our country as a  specialist in the United States Army during the Vietnam war. In 1968,  his compound was attacked by approximately 1,500 North Vietnamese Army  soldiers in the middle of the night. Despite the intense enemy fire, he  fought off the North Vietnamese in defense of the three wounded  American soldiers sheltering in his bunker.   Relentlessly defending that bunker saved Pastor McGinnis' life and  all the lives of his fellow servicemembers. He was successful against  all odds. Nearly 40 years later, he was awarded the Bronze Star for his  heroism. Last week, Pastor McGinnis was upgraded to the Silver Star in  further recognition of his bravery.   Following his military service, Pastor McGinnis worked as a sheet  metal worker for several years. He later decided that serving the Lord  was his true calling and began studying theology. In 1980, he founded  Park West Church of God in Knoxville, where he continues to serve.   Under Pastor McGinnis' leadership, the church has grown to serve a  membership of over 2,000 Christians. He also served as chaplain of the  Knoxville-based divisions of the FBI and ATF, as well as the Knox  County Sheriff's Department.   Pastor McGinnis serves his fellow veterans every chance he gets. A  few years ago, he started raising funds to purchase a farm where  veterans could go to receive counseling and study the Bible to help  cope with their PTSD.   Thank you, Gerald, for your service to our country, your fellow  veterans, and the Lord. I would say on a personal note, I was at the  service and my dear friend, Jenny Stansberry in my home office, helped  him get that Silver Star. All he talked about was his buddies that he  left behind. He is a true hero, Mr. Speaker.                            ____________________
