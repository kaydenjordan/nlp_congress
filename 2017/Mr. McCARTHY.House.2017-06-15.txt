 Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a resolution and ask  unanimous consent for its immediate consideration in the House and,  further, ask unanimous consent that it be read in full.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his comments.   Yesterday was a long and emotional day for the people in this House.  A cowardly act of violence was directed at our friends, our colleagues,  and our democracy.   We are currently praying for all those injured and their families-- Matt Mika, Zack Barth, Special Agent Crystal Griner, Special Agent  David Bailey, and Majority Whip Steve Scalise. These individuals are  strong and, as you said, they are fighters, and they should know that  they have the full love and support of this House.   But, Mr. Speaker, even in the face of this great evil, we saw amazing  bravery yesterday. Special Agents Griner and Bailey put their lives on  the line. They saved countless others. There is no other way to put it,  but they are heroes. Yesterday could have ended with many deaths. They  ran out in order to draw the fire away from the Members.   This attacker moved down the third baseline to home base, where the  majority of the players had been sitting in the dugout of first base,  lying on the ground, and even a 10-year-old son, whom they would hover  over on top of. He tried to make his movement there. Crystal had  already been wounded.   But as I talked to the agents yesterday in the hospital, they said  that they wished they could have even done more, having drawn the fire  away and saving so many lives. We will be forever grateful for their  courageous actions and those of all of our Capitol Police, who are  truly the best in the business. As we end this week, I do want to take  the time to thank our men and women in uniform and keep them all in our  prayers for their recovery.   Yesterday I spent a large portion of the day at the hospital, yes,  seeing the agents and seeing and praying for our majority whip. I have  known Steve Scalise for more than 20 years. Before either of us were  ever elected to any office, we got involved in politics in Young  Republicans. I was the national chairman, and he was the State chair of  Louisiana. We developed a friendship, a camaraderie, and a passion for  making the country better.   I know what Jennifer and the kids are going through, but our prayers  are with them, and he will definitely come back and play in that  baseball game.   So, Mr. Speaker, before I move on with the schedule for next week,  because of everything that happened yesterday, I missed doing something  important as well. I want to wish my friend, Mr. Hoyer, a belated happy  birthday. I hope my friend enjoyed a nice slice of his favorite desert:  pineapple upside-down cake. I do want it noted that, even on his  birthday, he took the time to make sure the staff of Steve Scalise had  something to eat, and they appreciated that greatly. They appreciated  his visit.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House. On  Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for  legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30.                                time  1400    On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning  hour and noon for legislative business.   On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.  Last votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m.   Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business  tomorrow.   One suspension worth highlighting is H.R. 2353, the Strengthening  Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, sponsored by  our own Representative Glenn Thompson. You may know him, Mr. Speaker.   This bill would expand experience-based learning opportunities and  support greater collaboration between schools and employers.   Mr. Speaker, 65 percent of today's grade school kids will work in a  job that is yet to be invented. It is vital we provide our students  with the skills necessary to succeed in an ever-evolving workplace, and  that is exactly what this bill aims to do.   Along those same lines, the House will consider H.R. 2842, the  Accelerating Individuals into the Workforce Act, sponsored by  Representative Carlos Curbelo. Under this bill, employers would partner  with State and local agencies in an effort to hire TANF recipients and  provide them with on-the-job training.   There is no substitute for a good job, and, by passing this bill, the  House will take a positive step toward getting more Americans back to  work.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, the House will consider two bills from the  Natural Resources Committee. First, H.R. 1873, the Electricity  Reliability and Forest Protection Act, sponsored by Doug LaMalfa. This  bipartisan legislation would streamline the process for removing  hazardous trees, helping to lower the risk of forest fires, while  ensuring a reliable electrical infrastructure.   And second, H.R. 1654, the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act,  sponsored by Representative Tom McClintock. This bill provides the  framework for creating a one-stop-shop permitting agency, ensuring the  vital water storage projects that are so badly needed are not delayed  by red tape.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Doggett) may be recognized on the legislative day of  Wednesday, June 21, 2017, to offer the resolution that he noticed on  Tuesday, June 13, 2017, without further notice under clause 2(a)(1) of  rule IX.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow; and  further, when the House adjourns on that day, it adjourn to meet on  Tuesday, June 20, 2017, when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour  debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business.
