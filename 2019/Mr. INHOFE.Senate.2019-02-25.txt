 Mr. President, I would like to offer my congratulations  to Tom Fontana, special assistant to the CEO for the U.S. Capitol  Visitor Center, CVC, on his retirement after 30 years of Federal  service.   Tom began his career at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1988. He  was responsible for communications for one of the Corps' largest  projects, the renovation of the Pentagon in the 1990s. He eventually  joined the U.S. Department of Defense, where he continued working to  successfully completing the project. Tom was at the Pentagon on  September 11, 2001, when a plane hijacked by terrorist crashed into the  building.   While Tom had just accepted a position with the Architect of the  Capitol, AOC, to manage communications for the construction phase of  the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center, due to the tragedy, he remained in his  position at the Pentagon to lend assistance before assuming his role  with the CVC in 2001.  [[Page S1435]]  Throughout the construction of the CVC, Tom provided countless tours  and briefings to Members of Congress, including leadership and their  staff. Given his depth of knowledge, responsiveness, and evenhandedness  through that challenging time, Tom earned great respect from the  Members of Congress and the media in Washington.   In 2008, Tom subsequently assumed the role of director of  communications and marketing for the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center. Under  Tom's leadership, the CVC communications division expanded from  providing the basics of a startup operation, to providing a wide range  of communications to help visitors learn about the Capitol and workings  of Congress. He has always looked for ways to take advantage of new  technologies to engage visitors, students in particular, about  Congress's history. Under his leadership, the first AOC apps were  developed, and one of them received a national award for its  innovation.   For many Members of Congress, dignitaries, AOC, and CVC staff, Tom is  the authoritative voice on the Capitol Visitor Center. He is widely  respected for his unique knowledge about the Capitol building and  grounds. From presenting inspiring tours to engaging visitors who are  simply seeking directions, he personifies an experience all visitors  expect when they come to the U.S. Capitol. Tom is an ambassador for the  CVC, the Capitol, and Congress without equal.   Tom has also been an incredible asset to me and my office throughout  his leadership at the CVC. Every year, I host a unique dinner on  Capitol Hill for governmental leaders from all over the continent of  Africa, including heads of state, legislators, and cabinet members.  Ambassadors and guests who are key leaders in Africa also attend, along  with several U.S. legislators. Prior to the dinner, we provide the  guests with a tour of the Capitol to learn more about our Capitol  building and the workings of Congress. Throughout all of the years I  have held the tour and dinner, Tom has gone above and beyond what was  required to make our guests feel welcome and to ensure that everything  runs smoothly. His role in the success of our event has become so  essential that, several years ago, we began inviting Tom to the dinner  not only to support it, but to take part in it.   Tom leaves big shoes to fill. My Senate colleagues and I appreciate  Tom's hard work and commitment to our Capitol and country. He will be  missed, but I wish him all the best in his retirement.                            ____________________
