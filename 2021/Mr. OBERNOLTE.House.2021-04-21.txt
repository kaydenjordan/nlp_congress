 Madam Speaker, infrastructure is a bipartisan issue.  We all agree that one of the primary functions of government is to  provide for the people collectively what they are unable to  individually provide for themselves. I am talking about things like  highways and roads and dams and harbors and airports. Things that  represent long-term investments in the future of our country.   Unfortunately, the infrastructure package we are currently  considering only devotes 12 percent of the over $2 trillion of spending  to infrastructure projects like those.   To give you some egregious examples, the proposed infrastructure  package devotes substantially more money to subsidizing the purchase of  electric vehicles than it does to building the roads and the highways  that those vehicles would drive on.   The proposed infrastructure package devotes over ten times as much  money to expansion of Medicaid than it does to the construction of  water infrastructure, of dams and of airports put together.   It is not to say that these other projects are without merit, but the  problem is that almost every dollar of this spending contributes to our  national debt. That means that we need to consider only the projects  that represent a true, long-term investment in our country.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  pare this package down to the projects that accomplish exactly that.
