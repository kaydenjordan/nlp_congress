 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairwoman for  yielding and for all that she is doing to end the Trump shutdown and  open up our government, but I rise today to engage in a colloquy with  the distinguished chairwoman of the Homeland Security Appropriations  Subcommittee, Congresswoman Roybal-Allard, in regard to a commitment  made between the two of us.   My district and the State of California were, once again, ravaged by  devastating and historic fires. In my own district, the Mendocino  complex fire burned a combined total of 460,000 acres, making it the  largest physical fire in California history. As a result, a  [[Page H637]]  major disaster declaration was announced for Lake County, which, sadly,  has been rocked with fires for the past several years.   California also experienced the deadliest and most destructive fire  in our State's history with the Camp fire, which, tragically, took the  lives of more than 60 people. The town of Paradise, which was home to  almost 27,000 people, was near completely destroyed, and more than  12,000 structures were burnt to the ground.   In addition, our State experienced other devastating fires, and they  continue. We need the continued support from the Federal Government  because it is essential as residents seek to rebuild and California  begins long-term recovery.   In response to these devastating disasters, I offered a bipartisan  amendment with Representatives LaMalfa, Lieu, Calvert, Garamendi,  Huffman, and 19 other bipartisan cosponsors from our State. This  amendment provided much-needed relief to the State of California and  local entities by increasing to 90 percent the Federal cost-share for  debris removal and emergency assistance for the 2018 wildfires.   The substance of this amendment has been supported by both the  Speaker and the majority leader and is consistent with the relief  generously provided in the 113th Congress.                                time  1500    The distinguished chairwoman and I have discussed this amendment and  the importance of Congress providing this much-needed relief to the  State of California and all affected communities impacted by these  wildfires.    Mr. Chair, I thank the chairwoman and the  bipartisan coauthors of this bill. I look forward to working with her  and appreciate her help.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself as much time  as I may consume.   I appreciate the opportunity to speak in support of my proposed  amendment.   Over the past 2 years communities across my district and throughout  the State of California have been devastated by some of the biggest,  deadliest, and most damaging wildfires in history. These disasters have  catastrophic consequences for our agricultural communities.   Wildfires can and do incinerate entire fields of crops, but they also  pose a threat of smoke contamination, exposure to high levels of smoke  which damages crops beyond repair.   While smoke damage can affect a range of crops, wine grapes are  particularly vulnerable. I have heard from dozens of my constituents  who are facing the loss of their crop as their grapes are rejected due  to this smoke damage.   I want to thank the Appropriations Committee and their staff for  working with me to ensure that grape growers like those in my district  are supported.   However, many wine grape growers do not discover smoke damage until  after removing their fruit from the vine. These growers sustain heavy  losses and deserve support. They should not be penalized simply because  the damage to their grapes was discovered after the harvest.   My amendment would clarify that assistance offered under H.R. 268 is  available to growers who discover smoke damage after removing their  grapes from the vine. This situation is tragic and far too common, and  this clarification is needed to ensure that growers like those in my  district receive the support that they deserve.   Madam Chair, I want to reiterate my thanks to the Appropriations  Committee and their staff, and I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself as much time  as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of amendment No. 8, which provides an  additional $50 million in community development funds for the 2017  federally declared disasters.   In October 2017, my district experienced, at that time, the most  devastating fires in the history of California. The October 2017  wildfires devastated nearly 300,000 acres in California, destroyed some  7,000 homes, caused billions of dollars in damage, burned to the ground  many businesses, and, most sadly, took the lives of 44 people.   In response to these fires, Congress enacted legislation that  delivered California Community Development Block Grant disaster relief  funding to address unmet needs and mitigation against future disasters.   As communities in my district continue the long and hard process of  rebuilding, we are finding that the unmet needs are greater than the  Federal relief provided. Local inspections of residences damaged or  destroyed in the October 17 fires indicate that FEMA's individual  assistance inspection process significantly underestimated the number  of homes damaged or destroyed in Santa Rosa, one of the cities in my  district, by a difference of nearly 2,900 homes.   Because the FEMA IA data may have informed HUD's initial allocation  to the State of California, this leaves some communities in California,  including Santa Rosa, with considerable unmet need for homeowners who  are rebuilding.   In terms of public infrastructure, California's CDBG-DR action plan  allocates 3 percent, at a total of $3.5 million for the entire State,  to aid unmet need for public infrastructure. However, Santa Rosa alone  has significantly greater needs for recovery of public infrastructure  with its projected local cost share for the repair of the damage  infrastructure over $11 million.   In addition to the local match requirement for FEMA public assistance  projects, there are several large infrastructure projects needed due to  the 17 wildfires, including street repairs, street tree removal, repair  to the sidewalks in one particular area, and restoration to  neighborhood parks.   The estimated cost for these projects is more than $20 million. My  amendment aims to help close this gap by providing the additional  moneys in community development funds for the 2017 federally declared  disasters.   Continued support from the Federal Government is essential as  residents seek to rebuild and my district continues its long-term  recovery.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to my colleague from California (Mrs.  Torres).    Madam Chair, I yield the remainder of my  time to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price), the chair of the  subcommittee, and I thank him for all of his help.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of  my time.
