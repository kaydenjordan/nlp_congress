 Madam Speaker, I think all of us Members of  Congress can agree on one thing; that one of the greatest joys of being  a Member is knowing the great men and women who work for us day in and  day out. These men and women also dedicate their lives to serving  others and serving our country.   Today, I honor one such man, my former chief of staff, Brandon Cox,  who as of Friday will be moving on to bigger and better challenges.   I first met Brandon 8 years ago as a staffer for my campaign, and I  saw a confident young man who knew politics better than anyone, worked  harder than anyone, had a memory for details  [[Page H991]]  that is unmatched, and who demanded excellence from himself and others.   Brandon has been an accomplished manager, first of my campaign and  for the last 4 years, of my entire congressional staff.   When you are elected as a freshman, you are often advised to not hire  your campaign manager as your chief, but I did not listen, thankfully.   I knew I needed someone who knew Nevada's Third Congressional  District, who always had my back, who knew me, and knew how to get  things done. My office was better for it, but most importantly, my  constituents were better for it.   Brandon, it has been a good run. Wishing you all the best.                            ____________________
