 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this cruel  resolution that will force low- and middle-income student loan  borrowers to face severe financial hardship.   In a reckless reversal of the payment pause, this measure sends an  average of $1,000 in surprise student loan bills to over 40 million  Americans. This absurd  [[Page H2567]]  approach to block President Biden's student debt relief plan hurts  those who are most at risk.   Older Americans owe a fifth of all student debt. Their debt has  increased fivefold in the last 20 years. Black Americans owe an average  of $44,800 in student debt. Over 6 million Americans living in rural  areas owe an average of $35,000. Reversals to the Public Service Loan  Forgiveness would put 260,000 public servants and 46,000 servicemembers  back under the thumb of these crushing payments.   Those who receive that Public Service Loan Forgiveness have played by  the rules for years and sacrificed too much to have partisan efforts  steal relief that they were already given and counting on.   Our job is to protect working people, and that should mean ensuring  that no one goes into unpayable debt just to get a degree to pursue  their dreams. This Republican plan would increase the likelihood of  defaulting for teachers, for law enforcement, for public servants  across the board, and it would be a drop in the bucket toward actually  addressing the deficit.   Yet Republicans took $1.9 trillion from taxpayers and handed it to  corporations in tax cuts, and dozens of them have absolutely no qualms  in pocketing over $22 million in PPP forgiveness just in this body  across the aisle.   Congress should be prioritizing aid to seniors and borrowers from  working families, not the wealthy. Vote ``no'' on this extreme,  unworkable, and cruel resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter signed by over 260  organizations, including labor, civil rights, and consumer protection  groups calling on Congress to reject this harmful resolution.                                                        May 8, 2023.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Hakeem Jeffries,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Leader Schumer, Minority Leader McConnell, Speaker       McCarthy, and Minority Leader Jeffries: The undersigned 261       organizations representing millions of students, workers,       people of color, veterans, people with disabilities,       consumers, and people of faith write in strong opposition to       bicameral efforts to use the Congressional Review Act (CRA)       to overturn President Biden's actions to pause student loan       payments and provide student debt relief for low-income and       working-class Americans continuing to recover from the deadly       COVID-19 pandemic and its devastating economic fallout.        In March, policymakers in the House and Senate unveiled a       CRA resolution to retroactively overturn the pause of federal       student loan payments and interest accrual, and President       Biden's debt relief plan. If successful, these CRA efforts       would immediately force tens of millions of borrowers into       abrupt and unplanned repayment with devastating effects,       including adding thousands of dollars of payments and       interest onto their loan balances. It will also force the       Department of Education to unwind loans forgiven under Public       Service Loan Forgiveness for first responders, nurses,       educators, servicemembers, and hundreds of thousands of other       public service workers across the country. These actions are       a clear attack on millions of the most vulnerable workers and       families who are still reeling from the devastating impact of       COVID-19.        The President's student debt relief program and extension       of the pause on student loan payments are both plainly legal       and desperately needed by the more than 43 million borrowers       drowning in nearly $1.76 trillion in student loan debt. While       they await the Supreme Court's decision regarding the fate of       debt relief, tens of millions of borrowers and their families       are relying on the federal student loan payment pause as they       continue to face the economic aftershocks of the pandemic,       including high inflation. Data show that the payment pause       has been of greatest help to student loan borrowers who were       in financial distress even before the pandemic and has       successfully provided relief for those borrowers more than       other COVID-19 assistance programs. The payment pause is       broadly supported among individuals with and without student       loan debt and has been recognized as necessary by the Trump       and Biden Administrations alike. Further, the U.S. Secretary       of Education's use of the HEROES Act of 2003 to pause student       loan repayment falls within a long line of waiver and       modification authority exercised by prior administrations       without the invocation of the CRA, including by his immediate       predecessor for precisely the same purpose.        Overturning the payment pause and forcing borrowers into       immediate repayment would have a devastating effect on       borrowers in every community. U.S. Department of Education       (ED) analysis demonstrates that a resumption of loan payments       without cancellation will spike delinquency and default rates       for the most financially vulnerable. Further, more than 26       million Americans applied for student debt cancellation in       the few weeks before it was shut down by partisan attacks in       the federal courts. This extraordinary engagement with       President Biden's cancellation plan is further evidence of       both the crushing burden this debt places on workers and       families from all walks of life and the promise of hope debt       cancellation offers for millions seeking an economic fresh       start.        Recent polling illustrates that cancellation enjoys broad       popular support, underscoring the massive impact of student       debt across families, communities, and entire generations of       Americans, and the reasons for the program's popularity are       clear. Cancellation will also benefit many Americans who have       suffered the most throughout the pandemic--with 90% of relief       dollars going to borrowers earning below $75,000 a year.       These are student loan borrowers who are low- and middle-      income, borrowers with disabilities, public servants who face       high educational costs and low wages, women and Black and       Latino/a borrowers who come from low-wealth families unable       to foot the bill for higher education upfront, and many more.       Cancellation will help prevent a wave of defaults and       delinquencies when repayment resumes and ensure that these       borrowers will be able to afford basics like food, housing,       and other necessities that pandemic-related financial       hardship would otherwise put out of reach.        The American people, the law, and the economic instability       of the present moment all emphasize the necessity of debt       cancellation and the continuation of the payment pause until       cancellation is realized. Policymakers now seeking to reverse       such critical relief through the CRA are ignoring the       economic needs of their own constituents and threatening our       nation's financial security. Congress should be acting to       improve the circumstances of the American people, not       attempting to thwart the President's efforts to ease the       financial pressure that so many are feeling.        For these reasons, we strongly oppose the efforts to       overturn this relief through the Congressional Review Act       (H.J. Res. 45/S.J. Res. 22) and we urge you to consider the       harmful impact they would have on the millions of American       people and families who are in need of student loan debt       relief.
