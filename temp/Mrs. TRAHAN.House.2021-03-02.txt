 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1, and I  commend the Speaker, the majority leader, Chair Lofgren, and  Representative Sarbanes for their unwavering leadership.   Madam Speaker, we live in a cynical age. Some of this is due to the  fact that the wealthy and well-connected have been granted access and  influence in the halls of power far beyond what is fair. The results  speak for themselves--massive economic, health, and wealth disparities.  It is also due to the fact that we have seemingly entered a post-truth  era in which facts have less of a grip on public debate, particularly  on our social media platforms.   Madam Speaker, the race to the bottom continues, whether it is the  big lie about the election, or gaslighting the American people about  the political leanings of insurrectionists, or the denial of climate  change.   The roots of these problems cannot be solved unless we reform our  government, starting today. H.R. 1 is needed to help dissolve the  cynicism and ensure that facts and honesty have a place at the table  once again.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join us in passing H.R. 1.
