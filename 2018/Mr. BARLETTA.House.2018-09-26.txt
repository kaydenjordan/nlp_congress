 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 302, which  includes my bill, the Disaster Recovery Reform Act.   In 2017, 8 percent of the United States population, that is 26.4  million Americans, were affected by at least one disaster. This year,  we have already seen tragedy strike in our communities.   For example, in July and August, Pennsylvania was devastated by  widespread flooding that destroyed homes and businesses and,  tragically, cost lives.   In Hershey, Pennsylvania, Swatara Creek crested at over 17 feet, the  second highest level since the weather service began keeping records.  As we speak, the Carolinas continue to recover from Hurricane Florence,  which took the lives of more than 40 Americans. It is clear that these  reforms are needed now more than ever.   I thank Chairman Shuster for his support in getting this bill over  the finish line.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an op-ed I coauthored with  former FEMA Administrator David Paulison.     As Millions Recover From Florence, Congress Has a Chance To Enact                              Disaster Reform       (By Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.) and R. David Paulison, 09/25/18)         Last fall, the United States was devastated by an       unprecedented string of natural disasters: hurricanes Harvey,       Irma and Maria. These stain's now account for three of our       country's five most expensive hurricanes on record, causing a       combined $265 billion in damages. Even worse, the storms       tragically took the lives of countless Americans.        With painful memories of these disasters still fresh, the       Atlantic hurricane season is once again at its peak in 2018.       Hurricane  [[Page H9037]]       Florence made landfall in the Mid-Atlantic as a record-      breaking storm, causing destruction like we have never seen       in the region. While the communities affected by Florence       will undoubtedly demonstrate American resolve and bounce       back, they are serving as unfortunate reminders of the need       to overhaul and improve our nation's disaster readiness. As       we help those impacted by Florence continue to recover, it is       more important than ever that we work to ensure that they are       fully prepared for when the next disaster strikes.        Over the course of our careers in and around emergency       management, we have seen the direct impact pre-disaster       mitigation can have on protecting local infrastructure,       preserving property, and saving lives. Whether dealing with       the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew in 1992, Katrina in 2005,       or the increasingly costly storms from more recent years, the       primary lesson from these events is that there is no       substitute for pre-disaster mitigation and resilient       infrastructure. It could not be clearer: America needs a       better system that saves lives and taxpayer dollars by       building smarter and stronger before disaster strikes.        These life-saving efforts can also provide massive savings       to taxpayers. Expert research has consistently supported this       assertion, with one recent study finding that every $1       invested up front in mitigation efforts can save as much as       $8 on future costs. With the cost of these storms in the       hundreds of billions, the savings pre-disaster mitigation can       provide are invaluable.        But despite the devastation caused by previous storms and       the ongoing havoc of Florence, the United States continues to       drag its feet when it comes to disaster preparedness. Many       states still do not incentivize the use of certain safety       standards, and the federal government wastes billions on       reactive post-disaster spending instead of focusing on       proactive investment in disaster preparedness.        Fortunately, there is already a solution on the table that       would provide both much-needed relief for Americans and an       investment in a stronger future. The Disaster Recovery Reform       Act of 2018 (DRRA), which has passed the House twice and is       currently under consideration in the Senate, would go a long       way toward accomplishing the goals of investing in pre-      disaster mitigation and creating a more resilient America.        Importantly, this bill would increase the amount of money       available for pre-disaster mitigation following major       disasters. By arming communities with the necessary resources       to strengthen their infrastructure against hurricanes and       other disasters, those affected across the country will be       better equipped for the next inevitable disaster. With the       DRRA, Congress has an opportunity to enact real disaster       reform.        Encouragingly, there have been recent signs that our       national approach to disaster response, recovery, and       mitigation is trending in the right direction. Earlier this       year, the House of Representatives included a cost share       incentive provision designed to greatly enhance state       resiliency in the Bipartisan Budget Reform Act that was       signed into law by President Trump. FEMA, in addition to its       extraordinary work done regularly in responding to disasters,       is taking steps to ensure that this law is implemented       effectively and efficiently. The Trump administration has       provided strength in its response to those suffering from       recent disasters, with Vice President Pence telling a       community wracked by Hurricane Harvey that they would work to       ``[rebuild] all of Texas bigger and better than ever       before.'' However, these actions are only the beginning of       the required wholesale shift in our national disaster       framework. It is up to Congress to continue this momentum and       enact meaningful reforms that will save lives, property and       taxpayer dollars.        Including the record-breaking 2017 season, disaster       spending continues to be an ever-expanding cost category for       the United States. With another tumultuous hurricane season       underway, it is time for lawmakers to act. Safer, stronger       communities mean a safer, stronger country. If members of       Congress are serious about serving their constituents, then       senators must finish the important work the House started and       pass the Disaster Recovery Reform Act now.
