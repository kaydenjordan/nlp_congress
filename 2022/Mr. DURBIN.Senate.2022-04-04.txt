 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it was just a short time ago in the  Senate Judiciary Committee that we voted to advance the nomination of  Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve as the next Associate Justice on  the United States Supreme Court.   In the coming days, Judge Jackson's nomination will come before the  full Senate. We are on track to confirm her this week.   Judge Jackson is an outstanding nominee. She has earned support  across the political and ideological spectrums, and her qualifications  are second to none. Most importantly, Judge Jackson's record on the  bench is one of evenhandedness, impartiality, and independence.   Despite this, not a single Republican on the Judiciary Committee  would vote in favor of her nomination. I am disappointed--not  surprised, but disappointed. As a result, Judge Jackson will be the  first Supreme Court nominee in the modern era to require a discharge  from the Judiciary Committee. It is unfortunate, in one respect, given  that she is more prepared to serve on the High Court than, perhaps, any  nominee in living memory, even by the standards of our Republican  colleagues.   During the Trump administration, Senate Republicans laid out what  they viewed as being the standards for supporting a Supreme Court  nominee. In their own words, a nominee to the High Court should be  confirmed if they meet three criteria. Let's take a look at those  criteria.   First, Republicans have argued that you must have mainstream,  bipartisan support for a nominee. For instance, in speaking out about  then-Judge Gorsuch, the senior Senator from Texas said that Gorsuch was  ``a mainstream nominee unanimously supported by Democrats in the  past.''   Well, lucky for them, Judge Jackson is well within that judicial  mainstream, and she has the receipts to show it.   Judge Jackson is supported by multiple Federal judges appointed by  Republican Presidents, including Judge Thomas Griffith, Judge Michael  Luttig, and Judge Bruce Selya. She is supported by dozens of  conservative lawyers, including former Secretary of Homeland Security  Michael Chertoff, former Deputy Attorney General Donald Ayer, and  former Solicitor General Charles Fried. She has broad support from law  enforcement organizations and former prosecutors.   They keep saying: Oh, she is soft on crime. She has the endorsement  of the largest police organization in America--the Fraternal Order of  Police--and the International Association of Chiefs of Police and 87  former assistant U.S. attorneys who have prosecuted a range of criminal  offenses here in the District of Columbia. Soft on crime? The  prosecutors don't think so.   And, like Judge Gorsuch, Judge Jackson has been unanimously supported  by Senate Republicans, especially since she was confirmed unanimously  by the Senate not once but twice to be a member of the U.S. Sentencing  Commission and a district court judge.   In short, Judge Jackson has had mainstream, bipartisan support right  here in the Senate over and over again.   The second standard laid out by Republicans during the Trump  administration was that a Supreme Court nominee must have exceptional  legal credentials.   We went for 4 straight days. She faced 24 hours of questioning--24  hours  [[Page S1928]]  of question after question after question, written questions, oral  questions--over and over. How many questioned her qualifications to be  on the Supreme Court? None. Not one.   In 2018, for instance, the Republican leader called then-Judge  Kavanaugh an ``absolute all-star,'' specifically mentioning he was a  Yale undergrad, Yale Law, and had impeccable credentials.   Judge Jackson passes that same test. She clerked at every level of  the Federal judiciary. I can tell you, as a lawyer, that to be a clerk  for any judge has great honor and distinction. To be a clerk on all  three levels of the Federal court, including the Supreme Court, is  extraordinary. It just hardly ever occurs. It did for Judge Jackson.   She served as a Federal public defender, a staff attorney, a  commissioner on the Sentencing Commission, and as a lawyer in private  practice. Her resume is absolutely star-studded in terms of legal  experience. For almost a decade, she served on the Federal bench,  handling some 1,100 matters, issuing 600 written opinions. Do you want  to know what she thinks about an issue? how she thinks about an issue?  Just read the written opinions on every type of legal issue imaginable  that came before her.   Altogether, Judge Jackson meets, if not exceeds, the qualifications  of previous nominees, and the Senate Republicans have enthusiastically  supported them. They should support her.   The third and final standard Republicans have articulated for  supporting a Supreme Court nominee is they must have a judicial record  and a reputation of evenhandedness.   In 2020, for instance, the Republican leader highlighted then-Judge  Amy Coney Barrett's ``openminded judicial temperament,'' Amy Coney  Barrett.   Well, by the very same metric, Judge Jackson easily passes muster.  Her record on the bench is clearly one of impartiality and  independence. She has ruled for and against the Presidents of both  political parties. She has ruled for prosecutors and ruled for criminal  defendants. She has ruled for employers and employees. In her nearly 10  years on the bench, Judge Jackson has displayed no political or  ideological favoritism.   Some people on the far left are upset that she isn't more of an  advocate for their point of view. She takes a balanced approach to it.  She has never allowed her personal views to influence any outcome, and  she has been a model of judicial restraint. She has been guided by  precedent, by fidelity to the rule of law, and by an unyielding belief  that the Constitution must work for all Americans.   I was listening when Senator McConnell came to the floor and  announced that he would not vote for her. The No. 1 reason: She  wouldn't take a position on packing the Court--packing the Court. That  is a question of changing the composition of the Supreme Court, the  number of Supreme Court Justices. There has only been one elected  official in recent memory who has changed the composition of the  Court--Senator McConnell. You will remember, with the Scalia vacancy,  he kept it vacant for more than 8 months and denied President Obama the  opportunity to fill it.    What about the issue of the future composition of the Court? Is that  a requirement for someone to be supported by the Senator from Kentucky?  Obviously not. Amy Coney Barrett wouldn't answer the question. She  wouldn't give an opinion. She, like Judge Jackson, said: That is a  matter of policy. That is for Congress to decide--and it is.   Judge Jackson easily passed the three tests the Senate Republicans  established for supporting a Supreme Court nominee, and she passed the  tests with flying colors. She is, simply put, one of the Nation's  brightest legal minds. She has outstanding credentials, an  unimpeachable character, and an unwavering dedication to the rule of  law. She is smart, and it shows.   Judge Jackson also has the temperament. I can't tell you how many  times during the course of the 24 hours of questioning she faced last  week in the Senate Judiciary Committee that I thought: That is it. I am  going to look up at that table, and she is going to stand up and say,  ``Enough. My family, we are going home. We have had it.'' She never  did--cool under attack, calm under pressure, solid as a pillar.   She has the acumen, the skill--the kind of attributes we demand from  a Supreme Court nominee--and she has devoted her life to serving her  country, always working to uphold and honor the Constitution. She is  dedicated to protecting judicial independence, advancing freedom and  liberty, and to making the Court, its work, and its decisions  accessible to all Americans.   She told that story of when she was up for the circuit court--that  her opinions were long, she said, because she wanted everyone to  understand her thinking from start to finish--no mystery here--and that  she wanted the people appearing before her to understand what just  happened in that courtroom. Why did they win? Why did they lose? What  were the issues that were at stake? What did she think about? She takes  the time to explain it because she believes in the law, and she wants  all of us to understand and believe it as well.   I am going to proudly cast my vote to discharge Judge Jackson from  the Judiciary Committee. Later this week, I am going to proudly cast my  vote to confirm Judge Jackson as the first Black woman to sit on the  U.S. Supreme Court.   Let's not hurry to leave for an Easter recess--and I am as anxious as  everyone to be with our families--and overlook the obvious. This is a  seminal moment in American history. We are breaking down a wall that  has been standing for too long. There have been 115 Supreme Court  Justices in our history, and 108 look like me: a White guy. The others  are representing women, representing Latinas, and others. They are, of  course, very important in history. This is too.   Judge Jackson is going to be an important part of America, and she is  going to inspire a lot of people, particularly young women, to aspire  to greatness.   She was discouraged, if you will remember her testimony. She went up  to Harvard and toured it during a national debate team appearance. She  liked it so much that she went back to her high school counselor in  Florida and said: I think I want to apply to Harvard.   The counselor said: Listen, honey. Don't do that. You are going to be  so disappointed. Let's think about some other choices for you.   She did it anyway. She was accepted and went up there, knees shaking,  wondering if she could cut it. She not only cut it; she set records in  terms of achievement, particularly for a person with her background.  Her dad worked as a schoolteacher, went to law school, and convinced  her that law was the future for her as well.   She has told so many wonderful stories about her family. This is an  exceptional woman. She has lived an extraordinary life. She has a  beautiful family. She has written a record we can all be proud of.  Let's discharge this nomination from the Judiciary Committee and bring  it to the floor this week. Let's make history--the right kind of  history for America.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to print the  following letter in the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                        U.S. Senate,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                                     Washington, DC.
