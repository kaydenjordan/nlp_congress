 Mr. Speaker, today, as we celebrate Small Business  Week, I rise to recognize, commend, and stress the importance of small  businesses of this country.   I have the honor of serving on the House Small Business Committee  every day, and I am reminded that small businesses are the pillars and  the cornerstones of the American economy.   The National Small Business Association recently met in our Nation's  Capital. They communicated to me their biggest concerns were health  care and government overregulation. That is why we believe doing  nothing with health care is not an option. That is why this Congress  must strive to end the overburdensome regulation this government does  to kill jobs.   All across Kansas, and this country, small businesses are driving  economic opportunity, innovation, and growth. This week, and every  week, we must keep their contributions at the forefront of our  decisionmaking.                            ____________________
