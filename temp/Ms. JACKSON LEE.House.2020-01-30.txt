 Madam Speaker, my first opportunity in speaking  today is to make sure that we honor all the men and women who are  wearing uniforms in the United States military, as Congresswoman Lee  has said, her family members and many family members who served.   What we do know is we found no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.   We supported Congresswoman Lee in the rational position to have the  inspection go forth, to know what was going on. The only thing we  secured was an endless war.   In the question of Iran, Mr. Ro Khanna's position is right. If there  is any need to defend us in Iran, the War Powers Resolution allows a  President to do that if we are defending ourselves against attacks or  if there are hostilities.   We need to address this in a constitutional way. Article I says that  Congress declares war.   The endless war that has carried on, for those of us who have been to  Iraq and then Afghanistan realize that our soldiers deserve the dignity  of a debate when they should go to war.   Let me say to those who were injured by Iran: It is not just a side  hit, if you will. These soldiers have been hit. We honor them.   We should have a Congress to stand up if we go to war, not use this  resolution. It should be repealed.    Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland  Security Committee and a cosponsor, I rise in strong support of RCP  116-49, the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 550, the No  War With Iran Act, introduced by the gentlewoman from California,  Congresswoman Barbara Lee.   I thank my Out of Iraq colleague, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, for  sponsoring this legislation which repeals P.L. 107-43, the broad,  [[Page H737]]  unrestrained, and outdated 2002 Authorization for the Use of Military  Force (AUMF) against Iraq, which was passed and signed into law on  October 16, 2002, nearly twenty years ago.   Congress never intended for the 2002 AUMF to have such broad and  extended reach.   Over the last 18 years, we have seen 3 Presidents use this  legislation as a blank check to engage in serious military action.   The 2002 AUMF is an outdated piece of legislation and repealing it  will not affect any current military operations.   The 2002 AUMF's only function is to provide the President with cover  to claim Congress has already authorized him to attack Iranian  officials, which is false.   Moreover, the 2002 AUMF is unnecessary because in the  administration's own view, everything the 2002 AUMF covers is already  fully covered under the 2001 9/11 AUMF, except for attacks against  Iran.   Congress passed the 2002 AUMF to address the perceived threat posed  by the regime of Saddam Hussein and the AUMF permitted the President to  use the Armed Forces as ``necessary and appropriate'' to ``defend U.S.  national security against the continuing threat posed by Iraq'' and to  ``enforce all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.''   U.S. military deployments and operations carried out pursuant to the  2002 AUMF--dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom--officially concluded in  2011.   Almost 18 years after the resolution's passage, the United States  recognizes the sovereignty of Iraq and considers Iraq a key ally.   Under the Constitution, Congress has the sole duty to declare war.  Repealing obsolete Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMFs) is  essential to Congress living up to its constitutional responsibilities.   Leaving the 2002 AUMF in place increases the likelihood that future  Presidents will use it as a basis to start a new war, or expand a  current one, without Congress's explicit authorization.   In July 2019, the House adopted a Lee amendment to NDAA virtually  identical to H.R. 2456, To Repeal the AUMF Against Iraq Resolution of  2002, by a bipartisan vote of 242 to 180. Unfortunately, the Republican  leadership stripped it out.   The overly broad 2002 AUMF represents a critical deterioration of  congressional oversight.   As our brave servicemembers are deployed around the world in combat  zones, Congress is missing in action.   Congress must repeal the 2002 AUMF immediately to fulfill its  constitutional obligation to provide oversight and consent on matters  of war and peace.   As provided under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, absent a  congressional declaration of war or authorization for the use of  military force, the President as Commander-in-Chief has constitutional  power to engage the U.S. Armed Forces in hostilities only in the case  of a national emergency created by an attack upon the United States,  its territories or possessions, or its Armed Forces.   Madam Speaker, since the objectives which led Congress to pass the  2002 Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF) have been achieved, I  believe the authorization to use that military force expired  automatically.   Madam Speaker, where a congressional authorization to use military  force has expired, the President must obtain a new authorization to  continue the use of force.   Given the material changes in circumstances, introducing additional  U.S. combat troops into the region would be both unwise and beyond the  scope of authority conferred by the 2002 AUMF.   As a co-equal branch of government, it is Congress's right and  responsibility to be fully consulted regarding any potential plans to  expand military operations in the region, to assess whether such action  is in the national security interest of the United States and our  allies, and to withhold or grant authorization for the use of military  force based on this assessment.   As we have learned from the painful and bitter experience of the past  18 years, at the initiation of hostilities, the costs in terms of blood  and treasure of U.S. military interventions abroad are often  underestimated and the benefits overstated.   More than 6,800 American servicemembers gave the last full measure of  devotion to their country on battlefields in Afghanistan and Iraq, with  hundreds of thousands more returning with physical, emotional, or  psychological wounds that may never heal.   The direct economic cost of the war in the Persian Gulf exceeds $1.07  trillion, including $773 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations  funds, an increase of $243 billion to the Department of Defense base  budget, and an increase of $54.2 billion to the Veterans Administration  budget to address the human costs of the military involvement in Iraq.   We should not repeat the mistakes of the past and my position on this  issue is directly aligned with the will of the American people.   I commend my colleague, Representative Barbara Lee, for her  introduction and advocacy of this legislation that will repeal the  outdated 2002 AUMF.    Madam Speaker, war is a violent and catastrophic  act, and its impact on the people of any nation is one that is long- lasting.   Between the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan, close to 7,000 Americans  lost their lives; families were broken. But yet, we honor them for  their service, as we honor those who are now serving and who have put  on the uniform unselfishly, just like the young men and women who were  called immediately after the killing of General Soleimani.   Today, we made an important statement on this floor; that is that the  Constitution prevails; the rule of law prevails, as we hope it will  prevail in the other body in this proceeding.   We know that Congress declares war. If there is danger, the President  can use the War Powers Resolution. But as we did not find weapons of  mass destruction in Iraq, we have an endless war.   We do not need to engage in a war with Iran. If we are attacked or  there are hostilities, we can defend ourselves.   Let us deliberate on behalf of the American people and do it the  right way.   To our military, we thank you for your service.                            ____________________
