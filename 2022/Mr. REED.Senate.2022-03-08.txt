 Mr. President, I notice the arrival of Senator Hawley. I  think we are both prepared at this point for me to make a unanimous  consent request, and I would like to do so now.  [[Page S1042]]                     Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  executive session to consider the following nominations: Calendar Nos.  599, 477, and 472; that the nominations be confirmed; the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order to  the nominations; that any related statements be printed in the Record;  and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action  and the Senate resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I think one of the messages that the Senator  from Missouri was trying to convey is ``do our job.'' One of our  fundamental jobs is to review, vote on, and confirm or not confirm  nominees to critical positions in the Department of Defense, and this  effort has completely frustrated that goal of doing our job.   We have seen repeated blockage of nominees who are fully qualified,  forcing votes--and the gentleman from Missouri is talking about we  should have had votes this week--forcing votes because one or two  people object. And, of course, the final outcome is 90 votes, 85 votes  in favor of the nominee.   The will of the Senate was very clear: These people should be in  their office, doing their jobs, helping us maintain our security, not  subject to the whims and the will of one or two people.   The nominees I just referred to are three individuals nominated to  critical positions within the Department of Defense. The Armed Services  Committee held hearings on all three of these nominations months ago,  and all three were reported out of the committee by voice vote. I am  unaware of any objections to these nominees relating to their  qualifications for the positions for which they have been nominated.   I need not remind my colleagues that with Russia's invasion of  Ukraine, a war of choice against a modern, functioning democracy, how  critical it is to have people in place in the Department of Defense.   It is very difficult to complain about the policy of the  administration when there has been a deliberate attempt for more than a  year to delay critical nominees from taking their position in that  Department.   And, more importantly, I think this is a trend that was observed by  the Commission on the National Defense Strategy under President Trump.  It said:         The implementation of the National Defense Strategy must       feature empowered civilians fulfilling their statutory       responsibilities, particularly regarding issues of force       management. . . . Strong civilian oversight is an essential       hallmark of civil-military relations codified in the       Constitution and embraced throughout the nation's history.    What is frustrating that principle? Actions like today, where fully  qualified individuals who pass by voice vote through the committee are  held up. If there is a weakness--that has been identified by other  sources in the National Defense Strategy at the Department of Defense-- it is in one case the lack of sufficient civilian leadership and  continuity, and that is exactly what this action today will continue to  foster.   For example, Mr. Ashish Vazirani was reported out of committee on  December 8 and would become the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness, the No. 2 official in the Department in charge  of military and civilian policy and the readiness of our Armed Forces.   Mr. Alex Wagner was reported out of the committee in October of last  year, and he would become the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for  Manpower and Reserve Affairs, the senior official within the Department  of the Air Force with responsibility for military and civilian  personnel policy and the readiness of Air Force and Space Force  personnel.   Ms. Rachel Jacobson was reported out of the committee in October of  last year, and she would become the Assistant Secretary of the Army for  Energy, Installation, and the Environment. She will be responsible for  managing the Army's physical footprint and, particularly, she will  oversee contracts that would increase installation resilience and the  modernization of Army infrastructure, particularly with regard to  energy, which is one of the issues that we are talking about with great  emphasis today and in the proceeding several weeks.   All of these positions are critically important to the Department of  Defense. And I am unaware of any substantive objection to these  nominees on the basis of their qualifications. The sooner they assume  their offices, the better for the Department's ability to tackle the  challenges on behalf of servicemembers and their families.   I also think it is important to recognize some of that discussion  about the situation in Ukraine. The Biden administration sent $650  million in aid--military assistance and aid--to the Ukrainian  Government in the last year, far surpassing anything that was done in  the Trump administration. In fact, we spent many hours here on the  floor of the U.S. Senate in an impeachment proceeding based on what  many of us thought was the attempt by then-President Trump to use  military aid to extract a political concession from President  Zelenskyy. That is quite a stark difference than what President Biden's  administration has been doing for the last year.   There was a reference made to dealing with Saudi Arabia. Well,  President Trump's first trip overseas was to Saudi Arabia to cavort  with his friends, the Kings and Princes of Saudi Arabia. His son-in-law  made multiple trips over there, and it wasn't in the spirit of  condemnation; it was in the spirit of businesslike behavior, I would  say. Khashoggi was killed by agents of MBS, the Crown Prince, but the  details of the report were never released by the Trump administration.  President Biden released those details, earning, I think, the enmity of  the Crown Prince. So this story of the ineffectuality of the Biden  administration is completely, in my view, without basis.   What we have seen--and I think the Presiding Officer recognizes it as  a member of the Foreign Relations Committee--is probably the most  sophisticated development of an alliance to oppose tyranny that we have  seen in many, many years.   When the whole world is united by the diplomacy of this  administration to stand up against Vladimir Putin--  [[Page S1044]]  and I must say practically the whole world. That is an amazing  demonstration of diplomacy and statesmanship. And it happened because  of the leadership of the President, the leadership of Secretary  Blinken, the leadership of Secretary Austin. And, again, when you have  Switzerland joining in sanctioning a country--the greatest neutral  nation in the world--that is a remarkable accomplishment.   We still have a long way to go. The outcome is still very much  uncertain, but to date, the President and his administration has done  an extraordinary job.   Afghanistan is an issue that we have dealt with for 20 years. One of  the first things we did was to ensure that in the National Defense  Authorization Act, there was an independent study which will be  conducted, but it is not going to focus on the last 2 weeks; it is  going to focus on 20 years. It is going to assess whether the decision  to invade Iraq was a critical strategic mistake--which I think it was.  That is why I opposed it originally.   It is going to look at the Doha agreement, in which the Trump  administration basically said, ``We are leaving,'' which gave the  Taliban one of their greatest psychological and, indeed, in a way,  military weapons because they went from village to village and said:  Here it is, signed, sealed, and delivered. They are going. And when  they go, who are you going to be with, Ghani or us?   So in any way to estimate the culpability, the responsibility of our  role in Afghanistan, it will take that kind of 20-year look by  independent experts who are concerned to find the truth, not to find a  political argument.   I am just very disappointed that we are going to continue to avoid  our duty to ensure that there are civilians in the Department of  Defense who are able to carry out the policy of the United States,  which is the basic principle of civil and military relations in the  United States and in the Constitution of the United States.                                    Energy    Mr. President, retaining my time, I would now like to resume my  comments with respect to the energy situation and the United States.   As I indicated previously, the invasion of Ukraine has revealed the  vulnerability that our dependence on oil creates for our economy and  for average Americans trying to fill up their cars and pay their  heating bills.   The fact is, the United States has sufficient domestic production to  meet our energy needs today. We are producing more oil and refined  product than ever before. Oil production was up more than half a  million barrels a day from January to December of last year and is  expected to rise even more this year, which I would assume would mean  that more and more Americans are working in the oilfields and  elsewhere. In fact, I believe, last year, the workforce grew about 6.6  million jobs, which we hadn't seen in the last year or two of the Trump  administration.   Unemployment now is hovering around 4 percent. Gross domestic product  has been significant and much more so than the preceding several years.  But we do have problems economically, and some of those problems are  related to the international oil supply. Now, we certainly don't need  Russian oil and I have said we should stop importing it and I am glad  that this morning the President announced the United States will  officially ban the importation of oil from Russia, denying Putin a key  revenue source for his illegal war. This is something both Democrats  and Republicans have called for, and the American people should know  this policy choice will likely affect the price of gasoline.   But even if we don't use Russian oil, everyone needs to know that  petroleum is traded on the world market, and the United States is part  of that world market. The chaos Putin is sowing in Europe will continue  to have an effect here regardless of where we get our oil. Our energy  policy of overreliance on fossil fuels is a matter of national  security, and it is time we embrace all that it entails.   The reality of a world market, combined with the impact on regular  Americans who need to fill up their cars, means the United States will  have to make some tough choices on whom we buy from if we are not  buying from Russia. We will have to more carefully consider what we are  exporting, how we will prevent profiteering, and what pain people  should expect at the pump.   If the climate crisis, raging fires, historic droughts, and flooding  aren't enough to convince our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  of the need to kick our oil addiction, I hope the national security and  economic vulnerabilities exposed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine will  be enough. As long as we base our energy future on oil, we choose to  make ourselves vulnerable.    Unfortunately, many of my Republican colleagues don't seem to  recognize that reality. Instead, they focus on never-built pipelines  geared toward exporting our oil, not using it here in the United  States. Most of the oil that was going through the pipeline that  President Biden--I think, because of many, many considerations--decided  against was destined for exportation, not for use here in the United  States, or they make claims about energy production under Democratic  Presidents that either contort or suspend reality. It is time--to  borrow the phrase from my Rhode Island colleague, Senator Whitehouse-- it is time to wake up. Indeed, their solution to higher gas prices is  more oil dependency.   The bottom line is that we need to accelerate the transition to  clean, renewable energy sources that aren't subject to worldwide  scarcity and manipulation by our adversary. There are, however, things  we should do in the short term to help consumers.   Again, the advocates for the oil companies, the advocates for special  tax arrangements, the advocates to continue to pump oil and pump oil  and pump oil are playing right, in my sense, into the hands of Putin  because if our world economy is based on hydrocarbons, then Russia is  going to make some money. If our world economy is based on other  sources of power--alternative sources of power--then his cash register  is going to ring close to zero.   I am pleased that President Biden listened to me and others in  Congress and decided to tap into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to  help bring down the price of oil. He wisely coordinated the release of  60 million barrels with our international partners. The action sends a  reassuring signal to markets, but we may need to release more to tamp  down prices. We also need to insist that our Middle East partners do  more to increase production to help stabilize prices and meet demand in  Europe.   We should also ask domestic oil and gas producers to pitch in.  Despite the other side of the aisle's claims about the economy, Big Oil  is earning some of its highest profits in years. They are not simply  passing on the cost--additional cost--to the consumer reluctantly and  grudgingly and sadly. ExxonMobil and Chevron, for example, reported a  combined net annual profit of nearly $38.6 billion in 2021, but are  they investing those profits in new production, particularly when they  have 14 million acres in unused leases? No. Instead, they are issuing  higher dividends and buying back stock to boost share prices. These  windfall profits should be used to help consumers, not their  billionaire investors.   Of course, the easiest way to insulate ourselves from higher costs is  to become more energy efficient. When we consume less, we pay less.  That is why I have long advocated better fuel economy standards for  cars and trucks, something that the last administration worked against.  Yes, the Trump administration tried to derail an increase in gas  mileage that the automobile companies were in favor of. Even when  automakers said we should keep the tougher standards, Trump said no.  Why? Let's be more dependent on gasoline. It is not only to this  country's oil-producing benefit. Guess what. Putin benefits and others  benefit.   Fortunately, the Biden administration has a broader vision for a  clean energy future that eases the burden on consumers.   While there is much more to do, the bipartisan infrastructure law  took important steps on this front. It invested $7.5 billion to build  out a national network of electric vehicle charges, $5 billion for  electric buses, and $90 billion to improve public transit systems.   It also includes $65 billion to upgrade our power infrastructure,  including by building thousands of miles of new, resilient transmission  lines to facilitate the expansion of renewable energy. And  [[Page S1045]]  we can't just look at transportation because consumers are also facing  the pinch on home energy prices.   Now, last year, I worked to secure $4.5 billion in the American  Rescue Plan for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program to help  consumers pay their energy bills. In the coming days, we will pass an  omnibus appropriations bill to provide base funding for that program,  which still lacks the resources to help all who qualify for assistance.  But we need to do more.   We also need to make other long-term investments. In his State of the  Union Address last week, President Biden emphasized the need to  weatherize homes and businesses to be more energy efficient, which in  turn lowers energy costs and reduces greenhouse gases and emissions,  and I cannot agree more.   It is why I have led the fight to fund the Weatherization Assistance  Program, which received $3.5 billion in the bipartisan infrastructure  law. This program has helped more than 7 million low-income families  reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient.   It saves participants nearly $300 in energy bills a year, and a  Department of Energy study found that in 1 year, it reduced carbon  emissions by more than 2.2 million metric tons, the equivalent to  taking more than a half a million cars off the road.   To make the most of this investment, this week, I introduced the  Weatherization Assistance Program Improvement Act along with Senators  Collins, Coons, and Shaheen. Our bill would make critical updates,  including increasing eligibility, raising the per unit funding level  for weatherization projects, and setting aside funding to make critical  health and safety repairs in conjunction with weatherization projects.  Together, these reforms will make the program more effective and will  help it serve even more households across the country.   These are significant steps, but we need the full package of climate  energy reforms that the President has been calling for, including tax  credits and grants that would make clean energy, clean vehicles, and  other clean technologies more affordable and better.   If we do these things, we will make a huge difference in the lives of  Americans today and for generations to come.   Just a final thought, I think one of the greatest nightmares that  Vladimir Putin has is a world that is powered by electricity, not  generated by hydrocarbons, a world in which the gasoline and oil that  he has in Russia is not worth $150 a barrel but $1.50 a barrel.   We can do it, and it will be one of the most significant national  security endeavors when we accomplish that.   I yield the floor.
