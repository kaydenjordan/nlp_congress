 Mr. Speaker, two Rhode Islanders have already tested  positive for coronavirus, and dozens  [[Page H1448]]  more are being monitored. Across the globe, more than 90,000 are sick  and 3,000 have died.   Rhode Islanders and all Americans deserve a strong, effective, and  fully funded response to this health crisis. That is why the House will  vote this week on an emergency appropriations bill that addresses the  scale and seriousness of the coronavirus epidemic. This bill will  ensure public health officials have the resources they need right now.   It is critical that the Senate send it to the President's desk as  soon as the House acts, and, for his part, the President needs to stop  calling this situation a hoax. This isn't about him; it is about  protecting the American people. When the bill gets to his desk, he  should sign it and then step aside and let the scientists, the doctors,  and the public health experts do their jobs.   This is no time for politics. It is about keeping the American people  safe. The House will do our job. The President should start doing his.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 387) condemning continued violence against  civilians by armed groups in the Central African Republic and  supporting efforts to achieve a lasting political solution to the  conflict, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 387         Whereas the overthrow of the Government of the Central       African Republic in March 2013 and subsequent violence has       led to the proliferation of multiple armed groups, which have       been responsible for widespread atrocities based on perceived       or actual religious or ethnic identities;        Whereas the United Nations (UN) concluded in 2014 that the       Central African Republic's minority Muslim community had been       the target of ethnic cleansing, and multiple UN officials       have warned of a risk of genocide;        Whereas, according to the United Nations, an estimated       2,900,000 people are in need of humanitarian assistance, over       590,000 Central Africans are refugees in neighboring       countries, and over 640,000 people are displaced, most of       whom are women and children;        Whereas armed groups continue to engage in gross human       rights abuses, violence, pillaging, and the illicit       trafficking of natural resources such as ivory, gold, cattle,       and diamonds;        Whereas armed groups have intentionally targeted personnel       from the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated       Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic       (MINUSCA), aid workers, and journalists, making the Central       African Republic one of the world's most dangerous operating       environments for humanitarian actors;        Whereas the Central African Republic has made significant       progress toward democracy by conducting democratic elections       despite the lack of security around electoral polling       stations and some irregularities, and inaugurated President       Faustin-Archange Touadera in March 2016;        Whereas the establishment of the Special Criminal Court in       June 2017 and the creation of more than 1,000 peace       committees across the country demonstrate a genuine       commitment to justice and accountability on the part of the       people of the Central African Republic; and        Whereas, since 2013, the United States has been the largest       single donor to the humanitarian response in the Central       African Republic, promoted peace and social cohesion,       supported the deployment of MINUSCA, enacted sanctions       against senior leaders of armed groups, and provided life-      saving assistance to communities in the Central African       Republic affected by the crisis: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) recognizes that strong United States leadership and       support for the stability of the Central African Republic is       necessary for the security and future stability of the       region;        (2) condemns violence against civilians, humanitarian       workers, journalists, faith leaders, and United Nations       peacekeepers by all armed actors operating within the Central       African Republic;  [[Page H1449]]         (3) welcomes the signing of the Khartoum Peace Agreement in       February 2019 and urges all parties to adhere to the terms of       the agreement, including participating in efforts to disarm       and demobilize combatants, to advance long-term sustainable       peace for the citizens of the Central African Republic;        (4) supports continued efforts by the Government of the       Central African Republic, with support from the African Union       and United Nations, to combat the threat posed by armed       groups;        (5) calls on the international community, including all       members of the United Nations Security Council as well as       neighboring countries, to support constructive efforts toward       peace in the Central African Republic;        (6) calls on the Government of the Central African Republic       to ensure that all state security forces adhere to civilian       command, refrain from human rights abuses, and sever any and       all links to armed groups except in the framework of       disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration under the       Khartoum Agreement; and        (7) urges the Secretary of State and the Administrator of       the United States Agency for International Development       (USAID), in coordination with other relevant Federal       departments and agencies, to--        (A) provide life-saving humanitarian and development       assistance to support vulnerable populations and build local       capacity to support sustainable agricultural production in       the Central African Republic;        (B) support the efforts of local communities,       nongovernmental organizations, and the Government of the       Central African Republic to prevent atrocities along       religious and ethnic lines, including through programs that       focus on peacebuilding, reconciliation, human rights, good       and inclusive governance, justice, security sector reform,       and the implementation of the Khartoum Agreement;        (C) work with the United Nations, African Union, and       regional governments and organizations to enforce existing       sanctions related to the Central African Republic and address       cross-border flows of illicit arms, natural resources, and       armed groups;        (D) ensure that United States assistance is well-      coordinated among agencies and with other donors to maximize       diplomatic, development, and defense resources to support       peace, stability, and the Central African Republic's journey       to self-reliance;        (E) undertake efforts to prioritize mutual interests       between the United States and the Central African Republic       and take steps to position the United States as a leader       working with the Government of the Central African Republic       in the areas of reconstruction, postconflict remediation, and       institution building, as well as taking steps to combat       Russian influence in the country and region;        (F) support rehabilitation and reintegration programs led       by the Central African Republic Government, nongovernmental       organizations, and regional government partners for children,       youth, and adults that have demobilized from armed groups,       including the Lord's Resistance Army;        (G) ensure that the United States Embassy in Bangui,       including USAID presence, and the Department of State Africa       Bureau have adequate staffing and funding to carry out their       programs and objectives; and        (H) ensure that the United Nations Multidimensional       Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African       Republic has adequate resources, including personnel,       temporary forward operating bases, and force enabling       equipment, to carry out its civilian protection mandate and       more effectively project the presence of the United Nations.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 387.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 387 and thank my  colleagues for their support of this bipartisan resolution.   As the gentleman knows, the destabilizing overthrow of the Government  of the Central African Republic, or CAR, in March 2013 has led to a  proliferation of armed rebel groups which have been responsible for  widespread atrocities based on religious or ethnic identities during  this bloody conflict. In 2014, the U.N. concluded that CAR's minority  Muslim community had been the target of ethnic cleansing, and multiple  U.N. officials have warned of a risk of genocide.   These armed groups continue to engage in gross human rights abuses,  including violence, pillaging, and the illicit trafficking of natural  resources such as ivory, gold, cattle, and diamonds.   However, despite the lack of security around electoral polling  stations, CAR has made significant progress toward democracy by  conducting democratic elections, ultimately inaugurating President  Touadera in March of 2016. Yet, armed groups still control much of the  country's territory, ethnic and religious violence occurs frequently,  and the central government still struggles with basic security and  governance.   Despite these challenges, the central government and armed groups  signed a landmark peace deal in February of 2019 that lays out a path  toward a unity government, demobilization of nonstate combatants, and  the creation of interim-mixed security units compromising security  forces and former rebels.   The United States has a long history supporting CAR, establishing  diplomatic relations in 1960 following their independence from France.  U.S. bilateral aid to CAR totaled $34 million in fiscal year 2018,  including $18 million in food aid, $13 million in security aid, and $3  million in development aid.   Despite this, the United Nations estimates 2.9 million people need  humanitarian assistance, and over 640,000 people have been displaced  due to this conflict, most of whom are children and women.   The United States has played an important role in brokering peace in  CAR, and is currently the largest international donor, helping to  strengthen the central government, increase security, and maintain  peace.   Actors, such as Russia, have engaged in CAR in ways that are  detrimental to American interests; therefore, it is vital that we  continue to support the people of CAR in achieving peace and a  democratic transition. That is why I am proud to sponsor this  legislation, to reiterate that Congress and the United States  Government is committed to achieving peace in CAR.   Specifically, this resolution condemns violence against civilians,  humanitarian workers, journalists, faith leaders, and United Nations  peacekeepers by all armed groups operating within the Central African  Republic.   It welcomes the signing of the Khartoum Peace Agreement in February  2019 and urges all parties to adhere to the terms of the agreement.   It calls on the international community, including all members of the  United Nations Security Council as well as neighboring countries, to  continually reassess and implement strategies that demonstrate clear  progress in achieving peace in the Central African Republic.   It calls on the Government of the Central African Republic to ensure  that all state security forces adhere to civilian command, refrain from  human rights abuses, and sever any and all links to armed groups,  except in the framework of disarmament, demobilization, and  reintegration under the peace agreement.   It urges the State Department and USAID to take steps to ensure that  American assistance programs support local sustainable agriculture,  other development efforts to create human well-being, and peace in CAR.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I once again thank the chairman and ranking member for  their support and urge passage of this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4508) to expand the number of scholarships available to  Pakistani women under the Merit and Needs-Based Scholarship Program, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4508         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Malala Yousafzai Scholarship       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) In late 2008, Malala Yousafzai began making the case       for access to education for women and girls despite       objections from the Pakistani Taliban. On October 9, 2012,       Malala was shot in the head by Pakistani Taliban on her way       home from school.        (2) In 2013, Malala Yousafzai and her father Ziauddin       Yousafzai co-founded the Malala Fund. The Malala Fund works       to secure twelve years of free, safe, and quality education       for all girls. Completion of a full twelve-year cycle of       primary and secondary education ensures a pipeline of girls       able to pursue higher education.        (3) On July 12, 2013, Malala delivered a speech before the       United Nations General Assembly calling for expanded access       to education for women and girls across the globe. She said,       ``[L]et us wage a glorious struggle against illiteracy,       poverty, and terrorism. Let us pick up our books and our       pens. They are the most powerful weapons . . . Education is       the only solution.''.        (4) On October 10, 2014, Malala Yousafzai became the co-      recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for her ``struggle against       the suppression of children and young people and for the       right of all children to education''.        (5) According to the United Nations 2016 Global Education       Monitoring Report, more than 130 million girls worldwide are       out of school. 15 million girls of primary-school age will       never enter a classroom. As of 2016, at least 500 million       adult women across the globe are illiterate.        (6) According to the World Bank, ``Girls' education is a       strategic development priority. Better educated women tend to       be healthier, participate more in the formal labor market,       earn higher incomes, . . . marry at a later age, and enable       better health care and education for their children, should       they choose to become mothers. All these factors combined can       help lift households, communities, and nations out of       poverty.''.        (7) In 2015, all United Nations Member States, including       the United States, adopted quality education, including       access to higher education, and gender equality as       sustainable development goals to be attained by 2030. One of       the education goal targets is to ``ensure equal access for       all women and men to affordable and quality technical,       vocational and tertiary education, including university''.        (8) In January 2010, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham       Clinton stated, ``We will open the doors of education to all       citizens, but especially to girls and women . . . We are       doing all of these things because we have seen that when       women and girls have the tools to stay healthy and the       opportunity to contribute to their families'' well-being,       they flourish and so do the people around them.        (9) In February 2019, the White House launched the Women's       Global Development and Prosperity Initiative to advance       women's economic empowerment across the globe and reach more       than 100,000 women.        (10) The World Economic Forum ranks Pakistan the second       lowest among all countries in the world evaluated for gender       equality. On educational attainment for women, Pakistan is       ranked the tenth lowest.        (11) In Pakistan, the rate of higher education enrollment       beyond high school for girls and women is just 9 percent as       reported by the World Bank. The global rate is 40 percent.       Less than 6 percent of women 25 and older in Pakistan attain       a bachelor's degree or equivalent as of 2016.        (12) Factors such as poverty, early marriage, disability,       ethnicity, and religion can contribute to the lack of       educational opportunities for women in marginalized       communities.        (13) According to the World Bank, ``Higher education       benefits both individuals and society. Economic returns for       college graduates are the highest in the entire educational       system--an average 17 percent increase in earnings per year       of schooling as compared with 10 percent for primary       school.''.        (14) The United States provides critical foreign assistance       to Pakistan's education sector to improve access to and the       quality of basic and higher education. Since 2010, the United       States Agency for International Development (referred to in       this Act as ``USAID'') has awarded more than 6,000       scholarships for young women to receive higher education in       Pakistan.        (15) The Merit and Needs-Based Scholarship Program       administered by USAID awards scholarships to academically       talented, financially needy Pakistani students from all       regions, including female students from rural areas of the       country, to pursue bachelor's or master's degrees at       participating Pakistani universities.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         (a) In General.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) every individual should have the opportunity to pursue       a full cycle of primary, secondary, and higher education;        (2) every individual, regardless of gender, socio-economic       status, ethnicity, or religion should have the opportunity to       pursue an education without fear of discrimination;        (3) educational exchanges promote institutional linkages       between the United States and Pakistan; and        (4) recipients of scholarships referred to in section 4       should commit to improving their local communities.        (b) Continued Support for Educational Initiatives in       Pakistan.--Congress encourages the Department of State and       USAID to continue their support for initiatives led by the       Government of Pakistan and civil society that promote       education in Pakistan, especially education for women, in       accordance with USAID's 2018 Education Policy.       SEC. 4. MERIT AND NEEDS-BASED SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM.         (a) In General.--The USAID Administrator shall award at       least 50 percent of the number of scholarships under the       Merit and Needs-Based Scholarship Program (referred to in       this Act as the ``Program'') to women for each of the       calendar years 2020 through 2022.        (b) Limitations.--        (1) Criteria.--The scholarships available under subsection       (a) may only be awarded in accordance with other scholarship       eligibility criteria already established by USAID.        (2) Academic disciplines.--Scholarships authorized under       subsection (a) shall be awarded for a range of disciplines to       improve the employability of graduates and to meet the needs       of the scholarship recipients.        (3) Other scholarships.--The USAID Administrator shall make       every effort to award 50 percent of the scholarships       available under the Program to Pakistani women.        (c) Leveraging Investment.--The USAID Administrator shall,       to the greatest extent practicable, consult with and leverage       investments by the Pakistani private sector  [[Page H1451]]       and Pakistani diaspora communities in the United States as       part of USAID's greater effort to improve the quality of,       expand access to, and ensure sustainability of education       programs in Pakistan.       SEC. 5. ANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFING.         (a) In General.--The USAID Administrator shall designate       appropriate USAID officials to brief the appropriate       congressional committees, not later than 1 year after the       date of enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for       the next 3 years, on the implementation of section 4.        (b) Contents.--The briefing described in subsection (a)       shall include, among other relevant information, for the most       recently concluded fiscal year--        (1) the total number of scholarships that were awarded       through the Program, including a breakdown by gender;        (2) the disciplines of study chosen by the scholarship       recipients;        (3) the percentage of the scholarships that were awarded to       students seeking a bachelor's degree or a master's degree,       respectively;        (4) the percentage of scholarship recipients who       voluntarily dropped out of school or were involuntarily       pushed out of the program for failure to meet program       requirements; and        (5) the percentage of scholarship recipients who dropped       out of school due to retaliation for seeking an education, to       the extent that such information is available.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 4508.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, when we break down the barriers holding women back, they  lift up entire communities. Top economists back this up. The World Bank  says that financing girls' education has the highest return on  investment in the developing world. We know that the impact isn't just  economic. When girls have access to education, they can inspire  millions, empower their communities, and change the world.   Look at Malala Yousafzai. Malala bravely put her education to use by  blogging about the brutality of Taliban rule in her hometown and  advocating for girls' rights to education.   The Pakistani Taliban tried to silence her with a violent attack on  her life. She survived, and she didn't back down. Malala's continued  commitment to advancing women's rights and expanding access to  education has resonated with millions of people and spurred action  around the world.   When we look at Malala, we see an inspiring source of strength, of  dedication, and of bravery. We also see what women are capable of when  they have the opportunity to go to school and use their voices. So, I  am pleased that we are moving forward this bill named in Malala's honor  that will strengthen the United States' investments in educational  opportunities for Pakistani girls.   The Malala Yousafzai Scholarship Act will require that at least 50  percent of USAID's Merit and Needs-Based Scholarships in Pakistan are  awarded to women.   I want to thank my colleague and friend from New York (Mr. Jeffries)  for introducing this excellent measure. I am proud to support it, and I  urge all my colleagues to join me in doing so.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to, again, really speak to the importance of  this resolution, because we have examples all over the world of where,  when women are empowered, it lifts up an entire community; and that  when women have a voice, they not only contribute to their own  empowerment, their own development, and their own success, but have an  enormous, positive impact on their local communities in the regions in  which they live.   It has often been said that one of the best investments we can make  is in education, and I think Malala's story is an example of the  transformative power of education, not only in terms of economic  security, but in terms of building democracy and civil society.   So this legislation will ensure that we intentionally and  purposefully invest in young women and girls because of not only the  impact it will have on their own lives but what it will mean to the  communities they are a part of.   I want to really applaud the chief sponsor of this, my friend and  colleague, Hakeem Jeffries, the chair of the Democratic Caucus, who has  really made this a priority in his work.   During discussions in the Foreign Affairs Committee there was  bipartisan recognition of the significant investment in women and  girls; that that had to be a priority, and that it would be a tool to  advancing economic success, to advancing educational success, and to  really help build a civil society. These are very often regions which,  for a very long time, women and girls were excluded from those  opportunities.   So this resolution will be really transformative and will really help  to ensure that Pakistan can serve as a model for what happens when you  actually invest in women and girls and the difference it can make in  the societies in that country that will be an example, I think, to the  rest of the world.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the very  distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), who is the author  of this very important piece of legislation, the Democratic Caucus  chair, and my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, again, I want to acknowledge the extraordinary work of  USAID and their focus on education and how critical that is to the  development of communities all across the world and, importantly, that  we fully fund USAID's efforts, and also to recognize that this focus on  education is a focus that continues to pay dividends.   I particularly want to acknowledge the leadership of Chairman  Jeffries in recognizing the particular responsibility that we have to  invest in women and girls and what a transformative difference that  makes in countries. Pakistan will be able to show the world the  difference that it makes when you give women and girls an opportunity  to realize their full potential. This act will ensure that at least  half of those scholarships go to girls. It is a very important piece of  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 1678) to express United States support for Taiwan's diplomatic  alliances around the world, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1678         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Taiwan Allies International       Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 (Public Law 96-8)       states that it is the policy of the United States ``to       preserve and promote extensive, close, and friendly       commercial, cultural, and other relations between the people       of the United States and the people on Taiwan''.        (2) The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 states that it is the       policy of the United States ``to maintain the capacity of the       United States to resist any resort to force or other forms of       coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or       economic system, of the people on Taiwan''.        (3) Taiwan is a free, democratic, and prosperous nation of       23,000,000 people and an important contributor to peace and       stability around the world.        (4) Since the election of President Tsai Ing-wen as       President of Taiwan in 2016, the Government of the People's       Republic of China has intensified its efforts to pressure       Taiwan.        (5) Since 2016, the Gambia, Sao Tome and Principe, Panama,       the Dominican Republic, Burkina Faso, El Salvador, the       Solomon Islands, and Kiribati have severed diplomatic       relations with Taiwan in favor of diplomatic relations with       China.        (6) Taiwan currently maintains full diplomatic relations       with 15 nations around the world.        (7) Taiwan's unique relationship with the United States,       Australia, India, Japan, and other countries are of       significant benefit in strengthening Taiwan's economy and       preserving its international space.        (8) According to President Tsai Ing-wen, the severance of       diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favor of diplomatic relations       with China is ``part of a series of diplomatic and military       acts of coercion'' by China.        (9) The Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018 (Public Law       115-409) states that--        (A) it is United States policy ``to support the close       economic, political, and security relationship between Taiwan       and the United States''; and        (B) the President should--        (i) ``conduct regular transfers of defense articles to       Taiwan that are tailored to meet the existing and likely       future threats from the People's Republic of China, including       supporting the efforts of Taiwan to develop and integrate       asymmetric capabilities, as appropriate, including mobile,       survivable, and cost-effective capabilities, into its       military forces''; and        (ii) ``encourage the travel of high-level United States       officials to Taiwan, in accordance with the Taiwan Travel       Act''.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON TRADE AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS                     WITH TAIWAN.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the United States and Taiwan have built a strong       economic partnership, with the United States now Taiwan's       second largest trading partner and with Taiwan the 11th       largest trading partner of the United States and a key       destination for United States agricultural exports;        (2) strong United States-Taiwan economic relations have       been a positive factor in stimulating economic growth and job       creation for the people of both the United States and Taiwan;       and        (3) the United States Trade Representative should consult       with Congress on opportunities for further strengthening       bilateral trade and economic relations between the United       States and Taiwan.       SEC. 4. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES WITH REGARD TO TAIWAN'S                     PARTICIPATION IN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS.         It should be the policy of the United States--        (1) to advocate, as appropriate--        (A) for Taiwan's membership in all international       organizations in which statehood is not a requirement and in       which the United States is also a participant; and        (B) for Taiwan to be granted observer status in other       appropriate international organizations;        (2) to instruct, as appropriate, representatives of the       United States Government in all organizations described in       paragraph (1) to use the voice, vote, and influence of the       United States to advocate for Taiwan's membership or observer       status in such organizations; and        (3) for the President or the President's designees to       advocate, as appropriate, for Taiwan's membership or observer       status in all  [[Page H1453]]       organizations described in paragraph (1) as part of any       relevant bilateral engagements between the United States and       the People's Republic of China, including leader summits and       the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue.       SEC. 5. STRENGTHENING OF TIES WITH TAIWAN.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the United States Government should--        (1) support Taiwan in strengthening its official diplomatic       relationships as well as other partnerships with countries in       the Indo-Pacific region and around the world;        (2) consider, in certain cases as appropriate and in       alignment with United States interests, increasing its       economic, security, and diplomatic engagement with nations       that have demonstrably strengthened, enhanced, or upgraded       relations with Taiwan; and        (3) consider, in certain cases as appropriate, in alignment       with United States foreign policy interests and in       consultation with Congress, altering its economic, security,       and diplomatic engagement with nations that take serious or       significant actions to undermine the security or prosperity       of Taiwan.        (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the       enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for five       years, the Secretary of State shall report to the appropriate       congressional committees on the steps taken in accordance       with subsection (a).        (c) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this       section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees''       means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Relations, the Committee on       Appropriations, and the Committee on Finance of the Senate;       and        (2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Committee on       Appropriations, and the Committee on Ways and Means of the       House of Representatives.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 1678.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the United States shares a special relationship with  Taiwan, rooted in a wide range of shared values. Yes, Taiwan is a  vibrant democracy. That is the core of our friendship. At the same  time, Taiwan is a model global citizen, making extraordinary  contributions to global health, aviation safety, and other areas aimed  at improving people's lives. It is this spirit of generosity and  commitment to building a safer, more stable world that makes Taiwan  such a valuable partner.   This stands in sharp relief to the record of the People's Republic of  China. It is a comparison the Chinese Government doesn't seem to like,  based on the PRC's constant attempt to restrict Taiwan's ability to  operate on the global stage, including efforts by Beijing to poach  Taiwan's diplomatic partners.   The Chinese Government is a bully. They want to try to isolate  Taiwan, and their tactics shouldn't go unanswered.   This bill, the TAIPEI Act, would help us provide a part of that  answer. It calls on the administration to examine our policies toward  countries that take steps that undermine Taiwan. It calls on the  administration to take additional steps to ensure that Taiwan can  participate in international organizations, and supports Taiwan's  efforts to build stronger partnerships with other countries around the  world.   However, perhaps the most important thing that we can do for Taiwan  is to push the U.S. Trade Representative to look for new ways to ramp  up bilateral trade and economic ties with Taiwan. Giving Taiwan  economic alternatives will be critical for Taiwan's economic future and  will benefit the United States.   This is good legislation, and it sends a strong and important message  to our friends in Taiwan and to the Chinese Government.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad to support this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                  Washington, DC, February 25, 2020.      Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: In recognition of the desire to       expedite consideration of S. 1678, ``Taiwan Allies       International Protection and Enhancement Initiative Act of       2019,'' the Committee on Ways and Means agrees to waive       formal consideration of the bill as to provisions that fall       within the rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and       Means.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letter on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of S. 1678.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard E. Neal,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, February 27, 2020.      Hon. Richard E. Neal,      Committee on Ways and Means,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal: I am writing to you concerning S. 1678,       the Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement       Initiative (TAIPEI) Act of 2019. I appreciate your       willingness to work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means under House       Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on S. 1678       to expedite floor consideration. I further acknowledge that       the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill does       not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the matters       contained in the bill that fall within your jurisdiction. I       will also support the appointment of Committee on Ways and       Means conferees during any House-Senate conference convened       on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,                                                          Chairman.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, when China works to intimidate and isolate a partner of  the United States, one that shares our values, our commitment to  democracy, our vision for engagement around, we should stand by our  partner's side. That is what American leadership is supposed to look  like.   That is exactly what we see happening with Taiwan, and if we really  support the U.S.-Taiwan partnership, we need to help our partner get  out  [[Page H1454]]  from under China's thumb. This bill would help to do that and would  send a clear signal of the importance we place on the U.S.-China  relationship.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill so we can send  it to the President's desk, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 230) expressing the sense of the House of  Representatives that the United States condemns all forms of violence  against children globally and recognizes the harmful impacts of  violence against children, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 230         Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that       the United States condemns all forms of violence against       children globally and recognizes the harmful impacts of       violence against children.        Whereas violence against children can take many forms,       including sexual violence, physical violence, emotional       violence, abuse, neglect, and exploitation;        Whereas, each year, more than 1,000,000,000 children       worldwide are exposed to violence;        Whereas, each year, the global economic impact of physical,       psychological, and sexual violence against children is       estimated to be as high as $7,000,000,000,000, which is 8       percent of global gross domestic product (``global GDP'');        Whereas, around the world, an estimated 1 in 3 adolescent       girls between 15 and 19 years of age, or 84,000,000 girls,       have been victims of emotional, physical, or sexual violence,       which is often perpetrated by individuals the girls know;        Whereas 1 in 5 girls in the developing world is said to be       married before reaching 18 years of age and, of those girls,       an estimated 1 in 9 is said to be married before reaching 15       years of age;        Whereas, according to the United Nations Children's Fund       (``UNICEF''), if current child marriage rates continue,       120,000,000 girls, an average of 12,000,000 girls a year,       will be married before their 18th birthday over the next       decade;        Whereas 246,000,000 boys and girls experience school-      related, gender-based violence each year;        Whereas children with disabilities reportedly are 3 to 4       times more likely to experience physical or sexual violence;        Whereas the tens of millions of children living outside of       family care, including those living on the streets, working       away from home, or in residential care, are particularly       vulnerable to violence and abuse;        Whereas an estimated 152,000,000 children are involved in       child labor and 4,300,000 children are subject to forced       labor, including in situations of trafficking;        Whereas nearly half of the 68,500,000 individuals who are       currently displaced by conflict and war around the world are       children, and displacement exposes those children to       increased risk of exploitation, violence, and abuse;        Whereas, according to the United Nations, from 2016 to       2017, verified cases of child recruitment, including forcible       recruitment, and child participation in armed conflict--        (1) quadrupled in the Central African Republic;        (2) doubled in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; and        (3) persisted at alarming levels in Somalia, South Sudan,       the Syrian Arab Republic, and Yemen;        Whereas more than 10,000 children were killed or maimed in       2017 in armed conflict;        Whereas the risks of online abuse and exploitation of       children is constantly growing, with the National Center for       Missing and Exploited Children reviewing cases involving       25,000,000 child sexual abuse images in 2015, up from 450,000       in 2004;        Whereas unaddressed exposure to violence disrupts the       development of critical brain architecture and other organ       structures, leaving children at lifelong risk of disease and       reduced potential;        Whereas studies show toxic stress relating to exposure to       violent or dangerous environments becomes damaging to       learning, behavior, and health across a lifespan;        Whereas violence against children can lead to negative       health consequences, including injury, noncommunicable and       communicable diseases, and poor maternal and child health       outcomes;        Whereas all forms of violence in childhood have a       significant negative impact on educational outcomes,       including by reducing school attendance and increasing       dropout rates, and can further limit access to the physical,       mental health, psychosocial, and cognitive protections that       safe educational settings provide;        Whereas decades of behavioral and social science research       have demonstrated that building adaptive capacities, known as       resilience, through stable and committed relationships with a       supportive caregiver or other adult can lessen the harmful       developmental effects of violence in children and youth;        Whereas, according to the Organization for Economic Co-      operation and Development, the United States invests 0.5       percent of official development assistance in programs that       are designed to prevent and address violence against children       and youth;        Whereas the United States, in coordination with public-      private partnerships and other organizations, has endorsed       the technical package called ``INSPIRE: Seven Strategies for       Ending Violence against Children'' (referred to in this       preamble as ``INSPIRE'') put forth by the World Health       Organization with substantial technical input from the United       States Government, including from the Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention and United States Agency for       International Development;        Whereas INSPIRE contains 7 evidence-based strategies to end       violence against children that include--        (1) implementing and enforcing relevant laws;        (2) addressing harmful gender and other social norms;        (3) creating and sustaining safe communities;        (4) supporting parents and caregivers;        (5) improving household economic security to reduce       violence in the home;        (6) improving access to health services, social welfare,       and criminal justice support; and        (7) ensuring safe school environments that provide gender-      equitable education and social-emotional learning and life       skills training; and        Whereas the United States Agency for International       Development, the Department of State, the Department of       Labor, the Department of Homeland Security, and the       Department of Health and Human Services each play a critical       role in preventing and responding to violence against       children and youth: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of       Representatives that the United States--        (1) condemns all forms of violence against children and       youth globally, including physical, mental, and sexual       violence, neglect, abuse, maltreatment, and exploitation; and        (2) should--        (A) develop and implement a comprehensive and coordinated       strategy built on evidence-based practices, including the       technical package called ``INSPIRE: Seven Strategies for       Ending Violence against Children'' put forth by the World       Health Organization; and        (B) adopt common metrics and indicators to monitor progress       across Federal agencies to prevent, address, and end violence       against children and youth globally, including harmful       impacts of violence on the healthy development of children       and the harmful economic impact of violence against children       and youth globally.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 230.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure, and I thank  the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), my colleague, for his  hard work in bringing this resolution forward.   More than a billion children worldwide are exposed to violence each  year. This can take the form of sexual violence, physical violence,  abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Adolescent girls are an especially  vulnerable group. One in three girls between the ages of 15 and 17  experience violent acts and are often the victims of someone they know.  Children with disabilities are reportedly three to four times  [[Page H1455]]  likelier to experience physical or sexual abuse.   This violence has a lifetime impact on the health and well-being of a  growing child and on their community. Children who experience violence  have higher rates of anxiety and depression and are at greater risk of  suicide. These traumatic events have a lasting impact, from reduced  neurological functions, to poorer educational outcomes, to higher rates  of early and child marriage.   Children should feel safe at home, in school, and in their  communities. But it is in these places that most violence against  children occurs, often at the hands of people they see every day. These  abuses shape their lives forever.   Violence against children can be prevented. Implementing appropriate  laws, reinforcing positive norms and values, creating safe  environments, and providing support to children and their caregivers  can help to address the risk of violence perpetrated against children.   This resolution puts the House on record, saying the United States  condemns all forms of violence--including physical, mental, and sexual  violence--against children.   In addition, the resolution urges the United States to adopt  evidence-based strategies to combat violence against children as part  of the World Health Organization's INSPIRE program, and it urges the  administration to develop indicators and evaluation tools to monitor  violence against young people globally across Federal agencies.   Mr. Speaker, it is a good measure. I am glad to support it, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                          Committee on Education and                                 Labor, House of Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, February 28, 2020.      Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, House Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: I write concerning H. Res. 230,       Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the       United States condemns all forms of violence against children       globally and recognizes the harmful impacts of violence       against children. This resolution was primarily referred to       the Committee on Education and Labor, and additionally to the       Committees on Foreign Affairs. As a result of Leadership and       Foreign Affairs having consulted with me concerning this bill       generally, I agree to forgo formal consideration of the bill       so the bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        The Committee on Education and Labor takes this action with       our mutual understanding that by forgoing formal       consideration of H. Res. 230, we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and we will be appropriately consulted       and involved as the resolution or similar legislation moves       forward so we may address any remaining issue within our Rule       X jurisdiction. I also request that you support my request to       name members of the Committee on Education and Labor to any       conference committee to consider such provisions.        Finally, I would appreciate a response confirming this       understanding and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters       on this matter be included in the committee report for H.       Res. 230 and in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration thereof.            Very truly yours,                                         Robert C. ``Bobby'' Scott,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, February 28, 2020.      Hon. Bobby Scott,      Committee on Education and Labor,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott: I am writing to you concerning H. Res.       230, Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives       that the United States condemns all forms of violence against       children globally and recognizes the harmful impacts of       violence against children. I appreciate your willingness to       work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Education and Labor under       House Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H.       Res. 230, to expedite floor consideration. I further       acknowledge that the inaction of your Committee with respect       to the bill does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       over the matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction. I will also support the appointment of       Committee on Education and Labor conferees during any House-      Senate conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), my friend, the author of this important  resolution, a champion of human rights, and the co-chair of the Tom  Lantos Human Rights Commission.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank Congressman McGovern for his hard work on  this measure. He has been a tireless advocate for children and  protecting children around the world.   American leadership on this issue is absolutely vital. Ensuring the  safety of our children today safeguards the future of our communities  tomorrow.   Protecting children across the world must be an American foreign  policy priority. We owe it to our younger generations everywhere the  best shot possible at a full, healthy, and prosperous life.   Mr. Speaker, this is an excellent measure. I am pleased to be a  cosponsor, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it. I yield back  the balance of my time.
