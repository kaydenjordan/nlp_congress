 Mr. Speaker, if a President decides to deploy troops  domestically, the very least we can do as Congress is demand the same  level of transparency that we expect when our troops are sent abroad.   It is true that the Insurrection Act was used to integrate Little  Rock Central High School and the University of Mississippi. It is also  true that it was used to crush slave revolts and labor organizing.   This amendment will go a long way towards helping inform Congress and  the American people how a President intends to use the authority.   This is not an abstract conversation. When the President threatened  to invoke the Insurrection Act recently, he was threatening my  constituents and our constituents. Unmistakably, he was threatening  people exercising their First Amendment rights.   There can be genuine emergencies when these powers are needed. We  must protect against all possible abuses in situations where the  emergencies do not exist.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, October of next year will mark 20 years since  the war in Afghanistan started. That is a generation of devastation in  Afghanistan, a generation of our men and women in uniform being sent to  fight and die for a war with no exit strategy. And still, to this day,  there are people saying that we shouldn't be too hasty in leaving.   Too hasty? It has been two decades.   Mr. Speaker, there will never be a perfect time to withdraw our  troops. There will never be a time when making the right decision does  not include some risks.   Our obligation to Afghanistan's stability will not end when our  troops leave. My amendment sets a clear timeline and clear  Congressional intent that we must end our country's longest war.   Mr. Speaker, we put this debate in context. I want to say this  amendment was offered by my friend, Chairman McGovern, 7 years ago. It  passed the House in 2013 with the majority of both parties voting in  favor. During that debate, Mr. McGovern stood on the floor and said:  ``The future and fate of tens of thousands of uniformed men and women  deserve a vote.'' The House took that vote, and 305 Members of this  body voted to end the war in Afghanistan.   Yet, since then, we have had 7 years of fighting and sustained  violence, 7 years of civilian casualties, 7 years of servicemembers  being forced to say good-bye to their families and subjected to a  terrible trauma.   In many ways, it is baffling to me that I have to do this, but I echo  Mr. McGovern's words from 2013: The future and fate of thousands of  uniformed men and women deserve a vote.   As a survivor of war, I can tell you that even 1 more minute of  conflict comes with a cost that is too great for most to imagine.   Finally, I say that I do not believe that the end of military  engagement should be the end of our obligation to the Afghanistan  people. Mr. Speaker, my amendment calls for a comprehensive peace plan  that includes all sectors of civil society. It calls for renewed  engagement on diplomacy and development. It calls us to fulfill our  moral and strategic obligation but not to risk one more life of  American servicemembers in a war with no clear objective.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, the last time this amendment was voted on in  2013, again, it got 305 Members of this body to vote for it. Nothing  has changed since then.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), the only Member of the House to vote against the  2001 authorization for war.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
