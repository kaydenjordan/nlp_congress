 Mr. President, every Member of Congress vividly  remembers his or her path toward engagement in our government. Some  have been more circuitous than others, but we all remember how that  spark was ignited and how action ensued.   Katherine Wetherton, a freshman at the University of Louisville,  hopes to kindle that passion for civic engagement in young women, and  part of her strategy was to write a book targeted toward middle and  high school students entitled, ``She Rocks the Vote.'' She distributes  it through the seminars and workshops she conducts for students and at  the Little Free Library that she built and installed in her hometown in  Oldham County.   A results-focused young woman, Kate was active in Girl Scouts for 13  years and completed her Girl Scout Gold Award, which is achieved by  only about 5 percent of Girl Scouts. And while she  [[Page S2784]]  has big plans for her education, including graduate school, she doesn't  intend to stop connecting girls and young women with the information  and skills they need to become involved at every level of government.   I am proud to recognize Kate for her accomplishments and leadership,  and to encourage her future endeavors.                            ____________________
