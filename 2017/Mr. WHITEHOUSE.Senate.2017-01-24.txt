 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Republicans in Congress have been on  the warpath for a long time to repeal the Affordable Care Act. In fact,  in this new Congress, their first order of business has been to pave  the way for dismantling this law. Despite the fact that 20 million  Americans have gained health insurance coverage thanks to this law,  despite people no longer being denied coverage for preexisting  conditions, despite big savings in health care costs, and despite  everyone with insurance being able to access important preventive  health services for free, my Republican colleagues have decided to  repeal it. And, after 7 years to get ready, they have no replacement,  not even a path to a replacement at this point.   Yes, they are set on repealing a law that has provided both health  and financial security to millions of Americans, with no replacement in  sight, just at this point some empty IOU for some future piece of  legislation that may or may not be any good. It is a little like being  asked to jump out of an airplane without a parachute and being told:  Trust us. We will build the parachute for you before you hit the  ground.   We don't know what this nonexistent Republican replacement would look  [[Page S422]]  like, but we sure do know what a repeal would do; it would gut health  insurance premium tax credits that help millions of Americans obtain  health insurance they could not otherwise afford. It would unwind an  expansion of the Medicaid Program that covers millions more Americans  in some 30 States that have chosen to participate, casting tens of  millions of Americans--men, women, and children--out of their health  insurance.   At the same time, it would deliver an enormous tax boon to  millionaires and billionaires, as usual for Republicans, by repealing  the revenue we used to pay for ObamaCare. This tax boon is a 16-percent  reduction in the taxes owed by millionaires and billionaires on their  investment income.   Republicans want to take health insurance away from tens of millions  of ordinary Americans and simultaneously reward those at the very top  of the income pile with a big tax benefit. So much for all the talk we  have heard from Republicans about the deficit.   At least in Rhode Island, the Affordable Care Act is working. The law  launched accountable care organizations that are improving care while  lowering costs. In Rhode Island, Coastal Medical and Integra Community  Care Network--two primary care-focused ACOs--are not only driving down  per person health expenditures but achieving high marks on quality and  on patient experience. In total, Coastal has saved $24 million over 3  years and Integra has saved $4 million in its first year as an ACO.   The Affordable Care Act also has protected seniors from the dreaded  drug price doughnut hole, and I can tell you I heard a lot about the  doughnut hole from seniors in Rhode Island when I was running for the  Senate. The Affordable Care Act has protected families where someone  had a chronic condition and couldn't get insurance, and the Affordable  Care Act has prevented insurers from throwing customers off coverage  when they get sick.   It is true that some of the health insurance exchanges haven't  attracted enough competition. We can fix that. Indeed, to help with  that issue, Senators Brown, Franken, and I are today introducing the  Consumer Health Options and Insurance Competition Enhancement Act, or  the CHOICE Act, to add a public health insurance option to the health  insurance exchanges. This public option would guarantee that consumers  always have an affordable, high-quality option when shopping for health  insurance and a strong health care fallback when markets fail.   ObamaCare may not be perfect, but it has done an awful lot of good.  Millions of Americans who lacked insurance now have it, and the rate of  uninsured Americans has fallen to 8.6 percent, about half of what it  was in 2010. Projected Federal health care costs are down nearly $3  trillion.   Instead of demolishing a system that works well for millions of  Americans with no replacement on the horizon, let's use our proposal to  make it better. Let's add a public option to our health insurance  exchanges.    Mr. President, if I could address another topic now  and ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes in morning  business.    Mr. President, the question I bring to the floor  today is what is Scott Pruitt hiding? Last week, the Environment and  Public Works Committee held a hearing on President Trump's nominee to  the Environmental Protection Agency. Today, for my 155th ``Time to Wake  Up'' speech, I have unanswered questions about Mr. Pruitt's fitness for  that role. His evasiveness at his hearing signaled nothing good about  his ties to the industry he would regulate if confirmed, and the lack  of curiosity about these industry ties from my Republican colleagues  speaks volumes about the political clout of that industry.   One question stood out. Our new chairman, Senator Barrasso, posed the  standard question of nominees to Mr. Pruitt in our hearing: ``Do you  know of any matters, which you may or may not have disclosed, that  might place you in any conflict of interest if you are confirmed?''   Mr. Pruitt answered: ``No.''   Scott Pruitt crawls with conflict of interest. He has conflicts of  interest with the fossil fuel industry from his political fundraising.  We just don't know how bad. He likely has conflicts of interest from  confidential private meetings with fossil fuel companies at Republican  Attorneys General Association get-togethers, but we just don't know how  bad. There is almost certainly evidence of conflict of interest in his  undisclosed emails with fossil fuel companies, but again we don't know  how bad. He came clean on none of this in his confirmation hearing.   This chart is a simple, and a likely incomplete, representation of  the many financial links reported between Pruitt and the fossil fuel  industry. At the top are the companies and the entities that have  supported Mr. Pruitt with political funding. Down below are the  political organizations for which he has raised money.   Pruitt for Attorney General was his reelection campaign. The  polluters gave to Pruitt for Attorney General. Oklahoma's Strong PAC  was his leadership PAC, a separate political fundraising vehicle. The  polluters gave to Oklahoma Strong.   There was another one here called Liberty 2.0, Mr. Pruitt's super  PAC, but he closed it down so we don't list it. While it existed, his  super PAC took nearly $200,000 in fossil fuel industry contributions.  Mr. Pruitt served as the chair of the Republican Attorneys General  Association in 2012 and 2013 and was a member of RAGA's executive  committee through 2015. Between 2014 and 2016, RAGA received $530,000  from Koch Industries. It received $350,000 from Murray Energy. It  received $160,000 from ExxonMobil, and it received $125,000 from Devon  Energy.   Devon Energy, by the way, is the company whose letter Mr. Pruitt  transposed virtually verbatim onto his official letterhead to send to  the EPA as the official position of the Oklahoma attorney general.   During his hearing, Mr. Pruitt refused to provide details about any  solicitations he made from regulated industries for the Republican  Attorneys General Association. We know they got special attention from  RAGA. Here is a confidential 2015 meeting agenda from RAGA when Pruitt  was on its executive committee. I ask unanimous consent to have printed  in the Record the meeting agenda page.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:      RAGA Summer National Meeting 2015, The Greenbrier, West Virginia                                MEETING AGENDA         The Greenbrier; 300 West Main Street, White Sulphur       Springs, WV; (855) 616-2441.

Sunday, August 2, 2015         A Cyber Lounge and Hospitality Suite are provided all day       for your convenience by Rent-A-Center in the Chesapeake Bay       Room        7:00 AM-10:30 AM--Breakfast (on your own); Location: Main       Dining Room; *Breakfast is included, please provide your room       key to the waiter.

This confidential agenda mentions a private meeting  [[Page S423]]  with Murray Energy. It mentions a private meeting with Southern  Company, and it mentions a private meeting with American Fuel  Petrochemical Manufacturers, which represents a lot of these  characters. Murray Energy, of course, is right there. Southern Company  is right there, and the American Fuel Petrochemical Manufacturers  organization, I am sure, represents the others.   This confidential meeting agenda is all we have about what took place  in those private meetings. I asked Mr. Pruitt in our hearings about the  content of these private meetings, and he wouldn't answer any  questions. He doesn't want us to know what was discussed there with the  big fossil fuel polluters--companies whose pollution he will oversee as  EPA Administrator.   Pruitt was also a chairman of the Rule of Law Defense Fund. The so- called Rule of Law Defense Fund is a dark money political operation  that launders the identity of donors giving money to the Republican  Attorneys General Association. As the New York Times said, the fund is  a ``legal entity that allows companies benefiting from the actions of  Mr. Pruitt and other Republican attorneys general to make anonymous  donations, in unlimited amounts.'' It is a complete black hole of  political cash.   In the hearing, Pruitt refused to shine any light into the dark money  he solicited or received from these fossil fuel polluters or others for  the Rule of Law Defense Fund--not whom he asked for money, not who gave  money, not what they gave, nothing. This is an organization that  appears to have a million-dollar-a-year budget so someone was busy  raising a lot of money. How much exactly, from whom, and what was the  deal? Scott Pruitt doesn't want our committee or this Senate or the  American people to know.   Colleagues and I sent letters to the Office of Government Ethics and  to the Environmental Protection Agency's top ethics official. Their  responses indicate that their ethics rules predate Citizens United and  its torrent of dark political money. Their regulatory authority on  government ethics has not caught up with the post-Citizens United dark  money world. Since their ethics authorities have not been updated for  these dark money conflicts, if Pruitt doesn't disclose any of this  information before the Senate, no one will know, and even those  government ethics watchdogs may end up blind to conflicts of interest.   That doesn't mean there isn't a conflict of interest here. What it  means is it is a hidden conflict of interest. That makes it our duty in  the Senate to examine those relationships, except for the fact that the  fossil fuel industry now, more or less, runs the Republican Party, so  there is a scrupulous lack of interest in this fossil fuel industry  dark money.   How badly does Mr. Pruitt want to hide his dealings with his fossil  fuel patrons? An Open Records Act request was filed with the Oklahoma  attorney general's office--Mr. Pruitt's office--for emails with energy  firms, fossil fuel trade groups, and their political arms, with  companies like Devon Energy, Murray Energy, and Koch Industries, and  the American Petroleum Institute, which is the industry's trade  association.   Let me share three facts about this Open Records Act inquiry: No. 1,  the Open Records Act request was filed more than 745 days ago--over 2  years, 2 years. No. 2, Pruitt's office has admitted that there are at  least 3,000 responsive documents to that Open Records Act request.  Consider that fact alone for a moment. There were 3,000 emails and  other documents between his office and these fossil fuel companies and  front groups--3,000. No. 3, zero, exactly zero of those documents have  been produced--745 days, 3,000 documents, zero produced.   Think how smelly those 3,000 emails must be when he would rather have  this flagrant Open Records Act compliance failure than have any of  those 3,000 emails see the light of day. Given the important financial  interests of these groups before the EPA, do we really not think that  3,000 emails back and forth between him and his office and those groups  might be relevant to his conflicts of interest as Administrator? Until  very recently, Republicans had a keen interest in emails. Chairman  Barrasso asked that important question: ``Do you know of any matters  which you may or may not have disclosed that might place you in any  conflict of interest if you are confirmed?'' Scott Pruitt answered:  ``No.''    On this record, there is every reason to believe that his statement  is false. Might having raised significant dark money from the industry  that he would regulate create a conflict of interest? Let's say that he  made a call to Devon Energy and said: I slapped your letter on my  letterhead and turned it in as if it were the official work of the  Oklahoma attorney general's office. Now I need a million bucks. And you  can give it to the Rule of Law Defense Fund as dark money, without  anyone knowing that it was you.   Might such a quid pro quo create a conflict of interest in his  ability to carry out the duties of EPA Administrator in matters  affecting Devon Energy? It is impossible to say that it would not be a  conflict of interest.   Let's say that at those confidential private meetings with Murray  Energy and Southern Company, something went on. Might something that  takes place in private meetings with Big Energy interests that he is  going to have to regulate create a possible conflict of interest? They  paid to be there. They wanted something. Might that not give rise to a  conflict of interest?   And who knows what conflicts of interest would be divulged if his  office were not sitting on 3,000 undisclosed emails with fossil fuel  industries that he will be regulating as EPA Administrator?   I challenge anyone to come to this Senate floor and tell me with a  straight face that there is nothing that those emails could reveal that  might create a conflict of interest for the man discharged with  regulating the companies on the other end of those emails. ``No'' just  doesn't cut it as an answer from Mr. Pruitt when there is still so much  that he is hiding.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Patrick  Reilly, a fellow in my office, be granted floor privileges for the  remainder of this Congress.
