 Madam Speaker, Angelic Health Hospice Care recently cut  the ribbon for their new headquarters in Atlantic County, New Jersey.   Their staff provides palliative, hospice, and transitional care  services and wound management to patients in south Jersey. Although  they have only been operating for a short time, Angelic Health already  employs over 200 employees, and they provide great care to over 100  seniors.   What makes Angelic Health special is that they go above and beyond  for their patients. They don't make their patients come to their  facilities. They go to them, whenever they can, to wherever they can  that their patients call home.   They don't only give care for their patients; they also provide  professional support to the families. And they just don't treat  physical ailments. Angelic Health gives the patients social, spiritual,  and emotional support as well.   I want to thank the staff and the volunteers of Angelic Health who  have made our community a more loving place for our seniors and for  their families. We are lucky to have them. They have truly impacted  lives in south Jersey.                            ____________________
