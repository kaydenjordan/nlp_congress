 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring transparency and  attention to a bill coming for a vote before this House tomorrow.   H.R. 986, the so-called Protecting Americans With Preexisting  Conditions Act, is undoubtedly one of the most deceptive bills to come  before this Congress.   The bill does not once mention protecting those with preexisting  conditions. The only place those words appear is in the title.   The bill merely prevents States from opting out of two provisions of  ObamaCare, and neither of those provisions protect those with  preexisting conditions.   Some wrongly believe that the American people won't read beyond the  title of a bill. They are wrong. They will. Americans care.   There is enough real division in this country. House Democratic  leadership shouldn't willfully manufacture discord through deception.   Furthermore, as someone with a preexisting medical condition, I find  it loathsome that anyone would use our health for their political  games. These are real Americans with real illnesses, and they deserve  actions, not games.                            ____________________
