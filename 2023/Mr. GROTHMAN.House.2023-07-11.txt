 Mr. Speaker, I am here today to highlight the important  work the House is doing in the 118th Congress to hold the Biden  administration accountable.   My colleagues are familiar with all we are doing with regard to  looking at student loan agreements, the abusive pandemic-era policies,  but today, I want to focus on something the administration is doing at  the southern border that it has no business doing.   Their new unlawful use of the CBP1 app is allowing an even greater  number of people to come across our border. In addition to people, the  got-aways, in addition to the family units, in addition to the  unaccompanied minors, we have people using an app to sign up and wind  up coming into our country.   In the current fiscal year, in each one of the 9 months, we had for  that month an all-time record number of people coming here. I think in  part because of the use of this app, the slumbering press corps is not  paying attention to that.   Let me repeat that one more time. In each of the last 9 months, we  had an all-time high in the number of people coming into the United  States.   This is an absolute scandal. I am glad our committee is taking it on,  and I  [[Page H3194]]  hope the press corps pays a little bit more attention to this invasion.                            ____________________
