 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend  from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), the chair, Mr. Takano, and also Dr. Roe,  the ranking member and former chair of the Veterans' Affairs Committee,  for all the work they do for our veterans.   It was at a meeting with Dr. Roe in Springfield, Illinois, last  summer that he heard from my constituents who represented the 13  colleges that I am blessed to represent in central Illinois. They got  together, and they talked about the GI Bill Work Study Improvement Act  language that is included in this bill right now.   Section 5 of this bill contains our improvement language, and I  really want to thank Susie Lee, my colleague. I want to thank Dr. Roe  again and my colleague,   Mike Bost, from Illinois because this  legislation creates a block grant program to disburse the funding that  would normally be used by the VA to administer their workstudy program.   We heard from the college administrators. It wasn't going well as is;  they were leaving veterans behind. They didn't know if the students  were going to be able to enroll, and the colleges didn't know when they  were going to get the money. This is a fix that came directly from  listening to the people who are serving our veterans at our educational  institutions.   This is what bipartisanship looks like. It is an idea that comes from  people who are affected, and those who are  [[Page H7211]]  affected are our heroes who protect our great Nation. This change is  necessary, this change is bipartisan, and this change is long overdue.  I want to thank everybody again for working on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill.
