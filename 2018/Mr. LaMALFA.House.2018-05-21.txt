 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to commend our Secretary of  State, Mike Pompeo, for his first major foreign policy speech this  morning.   Secretary Pompeo didn't mince words, saying Iran would be hit with  the strongest sanctions in history if their government does not change  their aggressive behavior in the Middle East.   After rightly pulling the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal, this  administration has made it clear: They are willing to actually solve  the Iran problem, unlike the previous administration or those before  that.   Secretary Pompeo laid out the conditions Iran must meet: cease their  nuclear program; end support for terrorist groups such as Hamas, al  Qaida, and Hezbollah; and withdraw from Syria, among others.   It is a long list of actions, but as Secretary Pompeo noted, it is a  list of Iran's own creation, not ours.   I want to see a peaceful Middle East as well, a solution for the  people of Iran themselves--next year will be 40 years under this type  of regime. Before that, they had freedom--especially for the women of  Iran that would like to enjoy the freedoms to associate as they see  fit.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Secretary Pompeo for his  commitment to researching an agreement and holding Iran accountable.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from New Jersey (Mr.  Smith) and the rest of my colleagues who have spoken up here as well.   This is a great opportunity to, I think, shed light on some truth on  what this really means with title X, what has gone on in the last  couple decades, really.   The proposed Protect Life Rule used to be the way of doing business  in this country for the way funding would be directed to those  providing health services. In recent years, a significant portion of  that has been now allowed to go towards those who are providing  abortions.   A key element to always remember is abortion is not family planning.  This rule we are talking about here that I urge President Trump to move  forward with would draw, indeed, a very bright line between abortion  and family planning, as was clearly intended in the statute. Currently,  266 Planned Parenthood abortion centers are also funded under Federal  title X locations.   So what is the general opinion of the public on this? Nearly two- thirds of Americans do not believe that their dollars should be funding  abortions. America's taxpayers don't want this. They don't want to be  complicit in it. They don't want to be a part of it.   So what is the effect? Family planning funding will not be reduced by  a single dollar. It is just which services will be provided by which  locations is the question here.   The Protect Life Rule would not decrease title X funding by a single  dollar but, instead, will be directing those dollars to the sites  willing to comply.   Less than 500 of the roughly already 4,000 title X services under the  current rule are Planned Parenthood facilities, less than 500 out of  4,000. So for those claiming that only Planned Parenthood provides  these, in some cases, so-called services, there are plenty of those  places that are already doing that without Planned Parenthood's help.  Indeed, this will provide more opportunities for women and girls to  find locations that will provide health services with the dollars going  where they are so desperately needed--rural America, especially.   It doesn't have to be just Planned Parenthood, as we would hear so  much from the other side of the aisle who desperately defends them at  every turn. Clinton-era regulations allowed funding for abortion  centers and required all grantees under title X to refer for abortions.   What about those centers and those facilities that have a conscience  on this issue? They don't want to have that. We are going through that  in California right now. It is going in front of the Supreme Court,  whether it is right or not or constitutional to force pro-life centers  to refer for abortions. Clinton-era regulations require that as well.  [[Page H4275]]    In the new Protect Life Rule being put forward, I hope President  Trump and his administration follow through on it to help protect those  freedoms to decide if those centers want to be part of that or not.  Indeed, centers that don't promote and push abortion will be the ones  that come forward and receive this type of funding that is so necessary  and the right thing that the American people and the majority want to  see happen.   So I commend this effort. I commend the administration for  contemplating and pushing through with this. I thank my colleague, Mr.  Smith, for always being that strong voice for what is right. Well done,  sir.
