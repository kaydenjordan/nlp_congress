 Madam Speaker, and still I rise, with love of  country in my heart.   And still I rise, as I did some 659 days ago, more than 21 months,  when I first stood on the floor of the House of Representatives and  called for the impeachment of the President. In so doing, I had to fend  off the multitudes who wanted to know what crime the President had  committed, what law did he break.   We had to fight that fight, and we won, because it is now generally  perceived and believed that the President does not have to commit a  crime to be impeached.   In fact, Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution of the United  States of America addresses that question when it deals with high  crimes and misdemeanors as misdemeanors or misdeeds, pursuant to the  understanding that we have of the Constitution of the United States of  America.   And still I rise now, understanding that we have had to fend off  those who have said: You have to wait for the Mueller report. You have  to wait. Why not wait?   Here is why you don't have to wait: Because the Mueller report is  dealing with violations of the law. Misdeeds don't necessarily require  a violation of the law.   If you are corrupting society, if you are creating harm to society,  if you are causing things to happen in society that are unacceptable to  the people in the United States of America, an unfit President can be  impeached for those misdeeds that corrupt and harm society.   We are winning that fight. This fight is one that is easily won  because, as we proceed, it is going to become intuitively obvious that  these misdeeds are the problems, and the misdeeds are creating the  concerns in society.   It is my belief that we have a duty, a responsibility, and an  obligation under the Constitution to deal with an unfit President.   There are those who would want me to withhold my thoughts until after  there has been an investigation, when we have clear and convincing  evidence before our very eyes of the misdeeds: separating babies from  their mothers, who happen to be of color, I might add; talking about s- hole countries that happen to be where people of color live, I might  add; talking about good people, or very fine people, in  Charlottesville, among those who are bigots, racists, xenophobes,  homophobes, and Islamophobes.   Yes, the evidence is there, because the President was putting in his  policies these bigoted statements. These statements went beyond his  words. They became a part of his policies. For this, he can be  impeached.   I stand where I stood 659 days ago, and I will continue to stand  until this President is removed from office.   We can investigate to the extent that we engage in what Dr. King  called the paralysis of analysis, just investigate until it is time for  another election, and then the election becomes the focal point.   My dear friends, my dear brothers and sisters, those who desire to  wait may do so. I will not wait. Impeachment is not dead.                            ____________________
