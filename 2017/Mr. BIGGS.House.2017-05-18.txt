 Mr. Speaker, last week I again visited the Arizona-Mexico  border. I examined border fencing in the city of Nogales, on the Tohono  O'odham Indian Reservation, and a working cattle ranch. As an Arizona  native, I have visited the border many times, and each time I am  disheartened by what I see.   Much of the fencing I saw last week would do little to keep illegal  aliens from crossing the border. In failing to construct a wall, we are  allowing anyone to enter the United States.   Border Patrol agents are outnumbered by illegal aliens, drug cartel  scouts, and human smugglers. The technology in place is woefully  inadequate. There is no question that our citizens along the border are  in danger and our national security is in peril due to the unknown  identities of those crossing our border.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump won by promising to build a border wall.  I unequivocally stand with him, but building the wall is only the first  step to securing our border. We must also increase the number of Border  Patrol agents, invest in cutting-edge technology, and fully enforce our  immigration laws. These expenditures and efforts are necessary and  worth the cost. It is time to do what we said we would do.                            ____________________
