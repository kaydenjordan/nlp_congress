 Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the Women's  Committee of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Miami as the members gear up  to celebrate the 17th annual Miracle Makers Fashion Show and Luncheon  on April 27.   Through its mentoring programs, Big Brothers Big Sisters of Miami has  given our community over 50 years of proven success in providing at- risk youth with the tools and resources to discover their true  potential and thrive in their personal, academic, and professional  lives.   Thanks to the invaluable dedication of its staff and volunteers, Big  Brothers Big Sisters of Miami has rightfully earned its reputation as  the gold standard of mentoring youngsters.   The upcoming Miracle Makers Fashion Show will highlight some of our  community's most outstanding miracle makers while bringing attention to  the positive impact that mentoring has on our youth.   I encourage all south Floridians who want to give back to our  community to lend their time and their support to Big Brothers Big  Sisters of Miami. Together, we can make a brighter future for all.                            ____________________
