 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas, Chairman  Hensarling, for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill that, really, if you look  at what we are trying to achieve here, it is a few things, but the main  two things are to give further reforms and protections to the taxpayers  of this country while also making sure that we are protecting and  giving certainty to the policyholders of the National Flood Insurance  Program; the fact that this is a 5-year reauthorization; the fact that  we were able to protect the grandfathering provisions that are so  important to families who have played by the rules, and if the rules  are going to change, it is not fair that you would hold something  against somebody that was legal in the past; the fact that this bill  has important reforms, like Ross-Castor.   We all talk about the fact that NFIP is the only place for most  families to go that want to buy flood insurance. We need to develop a  private marketplace, Mr. Speaker, and, frankly, for most families, it  just doesn't exist. Those Ross-Castor provisions are so important to  finally help jump start that process.   This program has had its own financial difficulties, and this bill  helps strengthen the program, helps give some certainty, and, frankly,  it gives some provisions in the bill that are going to make it better  for families who rely on this program, and the taxpayers of this  country, who help make sure that we have a stable economy.   It is important for homeownership, it is important that we maintain  those provisions on grandfathering that were so important to our  communities, and it is important that we pass this bill.   I am glad that the House is taking this action today.   Mr. Speaker, again, I commend Chairman Hensarling and Congressman  Duffy for their hard work, and all the other Members who played such an  important role in getting us to this point.                                time  1600
