 Mr. President, I am pleased to be on the floor this  evening, but I am here to discuss a significantly tragic issue that  affects way too many Americans all across our country--certainly at  home in Kansas--and that is the lack of treatment for mental health  conditions and, in many instances, the consequence that comes from  that--suicide.   Sadly, veterans in particular face risks for suicide, and,  unfortunately, COVID-19 has increased the problem. Veterans have a  higher rate of suicide and mental health issues than people who have  not served in our armed services.   We know there is not a single explanation or reason for suicide, and  there is no single treatment for prevention strategy. One veteran lost  to suicide is one too many, and, of course, we all have the obligation  to help those who have served our Nation--those who fought bravely for  our country--to help fix this tragedy.   Every day that we fail to act is another day we lose another 20  veterans to suicide. They need our help.   I want to highlight one veteran who fought a battle with his mental  health condition, CDR John Scott Hannon. Commander Hannon was a  decorated Navy SEAL. I met his family through the Senator from Montana,  Mr. Tester. He, like every other veteran, was more than just what his  service record would show. His family and friends remember him as a  passionate mental health advocate for veterans. He tried to help other  veterans who faced the same challenges that he did. They say he had a  gentle heart and a fierce belief in taking actions to tackle big  challenges.   Sadly, Commander Hannon lost his fight with post-traumatic stress,  bipolar disorder, and the effects of a traumatic brain injury. He lost  that fight in February 2018. He now lives on in the memories of his  friends and family, and when S. 785 becomes law--the namesake of the  Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement  Act--he will be remembered even more--more by other Americans than his  family and friends.   I am proud to lead this effort in passage of this legislation, in its  development, its creation, in the studies and efforts, the  conversations that went on with my colleagues in the Senate, our  colleagues in the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the veterans service  organizations, and his family. I am proud to lead that effort with the  Senator from Montana, the Senator who represents Commander Hannon's  family.   For several months now, our committee has been working closely with  the Department of Veterans Affairs and the White House to improve upon  and advance S. 785. This bill will make necessary investments in  suicide prevention. It will improve and support innovative research. It  will make improvements and increase the availability of mental health  care   This bill establishes a grant program championed by Mr. Boozman, the  Senator from Arkansas. The VA will be required to better collaborate  with community organizations across the country, serving veterans.   Senator Tester, Senator Boozman, and I come from rural States, and it  is hard to find the services where they are necessary. If we can allow  the Department of Veterans Affairs to deal with local organizations, we  have a better chance of fighting suicide.   This legislation represents a team effort. I appreciate Secretary  Wilkie, David Ballenger, Cathy Haverstock, and Chris Anderson for their  help and commitment in addressing mental health services.   President Trump and his support for veterans is well recognized. The  Second Lady, Karen Pence, has also been a long-time advocate for  veterans' mental health, and I appreciate our conversations on this  important topic. The staff at the White House and at the Domestic  Policy Council--Joe Grogan, Brooke Rollins, James Baehr, and Virginia  McMillin--deserve recognition as well.   The Senate VA committee is known for its spirit of bipartisanship,  and I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their  input on this important legislation. Along with the lead sponsor of  this legislation, Senator Tester, and the efforts I mentioned of  Senator Boozman, I would recognize Senator Sullivan, Senator Tillis,  Senator Cassidy, Senator Rounds, Senator Cramer--the Presiding Officer  this evening--Senator Loeffler, Senator Blackburn, Senator McSally, and  Senator Kaine for their substantive contributions to several primary  sections of this bill.   These contributions by our colleagues range from studies on  overmedication and suicidality, the effectiveness of hyperbaric oxygen  therapy on PTSD and TBI, a pilot program for post-traumatic growth, and  many provisions that will provide more direct oversight of the VA to  ensure the Department is equipped to better serve veterans.   As a result, this bipartisan legislation has 51 cosponsors, and it  received a unanimous 17-to-0 vote in the Senate Committee on Veterans'  Affairs earlier this year, and today is the time we will pass this  measure out of the Senate.   I am calling on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do our  part to make certain that every veteran has access to the lifesaving  care and support they need. We need to ensure that every VA medical  center is equipped with the proper personnel, evidence-based treatment  options, and the best research-informed care to fit the needs of each  veteran who walks through its doors.   For veterans and servicemembers like CDR John Scott Hannon, we, in  Congress, have the opportunity to take action to help them know they  don't have to struggle alone. Our legislation will help connect these  veterans and servicemembers to more resources and provide them with the  tools they need to address the challenges related to their service.   To my colleagues, we have a significant role and responsibility to  combat this struggle, and here today we can do our part to make certain  that, in their struggles, our veterans are equipped with the care and  services they need to be successful, to win. We must take real and  urgent action to tackle the challenges together.                        Additional Cosponsor to S. 785    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Rhode  Island, Mr. Reed, be added as a cosponsor to S. 785.    Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 498, S.  785.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee- reported substitute be withdrawn; that the Moran substitute amendment  at the desk be considered and agreed to; and that the bill, as amended,  be considered read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill, as amended.    Thank you for that. I now ask unanimous consent that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    I yield to the Senator from Montana for his conversation  and discussion about this legislation.    Mr. President, let me extend the courtesies that were  extended to me by the Senator from Montana, Mr. Tester.   It has been a privilege to work with him on this and many other  issues--many of them related to our Nation's service men and women and  those who served and are now veterans.   I appreciate that Senator Tester and I have the ability to work  together to resolve differences and find common ground for the benefit  of those who have served.   Before I conclude my comments this evening, I would use this as a  moment--on behalf of the Presiding Officer, on behalf of Senator Tester  and me, and on behalf of all Members of the U.S. Senate--to express our  gratitude to all who have served our country and express our respects  and honor for those who are no longer with us, who, because of those  battle wounds, have lost their lives to suicide.   We express our condolences and sympathies to their family members and  to their friends, and, in each and every instance, we recognize what  sacrifice they have made for the benefit of each and every one of us  here today and across the country.   I would say to those family members that this legislation--we hope-- and the example that their loved ones demonstrated in their lives will  be something that will inspire us to do the right thing and care for  those who served. So I express my condolence and sympathies to the  families, and I thank all who served, and I do so on behalf of all  Members of the U.S. Senate.   Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't thank the many dedicated staff  members who helped this legislation through to this point: Emily Blair,  who is with us on the Senate floor tonight, Tiffanii Woolfolk, Mark  Crowley, Asher Allman, Scott Nulty, Pat McGuigan, David Shearman, and  Caroline Canfield.   In addition, thank you to Senator Tester's staff: Sophie Friedl,  Dahlia Melendrez, and Tony McClain, the Kansan, as well as the House  Veterans' Affairs Committee staff members.   Suicide is preventable, and with the passage of Commander John Scott  Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act tonight--here,  moments ago--we take a stand to protect the lives of the people who  have given us so much in their protection of each and every American.   I yield the floor                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading, and in order to place the  bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to my  own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on Foreign Relations be discharged from further consideration of S.  Res. 658 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution  be agreed to; that the preamble be agreed to; and that the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m.,  Thursday, August 6; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that following  leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of Calendar No. 645. I further ask that notwithstanding  the provisions of rule XXII, the cloture motion with respect to  Calendar No. 645 ripen at 11:30 a.m. tomorrow; finally, if cloture is  invoked, the postcloture time expire at 1:30 p.m. and, if confirmed,  the motion to reconsider be considered made, laid upon the table, and  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:49 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, August 6, 2020, at 9:30 a.m.
