 Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute to  Commander Michael D. Cassady, Medical Service Corps, U.S. Navy.  Commander Cassady currently serves as the Program Manager, Naval  Advanced Medical Development at the Naval Medical Research Center and  will be released from Active Duty after almost 35 years of Active  military service on March 1, 2019. Commander Cassady is a native of  Millersport, OH, and I am pleased to recognize his distinguished  career.   Commander Cassady enlisted in the U.S. Navy on May 21, 1985, and  after  [[Page S7204]]  completing initial training at the Naval Training Center in San Diego,  he earned designation as a hospital corpsman third class. In 1991,  Cassady graduated from University of Maryland University College and  received a commission on June 8, 1993 as an environmental health  officer.   From 1993 to 1999, Cassady completed tours at the U.S. Naval Hospital  Keflavik in Iceland and Branch Medical Clinic in Iwakuni, Japan, where  he increased the overall readiness and health of hospital staff and  improved testing of the base drinking water. In 2001, he deployed to  Australia in support of Exercise Tandem Thrust 2001 and later deployed  to Thailand in support of Exercise Cobra Gold 2002 to improve combat  readiness, combined-joint interoperability, and enhance security  relationships between the United States, Thailand, and Singaporean  forces. He subsequently served as a medical department and safety  inspector for the Board of Inspection and Survey, providing direct  support to the fleet; and as chief, medical concept and development,  Joint Forces Command, where he furthered joint warfighter capabilities  and supported U.S. Northern Command response and relief efforts post  Hurricane Katrina.   In 2006, he deployed to Iraq in support of combat operations, where  he served as the civil affairs public health section lead, Multi- National Division in Baghdad. Upon returning from Iraq, he served as  the assistant officer in charge for the Navy Environmental and  Preventive Medicine Unit Two. Cassady also deployed as the medical  planning officer in Expeditionary Strike Group Two and U.S. Naval  Forces Central Command in Bahrain, where he was instrumental in  coordinating medical plans, guidance, and response to counter piracy  and Marine Corps operations, and health service support to the U.S.  FIFTH Fleet. His next two tours of duty were as the Environmental  Health Officer at the U.S. Naval Hospital Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and  the U.S. Naval Hospital in Naples, Italy. During these tours he  provided public health oversight and leadership. Commander Cassady  reported to his current and final tour of duty in July 2014 at the  Naval Medical Research Center in Silver Spring, where he provides  program management, leadership, and key administrative direction.   Commander Cassady has spent the entirety of his adult life and over  15 of his 35 years of naval service deployed or stationed overseas in  the defense of the United States. Additionally, he holds a master of  science in management from Troy State University, a master of public  health degree from the Ohio State University, a master of arts in  national security and strategy from the Naval War College in 2007, and  a master of science in education from Old Dominion University, which he  completed in December of 2011.   Mr. President, I ask that you join me, our colleagues, and Commander  Mike Cassady's family and friends in saluting this distinguished  officer's many contributions and sacrifices in defense of our great  Nation. It is fitting that the Senate today publicly recognizes his  service and wishes him, his wife Rohini, and their children, Rhyan,  Kassandra, Briana, and David, health, happiness, and success in the  years to come.   Congratulations, Commander Cassady, on completing an exemplary  career.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am here on the floor again for the  third time in 3 weeks to talk about the U.S.-Mexico agreement, USMCA.   Just a few moments ago, this trade agreement passed the House of  Representatives by a vote of 385 to 41. That is extraordinary. Trade  agreements sometimes tend to be pretty controversial and, more recently  in our history, pretty partisan. In this case, Republicans and  Democrats alike helped negotiate a good agreement, and Republicans and  Democrats alike supported it.   Let's now get that agreement over here. Let's not wait. The people in  Ohio and all around in country who are going to benefit from it need  those benefits now.   So I am very pleased that the President and his U.S. Trade  Representative, Bob Lighthizer, patiently negotiated with Speaker  Pelosi and House Democrats and were able to get something done, and now  it is close to becoming the law of the land. All it needs is a vote  over here from the Senate and then the President will sign it into law.   Thanks to important measures designed to strengthen our economy,  create more jobs, and increase market access, this new agreement, the  USMCA, actually helps to level the playing field between the United  States and Canada and Mexico.   First of all, it is going to result in more jobs. The independent  International Trade Commission has said over 170,000 new jobs. That is  mid-range. It could be a lot more than that.   But they have also said that these are good-paying jobs. Jobs in  trade tend to pay about 15 percent higher on average, and they have  better benefits. So this is a bunch of good jobs.   By the way, they estimate that at least 20,000 jobs in the auto  industry will come to the United States that would not have come  otherwise. I come from Ohio, a big auto State. It is a State that cares  a lot about manufacturing and, specifically, autos, and they are both  going to be helped by this agreement.   Part of the way that it is going to create jobs here is by leveling  the playing field on labor standards and enforcing those standards.   Also, it has higher content requirements for U.S.-made steel and  intra  [[Page S7224]]  auto parts that go into an automobile. As an example, USMCA requires  that 70 percent of the steel going into cars come from North America.  There is no provision like that in the status quo, in the NAFTA  agreement. So this is a big improvement for us to drive more jobs here  in America with regard to the steel production that goes into  automobiles.   But, second, it says that 75 percent of the overall content in USMCA  automobiles that are sold through this agreement have to be from North  America. That is a big jump. In the current agreement, instead of 75  percent, NAFTA has 62.5 percent.   What does that mean? It means that if you make a car, say, in Mexico,  and it has a bunch of parts in it that come from other countries, say,  Japan or China or Germany, they can't take advantage of the USMCA's  lower tariffs unless they have at least 75 percent North American  content. So that is a big difference.   Now, there are some, including on my side of the aisle, that have  criticized this provision and said that somehow this is a protectionist  provision. Let me just make this point. We are agreeing with Canada and  Mexico that we are going to have a new agreement with them that lowers  barriers, tariffs, and non-tariff barriers on our borders with Canada  and Mexico. We are taking advantage of that, with each other trading  back and forth. That is why we will have more trade. That is why we  will have more jobs.   If other countries want to take advantage of that by coming into  Mexico or Canada and adding parts to the cars, they are free riders  because they are not giving us the reciprocal access to their markets  as Canada and Mexico are. That is why I think this agreement makes  sense.   Now, I think it will incentivize two things. One, it will incentivize  more jobs here--auto jobs, manufacturing jobs, steel jobs. But, second,  it will incentivize those other countries to enter into a trade  agreement with us.   We have talked about this with Japan. We have taken the first step in  starting to put together what is considered a broader free trade  agreement. I hope we get to one. It would be important.   But if they can simply free ride on existing agreements by having  their stuff be transshipped from another country into the United States  to take advantage of the lower tariffs that we are providing to Canada  and Mexico, they wouldn't have that incentive to trade with us with  their own agreement. So I think this is a good thing for encouraging  more trade agreements and more trade openness.   The International Trade Commission also tells us that the USMCA is  going to grow our economy. In fact, they say it is going to grow our  economy by double the gross domestic product of that which was  projected under the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Some may remember that  agreement, the TPP.   Many of my colleagues, particularly on the other side of the aisle,  held that agreement up as one that would have been great for America  and that we should be part of it. I think it is important that we trade  with our neighbors in Latin America and in the Pacific Rim, but,  frankly, that agreement that was touted as being so great had less than  half of the economic growth that we are talking about here. So this has  more than doubled the economic growth we saw in the TPP.   Second, the USMCA means new rules of the road for online sales. This  is really important. So much of our economy today and our commerce  takes place online, and yet there is nothing in NAFTA on it. If you  think about it, 25 years ago there was no significant online commerce,  and so there is nothing in the agreement. Whereas, in this agreement,  there are a few things that are very important.   For my State of Ohio and, really, for our entire country, a lot of  our commerce is done online now. We have a lot of small businesses  engaged in it. They want to do business with Mexico and Canada, but  they have no protections--no protections from tariffs. They can be  assessed on that trade. This says no tariffs.   Also, data localization is something some countries are doing to  American online companies. So if you are in online commerce in America,  another country may say: Do you know what? You can do business in our  country only if you localize your data, meaning the servers have to be  in our country--in Mexico or in Canada, as an example.   This agreement says no. It prohibits that data localization  requirement, which allows us to sell more to those countries without  having to place our servers there.   It also says that the de minimis level on customs duties for sales  online is increased. This saves money because people can now be  involved in commerce with Canada and Mexico and not pay as much in  terms of the customs duties and the tariffs, but there are also  incredible administrative burdens being lifted by not having to worry  about that. So this is good for us because we do a lot of online  commerce here.   Third, I would say that American farmers are strongly behind this  agreement for a good reason, which is that it opens up more markets for  them and adds more certainty for them. Again, the NAFTA accord is 25  years old, and we had hoped during the last 25 years that we would get  at some of the protectionist policies, particularly with regard to  Canada and with regard to dairy and wheat and other issues, but we  didn't have much success until now. Now, with the USMCA, we have the  ability to send more of our stuff to these countries, and that is why  the ag community is so excited about it. Between bad weather, low  prices, and a shrinking China market, our farmers have been hit hard,  and this is a light at the end of the tunnel. That is why, by the way,  over 1,000 farm groups have come out in support of USMCA.    There are a lot of folks I hear talking who say one side won or one  side lost in the negotiations over USMCA. I don't think that is it. I  think because of the hard work of U.S. Trade Representative Bob  Lighthizer and the Trump administration and President Trump himself  supporting this and pushing it, I think neither side won but the  American people won. And isn't that nice to see? I think that is why  you saw today on the floor of the House of Representatives a vote of  385 to 41.   I think now more people are going to be able to benefit from trade  with these two countries. For Ohio, Canada is, by far, our largest  trading partner. Mexico is No. 2. So this is a big deal. It is more  modernized trade. We have replaced an agreement that has shown its age  with unenforceable labor standards and environmental standards, non- existent digital economy provisions, and outdated rules-of-origin  provisions. This changes all that.   We waited long enough. It is time, now that the House has voted--as I  said, this evening, which was great news--to get that legislation over  here to ensure that we do have great victory for American farmers, for  small businesses, for our manufacturers, for our online businesses, and  so many others.   I look forward to the opportunity to be able to vote for it over  here.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would also like to talk for a moment  about the legislation we just passed on the appropriations side.   There were two bills. One focused more on the national security and  defense side. There are a lot of good things in there for Ohio,  including the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and also for the Lima  Tank Plant. Also, much more importantly, it is good for our military-- for our men and women in uniform, who are on the frontlines every day,  sacrificing for us.   We have shown through this legislation we just passed that we  appreciate them. There is not only a pay raise, but also we are  providing them the equipment and the modern technology they need to be  able to be successful.   But I also noticed in the agreement that just passed, the first  appropriations bill, that there is really important language with  regard to the drug crisis that we face in this country.   I see my colleague Sheldon Whitehouse is on the floor. I have worked  with him over the years on the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery  Act. Now we have a CARA 2.0 bill that we would like to see passed.   But the bottom line is that this House and Senate and President Obama  and now President Trump have begun to address this problem in different  ways over the last 3 or 4 years, and it is beginning to work. We are  finally beginning to see, with regard to the opioid crisis, some  success.  [[Page S7225]]    Recall that the opioid crisis is the worst drug epidemic we have ever  faced in this country. In 2017, 72,000 Americans lost their lives to  overdoses. That is more than we lost in the entire Vietnam war. Last  year, we had a little better number. After 12 years of increases every  year in overdose deaths, finally, last year, we had a slight decrease,  and I think it is because of a lot of good work that has been done  here, particularly with regard to the opioid crisis.   In Ohio, unfortunately, we have been in the center of the storm. We  have been one of the top two or three States in the country in terms of  overdose deaths.   Last year, in 2018, because of all the hard work we have done here at  the Federal level, at the State level, and at the local level, we  actually saw a decrease. We led the country with a 22-percent decrease  in overdose deaths. So that is the good news, and it is because of the  Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act, which is bipartisan and which is  working to provide more treatment and recovery services, to provide  better prevention, and to provide more Narcan to reverse the effects of  overdoses. It is also because of the 21st Century Cures Act, which  provides funding for evidence-based programs to the States and the  States decide how it is spent.   I was back home just this past week meeting with people who are  getting the benefit of those programs. On Monday, I was at a home in  Dayton, OH, that provides residential treatment for women who are  addicted and pregnant and helps their children to be able to overcome  the neonatal abstinence syndrome when they are born to a mother who is  using. It is beginning to work.   I met two mothers who have turned their lives around, and I saw a  beautiful baby who, at 5 weeks old, is going into the world brighter,  cheerier, and with more opportunity because of the work that we have  done here to provide funding to help.   But I will say we have found, having made progress on opioids, that  other drugs are starting to come into our communities. This is not just  an opioid problem. This is an addiction problem, and addiction is a  disease that must be treated like other diseases.   Although we have made progress, we can't rest on our laurels. When I  talk to those on the frontlines, as I did on Monday in Dayton with law  enforcement--the sheriff was there for Montgomery County--but also to  treatment providers, to those who are in the trenches, and talking to  those who are recovering addicts who were there, they tell me about  what is happening, which is that, increasingly, other drugs, including  psychostimulants like crystal meth and cocaine, are making a horrible  comeback in those communities.   Crystal meth coming in from Mexico is more pure and less expensive  than ever. In fact, law enforcement tells me that on the streets of  Columbus, Dayton, Cleveland, or Cincinnati, crystal meth is sometimes  less expensive than marijuana and yet much more powerful and much more  dangerous.   So it is important that here in Congress we focus on how to respond  to that. Although we have some great legislation out there with regard  to opioid addiction, treatment, recovery, and how to deal with this, we  have not done as well with regard to these new drugs coming in.   Part of the solution, of course, is to build up our security at our  southern border, where we have seen larger and larger quantities of  crystal meth, manufactured in Mexico, being brought into our country by  these cartels from super labs, as they call them, in Mexico.   By the way, there were crystal meth labs over the years, but the  volume was not nearly as high, and the cost was much higher. Now that  it is cheaper and there is higher volume, you see the meth labs in our  communities closing down, but for the wrong reason. It is not being  made here anymore because the stuff coming from Mexico is so much more  pure, more powerful, more deadly, and less expensive.   So for the people already struggling with methamphetamine or cocaine  addiction, it is important that they have access to treatment, too, so  they can get help.   What I have heard at the local level is this: We appreciate the  funding on opioids, but we want more flexibility now to be able to use  this funding to combat what is, in many of our communities, in Ohio,  even a bigger problem, which is crystal meth and sometimes cocaine.   So I am pleased to say that in the legislation that we just passed  here this evening, legislation that provides appropriations to deal  with this addiction issue, we have provided that flexibility. We have  said: Yes, we are going to continue to provide grants to help with  regard to prevention and treatment and recovery and help with regard to  getting people back on their feet and helping law enforcement, but we  are going to allow local communities to use this funding both for  opioids and for crystal meth and other drugs.   So my hope is that what we will see is some of the same progress we  have made in opioids now happen with regard to some of these other  substances.   I have introduced a bill called the Combating Meth and Cocaine Act--I  introduced it in June of this year--to allow this kind of flexibility.  That is an authorization bill that has already been introduced, and we  have good bipartisan support for that.   But we went ahead today in these appropriations bill and did it for  this year. So for this fiscal year, essentially, that legislation will  be in effect. So for 2020 we are going to provide that flexibility.    I applaud the Senate appropriators for doing that. Again, I am proud  of Congress showing that we can be flexible and continue to fight a  many-front war on this issue. It is not just about opioids. It is about  addiction.   We also need to pass the authorization bill, the Combating Meth and  Cocaine Act, and I hope that we will be able to do that after the first  of the year to ensure that we can continue to address these public  health threats and we can continue to provide for those whose future is  so dim because of the addiction, and instead they be able to achieve  their God-given purpose in life.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  authorized to sign duly enrolled bills and joint resolutions during  today's session of Congress.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as we all know, there have been increased  incidents of violence and threats against some of our faith-based  institutions over the past decade. The FBI has been able to monitor  this and unfortunately tells us that these attacks are likely to  continue. We need to do a better job of figuring out how to disrupt  these attacks but also to harden these facilities.   When the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh was attacked, it was  the worst anti-Semitic violence in the history of our country. Shortly  after that, I went to Youngstown, OH, which is very near the Pittsburgh  synagogue that was attacked. It was within the next week or two  afterwards, and there were very raw feelings, as you can imagine. We  talked about what was needed to provide better protection for houses of  worship--our synagogues, our churches, our mosques--and we came up with  an idea to provide for a grant program from the expertise of the  Department of Homeland Security where they could provide best  practices, consulting, placement of cameras, you know, where it is  necessary to harden facilities, where it is necessary to have a door  with locks--simple things that can save lives.   That program has now been appropriated. In the legislation we just  passed, there was a $90 million appropriation for this program. The  Jewish community, the Christian community, the Muslim community, the  Sikh community, the Hindu community, and others are very supportive of  this program.   H.R. 2476 is the legislation I am talking about this evening, called  the Securing American Nonprofit Organizations Against Terrorism Act.  Tonight, I am hopeful that we can pass, by unanimous consent, this  legislation. In the appropriations bill, there is a $90 million  appropriation from Congress for the program for this fiscal year. Our  authorization bill is at $75 million. Again, it is a very important  program.   I am pleased that the Department of Homeland Security has recently  changed its rules to allow these institutions to use the funds not just  for cameras, locks, and other hardening but also for armed guards where  necessary. Sadly, it is necessary to disrupt and stop some of these  hate crimes that are occurring.   Senator Mike Lee had some concerns about the cost. I understand his  concern. We are going to keep the cost in an efficient and effective  manner--going to the organizations that really need it. I appreciate  his talking to me about that tonight and his willingness to allow us to  move forward on this legislation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs be discharged from further  consideration of H.R. 2476 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.    I further ask that the bill be considered read a third  time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, another bill has been cleared tonight  that I would like to ask the U.S. Senate to provide unanimous consent  for. This is legislation called the Fallen Warrior Battlefield Cross  Memorial Act. This comes out of a situation in Ohio where some of our  veterans were not permitted to have a battlefield cross at their grave  site.   Senator Brown, myself, and other Members have been supportive of this  legislation, and tonight I am pleased to say that we now have unanimous  consent from the other side of the aisle to proceed with it.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on  Veterans' Affairs be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 1424  and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table.
