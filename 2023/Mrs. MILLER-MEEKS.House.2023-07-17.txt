 Mr. Speaker, I take this time to congratulate the  17U Six Pack Volleyball Club from northeast Iowa, for winning the 2023  USAV Junior National Championship in Chicago last week. The team went a  perfect 11-0 as they claimed the national division title.   This team showed unbelievable talent throughout the tournament,  showing dedication and overcoming adversity in all aspects of the game.  I congratulate Coach Grassley and the entire team, especially Emma  Stammeyer of Iowa City West High School in Iowa's First District. You- all made Iowa proud.           Recognizing the 75th Anniversary of the State of Israel     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 75th  anniversary of the State of Israel. This week, Congress welcomes  Israeli President Isaac Herzog to commemorate this milestone and speak  about the special relationship between our two nations.   After the horrors of the Holocaust, the Jewish people fled to their  homeland and declared Israel a nation. The United States was the first  country to recognize Israel as a nation. The United States has been  paving the way for an everlasting friendship.    For the past 75 years, Israel has been a crucial partner and a  shining beacon of democracy in the Middle East. With anti-Semitism and  anti-Israeli hate at home and abroad rising, it is now more important  than ever that the United States stand with Israel.   I am honored to welcome President Herzog to Washington, D.C., and I  look forward to continuing our enduring partnership.                     National Parks and Recreation Month     Mr. Speaker, July is National Parks and Recreation  Month.   There are many parks in Iowa's First Congressional District, four  national parks, from the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site to the  many State parks, such as Lake Macbride State Park or the Maquoketa  Caves State Park. These parks provide opportunities for exercise or  relaxation with friends and family.   I am proud to have sponsored the Alexander Lofgren Veterans in Parks  Act, which unanimously passed the House last Congress. This legislation  provides free lifetime access to national parks and Federal  recreational lands for our honorable veterans, Active-Duty military,  and Gold Star families.   I encourage all Iowans to explore Iowa's natural beauty and  appreciate God's creation this month and every month.                       Support for Oral Contraceptives     Madam Speaker, I am proud to sponsor the Orally  Taken Contraception Act of 2023, or OTC Act, which directs the FDA to  issue guidance for drug manufacturers who make prescription oral  contraceptives, daily contraceptives, which may be suitable for over- the-counter availability over age 18.   As a physician and former director of the Iowa Department of Public  Health, I recognize the need for increased and consistent access to  oral contraceptives and have prioritized expanding access since I was a  State senator. As a pro-life individual, preventing pregnancy is the  best way to prevent abortion.   Oral contraceptives are not emergency contraceptives and do not  terminate existing pregnancies. Furthermore, this is a market-based  solution  [[Page H3618]]  that incentivizes competition which will, in turn, lead to greater  options and affordable prices for women.   I encourage all of my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I will take a moment to recognize my brother-in-law  Ralph Martino on his birthday.   Happy birthday to Ralph Martino.                            ____________________
