 Madam Speaker, this administration says starving the  Iranian economy is in defense of human rights, when it is an abuse of  them; and that their withdrawal from the nuclear deal was a  demonstration of American leadership, when it was an abandonment of it.   Escalation is deescalation, and war is peace.   In fact, they are asking us to deny reality. The reality is that  families of American soldiers and diplomats are being kept awake at  night worrying.   The Iraqi people who suffered decades of unjust war are now unjustly  suffering as their country becomes a battleground in a proxy war.   The Iranian people have suffered because of maximum pressure and will  suffer because of this escalation.   John Quincy Adams said:         America goes not abroad in search of monsters. America's       glory is not dominion, but liberty.    This administration has gone abroad in search of monsters to destroy.  May God show us the way to freedom, independence, and peace.
