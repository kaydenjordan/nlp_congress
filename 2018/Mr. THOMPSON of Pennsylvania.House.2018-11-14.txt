 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  November as National Adoption Month.   During this month, we celebrate and reflect on the life-changing act  of adoption. Many parents and families across America open up their  homes, and their hearts, to children in search of a stable support  system; to children in search of a forever home. Unfortunately, there  are so many children in the foster care system who are still waiting to  find a permanent home.   In 2017, more than 442,000 children and teenage youth were in U.S.  foster care. More than 59,000 of these children were adopted through  the system, and we must always strive to help more children find a  home.   All children deserve a permanent family that can provide them with  love, support, and encouragement so they can reach their full potential  in life.   Mr. Speaker, during National Adoption Month, we recognize the  unconditional love and support adoptive parents provide to their  children, and we hope that all children will soon be welcomed into a  loving family because they deserve no less.                            ____________________
