 Mr. Speaker, in addition to treating and vaccinating for  COVID, our main priority should be getting people back to work. This  legislation doesn't do that. It is full of job-killing mandates and  liberal special interest  [[Page H307]]  handouts. So it keeps schools closed. Operation Warp Speed was such a  great development to get the vaccine rolled out there so we can get the  economy going.                                time  1600    But one of the things that this resolution does, it bails out States  that help top off their tax revenue for 2020. However, in my State of  Kansas, the 2020 revenues are already higher than the 2019 revenues,  including in our just completed month of January, 10 percent higher  than a year ago.   So the States aren't suffering through the revenue loss because of  the ability for people to still continue to grow and work as they can.   But the resolution does raise expenses for Main Street, nearly  doubling the Federal minimum wage at a time when thousands of small  businesses are already struggling to keep the lights on. This  legislation also fails to recognize, as mentioned earlier, that there  is nearly $1 trillion left from the previous COVID bills that Congress  has already passed.   By the way, these were five bipartisan bills that were passed in 2020  in order to make sure that it addressed all of the issues that we  reflect across our country. The Biden administration should instead be  focused on families who are hurting the most, targeting, particularly,  the more than 8 million people who have lost their jobs due to COVID.   Workers, families, and small businesses don't need more Washington  regulations or mandates. They need to have the economy up and running  again. Republicans believe we must increase wages and job opportunities  for all workers, and we have gotten real results with tax and  regulatory reforms, achieving historic surges in jobs and wages.   Unfortunately, this legislation does not build off of that successful  playbook, but, instead, shows that the Biden administration is far more  interested in advancing a radical leftwing wish list over our common  economic policies that will help our Main Street businesses and  families.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate my friend from New Jersey for  yielding and for hosting this special hour.   As Americans, we realize that our government was formed to protect  our God-given rights, and among them are life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness. However, we recently marked the tragic anniversary of the  Roe v. Wade decision, an anniversary that reminds us that nearly 62  million babies never got a chance to see the world.   This anniversary is also a call to action. As elected officials, we  must stand for the rights of the unborn and be a voice for the  voiceless. Instead of working to protect innocent life, President Biden  has neglected this duty by signing executive orders that are neither  pro-life nor pro-taxpayer.  [[Page H317]]    He has reversed the Mexico City policy, forcing U.S. taxpayer dollars  to fund abortions in foreign countries, a policy that is opposed by 77  percent of Americans, Democrats and Republicans. And he signaled that  he will rescind the Title X protect life rule, which restricts funding  organizations that consider abortion routine family planning.   I am proud to stand with Americans who believe in the sanctity of  life, and I am proud to lead this movement in Congress with our  Protecting Individuals with Down Syndrome Act to safeguard babies with  a prenatal diagnosis of Down Syndrome.   Thankfully, more pro-life leaders, activists, and legislators are  rising up to defend the unborn across our country. In Kansas, over the  last couple of weeks, our State legislature has passed a resolution  that puts a Kansas constitutional amendment on the ballot next year to  say with certainty that Kansas values both the life of the mothers and  the babies.   There is so much more work to be done, and I look forward to  representing the many pro-life Kansans in Congress.
