 Madam Speaker, last week, the President put a five-alarm  fire on American families by putting the government's weight behind a  lawsuit designed to cripple many healthcare protections. The ordinary  people whose lives will be upended by this decision have been offered a  raw deal to blow up healthcare and fix it later, but even that is a  false promise.   There is no plan to help the 316,000 people with preexisting  conditions in coastal Orange County or the millions of Americans across  our country. There has been no plan for 10 years.   We have to recognize that the inability to pay healthcare expenses is  the leading cause of personal bankruptcy in the United States and a  leading cause of homelessness.   I hope my Republican colleagues will have the chance to show the  American people that Congress isn't completely without common sense and  decency by voting for our resolution Tuesday condemning this  ideological crusade to take away healthcare from millions of needy  American families.                            ____________________
