 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the FIRST STEP Act.   There are thousands of women who are incarcerated while pregnant. My  language in the FIRST STEP Act addresses the treatment of pregnant  inmates and the use of shackles.   The current system is based on a male model that fails to meet the  physical and mental health needs of women. This is occurring at a time  when women are the fastest growing population in our prisons and jails,  increasing in number by over 700 percent since the 1980s.   The treatment of incarcerated women is particularly glaring during  pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum. Pregnant women must be provided  appropriate prenatal care, which includes nutrition and housing.   We can also agree it defies common sense and logic to use shackles on  a woman who is delivering a baby. More than 22 States have restricted  the use on pregnant women, yet the practice continues. This is despite  no reported incidents of women attempting to escape when shackles are  not used during childbirth. If anyone knows of a woman who is able to  jump up while delivering and overcome an armed guard, I would certainly  like to meet her.   Women across the country have shared their horror stories about being  pregnant or delivering while shackled. The experiences are as grim as  you can imagine. One mother recounted being shackled after having an  emergency C-section. She was handcuffed and a chain was linked across  her belly.    She stated: ``With the weight on my stomach, it felt like  they were ripping open my C-section.''   We must institute Federal standards and educate correction officers,  medical personnel, and pregnant inmates regarding the standard of care  for pregnant women. Women must be a part of the debate on prison and  sentencing reform.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to introducing additional legislation to  highlight this issue.
