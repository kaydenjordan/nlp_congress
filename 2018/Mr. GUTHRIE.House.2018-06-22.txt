 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  rise in support of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act.   Kentucky has been one of the hardest hit by our Nation's opioid  crisis, and I have heard from many Kentuckians  [[Page H5513]]  across the Second District about the devastating effects the opioid  crisis is having in the Commonwealth.   Parents have lost children to opioid use disorder. Employers are  having a hard time finding employees. And the opioid crisis has taken a  terrible toll on our communities.   Last Congress, I was proud to work with my colleagues as we crafted  the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. We also passed the 21st  Century Cures Act. We have come together to build on those two laws  with more legislation to address the ongoing opioid epidemic. Over the  past 2 weeks, we have passed more than 50 bills out of the House,  including my bill, the Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers Act.   Today, we vote on the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, the  culmination of our work over the past year to combat the opioid crisis.   I urge my colleagues to support this important bill that will help  all Americans affected by this awful epidemic.
