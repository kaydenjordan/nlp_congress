 Madam Speaker, I support the bill before us today, but we  all know it is not enough. Much more must be done. In the next  comprehensive aid package, we must put people first.   But something also must be done about the horrific Federal response  to testing. FEMA and the Trump administration have been nonexistent in  getting States like Wisconsin the test kits, reagents, and PPE we need  to reopen.   If the President forces us to open too soon, more people will get  sick and die, and the economy will suffer, and that will be on the  President's hands.   This isn't a reality show. American lives are at stake. Get us our  supplies now.
