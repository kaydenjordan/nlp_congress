 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5078) to amend the Small Business Act to provide re- entry entrepreneurship counseling and training services for  incarcerated individuals, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5078         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Prison to Proprietorship       Act''.       SEC. 2.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Today, we will consider four bipartisan bills that were unanimously  approved by the Small Business Committee last November. Two of the  bills will provide entrepreneurship training to individuals in prison  and post-release. The other two bills will make meaningful improvements  to contracting programs that support small businesses.   I rise today in support of H.R. 5078, the Prison to Proprietorship  Act, as amended. I introduced this bill with my good friend and  colleague, Mr. Chabot, the ranking member of the Small Business  Committee.   I am pleased to be leading this important effort with the ranking  member. We have worked together over the years and have made great  strides in helping America's 30 million entrepreneurs launch and grow  their small businesses.   With this bill, we will have an opportunity to make a meaningful  difference in people's lives. This legislation will require the SBA's  resource partners to provide entrepreneurship training to individuals  in Federal prisons through intensive, in-depth classroom instruction  combined with one-on-one mentoring.   Small Business Development Centers and Women's Business Centers,  which currently provide free or low-cost counseling and training  services at nearly 1,000 locations across the country, are poised and  well positioned to carry out these services in Federal prisons.   Last fall, the Small Business Committee held a hearing to learn more  about the role entrepreneurship can play in overcoming barriers to  employment for the formerly incarcerated. We learned that despite steps  to reform and improve our criminal justice system, the formerly  incarcerated face significant barriers to reentering the workforce.  Many employers will not hire these individuals because of the stigma  associated with their incarceration or because of legal restrictions in  certain industries.   In testimony before the House Small Business Committee, a witness  said he thought that when he got out of prison and served his time, he  would be able to move on and have a second chance in life. Sadly, that  was not the case. He soon realized that someone with a felony  conviction could be legally discriminated against in housing,  employment, public benefits, and voting rights.   These impediments can prove difficult to overcome. Studies have shown  that an estimated 60 percent of these individuals remain unemployed a  year after release.   Recidivism rates tend to be higher for those individuals who lack  employment. Of the 262,000 offenders who were released from Federal  prison between 2002 and 2006, 50 percent of those who could not find a  job committed a new crime or were sent back to prison. However, 93  percent of those who were able to secure employment were able to  reintegrate back into society successfully.   Providing a pathway to entrepreneurship has the potential to empower  the formerly incarcerated who are locked out of the labor market to  start and grow their own businesses. Programs that focus on leadership  skills, financial literacy, developing a business plan, and building  networks have the potential to reduce recidivism, provide a great  return on investment by leading to economic expansion, and, ultimately,  save the taxpayers millions of dollars.   The legislation has the support of 10 small business groups,  including America's Small Business Development Center, the Association  of Women's Business Centers, SCORE, Small Business Majority, and the  National Small Business Association, among others.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support this bipartisan bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   As the flagship agency tasked with supporting entrepreneurs and small  businesses, the SBA can play a pivotal role in providing  entrepreneurship training in Federal prisons.   I am pleased to be sponsoring this legislation, which will provide  meaningful opportunities and hope for those who are committed to  rebuilding their lives but are locked out of the labor market. This  legislation will go a long way in creating more jobs on Main Street,  with the added benefit of reducing recidivism.   I thank Ranking Member Chabot and his staff for working with me to  provide a path forward for those who have served time and repaid their  debt to society. I would add that of the many pieces of legislation  that we have marked up and the many hearings that we have conducted in  our committee, this has been one of the most rewarding, moving  experiences. We all should be proud of providing people with a second  chance.  [[Page H35]]    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5065) to amend the Small Business Act to provide re- entry entrepreneurship counseling and training services for formerly  incarcerated individuals, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5065         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Prison to Proprietorship for       Formerly Incarcerated Act''.       SEC. 2. RE-ENTRY ENTREPRENEURSHIP COUNSELING AND TRAINING FOR                     FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS.         The Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 631 et seq.) is amended--        (1) by redesignating section 49 as section 50; and        (2) by inserting after section 48 the following new       section:       ``SEC. 49. RE-ENTRY ENTREPRENEURSHIP COUNSELING AND TRAINING                     FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS.         ``(a) Services Required.--The Administrator, in       coordination with the Director of the Bureau of Prisons,       shall require the Service Corps of Retired Executives to       provide entrepreneurship counseling and training services to       individuals formerly incarcerated in a Federal prison       (hereinafter referred to as `covered individuals') on a       nationwide basis.        ``(b) Goals.--The goal of the services provided under this       section is to provide covered individuals with the following:        ``(1) Mentoring, workshops, and instructional videos       designed specifically for covered individuals on how to start       or expand a small business concern.        ``(2) Tools, skills, and knowledge necessary to identify a       business opportunity, including how to--        ``(A) draft a skills profile, business plan, and transition       plan;        ``(B) identify sources of capital; and        ``(C) connect with local resources for small business       concerns.        ``(c) Additional Requirements.--The services provided under       this section shall include--        ``(1) regular individualized mentoring sessions, to take       place over the course of a year, to support development of       the business plans of covered individuals and the growth of       covered individuals as entrepreneurs;        ``(2) assistance with identifying of local resources for       small business concerns for covered individuals;        ``(3) assistance with identifying sources of capital, and       when appropriate, assistance with preparing applications for       loans and other funding opportunities; and        ``(4) workshops on topics specifically tailored to meet the       needs of covered individuals.        ``(d) Survey.--The Service Corps of Retired Executives       shall survey covered individuals who received services under       this section to assess the satisfaction of such covered       individuals with such services.        ``(e) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the       enactment of this section and annually thereafter, the       Administrator shall submit to the Committee on Small Business       of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Small       Business and Entrepreneurship of the Senate a report on the       performance and effectiveness of the services provided under       this section, which may be included as part of another report       submitted to such committees by the Administrator, and which       shall include--        ``(1) the number of covered individuals mentored under this       section;        ``(2) the number of hours of mentorship provided by the       Service Corps of Retired Executives under this section;        ``(3) the demographics of covered individuals who received       services, including age, gender, race, and ethnicity;        ``(4) a summary and analysis of surveys conducted under       subsection (d); and        ``(5) any additional information the Administrator may       require.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 5065, the Prison to Proprietorship  for Formerly Incarcerated Act.   Madam Speaker, I commend the sponsors of this legislation, Mr.  Jeffries from New York and Mr. Burchett from Tennessee, for their  commitment and dedication to providing opportunities to the formerly  incarcerated, giving them a chance to bring their business ideas to  fruition, and, in turn, offering hope for a better life.   After paying their debt to society, former inmates return to their  communities with hopes and goals of starting fresh. Unfortunately, for  numerous reasons, many end up being locked out of the labor market.   It is my firm belief that entrepreneurship is a great way to help  individuals overcome the barriers to reentering the workforce. For the  formerly incarcerated, it can be the difference between successfully  reintegrating back into a community or returning to prison.   This bill complements the Prison to Proprietorship Act by requiring  the Service Corps of Retired Executives, SCORE, to provide  entrepreneurship training via mentoring, workshops, and training videos  to individuals upon their release from Federal prison. The mentorship  will be invaluable in helping these folks launch small businesses, and  the workshops will help connect them with their community and other  small business owners.   As Ben Franklin once said: Tell me and I forget; teach me and I may  remember; involve me and I will learn.   Entrepreneurship can be one of the best options for gainful  employment, and SCORE, with more than 300 chapters across the country  and the Nation's largest network of volunteer expert business mentors,  is uniquely positioned to teach and provide this business advice to  those reentering society.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support this bipartisan piece of  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume  to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries), the chair of the House  Democratic Caucus and sponsor of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider), a valued member of the Small Business  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I have another speaker.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Oklahoma (Ms. Kendra S. Horn).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Entrepreneurship has always been a bedrock of American life, and it  is particularly important for those who have to overcome employment  barriers.   Today's legislation will provide opportunity and hope for those who  face steep challenges to employment. By requiring SCORE to provide  mentorship to those who completed the Prison to Proprietorship program,  we can ensure that the investment made for increasing instruction will  be fully utilized upon release for those who opt to launch a small  business.   With the cost to incarcerate a Federal inmate of nearly $100 a day  and more than $36,000 a year, it makes economic sense to invest in  training and give these folks the tools they need to succeed.   I thank both Representatives Jeffries and Burchett for leading this  important effort, and I also thank Ranking Member Chabot and his staff  for working with us to increase opportunities and resources for those  who seek to rebuild their lives.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5130) to amend the Small Business Act to adjust the  employment size standard requirements for determining whether a  manufacturing concern is a small business concern, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5130         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Capturing All Small       Businesses Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. EMPLOYMENT SIZE STANDARD REQUIREMENTS.         (a) In General.--Section 3(a)(2) of the Small Business Act       (15 U.S.C. 632(a)(2)) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (A), by inserting ``and subject to the       requirements specified under subparagraph (C)'' after       ``paragraph (1)''; and        (2) in subparagraph (C)--        (A) by inserting ``(including the Administration when       acting pursuant to subparagraph (A))'' after ``no Federal       department or agency''; and        (B) in clause (ii)(I) by striking ``12 months'' and       inserting ``24 months''.        (b) Effective Date.--This Act and the amendments made by       this Act shall take effect one year after the date of the       enactment of this Act.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5130, the Capturing All  Small Businesses Act of 2019, which lengthens the employee-based  calculation formula used to determine the size of a small business.   Let me begin by recognizing Congressman Veasey and commending him for  his dedication to our small business community. Mr. Veasey is a valued  member of the Small Business Committee, and I can attest to his  unwavering commitment to America's 30 million small businesses.   H.R. 5130 is the result of those endeavors, and I am pleased that he  worked closely with Congressman Hern to move this measure forward. I  thank them both for their collaboration.   It is irrefutable that, as Federal contracts become larger in size  and scope, one or two sizable contracts can force a small business out  of the small business category prematurely. When this happens, small  firms lose access to contracting set-asides and must compete against  much larger firms without having built the capacity to do so. Many  small businesses forced into this situation opt to restrain their  growth or sell, rather than compete in an imbalanced marketplace.   We simply cannot let this happen. H.R. 5130 addresses this matter by  doubling the employee-based calculation to 24 months instead of the 12- month standard currently being used.   Just like the Runway Extension Act, a companion bill we passed last  year, H.R. 5130 helps us keep up with the current contracting trends by  alleviating the effects of sudden growth caused by a sizable contract.   H.R. 5130 grants small firms with additional time to grow and mature.  Furthermore, it provides parity between the benefits extended to those  subject to the employee and the receipt-based size standards.   Madam Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey), a valued member of the Small  Business Committee and sponsor of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, supporting our small business community and ensuring  that they are able to thrive is the top priority for me and the Small  Business Committee that I chair.   H.R. 5130 supports the small business community by providing them  with additional time to grow and mature.   By extending the lookback in the employee-based size standard, H.R.  5130 allows small firms an opportunity to gradually and successfully  transition out of the small business category.   Most importantly, this bill ensures equal treatment of small business  concerns by granting manufacturing firms the same benefits provided to  concerns subject to the receipts-based formula.   I congratulate Mr. Veasey and Mr. Hern for bringing forward a  commonsense and bipartisan solution.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5130, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 5146) to amend the Small Business Act to require  contracting officers to take a small business concern's past  performance as part of a joint venture into account when evaluating the  small business concern, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5146         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Unlocking Opportunities for       Small Businesses Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS OF JOINT VENTURES FOR SMALL                     BUSINESS CONCERNS.         Section 15(e) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 644(e))       is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(5) Past performance ratings of joint ventures for small       business concerns.--With respect to evaluating an offer for a       prime contract made by a small business concern that       previously participated in a joint venture with another       business concern (whether or not such other business concern       was itself a small business concern), the Administrator shall       establish regulations--        ``(A) requiring contracting officers to consider the record       of past performance of the joint venture when evaluating the       past performance of the small business concern; and        ``(B) requiring the small business concern to inform the       contracting officer what duties and responsibilities the       small business concern carried out as part of the joint       venture.''.       SEC. 3. PAST PERFORMANCE RATINGS OF FIRST-TIER SMALL BUSINESS                     SUBCONTRACTORS.         Section 8(d)(17) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.       637(d)(17)) is amended to read as follows:        ``(17) Past performance ratings for certain small business       subcontractors.--        ``(A) In general.--Upon request by a small business concern       that performed as a first tier subcontractor on a covered       contract (as defined in paragraph 13(A)) that is submitting       an offer for a solicitation, the prime contractor for such       covered contract shall submit to the contracting agency       issuing the solicitation or to such small business concern a       record of past performance for such small business concern       with respect to such covered contract.        ``(B) Consideration.--A contracting officer shall consider       the record of past performance of a small business concern       provided under subparagraph (A) when evaluating an offer for       a prime contract made by such small business concern.''.       SEC. 4. RULEMAKING.         (a) SBA Rules.--Not later than the end of the 120-day       period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, the       Administrator of the Small Business Administration shall       issue rules to carry out this Act and the amendments made by       this Act.        (b) Federal Acquisition Regulation.--Not later than the end       of the 120-day period beginning on the date that rules are       issued under subsection (a), the Federal Acquisition       Regulation shall be revised to reflect such rules.       SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the measure under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5146, the Unlocking  Opportunities for Small Businesses Act of 2019, which will eliminate  barriers to entry for small businesses seeking to perform as prime  contractors in the Federal marketplace.   As the largest buyer of goods and services in the world, the Federal  Government needs contractors it can rely upon, and knowing how a  business performed previously is a strong predictor of its ability to  successfully perform in the future.   However, one of the challenges small businesses experience while  offering their products and services to the Federal Government is  showing that they have relevant past performance. Usually, the  government relies on the past performance records it compiles. However,  such information solely on the small business may not exist. Thus,  small businesses cannot effectively compete for contracts.   Moreover, small businesses cannot develop the appropriate past  performance without winning a prime contract first.   H.R. 5146 offers a solution to this dilemma by allowing small  businesses to leverage other types of past performance information.  Specifically, it requires contracting officers to consider a joint  venture's past performance record when evaluating an offer of any of  its members.   Similarly, it requires the acceptance of past performance information  generated by a contractor on its subcontractor when reviewing an offer  from the latter to serve as prime.   With this change, H.R. 5146 provides small businesses additional ways  of showing they possess relevant past-performance experience. Moreover,  by requiring acceptance of joint venture and subcontracting past- performance information, this bill advances uniformity government wide.   I urge Members to support this important piece of legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans), the vice chair of the  Small Business Committee.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  to close.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Hagedorn),  the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans), and Dr. Joyce from  Pennsylvania for their work on H.R. 5146 to make it easier for small  businesses to pursue Federal prime contract opportunities.   In the Small Business Committee, we recognize the crucial role small  businesses play in providing goods and services to the Federal  Government. That is why we are always searching for ways to simplify  the contracting process. H.R. 5146 achieves this by requiring  contracting officers to accept relevant past performance information  obtained by a small business while performing as a subcontractor or in  a joint venture.   With this bill, we reiterate our steadfast commitment to the small  business community. Moreover, it will encourage small businesses with  relevant past performance experience to bid on prime contracts, which,  in turn, will have the effect of promoting the growth of the industrial  base, enhancing competition, and decreasing costs.   In closing, I thank Ranking Member Chabot for his support for these  four bills. When passed, they will bring the total number of small  business bills approved by the House of Representatives to 27. That is  not a small feat, and I appreciate the gentleman's support and that of  the members of the committee who have rolled up their sleeves and  worked together to help our Nation's 30 million small businesses  succeed.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to follow our lead  and move expeditiously to approve these bills. I urge my colleagues to  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
