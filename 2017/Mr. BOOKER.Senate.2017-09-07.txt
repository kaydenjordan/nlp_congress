 Mr.President, today I rise to speak about the  introduction of the Confederate Monument Removal Act. This legislation  would properly remove certain statues on display in the Capitol as part  of the National Statuary Hall Collection so they can be exhibited  elsewhere in the proper historical context. I am proud to introduce  this legislation today and I want to thank Representative Barbara Lee  for her leadership in the House on this bill.   On July 2, 1864, a law was enacted that created the National Statuary  Hall Collection, which allows states to select two statues of deceased  individuals to be displayed in the Capitol. States are supposed to  choose people ``who have been citizens thereof, and illustrious for  their historic renown or for distinguished civil or military  services.'' Figures like George Washington, Samuel Adams, and Dwight D.  Eisenhower grace the collection and are prominently on display in the  Capitol. The collection is meant to honor patriots who served,  sacrificed, or made tremendous contributions to our Nation.   People who served the Confederate States of America do not deserve  that honor. These are individuals who took up arms against the Union  and inflicted catastrophic death and suffering among United States  citizens. Simply put, they fall well short of that high bar.   Moreover, the presence of these statues in the National Statuary Hall  Collection ignores the context in which  [[Page S5059]]  these monuments were first erected. Statues of Robert E. Lee and  Jefferson Davis were erected across the United States in the post- Reconstruction era and during the civil rights movement as symbols of  white suppression and defiance of Federal authority. They do not  represent Southern heritage and those who advocate thus are engaging in  revisionist history and are whitewashing our past.   That is why I am introducing the Confederate Monument Removal Act, a  bill that would mandate the removal of all eleven statues of people who  voluntarily served the Confederate States of America from the National  Statuary Hall Collection in the Capitol within 120 days. The list of  statues that would be removed includes Joseph Wheeler of Alabama, Uriah  Milton Rose of Arkansas, Edmund Kirby Smith of Florida, Zebulon Vance  of North Carolina, Alexander Hamilton Stephens of Georgia, Edward  Douglas White of Louisiana, Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, James  Zachariah George of Mississippi, Wade Hampton of South Carolina, Robert  E. Lee of Virginia, and John Kenna of West Virginia.   The legislation would allow a State who selected the statue to be  displayed in the collection to reclaim the statue if they pay for its  transportation back to the State. If a State declines to reclaim it  back, it would turn possession of the statue over to the Smithsonian,  an institution that is more than capable of displaying the statues in  the proper historical context and where a constructive dialogue can  take place about our Nation's history.   I am grateful that this legislation is endorsed by organizations such  as the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the National  Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and the NAACP Legal  Defense Fund.   Some have argued that this will lead to the removal of other statues  and monuments of prominent figures who played an important role in our  Nation's history. That is plainly false. This bill only touches on  those who were traitors against their Country and whose statues were  erected as a symbol of white supremacy.   It is true that the Confederate Monument Removal Act does not remove  certain statues in the Capitol that some people find offensive and who  arguably should not be honored in such a way. For instance, the bill  would not remove the statue of John C. Calhoun, a white supremacist and  a vigorous defender of slavery. This is a conversation we as a Nation  must have regarding how to best tell the truth of our past.   But surely we can all agree that people who took up arms against  their Country should not be venerated in the Capitol, a place all  Americans should feel welcomed, encouraged, and inspired. These statues  must be moved not just because of who they were in the past, but  because of who we are now as a Nation and who we must be to ensure an  even better and brighter future for generations to come.   I am proud to introduce the Confederate Monument Removal Act and I  urge its speedy passage.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Coons, Mr. Hatch, Ms. Klobuchar,          Mr. Tillis, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Warner, and Mr.          Grassley):   S. 1781. A bill to reauthorize grant programs to improve the  prevention, investigation, and prosecution of economic, high  technology, Internet, and other white collar crimes; to the Committee  on the Judiciary.
