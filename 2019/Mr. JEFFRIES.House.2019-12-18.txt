 Mr. Speaker, George Washington, in his farewell address  to the Nation, counseled America that the Constitution is sacredly  obligatory upon all. It is in that spirit that we proceed today.   Donald Trump pressured a foreign government to target an American  citizen for political gain and, at the same time, withheld, without  justification, $391 million in military aid to a vulnerable Ukraine as  part of a scheme to solicit foreign interference in an American  election.   That is unacceptable. That is unconscionable. That is  unconstitutional.   There are some who cynically argue that the impeachment of this  President will further divide an already fractured Union, but there is  a difference between division and clarification.   Slavery once divided the Nation, but emancipators rose up to clarify  that all men are created equally.   Suffrage once divided the Nation, but women rose up to clarify that  all voices must be heard in our democracy.   Jim Crow once divided the Nation, but civil rights champions rose up  to clarify that all are entitled to equal protection under the law.   There is a difference between division and clarification.   We will hold this President accountable for his stunning abuse of  power. We will hold this President accountable for undermining our  national security. We will hold this President accountable for  corrupting our democracy.   We will impeach Donald John Trump. We will clarify that, in America,  no one is above the law.
