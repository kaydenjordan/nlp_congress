 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 831, I  call up the bill (H.R. 5444) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986  to modernize and improve the Internal Revenue Service, and for other  purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on H.R. 5444, currently  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today we are taking the biggest and boldest steps in 20  years, to redesign the IRS with a singular focus, taxpayer service.   This bill will redesign the IRS for the first time in two decades. It  refocuses the agency to live up to its mission of putting taxpayers  first. Finally, it will rein in its enforcement powers to prevent  future abuse.   There are two important pieces of legislation being considered before  the House today, H.R. 5444, the Taxpayer First Act; and H.R. 5445, the  21st Century IRS Act. These bipartisan bills, the product of 2 years of  work by the Committee on Ways and Means, will make the IRS a truly  taxpayer-first agency in a number of different ways.   First off, this bill puts an emphasis on customer service. We are  requiring the IRS to submit to Congress plans to restructure the agency  to improve efficiency, enhance cybersecurity, and better serve  taxpayers. This will guarantee that the IRS is living up to its  ``quality service'' motto, while holding the agency accountable if it  fails to meet these standards.   In addition, our legislation encourages the IRS to adopt commonsense  customer service features commonly seen in the private sector, such as  a call-back option.   Secondly, we are overhauling the IRS' enforcement tools so families  and small businesses can't have property seized without fair notice and  due process. Over and over again, we have heard stories from across the  country of absolutely tragic abuses of power by the IRS.   For example, we heard from Andrew Clyde, who served three combat  tours in Iraq. Then he came home and opened a successful small business  in Georgia, only to have the IRS unfairly seize $950,000 from him. Our  legislation prevents outrageous enforcement abuses like this to protect  American taxpayers from unfair seizures.   Thirdly, the Taxpayer First Act reminds the IRS they are not just an  enforcement agency, they are also our tax administrator. That is why  this bill changes the title of the IRS chief from Commissioner to, more  accurately, Administrator.   Additionally, and this is important, Mr. Speaker, we are shifting the  burden of proof back onto the IRS when examining taxpayers. This  legislation establishes an Independent Office of Appeals within the  agency to ensure that taxpayers receive a fair and impartial review of  disputes they may have with the IRS.   It shouldn't take a Freedom of Information Act request to see what  evidence the IRS is bringing against you. This legislation will require  that the IRS provide you with your own case file prior to any review of  your dispute with the agency. It puts taxpayers on a level playing  field, which is where they deserve to be.   In the 21st Century IRS Act, we are revamping the IRS' nearly ancient  technology and better positioning the agency to proactively combat  cyber threats.   Right now, IRS technology is so outdated that some systems date to  the 1960s, and fax machines are still used for some official  communications. This bill modernizes the IRS and ensures the agency is  accountable for the billions of dollars in IT that it spends each year.   Lastly, the 21st Century IRS Act enhances the agency's ability to  combat identity theft tax refund fraud by strengthening the IRS'  partnership with States and with cybersecurity experts.                                time  1345    This bill requires the IRS to practically partner with States in the  private sector that effectively combat identify thieves trying to steal  our refund.   I want to thank Oversight Subcommittee Chairman Lynn Jenkins and  Oversight Subcommittee Ranking Member  John Lewis for their tireless  work on this important bill.   With the new Tax Code, it is time for a redesign of our tax agency.  This bipartisan legislation truly refocuses the IRS to make it a  taxpayer-first agency.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, before I turn over the floor, I would like to  recognize a good friend and trusted policy adviser, and by every  measure, one of the very best to ever serve the Ways and Means  Committee in the House, Mr. David Stewart.   David began his congressional journey in 2000, when he came to intern  for Ways and Means Committee member, Congressman Phil English. Over his  career as a staffer, David became a trusted voice on policy for Speaker  John Boehner, for Speaker Paul Ryan, and, 2\1/2\ years ago, for me,  when he joined the Ways and Means Committee as staff director.   This past year, with David's steady leadership and immutable resolve,  we were able to pass the first tax reform in a generation, which has  boosted our economy and helped so many American families. David's focus  has always been on making lives better for all Americans, and I stand  here to today to tell him: Job well done.   David is a selfless public servant. He sacrificed so much time away  from his family--his wife, Betsy, and his daughters, Grace and Poppy-- and yet he has served his nation so well.   To say David works hard is an understatement. Once, when he was asked  how many hours he worked per week, David replied, simply, with, ``A  lot.'' This also shows David's wit and his wry sense of humor that has  always made busy days brighter.   His dedication to mastering intricate policy is unmatched, and I  know, Mr. Speaker, I speak for all members and staff of the Ways and  Means Committee when I say: Thank you, David, for your service to the  House and the Committee on Ways and Means. You will be greatly missed  around here, my friend.                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                     Washington, DC, April 12, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: I am writing to you regarding H.R.       5444, the ``Taxpayer First Act''. There are certain       provisions in the legislation which fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on Financial Services.  [[Page H3417]]         In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill,       I am willing to waive this committee's right to sequential       referral. I do so with the understanding that by waiving       consideration of the bill the Committee on Financial Services       does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the       subject matters contained in the bill which fall within its       Rule X jurisdiction. I request that you urge the Speaker to       name members of this committee to any conference committee       which is named to consider such provisions.        Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R.       5444 and into the Congressional Record during consideration       of the measure on the House floor. Thank you for the       cooperative spirit in which you have worked regarding this       matter and others between our respective committees.            Sincerly,                                                    Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                     Washington, DC, April 13, 2018.      Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Hensarling: Thank you for your letter       concerning H.R. 5444, the ``Taxpayer First Act'' on which the       Financial Services Committee was granted an additional       referral.        I am most appreciative of your decision to waive formal       consideration of H.R. 5444 so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor. I acknowledge that although       you waived formal consideration of the bill, the Financial       Services Committee is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over       the subject matter contained in those provisions of the bill       that fall within your Rule X jurisdiction. I would support       your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees on any House-Senate conference involving this       legislation.        I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this legislation on the House       floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to  the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. Jenkins), and I ask unanimous consent  that she may control that time.
