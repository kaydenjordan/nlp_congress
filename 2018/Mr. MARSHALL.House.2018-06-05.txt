 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to be  responsible, to be accountable to the American public, and to deliver a  comprehensive immigration solution. Beyond safeguarding our borders and  addressing DACA, it is the responsibility of Congress to pass an  immigration bill that provides a workable visa system for our farmers  and all agriculture producers back home.   No one has worked harder or understands this more than my colleague  and former chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, Mr.  Goodlatte. His comprehensive immigration bill, Securing America's  Future Act, addresses this by reforming the current H-2A visa program.  The bill replaces the outdated H-2A program with a new H-2C visa  placing jurisdiction within the United States Department of Agriculture  and the Department of Homeland Security.   It also allows our farmers to access a stable supply of workers year- round, an important change for our farmers that work 365 days a year. I  have worked hard on this provision with Chairman Goodlatte, and I am  thankful for the time he took to listen to our farmers back home and  incorporate many of their ideas and solutions into his bill.   In Kansas, immigrants make the dairy industry run, they strengthen  the farms that provide food on kitchen tables across the country and  across the world, and it helped the Kansas agriculture industry become  the international powerhouse that it is today. Our farms, our local  economy, and all the groceries you buy depend on immigrant labor. To  address our current farm labor crisis, we need to create a process that  is easier to navigate and allows our farmers to access the labor pool  they need.   This Congress has focused on keeping our promises to be accountable,  and now is as good a time as any, and is actually a great time, to  bring immigration to the forefront and deliver for our constituents.  Leaving this to the chance of a slipshod petition with zero chance of  being signed by the President is simply not a solution.   I am all in on finding solutions, and while I certainly understand  the complexity of this issue, this Congress has proved it can move  mountains when, just a few months ago, we passed historic tax reform.  And we can tackle our Nation's immigration policy by working together.             Honoring the Service of Major General Joseph Martin     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Major General Joseph  Martin, who serves as the Commanding General of the 1st Infantry  Division back at Fort Riley, Kansas. I have had the pleasure of working  with General Martin and his wife, Leann, over the past year and have  found them to be exceptional assets to Fort Riley, as well as the  entire community. Although I am proud of their new journey, I was sad  to hear they will soon be departing for a new post.   General Martin graduated from the United States Military Academy in  1986, alongside another fellow Kansan, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.   General Martin was commissioned as an armor officer and, after  graduation, served in a variety of troop assignments, including  leadership within the Combined Joint Forces Land Component Command in  Iraq, where he partnered with Iraqi and Allied Forces to liberate  Mosul. Most recently, he served as the Commanding General for  [[Page H4744]]  the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California.   As Commanding General of the 1st Infantry Division, General Martin  has worked to build readiness among his troops, and continues the  partnerships with area communities and organizations to support his  soldiers and their families during their time at Fort Riley.   General Martin has excelled at each post he has served in, and will  continue to do so at his next assignment at the Pentagon this June. My  wife, Laina, and I would like to be the first to welcome General  Martin, his wife, Leann, and family to the East Coast. We commend them  for their service to our Nation and wish them and their family the very  best of luck at their next post.                            ____________________
