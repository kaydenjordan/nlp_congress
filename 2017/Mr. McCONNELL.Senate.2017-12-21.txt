 Mr. President, throughout this process of tax reform,  Senate Republicans explained time and again that we are fighting for  the middle class. Our opponents lobbed one attack after another,  claiming we were selling hard-working families short. Of course, that  is completely wrong. The tax bill we passed was written to help middle- class families from the very beginning. Our goal was to make their  taxes lower, simpler, and fairer.   Under our legislation, the typical family of four making the median  family income can expect nearly $2,000 in tax relief next year. Just  yesterday, we saw that tax reform has already inspired job creators to  increase take-home pay for thousands of their employees. Yet not a  single Democrat joined us to pass this tax relief for American  families.   What is worse, just before we voted, Senate Democrats raised a point  of order that proved who is really going after low-income families.  When given the chance, Senate Democrats, led by the junior Senator from  Vermont, raised a procedural challenge to strike out a provision that  protects colleges that provide students with tuition-free education.  Let me say it again. The junior Senator from Vermont raised a  procedural challenge to strike out a provision that protects colleges  that provide students with tuition-free education. They chose to do it  after the same provision had already passed the Senate before we went  to conference. They didn't have to raise this challenge. It is not  required. They chose to. In the process, they knowingly hurt schools  that provide tuition-free education to students who can't otherwise  afford to go to college.   Let me give you an example. Berea College, in my home State of  Kentucky, is dedicated to educating students from the Appalachian  region who have limited economic resources--in other words, poor kids  from Appalachia. Their students' average household income is less than  $30,000 a year. These are kids from families making less than $30,000 a  year. They are from Appalachia, and their families don't have the means  to pay for their education.   Here is what they do at Berea. Every single student receives a  scholarship, which covers the cost of their tuition--every student. The  students work at the school and in their communities to help cover  additional living expenses beyond the costs of attending school. In  fact, the vast majority of Berea students are able to graduate debt- free because of the model. For example, they have a great restaurant  there. You go there and eat lunch. The kids are cooking, and they are  serving. They are working their way through school. When they graduate,  they don't have any debt.   Berea College, located in one of the most economically challenged  areas of my State, offers a quality education to students with the  greatest financial need, and it has done so since 1855--1855. It was  founded by abolitionists.   In fact, as my friend in the Chair knows, I am originally from his  State. Let me tell you about when I first heard of Berea College. My  grandmother and my grandfather had an African-American family who  helped them around the house, and they had  [[Page S8188]]  an adopted daughter. I was a little kid, and I remember them talking  about her going to college.   I said: Where are you going?   She said: I am going to Berea.   I said: Where is that?   She said: It is up in Kentucky.   It was the closest college that would take African-American students  at that time. Since they didn't have the means to pay for the tuition,  it was a great opportunity to get a tuition-free education.   A few years ago, I called the president of Berea College and said: I  would like to try to locate somebody.   He said: Well, the privacy rules are such that all I can do is to see  if we can find them and see if they want to meet you.   I said: That is fair enough. This would be a person about a certain  age, who would have originally been from Athens, AL. If you can  identify this student, I would love to meet her.   He did. When she came to my office in the Capitol with her daughter,  who lives in the area, I found out that she graduated from Berea and  went on to be a nurse. She lived in the north most of her life and is  now relocated in Athens, AL.   This is Berea College. This is the college these guys over here-- every single one of them--voted to target by making their endowment  subject to a tax that would otherwise only apply to the really big  schools in the country--the Ivy League schools.   Every year, Berea uses the returns on its endowment solely for  scholarships, and that sets it apart from nearly every other college  and university in the Nation. I worked with the Finance Committee to  include a provision to protect schools like Berea from taxes on  endowments that apply to private schools who choose to sit on these  large funds rather than using them aggressively to reduce the cost of  attending school. But Senate Democrats identified this exemption as a  bridge too far. Instead of allowing the provision to stand, thereby  protecting these students at schools like Berea, they decided to pick  partisan politics and attack the measure simply because they could. In  the process, they assured that Berea would bear the brunt of their  blatant political calculation.   Because Democrats stripped this part of the bill, Berea estimates it  could pay a tax penalty of nearly $1 million every year. Berea's  president has already explained to us the effect of this tax: The  school will be forced to offer fewer scholarships to kids.   The junior Senator from Vermont and his allies, which included every  single Member of the Democratic conference, have chosen to make it  harder for low-income students to earn a college degree. This is  especially hypocritical coming from the man who claims to support free  college for all. During the Presidential campaign last year, I remember  he was promising free college to everyone. Apparently, that is free  college to everyone except at Berea College, where it is already free,  thanks to generations of donors who built their endowment.   I am at a loss for words. I don't understand how they can claim to  fight for students one moment and then make it harder for students to  afford college the next. They chose to attack the tax bill by any means  necessary, even though they knew the outcome and, in the process,  launched a direct attack on the ability of schools like Berea to  provide tuition-free education to needy students.   This action by Senate Democrats is deeply disappointing and will  provide real and lasting harm. I hope my friends on the other side of  the aisle realize the American people will see their partisan tactics  for what they really are--an attack on low-income students who want to  pursue opportunity and find success.   A number of my colleagues in Congress have said they are interested  in fixing this problem, including my colleague from Kentucky,  Congressman Andy Barr. I am committed to working with him and other  Members of Congress, and with schools like Berea, to help right this  wrong. It is hard not to repeat. This amendment was offered by the man  who wanted to provide every student in America with free college  tuition but at the same time wanted to reduce the number of  scholarships at a college where it is already free, actually, thanks to  the generosity of decades of wealthy people who gave to their  endowment, believing the mission of providing a college education for  poor kids from Appalachia was a worthy goal. We are going to fix this  problem. We are going to fix it as soon as we can.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, the Senate has  important business to conclude this week. The American people are  counting on Congress to reach a government funding agreement. If we  were to fail to reach an agreement, we would be failing to ensure that  our all-volunteer Armed Forces have all of the resources they need to  protect our country in the face of myriad threats from all around the  globe. We would be subjecting programs that American families rely on  to draconian sequestration cuts that none of us want to take effect.    The Senate stands ready to take up an agreement as soon as one  originates over in the House. We are ready to work together, across the  aisle, to ensure there is no lapse in funding for critical services.  Furthermore, my Republican colleagues in the Senate stand ready and  eager to ensure full and long-term funding for the Children's Health  Insurance Program. There are 9 million children who receive coverage  through CHIP. They and their parents deserve to know that Congress is  committed to them.   Republicans agree. We support a provision that would fund CHIP not  just for a few weeks but for 5 years. Unfortunately, our Democratic  colleagues are unwilling to make that commitment to American families.  Thus far, they have opposed all of our efforts to include 5 years of  CHIP funding in this week's agreement. Whatever partisan politics are  leading my colleagues on the other side to this mystifying conclusion,  it is time to put them aside and do right by our constituents. I hope  we can all work together and give Americans the peace of mind they  deserve, particularly going into the Christmas season.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a completely different matter, I  would like to say a few words in tribute to a fine colleague whose all- too-brief time in the Senate will soon draw to a close.   Senator Luther Strange of Alabama is the newest Member of this body,  having been sworn in just this past February, but he did not waste any  time in making an impact. In this historic year for the Senate, Luther  quickly emerged as a strong voice on policy and an important vote on  landmark legislation.   On a personal level, it didn't take anyone long to realize that this  newcomer would rank among the most diligent, dedicated, and public- spirited Members of this institution. At first, we even wondered  whether Luther might be a little too diligent.   Upon his arriving in Washington, the Senator dived into the task of  meeting his colleagues with the friendly earnestness that is his  calling card. The first time Luther passed Senator Roberts in a Capitol  hallway, he stopped to introduce himself and share his excitement to be  joining the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee. There was  nothing unusual there, but I have it on good authority that the very  next day, when Luther found himself sharing an elevator with Senator  Roberts, the junior Senator from Alabama introduced himself all over  again. Not long after, a chance meeting on the train occasioned yet a  third introduction. Pat Roberts had to put a stop to it.   ``Yes, Luther,'' he broke in. ``I think we've met before--and we're  sure glad to have you here, too.'' We certainly were glad as well.   Luther came to the Senate with a national reputation for integrity  and excellence in public service. That started young. The proud son of  a Navy veteran turned college professor, this Birmingham paperboy made  Eagle Scout at age 13--an accomplishment that still shows up on his  lapel from time to time.   He received his bachelor's from Tulane, where--and I know this may  come as a shock--the man the Senate historian has apparently verified  as the tallest Senator in history played scholarship basketball.  [[Page S8189]]    After graduation, to save for law school, he spent a year on a boat  that supplied oil rigs in the North Sea. He pitched in on everything-- did whatever it took to help the team--and helped the crew navigate the  ship through choppy waters.   These qualities will sound familiar to everyone who has worked with  Luther since.   He built a sterling reputation as an up-and-coming lawyer in private  practice. He then set it aside to serve the people of the State he  loves as Alabama's attorney general.   In the fine Alabama tradition of public servants, like his friends  and mentors Jeff Sessions and Richard Shelby, he combined a steel spine  with a servant's heart. Whenever the people of the State needed  defending--their businesses, their religious liberties, their Second  Amendment rights--their attorney general was there for them.   Then as now, he fought fiercely when times required it and his  principles demanded it, but no matter how important the issue at hand,  from the Supreme Court to the Senate floor, Luther never loses his good  humor or his conviction that we serve in order to help our  constituents, not to aggrandize ourselves.   Luther Strange reminds us that character counts. He reminds us that  deeply held conservative values do not in any way stand opposed to  collegiality and common decency. To the contrary, our values require  these things.   He reminds us that the American people need not choose between  leaders who share their principles and leaders who dignify public  service. They should hold their elected officials to a high standard  and demand that we do too.   If you cannot tell, Luther's colleagues look up to him in more ways  than one. We are sorry to see him go.   In the farewell speech that Senator Strange delivered on this floor,  he challenged his colleagues to revive greater comity in this body. He  implored us not to give up on bipartisanship or on building friendships  that run deeper than policy disagreements. He reminded us that the  Senate's Marble Room, across the hallway from this Chamber, used to be  a popular gathering place. Senators from both parties would relax and  get to know one another above and beyond the specific disputes of the  day. Today, Luther pointed out, this room often sits empty.   His advice is well taken, and I have an idea how we could begin to  put it into practice. All of us on both sides of the aisle could try to  approach our work with more of the optimism, can-do spirit, and  reverence for this great institution that Luther Strange has brought to  work every single day.   Of course, the Senate's loss will be a happy gain for Luther's  beloved family.   Despite the fact that his bright idea for a first date with Melissa  was a trip to the Talladega Superspeedway to take in the Talladega 500,  he convinced her to marry him anyway. Their loving partnership has now  spanned 36 years and counting. They have raised two sons. I hear that  Luke is just an inch shy of his dad's height and that Keehn is an inch  taller. In recent years, Luther and Melissa have become the proud  grandparents of two young boys.   I have it on good authority that a certain black Lab named Sophie  might be the most excited of all the Stranges to welcome the Senator  back home to Birmingham.   Wherever Luther's distinguished career takes him next, I know he is  glad it will involve more time with the people he loves most.   He has served with distinction in the Senate during a year of  historic achievements. On behalf of Alabamians, he has made vital  contributions on the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; Armed  Services; Budget; and Energy and Natural Resources Committees. He has  cast votes to help middle-class families and set America on a brighter  trajectory for years to come.   We thank him and wish him every success in his future endeavors, and  we salute him for the dedicated service he has rendered to his country  and to the people of the great State of Alabama.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
