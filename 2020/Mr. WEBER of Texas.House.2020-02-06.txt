 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman.   The gentleman over there used the word ``perverse.'' There is  something perverse here, all right. I will say that I support the  amendment by Mr. Meadows.   Among the numerous perverse power grabs in this bill offered today,  H.R. 2474 seeks to eliminate right-to-work protections nationwide,  superseding laws passed in those 27 States my good friend talked about,  including my home State of Texas, which as he alluded to, by the way,  its economy is so successful and our economy so big that if we were a  country, we would be the 10th largest country in the world. That is how  good our economy is.   Right-to-work laws prohibit the termination of employees for refusal  to join or pay dues or fees to an organization they may or may not even  support.   Let's protect families, not organizations. Let's protect families'  incomes, not unions'.   My friend Mr. Meadows' amendment strikes the provision of this bill  so that States may continue to protect workers from forced unionization  and ensure Americans keep their hard-earned money.
