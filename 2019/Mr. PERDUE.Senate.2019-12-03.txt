 Madam President, it is always a privilege to come before  the U.S. Senate. I always feel humbled by that because I think of the  people who have spoken on this floor since 1859. I am always measured  in what I try to bring in terms of thought or whatever, but today there  is a special sense of responsibility.   Senator Coons and I have been chosen to lead our colleagues in  honoring Johnny Isakson today. What we just heard was historic, I  believe. It is not the first time we have had a speech on this floor  that addressed that topic, nor will it be the last, I will predict.   We just heard Johnny admonish us to judge with our conscience and our  heart. With that, I feel somewhat unworthy to try to address what I  feel, and what he also talked about is his heart.   Today is truly a bittersweet occasion. It is bitter because my  friend, my mentor, and partner in the U.S. Senate, Johnny Isakson, is  stepping down at the end of this month. For those of us who know this  man, it is tough to come to grips with that. I will dearly miss him on  many levels. I will miss having him come here in the U.S. Senate  alongside me. I will miss his words of wisdom. I will miss his  patience. Most of all, I think I will miss his example.   However, we can still find joy in this occasion, I believe. As Johnny  and Dianne head into the next chapter of their lives with their family,  all of us can take time to reflect on who Johnny is and what his public  service has truly meant not only to us individually and not just to the  constituents in our State but to America.   Johnny has actually meant the world to me and for longer than I have  been in the U.S. Senate. When I got involved in the political process,  I had never been personally elected to anything--maybe in the 8th  grade. You know how that goes. But this was a radically different  experience than I personally had ever had. Johnny helped me personally  with that transition. He gave me advice. He befriended me. He  introduced me to our colleagues here in the Senate. He has been the  best partner anyone could ever ask for. I remember the best advice he  ever gave me. I just shared this with our colleagues at lunch: Dave, I  only have one piece of advice for you. Keep your head down, your mouth  shut, and don't ever vote against the farm bill.    That was his advice, and it was sage, and I listened to that.   Over the last 5 years--and, Johnny, it is hard to believe it has been  5 years. To Dianne, I am sure it feels like five lifetimes. In the last  5 years, Johnny's advice has stuck with me on many levels. A lot of  people in this town know how to talk, stick around. Johnny has shown us  how important it is to listen and learn from each other. He has shown  us how to work together on behalf of, not just ourselves or our next  reelection, but truly for the people who put us here. Johnny is a true  public servant.   I say that next to the word ``servant'' in the Webster dictionary is  a picture of Johnny Isakson. He is devoted to getting results, not just  for the people of Georgia, but for everybody in the United States. Most  importantly, he does it in a way that really is worthy of this august  body.   I know this body has had controversy throughout the last 230 years.  Part of what makes us great is that we have differing opinions, but  somehow, in the last 230 years, we found a way to put those aside to  find compromise. I made a living in business for 40 years finding ways  to compromise with people who had different views than I did.   One example of Johnny's statesmanship was with his longtime  friendship with another great Georgian, Zell Miller, who happened to be  a Democrat. Zell was a former Governor of Georgia and a U.S. Senator.  Last year, he, sadly, passed away. What most people forget is that  early in his career, Johnny actually ran for Governor against the same  Zell Miller who ended up being, as Johnny calls him, the best friend he  has ever had.   When Zell Miller passed away, Johnny was asked to speak, and he spoke  on this floor. In that speech, he said that Zell Miller was ``an  individual I met through politics, became one of my best friends  through politics, and probably had more influence on my life than  anybody else I know in public service.'' That is a Democrat Johnny  Isakson is talking about. Saxby Chambliss and I get a little upset  about that occasionally, but, Johnny, that is a big deal. Thank you.   It is almost hard to believe Johnny and Zell used to be political  opponents. Despite their political differences, Johnny and Zell  remained close friends up until Zell's death. In fact, Zell even  appointed Johnny as chairman of the Georgia Board of Education 7 years  after Zell had beaten him in that same Governor's race. We can have  strong differences in rigorous debates, but we should always be civil  and respectful to one another, Johnny says. And Johnny lives that out  every day.   I have said before that Johnny Isakson is the Howard Baker of our  time. Why do I say that; what do I mean? Johnny doesn't talk a lot, but  when Johnny talks, people listen. What we just witnessed was, I think,  historic. The paper that was on the podium in front of Senator Isakson  just now was not a speech. I want everybody to understand this. It was  a list of the 50 Senators who have asked to come to this floor over the  next few hours to honor this man as he goes into retirement.   What we just saw was straight from the heart--better than anybody I  have ever witnessed and in a way that I will always remember. Truly,  when Johnny talks, people listen. It doesn't matter if you are a young  child, a member of his staff, a colleague, or the President of the  United States, not only do people listen to Johnny, but I will add one  thing to what I have been saying for the last 5 years, when other  people talk, Johnny Isakson listens. That is a rare commodity in this  town; trust me.   If you need help, Johnny Isakson is always there. We all know now  that Johnny will no longer be with us in this body every day, but we  know he will still be around to help us in any way he can. I am hoping  he will still call me and give those pieces of advice that have been so  valuable over the last 5 years. I know he will answer my call when I  call him and ask for that same advice.   But I want to leave the body with this thought today--and I think it  echoes what he just said, and I prepared these remarks some time ago in  thinking about today--in the new testament in the Bible, in Matthew 23,  it says that the greatest among you will be the servant. And today, I  want to remind everybody in this body that the greatest among us is  Johnny Isakson.   Johnny, it has been a true blessing. God bless you and Dianne and  your family. America will always be in your debt. Thank you for  everything. God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.  Thank you, Johnny. God bless you.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Wednesday, December 4; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, morning business be closed, and the Senate  proceed to executive session and resume consideration of Executive  Calendar No. 47 under the previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:36 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, December 4, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
