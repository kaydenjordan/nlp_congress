 Madam President, I rise today to submit for the record  a column written by Mr. Jim Magagna, executive vice president of the  Wyoming Stock Growers Association, entitled ``Magagna: The Real  Challenges of Ranching.'' The article was published on June 2 of this  year.   I recently spoke at the 2021 Wyoming Cattle Industry Convention and  Trade Show, ``Positioning Wyoming's Beef Industry for Success,'' hosted  by the 149-year-old Wyoming Stock Growers Association in Sheridan. This  convention focused on both the challenges and the opportunities that  producers have before them. Jim says it best: Some of these are just  simply challenging opportunities.   I urge my colleagues to stand with ranchers like Jim Magagna and the  ranchers that he represents. Stand with those who understand the land  best and not with extremists who do not know how to run a farm, a  ranch, or a small business.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Ranching in Wyoming begins with a dedicated, often multi-      generational, ranching family or a highly qualified dedicated       ranch manager. Beyond this foundation, success on an annual       basis is driven primarily by three factors--the weather, the       markets and the government. When two of these are positive,       most ranchers would describe their year as a ``success''. In       that rare year when all three factors are particularly       favorable, the seasoned rancher saves dollars in preparation       for the inevitable bad year.  [[Page S4655]]         2020, given the impacts of COVID, was a year of ``all of       the above'' and more. The daily chores and challenges of       operating the ranch continued. With livestock needing to be       fed, and calved or lambed there was no unemployment. While       others struggled to adjust to having their children home       doing remote learning, many ranchers just welcomed the extra       help from the kids. A major challenge was driving long       distances into town for supplies, only to find that many of       the needed items were not available.        Livestock markets crashed in the spring of 2020, but       returned to a more normal range by the time that most Wyoming       ranchers were facing fall marketing. Government policies were       stable and somewhat friendly toward agriculture. While some       areas of Wyoming experienced drought, most ranchers were able       to maintain their herds with some added supplemental feeding.       Federal payments through the CARES Act provided significant       relief for some. Looking back, two of the three factors could       be deemed to have been positive at some time during the year.        While the impacts of COVID have lessened, 2021 is evolving       as a much more challenging year for many Wyoming ranchers       than 2020 when assessed by the three factors. Drought clearly       rises to the top of concerns faced by producers across most       of the state. Northwestern Wyoming experienced good winter       snowfall and the very southeastern portion has had       significant spring moisture. However, the majority of Wyoming       is suffering from both a shortage of irrigation water and a       lack of soil moisture. As a result, we are seeing a worrisome       reduction in the number of summer pasture cattle coming into       the state as well as the sale of replacement heifers that had       been retained in the fall of 2020. This will have impacts on       production for at least the next several years.        The change in administrations in Washington, DC this year       has added another high level of uncertainty to Wyoming       ranching. While some degree of uncertainty accompanies any       political change, the rhetoric and fast-paced issuance of       Executive and Secretarial Orders by the current       administration has been particularly frightening. The       rhetoric that surrounds ``30 x 30'', ``Make America       Beautiful'', ``Climate Change'' and other initiatives to date       lacks any substantive detail to enable our assessment of how       it might affect Wyoming's agriculture industry.        Cattle market events in recent years have given cattle       producers both needed wake-up call and a new path forward.       Our beef marketing chain clearly has a bottleneck at the       processing level. This both increases risk when an event such       as COVID impacts a major facility, and concentrates market       control in too few hands. Consumer interest in buying local       and knowing where their food comes from has provided new       marketing opportunities for some producers. In the span of       two years Wyoming has gone from having only one federally       inspected processing facility to nine facilities either       operating or under construction. New larger facilities being       developed across the nation, including in Idaho and Nebraska,       will provide greater competition and lessen dependence on the       ``Big Four'' U.S. beef processors. Efforts by the industry       and the Wyoming Business Council continue to attract larger       processors to Wyoming.        A discussion of ranching' s challenges would not be       complete without acknowledging the emergence of ``fake       meat''--both plant-based and lab-cultured products. While       these products have received tremendous publicity,       endorsement by celebrities and are now offered in some retail       establishments, they have not emerged as a threat to the       demand for high-quality beef and lamb.        Yes, ranching today is faced with significant emerging       challenges. Fortunately, these challenges are leading to       exciting new opportunities. Exploring these opportunities       will be the focus of the 2021 Wyoming Cattle Industry       Convention and Trade Show, ``Positioning Wyoming's Beef       industry for Success'' hosted by the 149 year-old Wyoming       Stock Growers Association in Sheridan June 2-4.                            ____________________
