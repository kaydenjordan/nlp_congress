 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if  in morning business for such time as I shall consume.    Madam President, last year, the Federal Communications  Commission approved an application by Ligado Networks to repurpose the  Federal spectrum in a way that will drastically interfere with GPS and  satellite communications. This a big deal. There are so many people who  understand this situation. There is a list of companies behind us that  grows every day. Almost every company in America that you know of or  have heard of--their name is on this list.   The decision that was made will threaten GPS and satellite  communications reliability for millions of Americans who depend on it.  The reliability of GPS and satellite communications is necessary for  safety of life operations, national security, and economic activity.   I am going to pause here for a minute to drive home what this  actually means for every American because people don't know this. They  don't know how important GPS is. Yet there is not an American I can  think of by description who isn't using it every day. So if something  happens to it, there is a serious problem. Here are some of the day-to- day activities that would be difficult when experiencing GPS  interference from Ligado.   A big one--using your credit card or your debit card. When you are  making a purchase or using an ATM, our financial systems rely on GPS  timing in order to work.   Another one--making a phone call. Cell phone networks rely on GPS to  synchronize cell towers so calls can be passed seamlessly. If they  experience interference, your call could be dropped when moving from  one tower to another.   Another one that people are not aware of and don't expect is energy,  whether that is filling up your tank with gas at the pump or electrical  grids to light our homes. We rely on GPS timing to safely operate  underground pipelines and our electricity grid.   Farmers and ranchers--this is something that a lot of people are not  aware of, but they depend on GPS and satellite communications when  planting crops, applying fertilizer, and during harvesting operations  to move large and critical machinery with precision.    Working out--a lot of people don't. I don't as much as I used to, but  a lot of people do. They say that one-fifth of the population, 20  percent of the population, of all Americans, use a fitness tracker or a  smartwatch. The majority have used GPS to count steps to track  distance. We all know that. You see them out there every day. They  depend on GPS.   Taking a flight--I have been involved in aviation for over 70 years  now and had occasion with three friends to fly around the world in 1991  using GPS. At that time--it may have been the first--the equipment I  used was a Trimble TNL 2000. Trimble is one of the big GPS companies. I  was using one, the TNL 2000. At that time, that may have been--we are  checking to see--the first time that had been used for private  [[Page S4721]]  aviation, flying all the way around the world. Again, that is GPS, and  that was 1991.   Driving around right now, each day, countless Americans rely on  Google Maps, Waze, Apple Maps, and any other navigation system to get  them from point A to point B. While no one hopes to ever need a  firetruck or an ambulance or the 9-1-1 operators, the EMS, they use GPS  on a daily basis.   There is more--weather forecasting, the movement of goods on our  highways, surveying maritime harbors, channels, and everything else.  The list goes on and on.   How do we know that Ligado will cause interference? The FCC told us  when they approved the Ligado order. I will read that now because  people need to understand. I guess you could say we were warned.   The FCC said in their document--that was the document they used on  their approval order. They said:         Ligado shall expeditiously repair or replace as needed any       U.S. Government GPS devices that experience or are likely to       experience harmful interference from Ligado's operations.    That is a quote. That is what they said. That is what the FCC said at  that time.   Over 21 organizations and companies and industries filed petitions  for reconsideration after the order was released, documenting the  damage they would face from the Ligado interference. This thing right  behind me is now up to 82; it was 78 this morning. The list goes on and  on. You can hardly think of a corporation in America that isn't on this  list. So it is something that is a very serious problem and widespread.   Here is one way to put the interference into perspective. Because GPS  signals travel from satellite in space, by the time those signals get  to Earth's surface, they are low power. Because the FCC order allows  Ligado to repurpose spectrum to operate a terrestrial-based network,  Ligado's signals on Earth's surface will be much more powerful than  GPS, causing substantial and harmful interference.   While the FCC required Ligado to repair damage to Federal Agencies  that results from the interference, congressional action is needed  because the FCC's Ligado order fell short in two important ways.   First, the order did not provide an adequate description of costs to  the Federal Agencies that would result from Ligado's interference.   We took bipartisan steps to correct this last year in the NDAA.   The NDAA is the largest bill of the year. I happen to have been for  several years the chairman of this thing. The NDAA is the national  defense authorization bill. It does all the things that we do in the  military. So that is the bill we are talking about.   We included in that bill a provision directing the Department of  Defense to produce an estimate of damages and costs associated with the  harmful interference to GPS. We also directed DOD--Department of  Defense--and the National Academy of Sciences to conduct an independent  technical review of the harmful interference that Ligado can cause.   Secondly, the FCC failed to require that Ligado bear the costs of  interference in State governments or pay for interference to devices  owned by individual users. Now, we are talking about all Americans out  there now--not just government, not State government, not Federal  government, but everyone else, these individual users. I talked already  about how many ways we rely on GPS in everyday life. None of that would  be protected from interference under the existing Ligado order.   That is why I am introducing legislation--it is a long name, but I am  going to say it anyway. It is called the Recognizing and Ensuring  Taxpayer Access to Infrastructure Necessary for GPS and Satellite  Communications Act, 2021. Got that? All right. I call it the RETAIN  Act. That is a little more accurate and easy to understand.   My legislation ensures that Federal Agencies, State governments, and  all others negatively impacted by the actions of a private actor are  not left holding the bag when it comes to costs, the amount of money it  would cost to rectify, and, worse, aren't put in a position where they  have to push the costs onto the American consumers.   Why is this legislation necessary? Reliable GPS and satellite  communications are important to everyone in the world and drive much of  the Nation's economy. That is why I am going to ask my colleagues to  embrace, endorse, and cosponsor this legislation. Otherwise, others may  be forced to pay for damage that is done by the system.   Anyway, I am going to ask our colleagues to join me in cosponsoring  this legislation. If we don't do this and something happens, then it  will be paid for not by those responsible parties but by the taxpayers.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Reserving the right to object.    I object.
