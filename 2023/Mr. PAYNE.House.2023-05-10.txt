 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, Mr. Thompson, for  the opportunity to speak here today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2. During the nearly 17  hours that the Committee on Homeland Security met to consider the  border bill offered by Mr. Green, Democrats offered more than 40  amendments in order to remedy significant shortcomings in the bill.   In an effort to offer new provisions to bolster operations at Customs  and Border Protection and build up the fiscal year 2023 Omnibus  Appropriations Act, which is what was supposed to be going on, working  on the budget that night, under Democratic leadership, they provide  over $17 billion to CBP to not only enhance port of entry operations  but also increase funding to the U.S. Border Patrol by 17 percent.   All of the amendments were rejected by the committee Republicans.  Instead of working with Democrats to provide bipartisan solutions to  fix our broken immigration system, H.R. 2 is just a far-right, MAGA- style immigration bill advanced by Republicans that would tear at the  fabric of American values and drastically limit asylum opportunities  while doing nothing to create an orderly system.   The xenophobia bill filed in this space of religious values that  Republicans claim to live by, at best, H.R. 2 is a deeply distrustful  effort to exploit irregular migration at the southwest border, which is  expected to intensify with the termination of title 42 health  restrictions.   To make political points with Donald Trump and his devoted, extreme  MAGA base, the hardworking civil servants who work to keep our border  secure deserve so much better.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Republicans who support detaining and deporting  more migrants to take a look at section 115(c), division A. If enacted,  it would prohibit DHS from contracting with any nongovernmental  organizations to transport or shelter ``inadmissible aliens.'' This  language would prevent ICE from being able to contract with private  companies that facilitate deportations or provide detention space,  because they want a nongovernmental organization to do it.   Now, for the life of me, here we are again. You can't have it both  ways. You want all of this deportation to happen, but now you are  limiting the organization from doing it.    Mr. Speaker, just one last point.   Ironically, it seems that the child deportation act may actually  undermine the MAGA extreme deportation agenda.   Listening to my colleague, the ranking member from Mississippi, we  have already torn children and babies away from their families. Now, it  appears that we won't even help women who might be pregnant in this  endeavor. I mean, how far do you want to go?    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the unnecessary debt  ceiling crisis.   The MAGA Republicans want to hold the American economy hostage to  [[Page H2237]]  their political agenda. They want to force cruel cuts to the budget to  hurt working-class Americans--all for cheap political points.   If enacted, their budget would deny healthcare to millions of  Americans and lay off thousands of teachers and emergency medical  personnel. It would take away food from children and seniors.   MAGA Republicans do not think the lives of children and seniors are  important. They would rather give tax dollars to billionaires and help  them take tax write-offs on private jets, et cetera.   Thankfully, House Democrats are putting people over politics to solve  real problems.   President Biden's budget supports children, seniors, and American  workers. It will create new jobs and lower costs to help families. It  is the budget America needs right now.                            ____________________
