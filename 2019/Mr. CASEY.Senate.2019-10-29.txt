 Madam President, I commend and salute the work of Senator  Manchin, the senior Senator from West Virginia, for his work on behalf  of American workers generally, but, in particular, his passionate  advocacy and his hard work to make sure that we, in this body, the  United States Senate, that we do everything we can to keep our promise.   I pick up from where he left off. As he has so often said when he  came to this floor, as he did today, to talk about the people whose  retirement security is on the line, this debate applies to a whole  range of workers, but when you consider just coal miners and their  families, who have given the country so much, I am reminded of a story  from my home area, northeastern Pennsylvania.   We produce, in a few counties in northeastern Pennsylvania, the hard  coal, anthracite coal. The great novel of Stephen Crane came to that  region in the 1890s. He would go on to become famous for writing the  novel, ``The Red Badge of Courage.'' But Stephen Crane, when he was a  young man--and he never made it to his 30th birthday, so he was an  accomplished writer even as a young man--he wrote an essay about a coal  mine in Scranton, my hometown in Lackawanna County.   In that essay, he described going into a coal mine and what he saw.  At one point in the essay, he said that the mine was a place of  inscrutable darkness, a soundless place of tangible loneliness. Then he  went on to describe what the coal miners did--what really the children  were doing, little boys in the mine and men in the mine. Then, at the  end of the essay, he listed all the ways a miner could die in those  mines in the 1890s.   Now, I know we made progress over the generations and over the  decades, but even in modern times, coal mining has been very dangerous  and very difficult work, work that I can't even begin to imagine. I  never had to do it, but my ancestors did. These miners not only worked  in those dangerous conditions and not only put their lives on the line  to do that work, but they also did it with a sense of keeping their  promise.   They made a promise to their employer that they would work hard every  day, and they kept that promise. They made a promise to their families  that they would work hard to provide a living for their families--in  some cases, provide a living for several generations of their  families--and they kept that promise. Some of them even made a promise  to their country to serve in war all the way from World War I and all  the way to our most recent conflicts. A lot of them died in Vietnam. A  lot of them died in battlefields all over the world, in World War II  and other conflicts.   They kept their promise to their country. They kept their promise to  their family and to their employer. All they have asked of us is to  keep our promise. It is not hard to do it either. All you have got to  do is put your hand up and say, ``I support that bill,'' or ``I support  that amendment.'' It is not hard to do. It doesn't take a lot of floor  time either to have these matters considered.   Now, what are we facing today? The bankruptcy filing of Murray  Energy, which stems largely from competition from cheaper alternatives  like natural gas and decline in exports. This could bring the pension  and healthcare coverage for our coal miners to the very brink and to  result in us not keeping our promise. Failure to act could result in  devastating consequences for these coal miners in communities across  Pennsylvania and West Virginia. We heard from the senior Senator from  Virginia, Senator Warner, and indeed all across the country.   Now, there is another bill that deals with pensions more generally,  the Butch Lewis Act. Now, the House passed the Butch Lewis Pension  Act--I am adding the word ``Pension'' into it. It is called the Butch  Lewis Act. The House passed that 3 months ago, and the majority leader,  Senator McConnell, has chosen not to have a vote on that bill. I don't  understand that. I am not sure that there are many people that do, but  I would hope--I would hope--that he would reconsider and have a vote on  the Butch Lewis Act.   We should also have a vote on the American Miners Act, the  legislation that Senator Manchin has worked so hard on. We know that in  the House, as well, a bipartisan effort led by Chairman Grijalva and  Chairman Scott, we know that the Health Benefits for Miners Act of 2019  and the Miners Pension Protection Act were voted out of the Natural  Resources Committee last week by a voice vote.   So, in the House, they are doing voice votes to advance legislation  to help these workers, to help miners, and here, there is not even a  vote--voice vote, rollcall vote, any kind of vote. We are not asking  for days of floor time. All we are asking for is a short time for  debate, but mostly, we are just asking for a vote. That vote is real  simple: Keep your promise. Keep our promise and the promise our country  made to these miners and the promise that our employers make to workers  every day of the week. There is still a lot of work to do on pensions  generally, as outlined by some of these bills, but they have kept their  promise over and over again. It is about time we kept our promise.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise tonight to talk about healthcare,  which is an issue that obviously commands a lot of attention, but  lately, frankly, not enough attention here in the Senate. I will focus,  in particular, on one report that we are issuing today that will talk  about one aspect of some of the problems we are having in our  healthcare system right now that a lot of Americans might not be aware  of. They probably will be more aware when they hear more about the  report that I have.   I think we should start from the basic premise that we have made  tremendous progress in the last number of years in access to  healthcare, in healthcare coverage. We know, for example, that between  the years 2010, the year that the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act was passed, and the end of 2016--so, basically, just a matter  of 6 years--something on the order of 20-plus million Americans gained  health insurance coverage. We went from roughly the number of uninsured  in the country being a little more than 47 million in 2010 to a little  more than 27 million in 2016.   Over the course of just 6 to 7 years, 20 million fewer people were  uninsured. That is a great measure of progress on an issue where most  people said there was no way you could get 20 million more people  insured. Very few Americans thought that was possible until it actually  happened.   Unfortunately, that progress--the progress being the diminution or  the reduction of the uninsured population--is, unfortunately, not just  flattening out, but it is actually getting worse. The number of  uninsured Americans is actually going up now. That is a giant step  backward in a country that not only reduced the uninsured number by 20- plus million but provided, in the same bill, the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act.   The patient protection part of that ushered in all kinds of reforms  for those with insurance--those who had insurance before 2010 and those  who were paying their premiums but had their lives and their coverage  in the hands of insurance companies that had power over their lives, to  the extent that an individual with a preexisting condition would not be  treated and would not be covered because of that preexisting condition.  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act changed that for tens  and tens and tens of millions of Americans, in addition to the coverage  gains that I just mentioned.   Just for a point of reference, I will mention the recent numbers. The  Census Bureau, back in just September of this year, said--and I am  quoting from a report from Kaiser Health News, by Mr. Phil Galewitz,  who is talking about the census report. He said the following:         For the first time in a decade, the numbers of Americans       without health insurance has risen--by about 2 million people       in 2018--according to the annual U.S. Census Bureau report       released Tuesday.    This ``Tuesday'' means a day in September.   [[Page S6257]]              The Census found that 8.5 percent of the U.S. population       went without medical insurance for all of 2018, up from 7.9       percent in 2017.    What he was referring to is that the Census Bureau had said that the  number of uninsured went up by 1.9 million people. That didn't happen  just by accident. It happened because of some of the steps taken by the  administration and by those that support the administration.   We have to be focused on reversing that decline, getting the number  of uninsured down, getting more Americans covered, and making sure that  more Americans have basic protections.   What is particularly egregious and disturbing about this trend is  that those suffering the most tend to be children. For example, in  another analysis by Georgetown University, it says that ``4.3 million  kids were uninsured in 2018--a statistically significant increase of  425,000.''   What Georgetown was telling us in that analysis is that that  diminution of those who were insured or who have insurance is rising by  more than 400,000 among children. So the United States of America made  great strides in the mid-1960s, when the Medicaid Program was enacted  into law, which helped to reduce the number of children who were  uninsured and helped to reduce the number of children who did not have  access to quality healthcare and ushered in a brand-new healthcare  program for children and people with disabilities and seniors needing  long-term care. That is the Medicaid Program. You could call it the  ``Kids, Seniors, and Disability Program for Healthcare.'' The same  country, the United States of America, then made greater progress  decades later when the Children's Health Insurance Program came into  effect. It was voted on here in the 1990s with bipartisan support,  sustained over time by bipartisan support, and sustained in many States  by Republican and Democratic Governors. But despite the Medicaid  Program and the advances for children, despite the Children's Health  Insurance Program and the advances for children, and despite the  advances brought about by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Act and the advances for children in that, now we are seeing a  reversal.   Are we going to be satisfied? Are we going to say that we are the  country that we want to be and that we claim to be if now we are moving  backward on children's health insurance, and 425,000 fewer children  have healthcare in 2018, and that that is what we are going to settle  for in the United States of America?   That is an abomination. That is a stain on our country. Anyone who is  not in the business of reversing that and getting that number up-- covering more children and making sure that children have healthcare  coverage--shouldn't be involved in any government and shouldn't run for  public office if that is what your attitude is. Either you don't care  about that or you think that is actually a measure of progress.   We have some work to do in the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of  Representatives and in the administration to make sure that when they  measure this again later in 2019 or in 2020, that number is coming  down, that we are reducing the uninsured, and that we are reducing the  number of children who are uninsured.   It is going to be difficult to do that and to make progress on that  when you consider what the administration, supported by Republicans in  the House and the Senate, have done lately. They have done three things  that are setting us backward.   One is supporting a lawsuit in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals,  which will destroy the Affordable Care Act. It will destroy it. We  should be arguing against that lawsuit. It is highly likely, or at  least likely, I will say--I don't want to be that pessimistic--that  that lawsuit will prevail and the Affordable Care Act will be wiped  away and declared unconstitutional by the circuit court or maybe by the  Supreme Court down the road if the Supreme Court were to take that case  up on appeal.   That is not good for America for lots of reasons. All those  Americans--more than 130 million--who have a preexisting condition will  be out of luck if that lawsuit prevails. The protections for  preexisting conditions will be taken away after having been granted for  the first time, basically, a decade ago, to tens and tens of millions  of Americans. A lot of other adverse consequences come from that  lawsuit succeeding, so every Member of the Senate should be against  that lawsuit.   Now, some say: Well, we have a better idea. Well, come forward with  your better idea and figure out a way, if you can, to provide coverage  for 20 million people, to provide protections for those who have a  preexisting condition--provide the same protections in a different way,  if you can, but don't say to the country that we are supporting a  lawsuit that will take all those protections away when you don't have  anything to replace it with, you have nothing that has been enacted  into law or nothing that has been proposed that will be commensurate  with the coverage gains and protections of the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act. We can be weeks away from that lawsuit succeeding.  That is problem No. 1--threat No. 1, I call it.   Threat No. 2 are the proposed cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. The  administration proposed cutting the Medicaid program that I just  referred to a couple of minutes ago, the children's disability and  long-term nursing home care program--that is what Medicaid does, helps  people get into nursing homes. It helps a lot of middle-class families  afford long-term nursing care. It helps about 40 percent of American  children with healthcare and helps a lot of children, especially  children with disabilities, have the therapies, treatments, and the  protections they need because they have a disability or sometimes more  than one disability. That is the Medicaid program.   What does the administration want to do? They want to cut it by $1.5  trillion. No one here should support that kind of a cut, but not only  do some people here support it by their silence, by their assent, many  here are champions of that, strongly advocating for that kind of a cut,  so we have to fight against that, too--the cuts to Medicare and  Medicaid.   Then there is threat No. 3--No. 1 being the threat of the lawsuit,  No. 2 being the threat of the cuts to Medicare and Medicaid--the third  threat is the sabotage that has been undertaken from day one of the  administration. On the Republican side, I would hope that someone would  speak up against this. I haven't heard much. I have been listening. I  haven't heard much about those who might claim to not be in favor of  sabotage.   Here is one example of sabotage in the report I referred to earlier.  We just issued this report today: ``HEALTH CARE SABOTAGE ONLINE: A  WARNING TO CONSUMERS.'' Here is what we did: We started calling all  over Pennsylvania and doing research on what was advertised for these  short-term duration healthcare plans known in the vernacular here in  Washington by the phrase ``junk plans.'' Why do we say they are junk?  Well, we say that because these plans were only allowed to be in place  for 3 months, but the administration changed that rule. Now, these  plans are available. You can purchase a plan like this for 1 year, and  then you can renew it for up to 3 years. What happens? Well, often,  people are deceived into signing up for plans that don't have the  protections that they thought they would have. They don't have the  protections that I think most Americans have come to expect.   Here is the first finding in the report: ``When searching online for  health insurance plans, it is difficult to differentiate between paid  advertisements and search results.''   Now, we just had an example today of a man in Pennsylvania who told  us that, when he went online and did some investigation and then was  talking to someone on the phone who was selling him insurance, they  said: ``It's got all the protections of the Affordable Care Act.'' But,  of course, it didn't, and he was deceived.   There are a lot of stories of people being deceived by false  advertising and by misleading advertising. Even if going to a page  after having done a search and on that page it might say  ``healthcare.gov,'' which is the right place to go if you want to  enroll, but sometimes, healthcare.gov has nothing to do with it. It is  advertised as what healthcare.gov offers, but it doesn't offer that. It  offers a junk plan, and people are in real trouble when they sign up  for the wrong plan.  [[Page S6258]]    So the first thing folks should do is make sure that they carefully  examine these paid advertisements so they don't get into a plan that is  going to prevent them from getting the coverage they need.   The second finding that we concluded is: ``Paid advertisements for  health insurance are often misleading and fail to fully disclose very  important information.''   The third and final finding is the following: ``Advertisements often  use `HealthCare.Gov' in the website title and descriptions despite  having no affiliation with HealthCare.Gov.''   So people see that on the top of the page, and it is not designated  in the correct way so that you can actually get to the correct site.  You are sent to some other site, and before you know it, you are  clicking on to plans that don't give you the coverage you think you are  getting.   So there is a lot of misinformation. There is a lot of scam artistry  or a lot of other ways to describe it because they have more time to do  it. They used to only have a 3-month time period. It wasn't really a  good business model to try to mislead people into your junk plan if you  only have 3 months. Now, they have 1 year or they may have more than 1  year if the individual were to reenroll for a total of 3 years. So  instead of having 3 months for this short-term insurance, which was  never meant to be permanent, which was only meant to be an interim  policy, now these scam artists, these purveyors of fraud in many  instances, have a lot more time to rip you off and get you on to a plan  that doesn't provide the kind of protection that you and your family  need.   So what are we going to do about it? We should do a couple of things.  We, first and foremost, should remind people that this is the time,  starting this Friday, November 1, for open enrollment. Folks will have  6 weeks in that open enrollment period. That is good, and we should  make sure people are aware when that open enrollment starts; but while  they are searching and making this very consequential decision for  themselves or their family, they should be warned about and be educated  about what can happen to them if they are on a site that will not  provide the care and the coverage that they need.   There is an old expression: ``Forewarned is forearmed.'' We want to  forewarn people so they are ready and they will be vigilant.   Here are a couple of things that we can do. We provide a couple of  tips to avoid enrolling in one of these junk plans. No. 1: ``To get  help picking the health insurance coverage that fits your needs, visit  HealthCare.Gov.''   In fact, when you type in to do a search, you should type  www.HealthCare.Gov. That is the best way to get to the right site. So  just make sure you are on HealthCare.Gov and not something that looks  like HealthCare.Gov. Some will go on a site, and some people don't  realize they are not on HealthCare.Gov. They are on healthcare.org.  That is an old way of referring to the site. HealthCare.Gov is the  correct one. That is tip No. 1. Be careful of that.   No. 2: ``Be aware of how the search engine designates  advertisements.'' Be aware that something that looks official is just  an advertisement. Be careful about that.   No. 3: ``Always look at the website address, typically displayed in  green font, before clicking on a link.'' So be careful about the  website address.   No. 4: ``Pay attention to the words used in the website title and  description.'' Title and description. For example, the difference  between HealthCare.Gov and healthcare.org.   So folks can take a look at these tips and be ready to enroll through  HealthCare.Gov in a way that will give them the coverage they want when  they are making that basic choice.   This is what sabotage looks like. When you change a rule from one  administration to the other, instead of having a 3-month rule giving  these interim plans a chance to operate in a shorter timeframe and you  enlarge that to a year, you are sabotaging the system when you do that.  You are not providing people a chance for better healthcare, you are  making it much more likely that folks will be deceived because those  who are trying to make money here saw this opportunity. As soon as they  saw that 3 months going to 1 year, they saw a golden opportunity to  make money and rip people off, and it is working. A lot of people are  becoming victims of it. So that is sabotage.   The other sabotage is limiting the enrollment period. I just  mentioned that open enrollment period starts on Friday, but it is 6  weeks. It used to be longer than 6 weeks. So you are limiting the time  within which someone can avail themselves to get healthcare, the  opportunity to change a plan or do anything like that.   Another way that sabotage has played out is a limitation on the  advertising. Guess what, if you limit the advertising by cutting the  advertising budget--at one point, it was cut by 90 percent--guess what,  fewer people know about their opportunities to enroll by way of  HealthCare.Gov or to have the opportunity not just for coverage but  often to have a subsidy that will help you pay for the coverage. So  that is another way that the administration is engaged in sabotage, and  it is working because, as I mentioned, 1.9 million Americans or fewer  Americans are insured today than 2 years ago, so it is working,  unfortunately.   I mention the coverage loss that is hitting children. There is a New  York Times story dated October 22, just last week. The headline is:  ``Medicaid Covers a Million Fewer Children. Baby Elijah was one of  them.''   The subheadline says ``Officials point to rising unemployment, but  the uninsured rate is climbing as families run afoul of new paperwork  and as fear rises among immigrants.''   So a series of steps taken by the administration has caused the  number of children who are uninsured to go up. That is and should be  unacceptable to any American.   Finally, I want to conclude with one thought about preexisting  conditions. When we vote this week, we will have an opportunity to push  back against some of the sabotage, to make it less likely that people  will be misled, to make it less likely that people will be enrolled in  some junk insurance plan. One of the adverse consequences of being in  the wrong plan, getting the wrong information, and being misled, being  deceived, is a lack of coverage for a preexisting condition. So if you  have asthma or diabetes or arthritis or high blood pressure under the  old rules, under the old law, you could be discriminated against  because you had a preexisting condition. So an insurance company can  legally discriminate against you.   The law changed in 2010, fortunately, so that discrimination was  pushed back against, and we finally had a circumstance for families who  didn't have to worry about preexisting conditions--or at least didn't  have to worry about coverage for treatment for a preexisting condition.   Lo and behold, you find examples in your home States. A couple of  months ago, I was with one of my constituents, Rev. Shirley Cornell.  She told me about how the Affordable Care Act had completely changed  her husband's life. She told me that her husband's $8,000 deductible  dropped by about one-third after enrolling in insurance under the  Affordable Care Act. She said: ``We were one experience away from chaos  and possibly bankruptcy.'' Because of the protections in place for a  preexisting condition, Reverend Cornell doesn't have to worry about  that. She may have to worry about a lot of other things, but that is  one thing she doesn't have to worry about.   Unfortunately, if this sabotage keeps marching forward, she may have  to worry. A worry that was lifted from so many families just less than  a decade ago now may burden them once again. There is no reason why we  have to go back to those days when an insurance company could deny a  child coverage because that child had a preexisting condition or could  deny an adult treatment or coverage because they had a preexisting  condition. There is no reason why we have to go back to those days; yet  some around here seem to want to go back to those days.   The best way to make sure that we don't is to fight against what the  administration has been doing, to fight against the lawsuit, to fight  against the sabotage, and to fight against the budget cuts. I know some  don't want to do that. They seem to want to continue to support what  the administration is doing.  [[Page S6259]]    I hope that folks will take advantage of this opportunity in the next  6 weeks, starting on Friday, November 1, and use the open enrollment  period and examine these issues with an eye towards not being deceived,  not being brought down a road where you won't get the coverage you  need. Maybe we can have some success in putting the junk plan artists  out of business so that they can't deceive people into getting  insurance that they expect would provide them more coverage.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
