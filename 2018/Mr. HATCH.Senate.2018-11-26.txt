 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Traumatic  [[Page S7090]]  Brain Injury Program Reauthorization Act of 2018. I want to thank my  colleague, Senator Casey, for working with me once again on important  legislation to reauthorize the Federal Traumatic Brain Injury program,  which is dedicated to improving the delivery and quality of care for  persons with traumatic brain injury -- or, TBI.   Each year, millions of Americans suffer TBIs as a result of  automobile collisions, falls, recreational accidents, assaults, and  other tragic incidents. TBI has also been called a signature wound of  recent wars. In 2016, the Department of Defense reported more than  18,000 service members diagnosed with traumatic brain injury. A  survivor of a severe brain injury typically faces years of intensive  health and rehabilitation services, with estimated lifetime costs in  the millions.   In 1996, I worked with my good friend Senator Ted Kennedy on the  original TBI Act to help limit the suffering, death, and long-term  disability that results from TBI. Our legislation marked the beginning  of a multifaceted Federal endeavor to address the needs of persons with  TBI and their families. The 1996 TBI law authorized research, not only  for the treatment of traumatic brain injury, but also for prevention  and awareness programs to help decrease the occurrence of TBI and  improve patient outcomes. It was the first Federal legislation to focus  on improving education, protection, and state services coordination for  TBI.   Today's TBI program maintains that original framework of prevention,  education, access, and protection. The Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) conducts projects to reduce the incidence of traumatic  brain injury. Through the Administration for Community Living (ACL),  the TBI State Partnership Grant Program helps States and territories to  build service infrastructure and improve access to services and  supports.   Through the ACL, the TBI program also supports protection and  advocacy to provide TBI survivors with information and referral  services, and to help resolve legal and administrative problems for  individuals or groups of individuals with developmental disabilities.  Our bill reauthorizes TBI activities at the CDC and ACL.   The CDC has reported that about 2.5 million children and adults  sustain TBIs each year. But we do not truly know the incidence and  prevalence of TBI or the lifelong disability it can cause. Surveillance  is especially important to our efforts to reduce the public health  burden of TBI. Improved data collection can help both primary  prevention of TBI, and acute care and rehabilitation. Prevention  programs should be targeted to address at-risk populations and specific  causes of TBI. And accurate data are needed to improve TBI survivors'  access to necessary services.   At present, CDC is piloting a National Concussion Surveillance System  as a means to fill these gaps and provide a better estimate of the TBI  burden. This system is an effort that aligns with recommendations made  in a 2013 report from the National Academies for Sciences, Engineering,  and Medicine, as well as proposals included in President's Budget  requests.   When taken to scale following the pilot study, this system has the  capacity to provide the first truly comprehensive incidence of TBI in  children across the lifespan and at a national level. It also has the  potential to improve our understanding of the full range of  circumstances leading to TBI and track healthcare utilization and  services received after a TBI event. By collecting information over  multiple years, we can also track whether the problem is getting better  or worse, and if prevention efforts are actually working.   The Traumatic Brain Injury Program Reauthorization of 2018 is  supported by the Brain Injury Association of America (BIAA) and the  National Association of State Head Injury Administrators (NASHIA). It  will extend important prevention, education, State program support, and  protection and advocacy activities for an additional five years. It  will also help to gather the data that we need to make those programs  better, and, ultimately, to improve TBI survivors' access to necessary  services. I urge my colleagues to support our efforts to continue  improving the delivery and quality of care for persons living with TBI  by helping to pass the Traumatic Brain Injury Program Reauthorization  of 2018.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Traumatic  [[Page S7090]]  Brain Injury Program Reauthorization Act of 2018.
