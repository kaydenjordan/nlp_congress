 I thank the Presiding Officer, and I want to start by  thanking my friend and our colleague, Senator Joe Donnelly, for  standing up for Hoosiers and, in standing up for Hoosiers, standing up  for all Americans whose healthcare is threatened if we continue to  proceed down this very dangerous road in the Senate.   He talked about the opioid epidemic. Just last week I met with a dad  by the name of Rick Warner and the brother and sister of a young man by  the name of Jamie Warner who had recently graduated from the University  of Maryland. He was a Terp.   Jamie died of an opioid overdose. He was part of the opioid epidemic  that is sweeping the country. Rick Warner and his family were here in  the Senate asking Senators--in fact, pleading with Senators,  Republicans and Democrats alike--not to pass this healthcare bill.   He had lost his son Jamie, and he is determined that other moms and  dads not lose their children to opioid overdose. This bill--make no  mistake--will make those tragedies much more likely by taking away  access to care in the way Senator Donnelly just mentioned.   Yesterday, with the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Pence, the  Senate began down a very dangerous path, but we can get off that path.  We can make sure we do not reach the end of that very dangerous  journey. It was as if yesterday we lit the fuse and the fire is  traveling down that fuse and at the end of the fuse is the plan to  totally blow up the Affordable Care Act, which will wreak havoc on our  healthcare system. That is why we have to put out the fire on that fuse  right here in the Senate. We have the power to do that. We have the  power to prevent the chaos and harm that will be created in our  healthcare system if we continue down this path.   The reality, we know, is that all the healthcare plans that we have  seen emerge to date--whether it was House plan 1 or House plan 2, or  Senate plan 1 or Senate plan 2, or the proposal to repeal entirely the  Affordable Care Act, which would cause great harm--have the same rotten  core. All of them have the same nasty DNA, and that is this: They would  deny access to affordable care for tens of millions of our fellow  Americans in order to give tax breaks to the very powerful and very  rich and to big corporations. In fact, the proposal we are voting on  very soon, which is entirely repealing the Affordable Care Act with no  replacement, will result, according to the nonpartisan Congressional  Budget Office--these are the nonpartisan referees who look at these  proposals and tell the American people what the impact will be--in 32  million fewer of our fellow Americans having access to affordable care  than today. They also tell us that we will double the health insurance  premiums compared to today. And for what? They give a gigantic tax  break to the wealthiest Americans.   Warren Buffett, a name most Americans know, said about a month ago:  For goodness' sake, I don't need a $670,000 a year tax cut in order to  throw tens of millions of Americans off of affordable care. Don't do  that. I don't need it.   Make no mistake. This has never been about healthcare. It has been  about wealth care. I want people to think about this. If this were  really about healthcare, why is it that all of the folks involved in  providing healthcare to the American people are against it--the nurses,  doctors, and hospitals?   People hear a lot of facts and figures from Senators and from the  House. Some people may dismiss those numbers, but why don't we ask the  people whose daily business it is to take care of the American people?  What the doctors say is that all of these Republican plans violate  their Hypocratic oath. What is the Hypocratic oath? It is the oath that  every doctor in the country takes and the first principle is to first,  do no harm.   Doctors, nurses, and hospitals all want to make people better. They  all want to cure us. They all want to improve our health situation, but  their No. 1 rule is not to make things worse, and all of these bills  make things worse. That is what the numbers show us, and that is what  the doctors, hospitals, and nurses show us. I think it is worse to have  32 million fewer Americans have access to affordable care.   What about our colleagues? Don't they think that is worse? I think it  is worse when you double health insurance premiums and raise the cost  of healthcare to Americans. That sounds like it is worse to me, not  better.   It is not just all the folks who provide healthcare. Why don't we ask  all of the patient advocacy groups across America about this so-called  healthcare bill? What do they say?   The American Cancer Society: Bad bill--don't pass it. It will create  harm. It will be a setback in our fight against cancer.   The American Diabetes Association says the same thing: Bad news for  patients with diabetes.   The American Heart Association tells us that this will be bad and  harmful to people with heart disease.   There is the Alzheimer's association, and we can go down the list.  Every single patient advocacy group in America that has taken a  position on this bill says it is a bad bill, it is dangerous to our  health, and it will do harm.   So I don't know how our Republican colleagues can bring Senate bill  1, Senate bill 2, or Senate bill 3 before this  [[Page S4244]]  House and call it a healthcare bill when all the people who provide  healthcare to our constituents say it is harmful to their health and  when every patient advocacy group that has weighed in says that it is  bad for their health. How is that a healthcare bill?   It is good for one group of Americans--those who will get a windfall  tax break, but many of them, like Warren Buffett, are saying: Hey, I  don't want this.   Now there are some very big corporations that are wanting their tax  breaks, and, yes, as corporations, they are going to get this windfall  benefit at the expense of everybody else in America and at the expense  of our healthcare system.   So let's not go down this path. The way to avoid going down this path  is to vote down all of these amendments and make sure that we don't put  this bill into the House of Representatives, where they have already  passed a bill that is harmful to Americans' health.   In fact, I think people will remember that President Trump had this  big celebration in the Rose Garden of the White House after the House  passed that bill. They were slapping each other on their backs before  the cameras.   Yet, behind closed doors, what did President Trump have to say about  the House bill? Behind closed doors, he called it a mean bill, and it  is a mean bill. These Senate bills, when it comes to cuts in Medicaid  that our colleague Senator Donnelly was talking about, are even meaner  than the House bill, with deeper long-term cuts. This is not according  to me. It is according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.   Those cuts get translated into stories of people like Rick Warner,  the dad I talked about at the beginning of my comments who lost his son  Jamie. Those numbers get translated into harm to people throughout this  country who have been crying out. We heard some of them in the Gallery  just yesterday. What did they say? ``Kill the bill. Don't kill us.''   The reality is, when you deny access to affordable care to millions  of Americans, you are putting their lives at risk, and when you raise  premiums and costs, you are putting people's livelihoods at risk. So  let's not go down this path.   The motion by Senator Donnelly and others will do what Senator John  McCain asked us to do yesterday--to go back to regular order, to go  back to the committee process, to go back to the way this democratic  institution is supposed to work, which is when we hear from our  constituents, we hear from the doctors, we hear from the nurses. We do  not cover our eyes and ears to the facts and the truth.   That open process is designed to protect the American people. It is  designed to protect the American people from bills just like this one  for which this Senate took that dangerous first step down the road on  proposals that only 11 percent of the American people think is a good  idea--11 percent. I cannot even find that 11 percent myself. I have  gone all over the State of Maryland, to those parts of our State that  voted for Donald Trump for President and to those that did not. I  cannot find 11 percent in Maryland who are for this bill. That is why  what we call the regular order around here is supposed to protect the  public interest--because when you have a committee hearing on a bill  like this and the doctors and the nurses and the hospitals all come out  and testify against it, they let people know how bad it is. Instead, we  have had this process in secret, behind closed doors. In many cases, we  do not even know what the next amendments after this one that is coming  up are going to be. We do not know what the Republican leader is  cooking up behind closed doors.   Let's do what Senator McCain urged us all to do. Let's get back to  regular order. Let's get back to a process that is designed to provide  transparency because with transparency comes accountability. It lets  the American public know exactly what we are doing and how we are going  to impact their lives.   Here is what I do know. Everybody across this country who knows about  this bill--everyone I have spoken to and from the phone calls we are  getting and the emails we are getting and at the rallies and the  townhalls--is catching on. Why would we just steamroll over all of that  important public sentiment coming from all political views? The  American Cancer Society is not a Republican or a Democratic  organization. The American Diabetes Association is not partisan. These  groups are crying out and saying: Stop.   So let's get off this path, this very dangerous path. Let's get back  to regular order. We all know our healthcare system is not perfect. We  all know the Affordable Care Act is not perfect. Senator Donnelly and I  and others and many of our Republican colleagues have put forward much  more narrow plans that focus on improving our healthcare system, not on  blowing it up entirely. That is the path we should take.   I hope all of our Senators will agree not to continue to let that  fire burn on the fuse until it gets to the end and blows up our  healthcare system. Let's stop now. Let's get together, and let's have a  committee process. Let's do something that really improves our  healthcare system and not something that destroys it.

Mr. President, I intend to file a motion to commit  the reconciliation bill to the Finance Committee with instructions to  report the same back to the Senate within 3 days, not counting any day  on which the Senate is not in Session, with changes that would  eliminate provisions that threaten to make prescription drugs  unaffordable for those with childhood cancer. I am offering this motion  because the Finance Committee should review the implications of  depriving millions of Americans of health insurance while at the same  time providing tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans. I ask unanimous  consent that the full text of my motion to commit be printed in the  Record following my remarks.
