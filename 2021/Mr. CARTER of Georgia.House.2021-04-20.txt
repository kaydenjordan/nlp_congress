 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor Bobby Ryon of Hinesville, Georgia, who sadly passed away on March  20 at the age of 65.   Bobby lived a remarkable life and touched countless lives. He was a  lifelong resident of Hinesville, Georgia, and was a proud graduate of  Bradwell Institute's class of 1974.   Everyone who knew Bobby remembers his kind and gentle spirit. He was  a former city of Hinesville council member, and served in various  capacities in many organizations, including Liberty County Hospital  Authority, Liberty County Chamber of Commerce, Diversity Health Clinic,  and Hinesville Housing Authority.   Through every position he had, he worked to better his community and  every life he touched. Many say that his greatest love was his family,  and those who knew him best know his greatest love also was his Lord.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all who  knew him, during this most difficult time.            Congratulating Brunswick High School Student Teachers     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Brunswick High School student teachers, who recently passed the end of  pathway assessments for early childhood education. These students  earned the honor of being the high-scoring group that has participated  in the Pint Pirates program--all of this while in the middle of a  pandemic.   I commend this group of students for their hard work and dedication.  The Pint Pirates program is an in-school preschool program offered at  Brunswick High and taught by students from Glynn Academy and Brunswick  High School pursuing the early childhood education pathway. The mission  of the class is to help young children prepare for prekindergarten and  to better prepare high school students who are interested in teaching  early childhood programs.   I am extremely proud to have these great students and program here in  the First Congressional District of Georgia.   To teachers, students, and staff alike at Brunswick High School and  Glynn Academy: Congratulations on your accomplishments, and keep up the  good work.                        Honoring Walter Ronald Huggins     Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Ronnie Huggins of Garden City and Rincon,  Georgia, who passed away on March 21, 2020, at the age of 80.   Ronnie was born in Savannah, Georgia, and was a graduate of Savannah  High School. He went on to proudly serve our country in the 118th U.S.  Army Field Artillery Regiment. One of Ronnie's passions in life was  helping others achieve their dreams.   He started his own construction business and quickly became a  distinguished and beloved residential home builder throughout the  Coastal Empire and Lowcountry of Hilton Head Island. He took great  pride in, and had a talent for, helping others achieve their dream  home, spending countless hours drawing and redrawing house plans by  hand.   Ronnie's passion as a volunteer in youth recreation would eventually  lead to an appointment as the recreation director for Garden City.   Ronnie's wife, Sheila, passed away on March 30, 2021. My thoughts and  prayers are with their family, friends, and all who knew them during  this most difficult time.              Recognizing Brunswick, Georgia's 250th Anniversary     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  250th anniversary of the founding of Brunswick, Georgia.   Located on the southeast coast of Georgia, Mark Carr was the first  European settler to live in what is now the city of Brunswick. In 1771,  the council of the Royal Province of Georgia ordered the city of  Brunswick to be laid out on Carr's land. The city was platted by George  McIntosh, copying the Oglethorpe Plan of Savannah.   Since its founding, the city of Brunswick has overcome fires,  hurricanes, wars, and pandemics and has flourished as a coastal city.   Despite such trying times in the past year due to the pandemic,  businesses have continued to emerge and the spirit of the people  continues to shine.   It has been 250 years since the momentous decision to establish  Brunswick as a city, and I want to recognize the great citizens and  public officials of Brunswick who have made it and continue to make it  a tremendous community and place to live.  [[Page H1962]]    Let this anniversary serve as a reminder of all that we have gone  through in the past and how capable we are of making it through these  trying times together.                            ____________________
