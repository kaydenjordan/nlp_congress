Mr. Chairman, I rise as the designee of the gentlewoman  from Florida, and I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of title XXXV add the following:       SEC. __. APPLICATION OF LAW.         Section 4301 of title 46, United States Code, is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(d) For purposes of any Federal law except the Federal       Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), any       vessel, including a foreign vessel, being repaired or       dismantled is deemed to be a recreational vessel, as defined       under section 2101(25), during such repair or dismantling, if       that vessel--        ``(1) shares elements of design and construction of       traditional recreational vessels (as so defined); and        ``(2) when operating is not normally engaged in a military,       commercial, or traditionally commercial undertaking.''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Byrne) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama.    Mr. Chairman, this straightforward and bipartisan  amendment would provide important clarity for the recreational marine  industry as it relates to workers' compensation coverage.   For decades, Federal law stated that individuals who build,  dismantle, or repair recreational vessels less than 65 feet could be  covered under State workers' compensation law instead of the Federal  Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act.   Under the Democrat-controlled Congress in 2009, the law was  simplified by eliminating the size limitation, which allowed more  employers to purchase State workers' compensation.   Unfortunately, in 2011, the Department of Labor issued a burdensome  and confusing rule creating a new definition of recreational vessel.  This change contradicted legislation passed by the Congress in 2009,  and effectively denied recreational vessel repair workers access to  more affordable State workers' compensation insurance.   This regulatory confusion and uncertainty is reducing access to  affordable workers' compensation policies and also hurting the overall  recreational repair industry.   Our bipartisan amendment increases strong protections to ensure that  no vessel used for commercial or military purposes is inappropriately  excepted from the Federal requirements.   This amendment would provide regulatory relief for small businesses,  including those in coastal Alabama, while also ensuring the maritime  workers receive the protections they need.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman. He and I have  worked together on shipbuilding issues a lot of times, and I appreciate  his leadership in that industry.   These are recreational vessel companies. They are small companies  doing small things on different types of vessels than the ones that Mr.  Courtney and I are typically working together on. So trying to apply  the same rules when it is a completely different activity to where,  when we are usually talking about very large ships, it just doesn't  make any sense.   This has traditionally been a Democrat amendment. I have always  supported it. I am happy to be here to support it today. I would like  for us to continue our tradition of bipartisanship on this issue.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, we have heard nothing from the Coast Guard  this year in opposition to this amendment. In years past, I think the  gentleman is correct, we have heard from them, but this year we have  heard no opposition. In fact, a recreational vessel being repaired is  the same as a recreational vessel being manufactured to use as a public  vessel and should be treated the same in law.   The Coast Guard already strictly enforces the existing laws and  regulations that determine whether a vessel is recreational and  enforces the law against those who would unlawfully use recreational  vessels for commercial purposes. So I would suggest to the gentleman  that this is not something the Coast Guard opposes.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.
