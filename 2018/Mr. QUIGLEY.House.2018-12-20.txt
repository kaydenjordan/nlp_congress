 Mr. Speaker, your point is well taken. I will address my  remarks to the Chair.   Mr. Speaker, the arguments we have heard tonight remind us of the  tale full of sound and fury signifying nothing, reminding us who told  us that tale.   Every border chief since the border chief under President Reagan has  said a wall will deter a crosser from somewhere between 90 seconds and  3 minutes. Mr. Speaker, $5 billion for that.   If they really want to protect our country, and that is what they are  so bent on doing in spending $5 billion, my subcommittee can help you.   In January of 2017, with a high degree of certainty, the entire  intelligence community said the Russians attacked our democratic  process. We are not prepared for their next attack. DNI Coats warned  that the lights are flashing red. We spent $380 million on election  security in 2018--nothing since then.   Mr. Speaker, 40 States do not even have sufficient equipment to put  on software that blocks this hacking. Mr. Speaker, 13 States don't even  have a paper trail. The last time our democratic process was called  into question for such matters was during Bush-Gore, where this very  body spent $3.5 billion to protect its integrity. We can--we must--do  better.   By the way, you have control of the House and Senate. You don't need  to yell at us, folks. You can yell at your own caucus.
