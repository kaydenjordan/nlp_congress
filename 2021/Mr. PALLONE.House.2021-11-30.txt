 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 951) to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to  carry out a national campaign to increase awareness of the importance  of maternal vaccinations for the health of pregnant and postpartum  individuals and their children, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 951         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Maternal Vaccination Act''.       SEC. 2. MATERNAL VACCINATION AWARENESS AND EQUITY CAMPAIGN.         (a) Campaign.--Section 313 of the Public Health Service Act       (42 U.S.C. 245) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a), by inserting ``and among pregnant       and postpartum individuals,'' after ``low rates of       vaccination,'';        (2) in subsection (c)(3), by striking ``prenatal and       pediatric'' and inserting ``prenatal, obstetric, and       pediatric'';        (3) in subsection (d)(4)(B), by inserting ``pregnant and       postpartum individuals and'' after ``including''; and        (4) in subsection (g), by striking ``$15,000,000 for each       of fiscal years 2021 through 2025'' and inserting       ``$17,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026''.        (b) Additional Activities.--Section 317(k)(1)(E) of the       Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(1)(E)) is       amended--        (1) in clause (v), by striking ``and'' at the end; and        (2) by adding at the end the following clause:        ``(vii) increase vaccination rates of pregnant and       postpartum individuals, including individuals from racial and       ethnic minority groups, and their children; and''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 951.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, we are continuing our work to combat the maternal  mortality and morbidity crisis facing our country. The legislation  before us will help ensure that pregnant women and their healthcare  providers are aware of the benefits and availability of safe and  effective vaccines.   Tragically, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports  that about 700 women die each year in the United States as a result of  pregnancy or delivery complications.   While there is no one cause of pregnancy-related death or health  complications, we know that some illnesses like flu, pertussis, and  COVID-19 can cause serious harm to pregnant women, including early  labor and delivery and other complications. Vaccines prevent these  illnesses and can save the lives of pregnant and postpartum women and  their children.   However, despite strong evidence of vaccines' safety and efficacy,  vaccine uptake among pregnant women is far below targeted goals.   We can and should do more to increase the vaccination rate of  pregnant women. H.R. 951, the Maternal Vaccination Act, will ensure  that our vaccination outreach and awareness campaigns and public health  grant programs include outreach to obstetric healthcare providers, as  well as pregnant and postpartum women. The legislation will also ensure  that we are reaching women from racial and ethnic groups and their  children.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this commonsense public  health effort, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1550) to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for  a public awareness campaign with respect to human papillomavirus, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1550         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting Resources to       Expand Vaccination, Education, and New Treatments for HPV       Cancers Act of 2021'' or the ``PREVENT HPV Cancers Act of       2021''.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1550.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1550, the PREVENT HPV  Cancers Act. This bill will help prevent cancer in thousands of  individuals by stepping up our outreach and education to ensure that we  are reaching people eligible for human papillomavirus, or HPV vaccines.   HPV causes nearly 36,000 cases of cancer in men and women each year.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that nearly  33,000 of these cases can be prevented through vaccination.   The HPV vaccine has been shown to be highly effective in most forms  of HPV, and in turn, preventing cancer caused by the virus. For  example, women who have been vaccinated against HPV have been shown to  be 90 percent less likely to be diagnosed with cervical cancer.   Mr. Speaker, despite the high efficacy of the vaccines and increased  vaccination rates, the rates are still below CDC targets and far lower  for HPV than for other recommended vaccines. And while cervical cancer  rates have gone down, other types of HPV-associated cancers, including  head and neck cancers, have been on the rise.   We must do more to improve our outreach to teens and young adults,  and this bill does that by creating a national campaign to educate  health providers and the public on HPV, HPV-associated cancers, and the  importance of HPV vaccines in preventing these cancers.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation passed unanimously out of  the Committee on Energy and Commerce. It deserves our support here on  the floor, so please join me in preventing cancer and supporting this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor), the sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would urge support for this bipartisan  and very important bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 550) to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect to  immunization system data modernization and expansion, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 550.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 550, the Immunization  Infrastructure Modernization Act. This bill would authorize $400  million for grants to expand, enhance, and improve immunization  information systems administered by health departments and used by  healthcare providers.   Immunization information systems, also known as IIS, or immunization  registries, are confidential, population-based, computerized databases  that record immunization doses administered by providers to patients.  They are critical in our fight against COVID-19 and other public health  threats like measles and influenza.   Local public health officials use IIS to collect, analyze, store, and  view aggregated vaccination information, which is kept confidential and  separate from identifiable patient information. This information helps  them understand overall vaccination levels so they can better guide  public health decisions for their communities.   IIS also helps patients and healthcare providers by allowing them to  view a secure consolidated immunization history, helping them determine  appropriate and necessary vaccinations, and reminding patients about  vaccination schedules.   IIS have been critical in the COVID-19 pandemic. They have helped us  understand where vaccines are getting to patients, and where we need to  do more to reach people and provide access. They provided near real- time information sharing, allowing State officials and leadership at  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to understand  vaccination rates and where people are choosing to receive their  vaccines.   Like all forms of infrastructure, IIS require maintenance and  upgrades. As I mentioned, IIS have been an important tool in the fight  against COVID-19, but the pandemic has also tested the ability of IIS  to keep up with the pace of our massive vaccination efforts.   According to the American Immunization Registry Association, one  State went from an average of 17,000 doses recorded in its IIS each day  to over 500,000 this past spring. This dramatic increase required the  State health department to nearly quadruple the number of digital  servers used to host the data. These are not one-time costs. Going  forward, these new servers and the new data collected during the  pandemic will need to be maintained and secured.   State and local leaders have also told us that inconsistent and  antiquated technology, incomplete provider participation, and faltering  interoperability are areas where we must improve to ensure that we have  useful and quality data.   It is important that the systems used by physicians are able to  communicate with the State and local public health departments, and  that these systems  [[Page H6686]]  can also communicate with other States and the CDC.   H.R. 550, the bill before us today, addresses these challenges by  providing grants for technological upgrades, provider outreach and  enrollment, policy development, and a skilled workforce to build and  maintain these systems.   The legislation also requires the Department of Health and Human  Services to create an implementation strategy and set clear data  standards that must be followed by all grantees. And this should help  ensure that States are coordinated going forward.   H.R. 550 will ensure all IIS are brought up to modern standards, help  control disease outbreaks, and put our public health infrastructure on  a solid foundation for years to come.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Kuster and Bucshon for their  bipartisan work on this bill. I urge all Members to support this  important bipartisan legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2685.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2685, the Understanding  Cybersecurity of Mobile Networks Act.   There is no shortage of concerning headlines about cybersecurity  attacks on our critical infrastructure, including our communications  networks. The reports range anywhere from a hacker looking for users'  personal information to sophisticated intelligence gathering on U.S.  officials by foreign adversaries.   The severe nature of these attacks coupled with the important  information carried across wireless networks demands our attention. We  must be vigilant in ensuring our networks are as secure as possible.  That is the goal of H.R. 2685, the Understanding Cybersecurity of  Mobile Networks Act. It will help us gain additional data and insights  from experts to determine what more we can do to make that happen.   Specifically, Mr. Speaker, the legislation requires the Assistant  Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information to lead a  study with the Department of Homeland Security. This study will examine  the cybersecurity of mobile service networks and the vulnerability of  those networks and mobile devices to cyberattacks and surveillance by  adversaries. It not only includes an assessment of what providers are  doing to keep their networks secure, but also an examination of  consumer expectations with respect to network security.   I am proud of the bipartisan work that the Energy and Commerce  Committee has undertaken over the past several years to secure our  communication networks. This is another important step toward that  effort, and I applaud Representatives Eshoo and Kinzinger for their  leadership on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4045) to direct the Federal Communications Commission to  establish a task force to be known as the ``6G Task Force'', and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4045         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Future Uses of Technology       Upholding Reliable and Enhanced Networks Act'' or the       ``FUTURE Networks Act''.       SEC. 2. 6G TASK FORCE.         (a) Establishment.--Not later than 120 days after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Commission shall establish       a task force to be known as the ``6G Task Force''.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4045.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4045, the FUTURE  Networks Act. Even as we await the full deployment and utilization of  fifth generation, or 5G, wireless networks, U.S. communications and  technology companies are collaborating on the next generation of  networks; specifically, 6G networks.   We may not be able to predict now the technological innovation that  will come with these networks, but based on our Nation's experience to  this point, we can foresee the issues that will need to be addressed to  get 6G networks off the ground. Issues like supply chain availability,  security, and equality in deployment and adoption will all need to be  reviewed and resolved; and, therefore, it is not too early for  government and relevant stakeholders to begin discussing these issues  now. That is the goal of H.R. 4045, the FUTURE Networks Act.   This bipartisan legislation would require the FCC to convene a task  force to examine relevant 6G issues. The task force will be made up of  stakeholders from industry, public interest organizations, academic  institutions, and relevant Federal, State, local, and Tribal Government  representatives.   Finding agreed-upon approaches and solutions to these issues now will  make for a smoother transition in the future.   I want to thank our Communications and Technology Subcommittee  chairman,  Mike Doyle, as well as Representatives Johnson and McBath,  for their bipartisan leadership on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support it today, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F. Doyle), who is the chairman  of our Subcommittee on Communications and Technology.    Mr. Speaker, I urge bipartisan support for this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4055) to establish a cybersecurity literacy campaign, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4055         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``American Cybersecurity       Literacy Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of the Congress that the United States has       a national security and economic interest in promoting       cybersecurity literacy amongst the general public.       SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF CYBERSECURITY LITERACY CAMPAIGN.         (a) In General.--The Assistant Secretary shall develop and       conduct a cybersecurity literacy campaign (which shall be       available in multiple languages and formats, if practicable)       to increase the knowledge and awareness of the American       people of best practices to reduce cybersecurity risks.        (b) Campaign.--To reduce cybersecurity risks, the Assistant       Secretary shall--        (1) educate the American people on how to prevent and       mitigate cyberattacks and cybersecurity risks, including by--        (A) instructing the American people on how to identify--        (i) phishing emails and messages; and        (ii) secure websites;        (B) instructing the American people about the benefits of       changing default passwords on hardware and software       technology;        (C) encouraging the use of cybersecurity tools, including--        (i) multi-factor authentication;        (ii) complex passwords;        (iii) anti-virus software;        (iv) patching and updating software and applications; and        (v) virtual private networks;        (D) identifying the devices that could pose possible       cybersecurity risks, including--        (i) personal computers;        (ii) smartphones;        (iii) tablets;        (iv) Wi-Fi routers;        (v) smart home appliances;        (vi) webcams;        (vii) internet-connected monitors; and        (viii) any other device that can be connected to the       internet, including mobile devices other than smartphones and       tablets;        (E) encouraging Americans to--        (i) regularly review mobile application permissions;        (ii) decline privilege requests from mobile applications       that are unnecessary;        (iii) download applications only from trusted vendors or       sources; and        (iv) consider a product's life cycle and the developer or       manufacturer's commitment to providing security updates       during a connected device's expected period of use; and        (F) identifying the potential cybersecurity risks of using       publicly available Wi-Fi networks and the methods a user may       utilize to limit such risks; and        (2) encourage the American people to use resources to help       mitigate the cybersecurity risks identified in this       subsection.        (c) Assistant Secretary Defined.--In this section, the term       ``Assistant Secretary'' means the Assistant Secretary of       Commerce for Communications and Information.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4055.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4055, the American  Cybersecurity Literacy Act. Cybersecurity threats targeting Americans  are increasingly common, particularly since wireless devices  proliferate our society.   H.R. 4055, the American Cybersecurity Literacy Act, is intended to  help Americans arm themselves with the information and tools they need  to prevent being a victim of a cyberattack. The bipartisan legislation  requires the Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information to  create and conduct a cybersecurity campaign to increase the knowledge  and awareness of best practices to avoid cyberattacks.   The bill also requires the campaign to, among other things, provide  instructions about how to identify common problematic attacks like  phishing emails and unsecure websites. The campaign will also highlight  the benefits of changing default passwords and encouraging the use of  cybersecurity tools like multifactor identification and complex  passwords.   Finally, to ensure that as many Americans as possible can benefit  from this information, the legislation requires the campaign to be in  as many languages and formats as practicable.   This legislation will arm the American people with critical  information that they need to ensure they are not the victim of a  cyberattack. It is important to note that by passing this bill we are  not shifting the burden of preventing cybersecurity attacks away from  large, sophisticated companies and onto individuals. Companies still  have the primary responsibility of preventing these attacks, and there  is still  [[Page H6691]]  much work to do, but this legislation adds additional layers of  protection by giving consumers the tools and information to protect  themselves.   Mr. Speaker, I want to applaud Representatives Kinzinger, Eshoo,  Veasey, Houlahan, and Bilirakis for their work on this important  bipartisan bill that continues our work of protecting consumers. I urge  my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support again for the bipartisan  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2355) to facilitate responsible, informed dispensing of  controlled substances and other prescribed medications, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2355         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2355.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in April of this year, the Energy and Commerce Health  Subcommittee held a hearing to discuss the dual threat of the  concurrent COVID-19 pandemic and the opioid overdose crisis. In that  hearing we considered a slate of bills targeted toward the opioid  crisis including H.R. 2355, the Opioid Prescription Verification Act of  2021.                                time  1615    We knew then, and we know now, that time was ticking. Millions of  Americans were experiencing the deadly pandemic and simultaneously  living through hard-hitting mental health and substance use issues.  Tragically, we have lost over 750,000 Americans to COVID-19 and over  100,000 to drug overdoses during the pandemic.   H.R. 2355 seeks to reduce prescription opioid diversion by directing  HHS, DEA, FDA, CDC, and SAMHSA to update and disseminate training  materials to help pharmacists that dispense opioid medications verify  the identity of the patient. To incentivize States to facilitate  verification, the bill also authorizes the CDC to prioritize certain  grant funding to States that maintain  [[Page H6692]]  prescription drug monitoring programs and require prescribers of  controlled substances to issue prescriptions electronically.   Grant funding would also be prioritized for States that require  pharmacists to enter certain information about controlled substance  prescriptions into prescription drug monitoring programs, including the  quantity dispensed, the date filed, and the patient identifier.   This bill received unanimous support in the Energy and Commerce  Committee and is part of a series of bills the committee has worked on  to help prevent diversion of opioids and reduce harmful opioid use.   I would like to thank the sponsors of this bill and my colleagues on  the committee for their steadfast work in addressing the overdose  crisis. We must continue to work in a bipartisan fashion to combat this  crisis in order to keep our constituents safe.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional Members who wish to  speak, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues, again, to  support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2364) to amend title III of the Public Health Service Act to  direct the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention, to provide for a public education  campaign to raise public awareness of synthetic opioids, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2364         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Synthetic Opioid Danger       Awareness Act''.       SEC. 2. SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN.         Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act is       amended by inserting after section 317U (42 U.S.C. 247b-23)       the following new section:       ``SEC. 317V. SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN.         ``(a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date       of the enactment of this section, the Secretary shall provide       for the planning and implementation of a public education       campaign to raise public awareness of synthetic opioids       (including fentanyl and its analogues). Such campaign shall       include the dissemination of information that--        ``(1) promotes awareness about the potency and dangers of       fentanyl and its analogues and other synthetic opioids;        ``(2) explains services provided by the Substance Abuse and       Mental Health Services Administration and the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention (and any entity providing such       services under a contract entered into with such agencies)       with respect to the misuse of opioids, particularly as such       services relate to the provision of alternative, non-opioid       pain management treatments; and        ``(3) relates generally to opioid use and pain management.        ``(b) Use of Media.--The campaign under subsection (a) may       be implemented through the use of television, radio,       internet, in-person public communications, and other       commercial marketing venues and may be targeted to specific       age groups.        ``(c) Consideration of Report Findings.--In planning and       implementing the public education campaign under subsection       (a), the Secretary shall take into consideration the findings       of the report required under section 7001 of the SUPPORT for       Patients and Communities Act (Public Law 115-271).        ``(d) Consultation.--In coordinating the campaign under       subsection (a), the Secretary shall consult with the       Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use to       provide ongoing advice on the effectiveness of information       disseminated through the campaign.        ``(e) Requirement of Campaign.--The campaign implemented       under subsection (a) shall not be duplicative of any other       Federal efforts relating to eliminating the misuse of       opioids.        ``(f) Evaluation.--        ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall ensure that the       campaign implemented under subsection (a) is subject to an       independent evaluation, beginning 2 years after the date of       the enactment of this section, and every 2 years thereafter.        ``(2) Measures and benchmarks.--For purposes of an       evaluation conducted pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary       shall--        ``(A) establish baseline measures and benchmarks to       quantitatively evaluate the impact of the campaign under this       section; and        ``(B) conduct qualitative assessments regarding the       effectiveness of strategies employed under this section.        ``(g) Report.--The Secretary shall, beginning 2 years after       the date of the enactment of this section, and every 2 years       thereafter, submit to Congress a report on the effectiveness       of the campaign implemented under subsection (a) towards       meeting the measures and benchmarks established under       subsection (e)(2).        ``(h) Dissemination of Information Through Providers.--The       Secretary shall develop and implement a plan for the       dissemination of information related to synthetic opioids, to       health care providers who participate in Federal programs,       including programs administered by the Department of Health       and Human Services, the Indian Health Service, the Department       of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense, and the       Health Resources and Services Administration, the Medicare       program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act, and the       Medicaid program under title XIX of such Act.''.       SEC. 3. TRAINING GUIDE AND OUTREACH ON SYNTHETIC OPIOID                     EXPOSURE PREVENTION.         (a) Training Guide.--Not later than 18 months after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health       and Human Services shall design, publish, and make publicly       available on the internet website of the Department of Health       and Human Services, a training guide and webinar for first       responders and other individuals who also may be at high risk       of exposure to synthetic opioids that details measures to       prevent that exposure.        (b) Outreach.--Not later than 18 months after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human       Services shall also conduct outreach about the availability       of the training guide and webinar published under subsection       (a) to--        (1) police and fire managements;        (2) sheriff deputies in city and county jails;        (3) ambulance transport and hospital emergency room       personnel;        (4) clinicians; and        (5) other high-risk occupations, as identified by the       Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on H.R. 2364.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have hit a tragic milestone in our battle against the  opioid overdose crisis. From April 2020 to April 2021, the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention estimated that over 100,000 people died  due to drug overdoses, no doubt exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.   Synthetic opioids like fentanyl and fentanyl analogs significantly  contributed to overdose deaths. In 2019, the CDC estimated that more  than half of overdose deaths involved synthetic opioids and drugs mixed  with synthetic opioids, such as methamphetamine and cocaine mixed with  fentanyl.   The Energy and Commerce Committee has worked throughout the pandemic  to address this crisis. The American Rescue Plan, passed and signed  into law earlier this year, included the largest-ever funding boost of  over $3 billion for mental health and substance abuse block grants to  the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or  SAMHSA. That $3 billion in funding has gone to critical services for  addiction treatment, prevention, harm reduction, and recovery.   H.R. 2364, the Synthetic Opioid Danger Awareness Act, provides an  additional tool to address one piece of the opioid crisis. This bill  requires the Department of Health and Human Services to launch a public  education campaign on the health risks associated with synthetic  opioids and services available to address misuse of these products.  Further, HHS would be required to disseminate information regarding  synthetic opioids to healthcare providers.   The bill also directs HHS to produce training materials for first  responders and other professionals at a higher occupational risk of  coming into contact with synthetic opioids. It also requires the agency  to conduct outreach about the availability of these materials in order  to help those on the front lines be aware of the risks associated with  synthetic opioids.   The bill is another step the Energy and Commerce Committee has taken  to address the opioid crisis and protect the health and safety of our  communities. The committee passed this legislation with unanimous,  bipartisan support in July.   I want to thank my New Jersey delegation colleague, Representative  Kim, and Representative Pappas of New Hampshire for leading this  important legislation. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2364, the  Synthetic Opioid Danger Awareness Act, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3743) to increase funding for the Reagan-Udall Foundation  for the Food and Drug Administration and for the Foundation for the  National Institutes of Health.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3743         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Supporting the Foundation       for the National Institutes of Health and the Reagan-Udall       Foundation for the Food and Drug Administration Act''.       SEC. 2. REAGAN-UDALL FOUNDATION AND FOUNDATION FOR THE                     NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.         (a) Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food and Drug       Administration.--Section 770(n) of the Federal Food, Drug,       and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 379dd(n)) is amended by striking       ``$500,000 and not more than $1,250,000'' and inserting       ``$1,250,000 and not more than $5,000,000''.        (b) Foundation for the National Institutes of Health.--      Section 499(l) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       290b(l)) is amended by striking ``$500,000 and not more than       $1,250,000'' and inserting ``$1,250,000 and not more than       $5,000,000''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3743.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3743, the Supporting the  Foundation for the National Institutes of Health and the Reagan-Udall  Foundation for the Food and Drug Administration Act.   The Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA is an independent nonprofit  organization established by Congress in 2007 to advance the mission of  the FDA to modernize medical product development, accelerate  innovation, and enhance safety.   Likewise, the Foundation for the NIH is an independent nonprofit  organization established by Congress in 1990 to develop private-public  partnerships that advance biomedical research, domestically and  globally.   Both organizations work to advance the missions of the NIH and the  FDA and have played important roles in our Nation's fight against  COVID-19. For example, the Foundation for the NIH has worked to  coordinate the ACTIV program that is strategizing our research and  prioritizing and speeding development of the most promising COVID-19  vaccines and treatment. Likewise, the Reagan-Udall Foundation's COVID- 19 Diagnostics Evidence Accelerator has brought stakeholders together  to collect and evaluate real-world data in a way that is scientifically  useful and meets the FDA standards so we can understand the efficacy of  COVID-19 diagnostics in the real world.   Mr. Speaker, the FDA and the NIH are currently authorized to transfer  funding to their respective foundations within a statutory limit that  has not been increased since 2007.   H.R. 3743 would increase the transfer authority for both foundations  from up to $1.25 million to up to $5 million. This legislation will  allow the agencies to increase their support consistent with the  increasing costs of medical product research and development.   This bipartisan bill received unanimous support in the Energy and  Commerce Committee. I would like to thank my colleagues, Representative  Hudson and Health Subcommittee Chairwoman Eshoo, for their outstanding  leadership on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3743, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no Members who wish to speak at this  time, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3894) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to issue and disseminate guidance to States to clarify strategies to  address social determinants of health under the Medicaid program and  the Children's Health Insurance Program, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3894         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Collecting and Analyzing       Resources Integral and Necessary for Guidance for Social       Determinants Act of 2021'' or the ``CARING for Social       Determinants Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. REQUIREMENT TO ISSUE GUIDANCE TO CLARIFY STRATEGIES                     TO ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IN THE                     MEDICAID PROGRAM AND THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH                     INSURANCE PROGRAM.         Not later than 3 years after the date of the enactment of       this Act, and not less frequently than once every 3 years       thereafter, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall       update the State Health Office letter 21-001, issued on       January 7, 2021, to clarify strategies to address social       determinants of health under the Medicaid program and the       Children's Health Insurance Program. Such update shall       include the following:        (1) Guidance to State Medicaid agencies regarding the       strategies that States can implement under authorities in       existence as of such update under title XIX of the Social       Security Act, title XXI of such Act, or section 1115 of such       Act to address social determinants of health in the provision       of health care, including strategies specifically targeting       children receiving medical assistance under a State plan       under title XIX of such Act (or a waiver of such plan) or       child health assistance under a State child health plan under       title XXI of such Act.        (2) Guidance on how States can encourage and incentivize       managed care entities to address social determinants of       health through contracts with such entities.        (3) Updated examples from States with respect to how States       are addressing social determinants of health in the provision       of health care under the Medicaid program under title XIX of       the Social Security Act and the Children's Health Insurance       Program under title XXI of such Act, including through       payment models.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3894.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, environmental factors can have a tremendous effect on an  individual's health. Where a person lives, their level of education,  their food security, and many other aspects of a person's life, can  affect their health and well-being. These are often called the social  determinants of health.   Healthcare providers and insurance plans are looking more and more at  addressing some of these social determinants in order to improve  individual health. State Medicaid programs have been especially engaged  on this front.   Unfortunately, it can sometimes be difficult for States and insurance  plans to understand the various authorities available in Medicaid to  address the social determinants of health. Likewise, it can also be  difficult to see how other States are using those authorities in  creative new ways.   H.R. 3894, the Collecting and Analyzing Resources Integral and  Necessary for Guidance for Social Determinants Act, will give States a  valuable new resource to ensure that they are able to use Medicaid to  the fullest extent possible.   H.R. 3894 will ensure that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services regularly updates its guidance to States on how they can use  Medicaid to address the social determinants of health. It will also  require CMS to provide examples of how other States are using Medicaid  to address the social and environmental factors that can affect  people's health.   I want to thank Representatives Blunt Rochester and Burgess for their  work on this important bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this  bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no Members who wish to speak, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4026) to require the Comptroller General of the United  States to submit to Congress a report on actions taken by the Secretary  of Health and Human Services to address social determinants of health.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4026         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Social Determinants of       Health Data Analysis Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. REPORT ON ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH                     AND HUMAN SERVICES TO ADDRESS SOCIAL                     DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.         Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       submit to Congress a report on actions taken by the Secretary       of Health and Human Services (in this section referred to as       the ``Secretary'') to address social determinants of health.       Such report shall include the following:        (1) An analysis of how any data collection undertaken by       the Secretary in furtherance of such actions complies with       Federal and State privacy laws and regulations.        (2) A description of any coordination undertaken by the       Secretary with other relevant Federal agencies and State and       local authorities as part of such actions.        (3) An identification of any potential for duplication of       such actions or other barriers to such actions.        (4) Recommendations on how to foster private-public       partnerships, as well as how best to leverage private sector       efforts, to address social determinants of health.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4026.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, social determinants, or social drivers, of health affect  every single person in our communities. They are aspects of our daily  living, such as the conditions in the places where we live, learn,  work, and play, which can positively or negatively affect a wide range  of health risks and outcomes.   Through our healthcare system, social determinants of health are  being examined as part of a holistic view of a person's healthcare.   A noted example was highlighted by The New England Journal of  Medicine linking the loop that determinants can play throughout a  person's life. Poor health or lack of education can impact employment  opportunities which, in turn, constrains income. Low incomes reduce  access to healthcare and nutritious food and overall increase hardship.  Hardship causes stress which, in turn, promotes unhealthy coping  mechanisms, such as substance abuse and poor nutrition choices. And  poor nutrition increases risk factors for heart disease, obesity, and  diabetes.   When not given an equal opportunity to thrive, these social factors  can compound and snowball to negatively impact a person and their  community. Fortunately, States are becoming innovative in addressing  social needs in the communities to improve health and decrease costs.                                time  1645    Today, we are taking another step in the right direction by  considering H.R. 4026, the Social Determinants of Health Data Analysis  Act of 2021. This bipartisan legislation requires a report on programs  undertaken by the Department of Health and Human Services to address  social determinants of health. The report would include recommendations  to foster private-public partnerships and include an analysis of  privacy measures as part of social determinants of health data  collection.   The report and research, Mr. Speaker, will help inform our future  work on social determinants, and, therefore, it is important that we  pass this bill.   I urge my colleagues to support the legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
