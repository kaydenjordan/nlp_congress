 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to  highlight the urgent humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.   We have taken action with the ALLIES legislation to make sure that  the persons who have assisted us as drivers and interpreters find a  pathway to freedom, but conditions for others are quite trying at this  time.   Conditions for women, civil society, journalists, human rights  defenders, and others continue to deteriorate, with vulnerable Afghans  facing threats of violence and death, and heightened restrictions in  Taliban-controlled areas.   Many Afghans are so terrified for their lives and their children's  safety that they will not leave their homes. A recent wave of targeted  slayings, more than 700 killed and 540 wounded in 2020, represents a 45  percent increase from 2019. The number of women killed doubled between  2012 and 2020.   The withdrawal of U.S. troops and the raging expansion of Taliban  territorial offenses in our wake requires urgent action. Our failure to  help those who help us and those who are in the crosshairs of the  Taliban would, frankly, make us complicit in any further bloodshed.   That is why I have introduced this amendment, and I am introducing  today the Improving Access for Afghan Refugees Act, to provide  vulnerable Afghans with priority 2 refugee status to expand access to  our refugee system.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill because we do  have a moral obligation to do so.                                time  1500
