 Madam Speaker, as a proud member of the  Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I rise in strong support of the Tri- Caucus resolution promoting COVID-19 vaccine equity among communities  of color.   I represent the large immigrant population that has been especially  hard hit by this crisis, and now these are the same communities who are  still struggling to get the vaccine.   Yes, vaccine hesitancy remains an issue, but the reality is that  access is an even bigger problem. If we are serious about fighting  COVID-19, we need to meet people where they are and bring vaccines to  those who need it most, and we can't do this without engaging with  trusted community leaders.   I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge one of these leaders  in Chicago. Illinois Unidos, a coalition of health professionals and  community leaders, is one of a kind and stands as a national model.  From testing, to the vaccine rollout, to housing and food assistance,  Illinois Unidos has stood shoulder to shoulder with the Latino  community in Chicago.                            ____________________
