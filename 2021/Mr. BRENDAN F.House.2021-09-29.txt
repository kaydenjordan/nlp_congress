 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I will attempt  to address two things: the present and the future.   First, on the present, there is no question, none--and let's not let  the other side get away with this conflating of two different things-- this is not about adding new debt. It is about whether or not we are  going to pay the bills for the old debt that was already rung up under  all of the previous administrations combined, including, and  especially, the last one.   That is what this is about.   Are we going to pay our bills?   Of course, the answer is yes. I have voted to raise the debt ceiling  under a Democratic administration, and I have done it under a  Republican administration because it is the responsible thing to do.   But the second thing is the future.   Why do we constantly keep finding ourselves in this rather bizarre,  counterproductive debate that achieves nothing?   We always know the debt ceiling is ultimately going to be raised.   The question is: How much of a political game of chicken will we have  to go through?   And that game of chicken comes at a real cost. The last time the  United States came close to not raising the debt ceiling was exactly 10  years ago. The GAO found the cost at $1.3 billion, and, my God, just  imagine if ever a miscalculation brought about an occasion in which by  accident we truly didn't raise the debt ceiling.   When on the Ways and Means Committee I asked Secretary Mnuchin what  would happen, he replied that the consequences would be so dire he  couldn't even imagine them.   So let's fix this. I have a piece of legislation with Budget  Committee Chairman Yarmuth that would take this out of the political  sphere. It would depoliticize it. And instead, make this the  responsibility of the Treasury Secretary--Democratic Treasury Secretary  today, Republican Treasury Secretary tomorrow. That would be the  responsible approach and end this game once and for all.
