 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong and joyful support of  the Respect for Marriage Act.   As the mother of an incredible trans daughter, I am here to fight for  her rights and those of all LGBTQ+ people, who for too long have been  denied the dignity and the respect that they deserve. And as someone  who is myself in an interracial marriage, it is far past time that we  codify those rights.   An extremist Supreme Court and hateful State legislators want to roll  back the hard-won progress that we have made. But we are here to say in  a bipartisan way, we will not tolerate this, we will codify these  rights once and for all.   This is the beginning. I also call on the Senate to pass the Equality  Act to ensure that LGBTQ+ people can enjoy the same rights as everyone  else in the country.   But today, Madam Speaker, let's get this bill done. Vote ``yes'' on  codifying the right to marry the one you love. Vote ``yes'' on the  Respect for Marriage Act.
