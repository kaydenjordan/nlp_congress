 Mr. Speaker, I send to the desk a resolution and ask  unanimous consent for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 911, I call up  the bill (H.R. 748) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to  repeal the excise tax on high cost employer-sponsored health coverage,  with the Senate amendment thereto, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material on the matter under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, we meet at a challenging time in our country and in the  global community. This session will be different than most, where we  come together and reach out our hands. We hug one another in affection  and thanks for the collegial work with us on the people's business.   People who can see the Chamber now will see that we are keeping  distance from one another, not out of hostility, but out of love for  one another, that we may keep one another healthy and safe. It will,  therefore, be an unusual session, but a critical session.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation represents a bipartisan resolve to meet  the coronavirus challenge head-on. It represents a focus on families  and workers, with the objective of making them safer and economically  supported. It will protect workers and their families in our economy as  we all do our part to flatten the curve.   Public health officials have made it clear that the only chance we  have to prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed by this  pandemic, as it is threatened to be, is for as many Americans to stay  home as possible.   It is, however, necessary for us to be here to pass legislation to  respond on behalf of the American people to this daunting challenge.   The closure means that large parts of our economy must be temporarily  shut  [[Page H1819]]  down, causing severe disruption for businesses and workers. We saw the  impact of this yesterday, when new unemployment insurance claims  increased by more than 3 million people, 3 million individuals, 3  million who are in families who rely on them for support and  contributions to the support of their families and their children.   Today, the House is taking action on phase three of our response to  this unprecedented challenge.   We initially responded, Mr. Speaker, to the immediate need of our  Nation with $8.3 billion in appropriations to meet the immediate health  needs of our people.   A little over 2 weeks ago, we acted to meet the continuing health and  economic needs of our people. That was phase two.   This bill, Mr. Speaker, which is phase three of our effort, will  increase unemployment insurance benefits to those furloughed or laid  off while expanding eligibility to include the self-employed and  contract workers, and send checks to most Americans to help them get  through this difficult period.   Mr. Speaker, I am personally disappointed that Senate Republicans  insisted on shortchanging the 700,000 people of the District of  Columbia by $700 million, treating the District as a territory and not  as a State for the purposes of allocating stabilization funds, as is so  often the case. This jeopardizes the entire national capital region as  we work together to prevent further spread of coronavirus.   I will be working with Delegate Holmes Norton and our colleagues to  enact legislation correcting this injustice, and I look forward to  working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to accomplish  that objective.   As the number of coronavirus cases in our country rises above 85,000  of our fellow citizens and continues to increase exponentially, we must  take swift action to ensure that people can stay home to slow the  spread of this deadly virus, and that our economy can be supported so  that it can rebound when the medical experts and scientists say it is  safe to do so.   I thank the Speaker and the committee chairs who have worked  tirelessly to bring this agreement to fruition, including Chairwoman  Nita Lowey, Chairman Frank Pallone, Chairman Richard Neal, Chairman   Bobby Scott, Chairman Peter DeFazio, Chairwoman Maxine Waters, as well  as other chairs who have participated in forging this legislation with  a bipartisan coalition in the United States Senate.   I thank, as well, the extraordinary staff--the extraordinary staff-- who have worked around the clock in a very short period of time,  knowing full well the crisis that confronts us and that time is of the  essence.   Thank you, staff.   The staff of each of our committees, our Members, and the leadership,  the staffs of all three of those entities, and the Members have been  working around the clock, literally, Mr. Speaker, around the clock to  determine needs and priorities and meet them.   The House continues to stand ready to take additional steps when and  as they are needed to win this battle for the safety and health of our  people and our Nation.   Together, Democrats and Republicans, together, we Americans, we  Americans will work together to do our part in fighting against the  coronavirus.   Mr. Speaker, all of us stand in awe and deep gratitude to the  millions of Americans who have shown courage and commitment at this  dangerous and challenging time: our doctors, our nurses, our medical  personnel, our police, our firefighters, and our emergency medical  response teams; those keeping our pharmacies, grocery stores, gas  stations, and other critical facilities open; and so many in the  private and public sectors who are daily showing up to serve the needs  of their neighbors and fellow citizens.   Mr. Speaker, they reflect the best of the ``home of the brave.'' It  is in times like these that we remind the world and ourselves that we  are truly one Nation, under God, indivisible, working together to  overcome the greatest challenge with the greatest resolve.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Neal), one of the senior Members of the Congress and  the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.  [[Page H1820]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), who is one of the leaders in this Congress  on protecting families and children.    Mr. Speaker, I have thanked each and every one of the  chairs. None have worked harder than Mr. DeFazio from the State of  Oregon. He is one of this country's experts on transportation and the  movement of goods and services so critical to our economy and so  critical to the health of our people.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  DeFazio).    Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman from Illinois.  This is about all of us as Americans, not as Republicans and Democrats,  helping those who are challenged, as all of our country is.   Our next speaker is my dear friend from New York City--one of the  epicenters of this challenge--who has led the Small Business Committee  with extraordinary ability and passion and making sure that the small  businessmen and -women of America are helped and addressed in this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Velazquez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), my friend and neighbor from across the river, who  is the chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor and who has  done a yeoman's service on working to create this legislation and to  improve this legislation and to make it friendly for our workers and  for our families.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Schiff), the distinguished chair of the Intelligence  Committee and a member of the Committee on Appropriations as well.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano), the chairman of the Committee on Veterans  Affairs.    I thank the gentleman for his comments.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), the former mayor of Providence and the  chairman of our policy committee.

Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Wild).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Nevada  (Mr. Horsford).

Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  O'Halleran).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Crow), who has served his country on the front lines of  battle in the defense of freedom.    Mr. Speaker, I misspoke and elevated Mr. Neguse from  Colorado, who is on the leadership and the freshman representative to  the leadership, but now I am really recognizing the president of the  freshman class, an extraordinary woman who has been in the Federal  Government to rescue our automobile industry, and I thank her for her  service.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms.  Stevens).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Michigan an  additional 30 seconds.

Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Mexico (Mr. Lujan), the former chairman of our campaign committee and  an extraordinary candidate for the United States Senate for New Mexico.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), one of the senior Members of the Congress of  the United States, a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming for her remarks. I  am sure all of us on this floor can subscribe to them and, hopefully,  react accordingly. I thank the gentlewoman for her remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms.  Titus), another senior Member of the Congress of the United States.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Luria), a retired Navy commander who has been on the  front line herself and knows what the front line is all about.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the  Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   As has been said so many times on this floor, America has faced many  threats, some in the nature of attack by enemies and some in the nature  of natural disasters, whether they be hurricanes or tornadoes or  floods. Americans have responded and overcome those threats.   We now have a threat, as some have mentioned, that is unseen but has  a great effect and is having a great effect today as we debate this  bill in America.   Today we will vote not as Democrats or Republicans but we will vote  as Americans who have been sent here to represent our country and our  people to promote the general welfare. Certainly the general welfare  has been put at risk by this virus.   We have in a very short time passed three major pieces of  legislation, two that generated in this House and one that generated in  the Senate. We will pass this bill today. I want to thank the majority  leader--excuse me--the minority leader. I am the majority leader.    You can't have it.   While we enjoy a little levity, we understand the gravity of this  situation. People will die today as a result of this virus.   We have come together as Democrats and Republicans from every region  of this country to respond in a way sufficient for the challenge, and  we know we will need to do more. But this day let us hope that like the  United States Senate we come together each and every one of us not for  partisan advantage but for the advantage and defense of our people.   America has been blessed by God and by our people. Let us respond  this hour to their need in their defense so that America will go  forward stronger, better, and more ready to face future challenges.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to clarify a provision in the bill we  passed this morning, the Cares Act, that provides relief to states.  With state revenues decreasing at the same time that demand for  services is rising, there has been broad agreement in the House that  something needs to be done to help states cope with funding shortfalls.  Our legislation creates a Coronavirus Relief Fund to provide additional  resources to states, local governments, and tribes to address costs  incurred responding to the coronavirus pandemic. I am pleased that the  final legislative language gives states broad flexibility in how they  spend the money they will receive.   Some state leaders have expressed concern that a provision requiring  that funds be spent only on newly identified needs could prevent states  from using this new funding for legitimate needs relating to the  current public health emergency just because the state's regular budget  addresses similar spending needs. That is not the intent of the  language in our bill. To be clear, we intended for the language to give  states, localities, and tribes broad flexibility to address needs  arising from the coronavirus pandemic, regardless of whether the need  arises directly from new spending related to the outbreak or indirectly  as a result of collapsing state revenues, as businesses shut down to  support social distancing and protect public health.   I am encouraged that the Treasury Department has indicated that it  appreciates the importance of providing this funding to states quickly,  flexibly, and with a minimum of paperwork. It is critically important  that the federal government give states the tools they need  simultaneously to address the public health crisis as well as the  economic damage it is causing.   In this same vein, I would be remiss if I did not, once again,  express my profound disappointment that this provision treats the  District of Columbia as a territory rather than a state. This misguided  decision by the Senate will shortchange the District by hundreds of  millions of dollars, hurting the National Capital Region's coordinated  effort to fight the coronavirus. I am committed to fixing this issue in  whatever legislation we consider next to address the coronavirus.
