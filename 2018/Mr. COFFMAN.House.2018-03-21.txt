 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize both the  Grandview High School boys and girls basketball teams. These two teams  from Grandview are now the State of Colorado's 5A high school  basketball champions.   The Grandview boys basketball team had a spectacular season,  finishing the season with an impressive 24-4 record, and the  culmination of the season was its first-ever boys basketball State  Championship title.   The Grandview girls basketball team also had a tremendous season,  finishing with an equally impressive 25-3 record, and the culmination  of its season was its second consecutive girls basketball State  Championship title.   The teams were led to their respective championship titles by their  coaches: Josh Ulitzky for the girls team, and Michael Rogers for the  boys team.   I also commend these two coaches, their coaching staffs, and all  their supporters at Grandview High School for all they have contributed  to the success of the school's boys and girls basketball programs.   I am incredibly proud to represent Grandview High School in the  United States House of Representatives. Again, congratulations to the  Grandview High School girls and boys basketball team on this impressive  victory in Colorado's 5A State Championship.                            ____________________
