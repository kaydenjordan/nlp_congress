 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  gentlewoman from Florida, the Honorable Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, be  permitted to take the oath of office today.   Her certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to her election.    Madam Speaker, as the dean of the Florida  delegation, I have the honor of welcoming Representative Sheila  Cherfilus-McCormick of Florida's 20th District to the United States  House of Representatives.   Our new colleague will fill the seat of my late dear friend, Alcee  Hastings. Now, similar to the district that I am honored to represent,  Florida's 20th District is extremely diverse and covers urban and  agricultural areas in both Palm Beach and Broward Counties.   Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick is the proud daughter of Haitian immigrants,  and she was born in Brooklyn, New York.   Madam Speaker, after finishing college at Howard University, she  moved to Florida to attend St. Thomas University School of Law.   Although she left Florida to become a project manager at the New York  City Transit Authority, it wasn't long before Florida's sunshine  brought her back to Florida. In 1999, she joined Trinity Health Care  Services and eventually became the company's CEO.   Madam Speaker, this once single mother is the epitome of the American  Dream and represents the aspiration of so many of our South Florida  neighbors. I look forward, Madam Speaker, to working with our newest  colleague on the issues of importance to our country and to South  Florida. Florida's congressional delegation is honored to welcome  Congresswoman Cherfilus-McCormick to the United States House of  Representatives.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs.  Cherfilus-McCormick), who is our newest Member of Congress.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Diaz-Balart for  those kinds words and introduction.   I would first like to thank my family: my husband, Corlie McCormick,  my daughter, Ismanie McCormick, and son, Jackson McCormick, who are in  the gallery.   I would like to thank my team and my family, and especially God, who  has brought us this far.   I am a child of immigrant parents who risked their lives to come to  the United States. I thank my colleagues who fought for me even before  I was born here to ensure that immigrants can actually have a place in  our country and can live the American Dream. So I thank Members in  advance because that is how I got here.   I also want to thank the 20th District who fought with us and who  believed in a new voice and is giving this little Haitian-American girl  a chance to fight for our country.   I would like to say a special thank you for all the pastors who  prayed. I pledge to work as hard as I can, tirelessly, to ensure that  District 20 and the United States are getting their needs met. I pledge  to work as hard as  [[Page H206]]  I can with every Member who is present today as we move forward  upholding the Constitution and the promises, all the promises that  brought me here today.   For the other children who were told that it could never happen for  them, we fight today, and we join hands today.                            ____________________
