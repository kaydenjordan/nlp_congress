 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 156) calling for accountability and justice for  the assassination of Boris Nemtsov, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 156         Whereas Boris Nemtsov was a Russian statesman who, over 25       years of public service, served as a Member of Parliament,       Governor of the Nizhny Novgorod Region, and First Deputy       Prime Minister of Russia;        Whereas throughout his life, Boris Nemtsov showed an       unwavering commitment to the ideals of democracy, freedom,       and the rule of law, and to upholding the rights and dignity       of Russian citizens;        Whereas Boris Nemtsov was a powerful voice in opposition to       the authoritarianism and corruption of Vladimir Putin's       government, publicizing its abuses, leading street protests       against election fraud and the war on Ukraine, and       successfully advocating for international sanctions on human       rights violators;        Whereas Boris Nemtsov was co-chairman of a leading       opposition party, won election to the Yaroslavl Regional Duma       in 2013, and was planning to run for the Russian Parliament       in 2016 and challenge Vladimir Putin for the Presidency in       2018;        Whereas, on the evening of February 27, 2015, Boris Nemtsov       was shot in the back and killed as he walked across Bolshoi       Moskvoretsky Bridge near the Kremlin in Moscow;        Whereas, on March 7 and 8, 2015, Russian authorities       arrested five individuals, all of them natives of the Chechen       Republic, on suspicion of carrying out the assassination,       while a sixth suspect allegedly blew himself up during the       attempted arrest;        Whereas the defendants were tried at the Moscow District       Military Court, which on June 29, 2017, found them guilty of       carrying out the assassination of Boris Nemtsov, and on July       13, 2017, sentenced them to different prison terms;        Whereas at the time of the assassination, the now-convicted       gunman, Zaur Dadayev, was serving as a Lieutenant in the       Internal Troops of the Interior Ministry of the Russian       Federation and as Deputy Battalion Commander in the ``Sever''       (``North'') Regiment stationed in the Chechen Republic, under       the command of the Internal Troops Commander, General Viktor       Zolotov, and the Kremlin-backed head of the Chechen Republic,       Ramzan Kadyrov;        Whereas Ramzan Kadyrov has called Lieutenant Zaur Dadayev a       ``true patriot'' and has publicly referred to Boris Nemtsov       as an ``enemy of Russia'';  [[Page H2658]]         Whereas by Decree No. 115 issued on March 8, 2015,       President Vladimir Putin awarded Ramzan Kadyrov the Order of       Honor;        Whereas according to reports published in the       RosBusinessConsulting (RBC) newspaper on January 20, 2016,       General Alexander Bastrykin, chairman of the Investigative       Committee of the Russian Federation, has on two occasions       prevented investigators from indicting Major Ruslan       Geremeyev, Battalion Commander in the ``Sever'' (``North'')       Regiment of the Internal Troops of the Ministry of Internal       Affairs of the Russian Federation stationed in the Chechen       Republic and a close associate of Ramzan Kadyrov and Russian       State Duma Member Adam Delimkhanov, as an organizer in the       assassination;        Whereas according to reports published in Novaya Gazeta       newspaper on December 9, 2016, operatives of the Federal       Security Service of the Russian Federation in the Chechen       Republic have failed to serve Major Ruslan Geremeyev with a       summons for questioning as a witness, reporting to their       superiors that on the sole occasion they attempted to do so,       ``nobody opened the door'';        Whereas despite requests from the legal team representing       Boris Nemtsov's family, the Investigative Committee of the       Russian Federation and the Moscow District Military Court       have refused to question high-ranking persons of interest,       including Ramzan Kadyrov, General Victor Zolotov, and Adam       Delimkhanov;        Whereas the Investigative Committee of the Russian       Federation has, to this day, not issued any indictments       against the organizers or masterminds of the assassination of       Boris Nemtsov, with the exception of Major Ruslan Geremeyev's       driver, Ruslan Mukhudinov, who is named alongside ``other       unidentified persons'';        Whereas the Investigative Committee of the Russian       Federation and the Moscow District Military Court have       refused to classify the assassination of Boris Nemtsov under       Article 277 of the Criminal Code as ``encroachment on the       life of a statesman or a public figure,'' choosing instead       Article 105 that deals with common domestic murders;        Whereas throughout the proceedings at the Moscow District       Military Court, the judge repeatedly disallowed questions       relating to political motives behind the assassination;        Whereas the Federal Protective Service of the Russian       Federation has refused to release video footage from the       security cameras on Bolshoi Moskvoretsky Bridge from the       night of the assassination, claiming in a letter to State       Duma Member Dmitry Gudkov on November 6, 2015, that the       bridge next to the Kremlin is ``not a protected object'';        Whereas, on May 18, 2017, the Parliamentary Assembly of the       Council of Europe appointed Lithuanian Member of Parliament       Emanuelis Zingeris as its special rapporteur on the need to       shed light on the background of the murder of Boris Nemtsov,       with a mandate to review and report on the case and on the       progress of the official Russian investigation;        Whereas, on May 24, 2018, the Russian Foreign Ministry       informed Emanuelis Zingeris that he is forbidden from       entering the Russian Federation;        Whereas, at its 27th annual session held on July 7 through       11, 2018, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for       Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) adopted a       resolution urging Russian authorities to ``undertake a new,       full and thorough investigation into the February 2015       assassination of Boris Nemtsov'';        Whereas, on July 8, 2018, the Parliamentary Assembly of the       Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe held a       public event to discuss the need for OSCE oversight of the       official Russian investigation into the assassination of       Boris Nemtsov;        Whereas the United States and the Russian Federation are       full members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation       in Europe;        Whereas the OSCE Moscow Document has established that       ``issues relating to human rights, fundamental freedoms,       democracy and the rule of law . . . are matters of direct and       legitimate concern to all participating States and do not       belong exclusively to the internal affairs of the State       concerned'';        Whereas, on February 27, 2018, Washington, DC, designated       the street in front of the Embassy of the Russian Federation       as ``Boris Nemtsov Plaza'' to honor Mr. Nemtsov; and        Whereas, on February 22, 2019, the President of the       Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE, George Tsereteli,       appointed Swedish Member of Parliament and Vice President of       the Assembly Margareta Cederfelt as the rapporteur on the       investigation of the assassination of Boris Nemtsov, with a       mandate to review and report on the case and on the progress       of the official Russian investigation: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns Vladimir Putin and his regime for targeting       political opponents and covering up the assassination of       Boris Nemtsov, a Russian opposition leader who worked to       advance democracy and human rights in Russia;        (2) urges the United States Government, in all its       interactions with the Government of the Russian Federation,       to raise the case of the assassination of Boris Nemtsov and       underscore the necessity of bringing the organizers and       masterminds to justice;        (3) supports the efforts by the Organization for Security       and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and its Parliamentary       Assembly to initiate oversight of the official Russian       investigation into the assassination of Boris Nemtsov;        (4) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to       allow an impartial international investigation of the       assassination of Boris Nemtsov and to cooperate with the       Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE and the Parliamentary       Assembly of the Council of Europe in their ongoing inquiries       over this case;        (5) calls on the Secretary of State and the Secretary of       the Treasury to use their authority under the Sergei       Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 2012 (title IV of       Public Law 112-208) and the Global Magnitsky Human Rights       Accountability Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public Law       114-328) to designate individuals whom they determine to have       been involved in the assassination of Boris Nemtsov as       perpetrators, organizers, or masterminds, on the list of       specially designated nationals and blocked persons maintained       by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of       the Treasury, freezing their assets and making them       ineligible to receive United States visas;        (6) calls on the Secretary of State, in consultation with       the Director of National Intelligence, to prepare and submit       to Congress a report detailing the circumstances of the       February 27, 2015, assassination of Boris Nemtsov, including       the list of individuals whom they determine to have been       involved in the assassination as perpetrators, organizers, or       masterminds, and identifying what measures, if any, have been       taken by the Government of the Russian Federation to       investigate this crime and bring its perpetrators,       organizers, and masterminds to justice, and evaluating the       effectiveness of such measures; and        (7) urges the Secretary of State to take all possible steps       to--        (A) investigate the business activities of Ramzan Kadyrov       and any entities controlled by Ramzan Kadyrov outside the       Russian Federation; and        (B) determine whether any such activities, or any entities       facilitating such activities, are in violation of the       sanctions imposed on Ramzan Kadyrov pursuant to the       authorities provided by the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law       Accountability Act of 2012 (title IV of Public Law 112-208;       22 U.S.C. 5811 note).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 156, as amended, a resolution  calling for accountability and justice for the assassination of Boris  Nemtsov, currently under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this resolution. I am  proud to have authored this measure with the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  McCaul), my colleague and the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee. The measure before us today condemns the assassination of  Boris Nemtsov.   Nemtsov was a brave advocate for democracy in Russia, calling for  free elections and an end to the massive corruption at the Kremlin. I  remember when he visited here and I had him in my office. We took  pictures. Just the other day, we were looking at them.   He certainly was a champion of freedom in Russia and, for it, met his  demise. The fact that he was calling for free elections and an end to  the massive corruption in the Kremlin put him right in Vladimir Putin's  crosshairs.   Now, he joins a long list of brave journalists, human rights  activists, and political opponents murdered by Putin's henchmen in  their quest to silence all criticism of the Kremlin and stamp out any  perceived threat to Putin's authoritarian regime.   When I met Boris Nemtsov here in Washington in my office, he talked  about his vision for Russia, free from Putin's grip on power, with  open, fair elections, independent media, and a strong civil society. In  the words of John McCain, Boris Nemtsov ``would not be oppressed by  unjust laws or violence or by violence and fear . . . he lived for love  and justice and truth.''   He was incredibly brave to take on these issues in a country where  opposition to Putin often amounts to a death sentence. Just a few  months after our  [[Page H2659]]  conversation, as I mentioned before, he was murdered in cold blood in  Moscow.   Now, it has been 4 years since his death, but there has been no  proper investigation of his assassination and the coverup and zero  accountability for those responsible. That is certainly an outrage.   This resolution condemns the Kremlin's systematic targeting of its  political opponents and calls on the administration to impose sanctions  on those responsible for Nemtsov's murder and coverup.   It also requires the administration to deliver to Congress a thorough  report on Nemtsov's assassination. That is a critical part of this  legislation because, sadly, the administration, in my opinion, hasn't  done nearly enough to stand up to Russia and call out Putin's thuggery.   So it is up to Congress to assert American leadership on this issue.  I strongly support this bipartisan, bicameral measure, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                        Committee on Ways and Means,                                        House of Representatives,                                     Washington, DC, March 11, 2019.      Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: I am writing with respect to H. Res.       156, ``Calling for Accountability and Justice for the       Assassination of Boris Nemtsov.'' As a result of your having       consulted with us on provisions on which the Committee on       Ways and Means has a jurisdictional interest, I will not       request a sequential referral on this measure.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation, and request your support for such a       request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H. Res.       156.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard E. Neal,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, March 12, 2019.      Hon. Richard E. Neal,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee on H. Res. 156, ``Calling for       Accountability and Justice for the Assassination of Boris       Nemtsov'' for agreeing to forgo a sequential referral request       so that the resolution may proceed expeditiously to the House       floor.        I agree that your declining to pursue a referral in this       case does not diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the       Committee on Ways and Means nor prejudice its jurisdictional       prerogatives on this resolution or similar legislation in the       future. I would support your effort to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees from your Committee over any       parts of this resolution or similar legislation under the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means to any House-      Senate conference.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       resolution. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       resolution and look forward to continuing to work with you as       this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Malinowski), who is a very new and valued member of the  Foreign Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, in closing, let me say, it is critical that  we speak out against strong men and dictators throughout the world. We  need to demand justice for those unable to do so themselves.    As we have mentioned, Boris Nemtsov was brutally murdered for bravely  standing up to Putin and his corrupt regime. The Kremlin is being  complicit in covering up the assassination and failing to conduct a  proper investigation.   By passing this measure, we show Putin, his cronies, and dictators  throughout the world that the U.S. Congress is watching, and we will  not stay silent.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support this resolution. I urge my  colleagues to join me, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 596) to prohibit United States Government recognition of  Russia's annexation of Crimea, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 596         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Crimea Annexation Non-      recognition Act''.       SEC. 2. PROHIBITION AGAINST UNITED STATES RECOGNITION OF THE                     RUSSIAN FEDERATION'S CLAIM OF SOVEREIGNTY OVER                     CRIMEA.         (a) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United       States not to recognize the Russian Federation's claim of       sovereignty over Crimea, its airspace, or its territorial       waters.        (b) Prohibition.--In accordance with subsection (a), no       Federal department or agency may take any action or extend       any assistance that implies recognition of the Russian       Federation's claim of sovereignty over Crimea, its airspace,       or its territorial waters.        (c) Waiver.--The President may waive the prohibition in       subsection (b) on a case-by-case basis if the President       determines that it is vital to the national security       interests of the United States to do so.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 596, the Crimea Annexation Non- recognition Act, as amended, currently under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank this bill's author, who is a valuable member  of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Mr. Connolly from Virginia.   Madam Speaker, I also thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul),  our ranking member, for working with us on this bipartisan legislation.   Madam Speaker, Vladimir Putin has left no doubt about his intentions  to expand Russian influence, undermine democracy, and splinter the  alliances and agreements that have long kept Russia in check.   We have seen these through Russia's direct attacks on our democratic  institutions, including our own--remember the Presidential election of  2016--through a pernicious and widespread misinformation campaign  designed to distort reality and foment confusion and, in no clearer  way, through its illegal occupation of parts of Ukraine and parts of  Georgia.   It is shocking in the 21st century to see a country trample on a  neighbor's sovereignty and seize territory by force. It goes against  everything we have worked for since World War II to build a Europe that  is whole, free, and in peace.   It has been 5 years since Russian forces moved into Crimea and staged  a sham election in an attempt to give their occupation a gloss of  legitimacy, but there is nothing legitimate about it--absolutely  nothing.   The United States must never accept Putin's attempts to seize  territory by force, and this legislation would enshrine into our laws a  nonrecognition of Russia's annexation of Crimea. This bill would  prevent our government from taking any action that even implies  American recognition of this blatantly illegal land grab.   This bill also sends a strong message to our Ukrainian friends that  we stand shoulder to shoulder with them as they continue to resist  Russian efforts to fracture their country. This is especially important  in light of recent events in which the Russian Navy intercepted  Ukrainian patrol boats in Ukrainian waters, capturing the vessels and  their crew by force.   Vladimir Putin is a bully and a thug. His troops may hold Crimea in a  stranglehold, but we need to be clear that Crimea will always be part  of Ukraine, not part of Russia. This measure will put that rejection  permanently into our laws. I am pleased to support it.   Madam Speaker, I ask all Members to do likewise, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), the author of this bill and a very valued  member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, in closing, let me say that we need to take a strong  stand against Vladimir Putin and his aggressive behavior in Eastern  Europe. This legislation would reaffirm in American law that Russia's  annexation of Crimea is illegal and that the United States will never  recognize its legitimacy.   I hope the other body will act on this measure soon after we pass it,  and I hope the administration will signal its willingness to sign this  legislation. There are too many questions swirling around when it comes  to Russia, too many times that we don't seem to be calling Vladimir  Putin out for what he has done. I think that it is something that we  really need to look at very carefully, and I would hope the White House  would do that.   Signing this bill will not put these concerns to rest, but it would  help show that the United States won't just roll over and accept  Russia's land grabs and egregious violations of international law.   I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) for his work on  this bill, and I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot) for his  work on the bill. I am happy to support it, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
