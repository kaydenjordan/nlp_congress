 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding and  for his continued leadership on behalf of America's workers.   Mr. Speaker, more and more employees today are working for a company  whose name is not on the front of their office building. Instead of  hiring employees directly, companies are renting employees from  staffing agencies. Let me say that again. Companies are renting  employees from staffing agencies and then evading responsibility for  upholding the rights of those workers, even as they profit from their  work.   For decades, sensible joint employment standards under the Fair Labor  Standards Act have ensured that workers can hold employers accountable  for violating wage and hour laws.   Instead of refining those standards to reflect the complex  relationship between workers and employers in today's economy, this  legislation sets a dramatically and intentionally narrow standard so  that no large corporation can be held accountable if their contractors  violate workplace laws.   Mr. Speaker, I include a letter of support in the Record, a letter by  the National Employment Law Project and signed by more than 200  organizations opposing H.R. 3441 because it opens the door to  widespread wage theft and hurts law-abiding small businesses.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Virginia Foxx,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Robert C. Scott,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, Chairwoman Foxx and       Ranking Member Scott: The undersigned organizations write in       opposition to H.R. 3441, the so-called Save Local Business       Act, which would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)       and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to prevent       workers from holding more than one employer jointly       accountable for wage theft, child labor, equal pay       violations, or unfair labor practices even when the employers       jointly exercise and share control over working conditions.        Under our nation's long-standing laws dating back as far as       the late 1800s, employers who share control with their       subcontractors over working conditions may also share       accountability as joint employers for violations of workers'       rights so that they will provide better oversight of working       conditions, and in so doing, ensure broader compliance with       basic labor and employment laws.        H.R. 3441 seeks to dramatically narrow the long-standing       definitions of ``employer'' in the FLSA and NLRA and it is       neither good for workers nor for law-abiding businesses.    H.R. 3441 opens the door to widespread wage theft and worker harms in     occupations across the economy, including in our nation's growth                                 industries         The bill would undermine protections for millions of       workers across the economy, especially in low-wage sectors       where subcontracting is common: construction, agriculture,       garment, janitorial, home care, delivery and logistics,       warehousing, retail, temp and staffing, and manufacturing,       just to name a few.        Wage theft and other workplace dangers are prevalent in       many of these jobs, and even under current law, millions of       workers today are no longer sure who their boss is--and       indeed, have no way to navigate the intricacies of companies'       contracting relationships to ascertain who is responsible for       workplace violations. When there's no clear line of       accountability, work conditions are more likely to       deteriorate: pay declines, wage theft increases, and       workplace injuries rise. In addition, outsourced jobs pay       less--sometimes as much as 30 percent less--than in-house       jobs, likely due to a lack of worker and subcontractor       bargaining power. In today's economy, we should be looking       for ways to increase workers' pay and economic security, not       laying the groundwork for more sweatshops.        When a subcontractor cannot pay, joint employer standards       ensure that workers have remedies against the contracting       company for the legal violations. Workers should be able to       recover when cheated out of wages, exposed to dangerous       working conditions, or otherwise treated unlawfully.         This bill would also impede workers from bringing equal       pay claims to close the gender pay gap. Because the Equal Pay       Act is a part of the FLSA, and uses the FLSA's definition of       an employer, H.R. 3441 would make it harder for subcontracted       workers to hold their employers accountable for gender-based       pay discrimination.       The bill actually hurts, not helps, law-abiding small businesses         Although framed as a bill to help protect the independence       of small businesses, including those that operate as       franchisees, the bill would in fact insulate corporations,       including franchisors, from liability. Unscrupulous       businesses that employ abusive labor contractors to cheat       workers would gain a competitive advantage over law-abiding       businesses. In addition, franchisees whose business practices       are all but dictated to them by larger corporations will be       hung out to dry for decisions that aren't their own, without       any indemnification from the entity that often all but forces       labor and employment violations on them.        Corporations that engage low-road contractors and then look       the other way gain an unfair advantage over companies that       play by the rules, resulting in a race to the bottom that       rewards cheaters. It's one reason why the job quality of what       were formerly middle-class jobs in America is suffering       today. Working people struggle enough in today's economy.        Don't let Congress make this worse by legislatively rigging       the system in favor of corporations that don't care about the       workers who build their businesses. Oppose H.R. 3441.

Mr. Speaker, from 2001 to 2013, Wal-Mart was contracting  with three warehouses in my community, and those warehouses contracted  out their staffing to a company that was accused of committing  egregious wage and hour law violations.   Thanks to the FLSA joint employer standard, 1,700 warehouse workers  were able to reach a $22 million settlement to collect the pay that  they were owed from their employer. Under this bill, they would likely  have gotten nothing.   The questions we face today are: Will millions of workers, like the  warehouse workers in my district, lose what little power they have left  to fight against wage theft; will organized workers lose the basic  right to bring all responsible parties to the table to collectively  bargain for better wages and workplaces; will shrewd corporations be  allowed to claim immunity from the laws that protect employees; and,  most of all, will the people's House stand with the people or stand  with the corporations that continue to rig the economy against the  American worker?   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 3441.
