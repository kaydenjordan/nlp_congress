 Madam Speaker, my esteemed colleague, Representative  Rooney, has introduced a bill, H.J. Res. 20, to limit the number of  terms that a Member of Congress may serve to three terms. I signed on  to cosponsor this bill right away.   Term limits would take power away from special interests and  lobbyists and give it back to the people. When Members stay in Congress  for too long, they lose touch with the people back home and allow  special interests to hold sway more than regular people.   A Congress out of touch with its constituents cannot do a good job  representing the American people. This bill would make sure our  constituents will have a representative body that they recognize.   The power of incumbency is a counterbalance to the will of the  people. Term limits would encourage independent congressional judgment  and reduce election-related incentives for wasteful government  spending.   This bill would create a much better political system by inspiring  political leaders with a desire to serve their constituents, not  themselves; political leaders who respond to voters' concerns, not a  career path in special interests.   Madam Speaker, I call on my fellow Members to support this bill.                            ____________________
