 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 1 minute as in morning business.    Madam President, this week marks the second anniversary  of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act--December 2017--when the  biggest tax cut in the history of the country was passed by the  Congress. It has been very successful.   The reason I come to honor this second anniversary is because polls  show that people don't realize the benefits of the tax cuts. Some of  them even wonder: Did we get a tax cut?   I have some appreciation for that because I spent 10 years on an  assembly line in Cedar Falls, IA, and probably if I got a 50-cent cut  every week, I wouldn't know until the end of the year that that added  up to $250 more in my pocket. So under the circumstances of the working  men and women of America, it might be difficult to know that.   Studies show a great benefit to the middle-class families from this  tax cut. Thanks to these historic tax cuts and reforms, Americans do in  fact have more money in their paychecks and their pocketbooks.  Individuals and families have more to spend or, if they want, to save  it, and maybe a lot of people save for retirement.   Small businesses and entrepreneurs benefit from the tax cut. They  have more to invest in their employees and in their business  operations, and they probably hire more Americans.   As a result, we have experienced the longest U.S. economic expansion  in history, higher wages, and historically low unemployment--the lowest  since 1969.   I am proud to say on this 2-year anniversary of the tax reform that  it has been a resounding success.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
