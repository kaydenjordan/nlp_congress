 Mr. Speaker, we are at a crossroads coming out of this  pandemic. We are either going to decide, as a country, whether we are  going to move forward together, or we are going to double down on the  past and the bad economy.   In the rescue package, 2.3 million Ohioan children will get $3,000 or  $3,600 to stabilize themselves, to pull them out of poverty. And the  Republicans said no.   We had pension reform in that. Forty-thousand Ohioans will now be  made whole instead of losing half their pension. Republicans said no.   We want to do infrastructure. Republicans said no.   We want money for State and local governments for hazard pay.  Republicans say no.   Mr. Speaker, if we removed the word ``no'' from the vocabulary of the  people of the United States, the Republicans would be speechless.                            ____________________
