 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois  (Mr. Roskam) for yielding me time, and I thank another gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis) for introducing this legislation.   The Equitable Access to Care and Health Act is a bill that I strongly  support. It expands the religious conscience exemption in the  Affordable Care Act.   The bipartisan legislation has broad support in the House and in the  Senate. It has passed the House by voice vote in the last two  Congresses.   The ACA currently provides for a religious conscience exemption, but  the exemption is unduly narrow and applies only to a few faiths. This  exemption should be expanded to accommodate other religions whose  sincerely-held religious beliefs could cause them not to purchase  healthcare insurance.   With the recent repeal of the individual mandate, the CBO now  estimates that the bill will result in about $30 million in cost  savings. I hope my colleagues will support this piece of legislation.  It will help advance the cause of religious freedom.
