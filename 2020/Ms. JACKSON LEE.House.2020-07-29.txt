 Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary,  Homeland, and Budget Committees, and Founding Chair of the  Congressional Children's Caucus, I rise  [[Page H3921]]  in strong support of H.R. 7327, the ``Child Care for Economic Recovery  Act'', which expands the availability of quality child care, helps  workers return to their jobs when it is safe, and enables America's  economy to recover from the COVID-19 recession.   The Child Care for Economic Recovery Act creates a new tax credit  that helps employees access quality, affordable child care, and by  expanding the employee retention tax credit, it incentivizes employers  to keep child care workers on payroll.   Further, this bill provides $850 million to states, the District of  Columbia, and all U.S. territories to fill in the gaps in dependent  care for essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as  invests $10 billion in infrastructure to improve child care safety.   Madam Speaker, just last week, the United States reached a historic  and unfortunate milestone with over 4,000,000 confirmed coronavirus  cases.   Today, there are over 4,400,000 cases nationwide and 151,000 deaths.   In my home state of Texas, a current hotspot, there are over 413,000  cases and 6,500 deaths.   At the county level, Harris County, which includes my district, has  approximately 67,660 cases and 1,127 deaths.   As we seek to regain control over this virus and poise our economy to  rebound from the effects of the coronavirus, we must take the necessary  steps to address the cracks and disparities that have come to light by  way of the pandemic.   The child care industry has served as a crucial backbone to the  United States' economy for many years, and it too continues to be  rocked by the coronavirus.   Child care facilities provide an immense and unquestionable public  value.   This was demonstrated by the key role child care centers had as they  continued to provide child care for essential workers who continued to  work at the beginning of the pandemic.   According to the Washington Post, before the coronavirus pandemic,  approximately one-third of all children under 5 attended a paid care  facility, day-care center, preschool or prekindergarten.   Workers in every industry rely on child care centers to provide  capable care for their children, helping them juggle both parenting and  employment responsibilities.   The child care industry is even more essential to single parent  households.   In 2019, 15.76 million children lived with a single mother and  approximately 3.23 million children lived with a single father.   For these millions of families, child care is a lifeline.   However, as millions of businesses continue to feel the economic  effects of the coronavirus and fight for survival, the child care  industry is facing its own crisis.   Nationwide, an estimated 1.5 million childcare workers have lost  their jobs.   Before the pandemic, Texas had more than 11,000 child care  operations.   Yet, as a result of this disease, there were only 883 facilities  still operating in the state as of early this month, according to CNN.   Madam Speaker, I stand here today, voicing my support for H.R. 7327  because it serves as a vital component to our nation's economic  reopening strategy.   The federal government must do everything in its power to ensure that  the child care industry remains available to all who need it, and that  means voting yes on this bill.   By enacting this piece of legislation, Congress commits to ensuring  the long-term success of the child care industry by investing $10  billion over the 2020-2024 period to improve child care facilities and  infrastructure.   Doing so will address longstanding inadequacies of child care  facilities as well as respond to the immediate infrastructure needs  that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, including structural changes to  facilitate social distancing and improve sanitation.   Madam Speaker, this legislation also requires the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct a first-ever comprehensive  inventory of the structural challenges facing child care in the United  States and its territories.   For far too long, the child care industry has been overlooked and  undervalued, and it is no coincidence that this industry is comprised  of 94 percent women, a majority of whom are women of color.   But child care is not just a woman's issue.   Everyone has a stake in ensuring the viability of the child care  industry.   I have been a long-standing advocate for the child care industry  because I understand the challenges many working families face when it  comes to obtaining reliable, affordable, and quality child care.   Prior to the pandemic, HHS considered childcare affordable if no more  than 10 percent of a family's income was put towards it, but parents  were ultimately spending much more, on average.   However, because of the coronavirus and the economic devastation it  has caused, what was once deemed affordable is bound to change.   By passing H.R. 7327, we have the opportunity to bring much-needed  relief to financially struggling child care providers, to families who  need child care in order to return to work, and to the U.S. economy.   With this legislation, we will expand access to care and ease the  financial burdens placed on parents and employers, so that we can  reopen and recover from this public health crisis without leaving kids,  parents, and businesses behind.   I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 7327, the ``Child  Care for Economic Recovery Act.''    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio and Ranking  Member Graves for answering the plea of so many of us in relation to  our districts. I thank subcommittee chairwoman, Mrs. Napolitano, and  Ranking Member Westerman.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad for all these years I have been working on  issues dealing collectively with our Houston port or bayous and the  flooding crisis that we have in Houston, Texas, Harris County.   I am glad that this legislation authorizes the Houston Ship Channel  Expansion Improvement Project, part of my district, the Federal  contribution to which is approximately $463 million. I remember  standing at the edge of our port looking at the mud collecting and  impeding the going and coming of those vessels.    It authorizes the construction of all 34 pending Corps Chief's  Reports received since the enactment of WRDA;   Authorizes 35 feasibility studies for water resources development  projects;   And directs the Corps, which we have worked with, to expedite the  completion of 41 feasibility studies currently underway, including the  Houston Regional Watershed Assessment, Flood Risk Management  feasibility study, which I have introduced over and over again. It is  now going to move.   It fully unlocks the approximately $10 billion currently held in the  Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund.   It helps bayous in my district, Greens Bayou, White Oak Bayou,  Hunting Bayou; and, of course, it recognizes that Hurricane Harvey--we  had 21 trillion gallons of water, losing housing, 203,000 homes were  damaged and 12,700 were destroyed.   Finally, what is so important, the bill directs the secretary to  issue final agency procedures for its Principles, Requirements, and  Guidelines to ensure that future water resources development projects  will maximize sustainable development and affordably address the needs  of economically disadvantaged communities.   The bill authorizes the Corps to study, design, and construct water  resources.   Mr. Speaker, the most disadvantaged persons are the ones that suffer  the most. I am grateful for this bill, and I ask support for this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong and enthusiastic support of H.R. 7575,  the Water Resources Development Act for 2020, which strengthens  America's competitive edge by investing in our ports, harbors and  inland waterways, builds more resilient communities, and creates  additional flexibility for the Corps to address the water resources  needs of economically disadvantaged communities, communities of color,  and rural communities.   I thank Congressman DeFazio and Congressman Graves of Missouri, the  Chair and Ranking Member of the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructue, and Congresswoman Napolitano and Congressman Westerman,  the Water Development Resources Subcommittee Chair and Ranking Member,  respectively, for their work in shepherding this important bipartisan  legislation to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bipartisan legislation because it:   1. Authorizes the Houston Ship Channel Expansion Channel Improvement  Project, the federal contribution to which is approximately $463  million.   2. Authorizes the construction of all 34 pending Corps Chief's  Reports received since the enactment of WRDA 2018.   3. Authorizes 35 feasibility studies for water resources development  projects, those identified through the public review process  established by section 7001 of the Water Resources Reform and  Development Act of 2014.   4. Directs the Corps to expedite the completion of 41 feasibility  studies currently underway, including the Houston Regional Watershed  Assessment Flood Risk Management Feasibility study, which is certainly  needed given the frequency and severity of historic-level flood events  in recent years in and around the Houston metropolitan area.   5. Fully unlocks the approximately $10 billion currently held in the  Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF) by providing the authority to  appropriate additional funds for harbor maintenance needs from the  existing balance in the Trust Fund.   Mr. Speaker, these water development projects managed by the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers in consultation with local partners are key to  preserving our Nation's economy, to protecting our communities, and to  maintaining our quality of life.   The Army Corps of Engineers has been working with the Harris County  Flood Control District since 1937 to reduce the risk of flooding within  Harris County.   Current projects include 6 federal flood risk management projects:   1. Sims Bayou;   2. Greens Bayou;   3. Brays Bayou;   4. White Oak Bayou;   5. Hunting Bayou; and   6. Clear Creek.   In addition to these ongoing projects, the Army Corps of Engineers  operates and maintains the Addicks and Barker (A&B) Detention Dams in  northwest Harris County.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation because it is  essential in minimizing the risk of flood damage to Houston and Harris  [[Page H3959]]  County metropolitan area, the nation's fourth largest, is a matter of  national significance because the region is one of the Nation's major  technology, energy, finance, export and medical centers:   1. The Port of Houston is the largest bulk port in the world;   2. Texas Medical Center is a world renowned teaching, research and  treatment center;   3. Houston is home to the largest conglomeration of foreign bank  representation and second only to New York City as home to the most  Fortune 500 companies; and   4. The Houston Watershed Assessment study area sits within major  Hurricane Evacuation arteries for the larger Galveston Gulf Coast  region.   At its peak on September 1, 2017, one-third of Houston was underwater  due to Hurricane Harvey flooding.   There were over 41,500 square miles of land mass impacted by  Hurricane Harvey and the subsequent flooding that covered an area  larger than the States of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,  Rhode Island and Vermont combined.   Hurricane Harvey dropped 21 trillion gallons of rainfall on Texas and  Louisiana, most of it on the Houston Metroplex.   In September 2017, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory reported that  Hurricane Harvey's rainfall created 275 trillion pounds of water, which  caused the crust in and around Houston to deform and sink nearly 1 inch  because of the weight.   Over 300,000 structures flooded in southeastern Texas, where extreme  rainfall hit many areas that are densely populated.   Hurricane Harvey is the largest housing disaster to strike the U.S.  in our Nation's history.   Hurricane Harvey damaged 203,000 homes, of which 12,700 were  destroyed.   Texas flood control districts are still struggling to recover from  this record breaking flood event.   Nineteen trillion gallons of flood waters poured into the Houston  Ship Channel from area rivers and bayous on the way to the Gulf of  Mexico.   As a consequence, tens of millions of tons of sediment and debris  flowed through the biggest waterway in the nation.   The Port of Houston produces 27 percent of the nation's gasoline and  about 60 percent of the U.S. aviation fuel.   Investments in all aspects of our Nation's water infrastructure pays  dividends in the form of economic activity.   The Houston Ship Channel generates $617 billion in the U.S. with $265  billion of that in Texas representing 16 percent of the state of  Texas's GDP.   The Port of Houston sustains 2.7 million jobs nationally with 1.2  million of them within the state of Texas.   Mr. Speaker, let me list a few of the provisions in this bill that  will benefit my communities I represent.   The bill directs the Secretary to issue final agency procedures for  its Principles, Requirements, and Guidelines (PR&G) to ensure that  future water resources development projects will maximize sustainable  development and affordably address the needs of economically  disadvantaged communities.   The bill authorizes the Corps to study, design and construct water  resources projects for communities that have been subjected to  repetitive flooding events and have received emergency flood  assistance, including construction of temporary barriers.   This authority will help repetitive loss communities, especially  those in economically-disadvantaged communities, obtain critical flood  protection.   The legislation requires the Corps to undertake an inventory of water  resources development projects and associated properties that are or  may be contaminated with PFAS, and to develop a plan to remediate and  limit potential human exposure to the contamination.   The bill requires the Corps to complete its review on minority  community and tribal consultation, as well as update Corps' policies on  environmental justice considerations and community engagement and  consultation.   Finally, the legislation authorizes and creates additional  flexibility for the Corps to address the water resources needs of  economically disadvantaged communities, communities of color, and rural  communities, such as authorizing the Corps of Engineers to provide  technical assistance for resiliency planning, with priority given to  economically disadvantaged communities.   I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 7575, the bipartisan  Water Resources Development Act of 2020.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I rise for the thousands and millions  of childcare workers--essential workers--and their families and the  children in support of legislation that provides $50 billion to  reaffirm childcare essential workers and, as well, to provide relief to  desperate parents.   COVID-19 has taken an enormous toll on our community. It has taken a  toll because people have not worn masks, there have not been stay-at- home orders, and Houston and Harris County are suffering. This  legislation will be a lifeline.   In addition, I fight for and advocate for the moneys for our States  and local communities. We cannot suffer a Republican bill. We must have  $600 for our unemployment extension or addition, and, as well, it is  imperative that we have testing money. The way you stop COVID-19 is  testing, testing, testing, social distancing, wearing a mask, and  giving authority to local jurisdictions to be able to issue stay-at- home orders.   This is a pandemic and a crisis. When is the Nation going to stand up  to an administration that refuses to understand that?   We in the Congress, this majority in the United States House of  Representatives, will fight against eliminating $600, not getting the  money for our States and local governments, and not getting testing  money.                            ____________________
