 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for more than 70 days now, the Ukrainian  people have endured--and more than endured, they fought back. They  stood up to their invaders and have achieved amazing things against a  superior force--superior, at least, on paper.   Many feared that Russia would crush Ukraine in days. Instead, Ukraine  has not only withstood Russian aggression but has inflicted humiliating  defeats on Russia. Twelve--twelve--Russian generals have reportedly  been killed. Russia lost thousands of its troops, as well as hundreds  of tanks and scores of aircraft. One estimate from British intelligence  suggests that Russia may have lost more than a quarter of its ground  combat strength.   Ukrainians successfully pushed Russia out of the Kyiv suburbs, have  retaken territory outside of Kharkiv, and still--still--maintain a  defiant hold on the steel plant in Mariupol despite being encircled by  Russian troops.   At the same time we recognize Ukraine's successes and the fierce  determination that has made them possible, it is also important to  remember the devastation this war has inflicted. Thousands of Ukrainian  civilians have been killed. Somewhere around 12 million Ukrainians have  fled their homes. And the list of Russian atrocities gets longer every  day--schools and hospitals intentionally bombed, executions and mass  graves, torture, rape, the deliberate targeting of civilians, apparent  war crimes.   In a few short weeks, Russia has brought unimaginable devastation.  The port city of Mariupol--once home to more than 400,000 people--has  been reduced to rubble. The city essentially no longer exists. Across  Ukraine, an untold number of homes and buildings have been destroyed.  It will take years to rebuild or remove the imprint of Russian  aggression from the landscape, and some things cannot be entirely  recovered. Just last night, Russia intentionally struck civilian  centers in Odessa, bombing a shopping mall and a consumer warehouse  without regard for innocent human life.   The Ukrainian people have displayed an incredible gallantry and  resolve. They have embraced this fight and the cause of their country's  freedom. They have not spent any time waiting around for anyone else to  come and save them. In fact, a recent news story highlighted the fact  that Ukrainians not only continue to oppose the Russians, they have  actually started rebuilding in places even as the war continues to  rage.   But it is also important to remember that the Ukrainian people cannot  sustain this war without military support from the United States and  other free countries. The weapons and military resources we have  supplied are playing a crucial role in enabling Ukraine to continue  standing up to Russian aggression, and it is essential that we continue  that support for as long as the Ukrainian people need it.   At the end of April, the President sent Congress a request for $33  billion in emergency supplemental funding for critical security and  economic assistance to Ukraine. Negotiations are ongoing about how we  iron out a few matters. The top-line numbers may  [[Page S2388]]  change, but I hope Congress can act quickly to get Ukraine the military  equipment it needs, as well as humanitarian support to help the  millions of Ukrainians who have been displaced. We also need to make  sure that our European partners are making similar contributions to  help put President Zelenskyy in the strongest possible position to  bring this war to an end. It would be a tragedy for Ukraine to have  bought all this time with our help only to lose the initiative now.   So I hope that we can get this funding out the door as quickly as  possible and that Democrats will not slow things down by attaching  extraneous funding requests for unrelated policy riders. Thirty-three  billion dollars is a substantial sum of money, but, as the news reports  showing Ukrainian highways dotted with bombed-out Russian tanks attest,  Ukraine is putting our military aid to good use.   The cost of inaction on our part--of allowing Vladimir Putin to  destroy Ukraine and threaten NATO--would be much greater. We should not  be so naive as to think that Putin's campaign of Soviet expansion will  end with Ukraine. There are rightfully concerns that he will seek to  escalate into former Soviet countries in Eastern Europe or even  further. He has already hinted at a willingness to use nuclear weapons,  and he proved in Syria that he is certainly OK with the use of chemical  weapons.   I hope defenders of the Iran nuclear deal are making note of what  nuclear power looks like in the hands of a nation with a malign agenda.   We cannot allow Putin to think that he can pursue his expansionist  dreams unopposed.    The United States and all NATO members must remain committed to our  shared defense and to supporting Ukraine in its fight for freedom. NATO  countries should also preserve our open-door policy to nations that are  seeking to contribute to the collective security of the alliance. There  can never be too many allies in the quest to preserve peace and  maintain a strong defense against tyranny, and we should welcome any  nation that seeks to help further those goals.   Currently, Russia's main areas of control span from east of Kharkiv  to previously contested parts of the Donbas and now along the coast of  the Sea of Azov and past Crimea in an attempt to fully block Ukraine's  access to the Black Sea. Russia has failed to capture Kyiv or break the  resolve of the Ukrainian people, so now Putin wants to close Ukraine  off from the world, which will harm not only Ukrainians but also  Ukraine's trading partners that rely on Ukraine's substantial  agricultural capacity.   Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, corn, and sunflower oil. If  Ukraine's ability to produce and export these products is compromised,  which is already happening, we are likely to see not only price hikes  but very serious food shortages as a result.   The World Food Programme reports that an additional 47 million people  around the world could be facing acute hunger if the war in Ukraine  continues. In a world in which hunger persists and famine looms,  Putin's war of aggression in Ukraine threatens to cause casualties far  beyond Ukraine's borders, which brings us back once again to the  importance of supporting the Ukrainian people and their fight.   As President Zelenskyy said the other day in reference to the United  States and Ukraine, we defend common values, democracy, and freedom. We  do, indeed, Mr. President. We do, indeed.   The Ukrainian people are currently giving their all to secure a  future of democracy and freedom in Ukraine. Let's continue to make it  clear that they are not alone in that fight, and let's make sure they  have the tools they need to win this war and secure Ukraine's freedom  permanently.
