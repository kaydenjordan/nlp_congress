 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Matthew Paciullo, a student at South Central High School  in Pitt County, and the winner of North Carolina First Congressional  District Artistic Discovery Contest.   Matthew, who won first place, took inspiration from his father,  Zachary, whose love of rock music led to the creation of this  remarkable masterpiece titled, ``Liberty.''   Through his artistic work, Matthew transformed recycled Styrofoam  into a creative piece that captures the spirit of liberty.   I commend all the participants for their outstanding work and  contribution to the artistic landscape of our community because it  fosters creativity and self-expression.   Together, let us continue to support and nurture the next generation  of artists who inspire creativity and enrich our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Matthew and all competition winners. They  rock.                            ____________________
