 Mr. President, yesterday, we confirmed Antony Blinken,  our new Secretary of State. Like the Director of National Intelligence,  the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the Treasury, it was  another big, bipartisan vote here in the Senate.   Four years ago, Senate Democrats subjected mainstream nominees to  lead State and Treasury to a full gauntlet of partisan delay tactics.  They forced cloture votes. Those were nearly party-line. So were the  final votes. Neither got on the job until February. But this  President's mainstream nominees to key posts are receiving fair  consideration and a timely process.   Republicans have no shortage of substantive policy differences with  the new administration. We will be discussing them with Secretaries  Austin, Yellen, and Blinken in the course of normal committee  oversight.   But unlike what took place 4 years ago, Republicans are not  gratuitously delaying people who are mainstream and qualified whom the  new President has asked to serve in key posts. If we find somebody  unfit, unqualified, or outside the mainstream, you bet we will oppose  them.   But I have just spent 4 years arguing that Presidents deserve some  latitude to assemble their team. I meant it, and I mean it now.   With my vote to confirm Mr. Blinken, I wanted to reinforce the need  for a true bipartisan consensus on the core objectives of our foreign  policy.   Yesterday, while discussing the legislative filibuster, I talked  about the chaos that would ensue if every domestic policy swung wildly  back and forth with every election. The same goes for our foreign  affairs. American statesmen should make commitments and issue threats  that can endure beyond their terms in office.   To be clear, Presidents bear the primary responsibility for foreign  policy, and I am not suggesting different leaders should not have  different ideas. But they will be more successful and their legacies  more enduring if they make the effort to build bipartisan support among  Congress and the American people.   Neither America nor our allies will like the world that results if  the world's leading Nation starts over like an Etch A Sketch every 4  years.   For starters, in several important areas, the new administration  should build on bipartisan consensus that actually already exists.   Let's start with China. The Trump administration helped build a long  [[Page S159]]  overdue awakening to the reality that we are in strategic competition  with the PRC, that Beijing will not magically conform itself to the so- called international community, and that these challenges demand fast  and serious action from the United States and from our friends.  President Biden and his new Cabinet must keep working with Congress to  continue building a whole-of-government, whole-of-economy approach to  checking China.   We need Secretary Austin to keep focus on modernizing our forces,  deterring Chinese threats from the Indo-Pacific to space and cyber  space, sustaining robust defense spending, and investing in defense  partnerships across the world.   We need Secretary Yellen to keep focused on the coercive manipulation  the PRC uses to ensnare the developing world in its orbit.   We need Secretary Blinken to keep clarifying the China threat to our  allies and European partners, to focus on contesting their growing  influence in Africa and the Middle East, and to hold Beijing  accountable for its unacceptable repression in places like Tibet and  Hong Kong and its hostility toward Taiwan.   Now, we know China is not the only great power with whom we need to  hang tough. In concrete policy terms, the United States just spent 4  years developing a more clear-eyed approach to Russia. Rather than  chasing naive ``resets'' with the Kremlin or worshipping arms control  like a religion, we leaned into military assistance to Ukraine, serious  sanctions, cyber countermeasures against meddling, and other strong  steps.   The Biden administration will find willing partners on Capitol Hill  if it builds on this process, keeps imposing real costs on Moscow,  pushes back on expansionism in the eastern Mediterranean, and,  importantly, encourages our allies to join in this effort.   Great power competition is key, but, of course, it does not exhaust  the threats that we face. In the Middle East, I know President Biden  will face political pressure from the left to rejoin Obama's Iran deal,  just as President Trump faced pressure from the right to abandon it.   Had President Obama not tried to circumvent Congress and pursue a  partisan policy, this critical national security challenge might not  have become so polarizing, but that is where we are.   There is no question that Iran is the biggest threat the United  States and our partners face in the region. It poses threats beyond  just its pursuit of nuclear weapons: sponsoring terrorism, its  sectarian agenda, its work to undermine its neighbors' sovereignty, its  development of ballistic missiles and lethal drones, and its  appalling--appalling--record on human rights.   Confronting this multifaceted challenge will take bipartisanship at  home and solidarity with Israel and our Arab partners abroad. Those  things need to exist before making major changes or racing to rejoin a  deal.   And our new President must be ready to respond to violence with  force, as the Trump administration did when they removed Soleimani from  the battlefield.   Speaking of the Middle East, I have consistently and vocally stood up  during administrations of both parties against withdrawing our limited  forces in Afghanistan, Iraq, or Syria too rapidly or without a smart  plan. A supermajority of the Senate joined me last Congress in warning  against abruptly abandoning battlefields recklessly on bad terms.   Finally, all of this important work will require that we keep our  friends close. The United States needs to be a partner that neither  strains alliances unnecessarily nor hands out free passes. President  Biden should continue prodding our partners to honor their promises,  pay their share, and put real capabilities on the table--and  reemphasize that we have their backs.   One early test for the new administration and congressional Democrats  will be the defense budget. If President Biden and his team are serious  about contesting China, Russia, and these other threats, they will need  to show it. Without continued, robust investment in a modern global  force presence, American leadership would be little more than hollow  rhetoric.   I voted to get President Biden's top foreign policy advisers on the  job swiftly. I hope and expect that our shared work will lead to  frequent, close, and bipartisan work with the Senate.                            ____________________
