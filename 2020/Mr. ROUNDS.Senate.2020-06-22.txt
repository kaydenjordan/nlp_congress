 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Josh Jorgensen,  a legislative aide in my Washington, DC, office, for all of the hard  work he has done for me, his colleagues, and the State of South Dakota.   Josh is a native of Sioux Falls, SD. He is a graduate of Bishop  O'Gorman High School in Sioux Falls, SD, and the University of South  Dakota in Vermillion, SD. During his undergraduate career, Josh majored  in journalism and political science and served as president of the  College Republicans.   Josh first joined my office as an intern in the spring of 2016.  During this time, he proved himself to be a diligent and dedicated  worker and became a true asset to my office.   He later returned as a senior legislative correspondent, and through  hard work and dedication, he worked his way up to legislative aide,  handling Tribal relations, healthcare, and education issues for my  office. Josh has played an instrumental role in my office by providing  insight and guidance into these issues.   Josh has been a dedicated and faithful public servant during his time  working in the Senate. I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to  him for his fine work. As he continues on with his career, he bears the  esteem of a grateful State and my utmost gratitude for a job well done.                            ____________________
