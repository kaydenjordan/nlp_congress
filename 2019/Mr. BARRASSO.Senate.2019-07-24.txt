 Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of S. 2249, introduced earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today again, as I  have week after week, to highlight the healthcare policy disaster the  Democrats have labeled as Medicare for All. This mislabeled, one-size- fits-all approach takes health insurance away--takes it away--from 180  million Americans who have earned and who get their health insurance on  the job.   Still, many Democratic Members and many Presidential candidates  support this radical proposal, which would actually eliminate on-the- job insurance. Offered originally by Senator Sanders, this so-called  Medicare for All bill would dramatically raise taxes. It would destroy  Medicare as we know it, and, of course, it would ration care.   Last week I discussed healthcare rationing in Britain and in Canada.  Today my focus is the plan's impact on medical innovation. As a doctor,  I continue to remain astonished at how far medical technology has come  in the 30 years since I started to practice medicine. Scientific  breakthroughs are saving lives all around the world. I know because my  wife Bobbi is a breast cancer survivor.   According to the American Cancer Society, the death rate for women  with breast cancer has fallen nearly 40 percent. More women are living  longer after being diagnosed and treated. The progress is due to  earlier detection as well as better treatment. It is a combination.   This is not limited to breast cancer alone. The death rate for all  cancer patients has steadily declined. The diagnosis of cancer is no  longer considered a death penalty. People survive and thrive. We have  made tremendous strides. U.S. brain power has led the way. According to  the New York Times, the United States is ``home to an outsize share of  global [healthcare] innovation.''   The innovation comes from America. Patients the world over depend  upon our medical breakthroughs.   What happens if we put Washington in charge of all of U.S.  healthcare? Washington bureaucrats--not you, not your family, not your  doctor, not scientists, but Washington bureaucrats--will call the  shots.   Let's look again at Britain, which has a government-run system. There  was a recent headline in the British  [[Page S5039]]  newspaper, the Guardian, and it is enlightening. It says this: ``NHS  cancer scans left unread for weeks.'' The cancer scans have been left  unread for weeks.   The Guardian reports: ``Cancer scans showing the presence or spread  of the disease are going unread for as long as six weeks.'' Think about  that. You are a patient. It is cancer. It is ongoing, and it is  spreading. You have had a scan and have been waiting 6 weeks to know  what is happening with your own body.   Cancer scan reports used to take a week; then, about a month and now,  6 weeks. As a result, according to one of the radiologists in Britain,  ``[u]nexpected and critical findings are going unreported for weeks.''  As he said, ``We are now just firefighting.''   The patients are getting the scans, and they are waiting for results.  American patients simply would not tolerate this. They wouldn't in my  home State. They wouldn't in your home State, Mr. President.   American patients will not tolerate this. That is why we can't afford  to lose our competitive edge. The return of our investment in medical  research and development in this country is absolutely tremendous. It  is thanks to U.S. investment and innovation. That is why patient care  is improving not just in the United States but worldwide.   President Trump is asking Europe and other developed countries to  start paying their fair share. The President is right. American  patients shouldn't have to foot all of the bill for global cures.  Still, U.S. patients will surely suffer if Washington bureaucrats start  blocking new innovations.   As I said last week, the Congressional Budget Office came out and  talked about their report on what Medicare for All would mean, and they  said that there would be a delay--a delay in treatment, as well as a  delay in technology if we had a one-size-fits all healthcare system and  180 million Americans lost the insurance they get from work.   Patients in England have bureaucrats as judge and as jury weighing  the value of every advancement, seeing if they can even have it in that  country. What we see is that the bureaucrats are denying lifesaving  treatment, much of it invented in the United States.   British patients recently protested their National Health Service.  They protested because the National Health Service refused to permit  the use of a cutting-edge drug to treat cystic fibrosis. The protesters  ended up placing T-shirts in Parliament Square, representing the 255  people in England who have died as a result of the refusal of England  to approve the use of a drug that exists and that works.   Of course, we all agree the prices of medications need to come down.  In England, the government just says: No, we are not going to have that  treatment, that cure, to be used in our country.   We need to get the cost of care down. We also need to protect  innovation because that is the future of healthcare. Doctors and  scientists need the freedom to give us the next generation of  lifesaving drugs. That is why I am concerned that under the Democrats'  plan such medical progress is threatened.   Clearly, Democrats have taken a hard-left turn when it comes to  healthcare and when it comes to the role of imposing more government in  our lives. They want to take away your health insurance, the one you  get from work, and in place of on-the-job insurance, they want one  expensive, new, government-run program for everyone.   Democrats' extreme scheme is expected to cost $32 trillion. It is so  expensive, in fact, that even doubling everyone's taxes wouldn't cover  it. That means Washington bureaucrats will be restricting your care.  You will lose the freedom to choose your doctor. You will lose the  freedom to choose your hospital. You will have the freedom to make  choices about your own life, and bureaucrats will limit your access to  new treatments as well as cutting-edge technologies.   It is hard to know how many months you will have to wait for urgently  needed care. We have seen it in Canada. We have seen it in England. We  do not want to see it here in the United States. Delayed care becomes  denied care.   Why should you pay more, which is what this so-called Medicare for  All does? You will be paying more to wait longer for worse care. Why  would America want that? That is exactly what the Democrats are  proposing.   Meanwhile, Republicans are focused on real reforms--reforms that  lower costs without lowering standards. That is the key difference. We  want to lower costs but not standards.   In England, they say: Well, it is free, but you are going to have to  wait for a long time for your free care. As I reported last week,  people have actually gone blind while waiting and others have died  while waiting.   The Democrats' proposal actually lowers standards while limiting your  choices and raising your costs. It is time to reject the Democrats'  one-size-fits-all healthcare scheme. Instead, let's ensure our patients  get the innovative care they need from a doctor they choose at lower  costs.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
