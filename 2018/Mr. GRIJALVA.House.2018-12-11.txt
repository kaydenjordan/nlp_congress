 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of S. 943, the Johnson-O'Malley  Supplemental Indian Education Program Modernization Act.   The abysmal conditions and status of education attainment and  achievement of American Indian children and students continues. This  educational gap for American Indian students continues to lag behind  all other students in this country.   This bill would require the Department of the Interior to annually  update the count of American Indian and Alaska Native students so the  Department can more accurately distribute Johnson-O'Malley funds which  supplement Indian education. The bill would also require grantees to  report how funds are being used, helping to ensure Federal dollars  support Native students' education.   The Federal Government has a responsibility to provide parity in  resources to Native education. Currently, the Department is prevented  from updating the count because of an effort, from over 20 years ago,  to cut spending through the use of block grants.   Congress, at the time, determined one way to reduce funding for  Indian education was to freeze efforts to count the number of Native  students. As a result, the Department of the Interior continues to use  the 1994 number of 272,000 Native students, even though it is  estimated, based on Census reports, that there are now more than  750,000 Native students. This policy is just another in a long list of  the second-class treatment of American Indians by our government.   I want to thank my colleague, Betty McCollum, for introducing this  version of the legislation and my Republican colleagues,  Tom Cole and   Don Young, for providing bipartisan support. My hope is that the  passage of this bill is a first step, however small it may be, to  righting a wrong to American Indian students.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 943, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
