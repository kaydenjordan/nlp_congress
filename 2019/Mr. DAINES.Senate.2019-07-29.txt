 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  congratulating Thomas Penley of Helena, MT, for his hard work  representing Montana at the 2019 meeting of Boys Nation.   The process to be a delegate at Boys Nation is highly competitive,  with only a few students per high school allowed to receive a  nomination. Mr. Penley successfully earned a nomination to attend the  Montana Boys State meeting at Carrol College in Helena. At this  meeting, Mr. Penley was one of the two attendees selected by the  conference to represent Montana at the national meeting.   Mr. Penley's achievements do not stop at his nomination to be part of  the Montana delegation at the Boys Nation meeting. At the assembly, Mr.  Penley was elected by his peers to serve as vice president of the  session. This tremendous honor speaks volumes to Mr. Penley's work  ethic and leadership. In the 73 years of Boys Nation, only one other  time has a Montanan been elected vice president.   I am proud to recognize Mr. Penley for his continued success and wish  him the best. I look forward to following all the future  accomplishments Mr. Penley will achieve.                            ____________________     Mr. President, we are at a pivotal time in our great  Nation's history. America was founded upon the principles of liberty,  the free enterprise system, the promotion of national sovereignty, and  a strong national defense. Under these principles, we have built the  greatest country in the history of the world. We have shown the world  time and again the genius of American ingenuity and the grit of  American determination.   What makes America so great is not that we are bonded by one  ethnicity or one race but that we are bonded together by the idea of  liberty. Montanans agree. Montanans want less government. Montanans  don't want the hand of Big Government and Washington, DC, in their  pockets, making decisions on their behalf or limiting their freedoms.  In Montana, we understand the principles of freedom.   However, a radical, socialist, far-left movement is growing across  this country and has taken root as the new voice of the Democratic  Party. My Grandpa was a Democrat from Billings, MT. I spent many days  out with Grandpa fishing and hunting in certain places in Montana. I  love my Grandpa dearly. But if he were around today, he would be  appalled as a Democrat at some of the things the far left are saying  and advocating for. The words and the actions of certain radical  Members of the Democratic House highlight this new standard for the  Democratic Party.   It was renowned economist Milton Friedman who once said, ``One of the  great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions  rather than their results.''   Radical Democrats are advocating for disastrous policies that would  wreck our economy under the guise of cleaning up the environment.  Fantasy policies, like the Green New Deal, would be a disaster for  Montana and the American people. Under this socialist wish list,  Montanans and millions of the American people would have to give up  their cars and air travel. Montana truckers, our ag haulers, our  pilots, and the industries that rely on them would be wiped out. What  the socialists are calling for is a disbanding of our coal plants,  leaving countless Montana communities in the dark and in the cold and  putting many more out of good-paying jobs and putting a diverse energy  sector out of business.   Above all else, to fund this disaster of a policy, it is estimated it  would take $93 trillion--that is with a ``t.'' Who do they think is  going to pay for that? It would be Montanans, Americans, our moms and  dads, our children.   Just last week in Berkley, CA, their city council banned natural gas  in new homes. Whatever happened to supporting all of the above energy  agenda? They are banning natural gas in new homes in Berkley, CA.   Another disastrous policy that the radical left is pushing for is  this so-called Medicare for All or rather socialized medicine. They are  calling for a complete takeover of our healthcare system by the Federal  Government, eliminating private insurance and eliminating choice.   This so-called plan will cost the taxpayers another $32 trillion over  10 years--$32 trillion with a ``t.'' Combine this cost with the cost of  the Green New Deal proposal, and the country you and I know will cease  to exist. Our economy will be destroyed.   We are also seeing far-left, radical Democrats normalize crime and  the blatant disregard of the law with their push for open borders. We  are a sovereign nation with established borders. We are a nation based  on the rule of law.   Lost in this heated immigration debate taking place at our southern  border are the stories of the law-abiding, legal American immigrants  who have fled socialist regimes for a chance at freedom. Some of these  immigrants include the Vietnamese boat people, the Cuban refugees who  fled Castro's murderous regime, and Chinese Christians persecuted for  practicing their faith. You see, in talking to these immigrants--these  legal immigrants--they will tell you what socialism looks like. They  will also tell you how grateful they are to have freedom here in  America. They are proud to be Americans.   So we, as Americans, have a choice. One path leads to complete  government control, undermining our Constitution and our American way  of life. The other path is the path of freedom. You see, capitalism and  the free enterprise system has done more than any other system in the  world to lift people out of poverty.   As a former technology executive, I can speak to the wonders of the  free enterprise system because I saw it happen firsthand in my hometown  of Bozeman, MT. What was once a small startup cloud computing business,  grew into a billion-dollar company headquartered in Bozeman, MT, and it  transformed Bozeman into becoming one of the tech hubs now of the West.  It is all because the American free enterprise system thrives in  innovation, and it rewards  [[Page S5149]]  entrepreneurs and employees who pursue their dreams and take that leap  of faith. That is what freedom looks like.   In the face of this extremism we see bubbling up right over in that  other Chamber, the U.S. House of Representatives, we must stand strong  for the values that made America what it is today.   Therefore, today I introduce a resolution--my resolution condemning  the growing socialist movement in our country. I ask my Senate  colleagues to join me in renouncing this ideology taking root in our  country and to stand for freedom.   Today we make a choice--freedom or socialism. I choose freedom.                            ____________________
