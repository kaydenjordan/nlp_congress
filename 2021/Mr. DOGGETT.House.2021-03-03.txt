 Madam Speaker, death and destruction at this Capitol  from recent Trump-instigated violence shows the result of insufficient  policing. The deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, and in my  area, Mike Ramos and Javier Ambler, and too many more, from misconduct,  show the result of insufficient justice. As the name of this bill,  ``Justice in Policing,'' indicates this bill is not about removing the  police; it is about removing the injustice. It seeks accountability.   It seeks equal justice under the law by our law enforcers,  particularly for people of color, who have too often been victimized by  systemic racism. Instead of working with us to make it better and  secure our communities and more justice for all, many of today's  Republican opponents are only spouting the poisonous slogans of  Trumpism. Because Black and Brown lives do matter, let's approve this  bill to achieve greater justice for all in an America that is safer for  all.                                time  1945
