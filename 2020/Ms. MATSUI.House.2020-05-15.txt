 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule.   The public health challenge this country faces is unprecedented in  modern American life, and we have an obligation to respond in kind.  [[Page H2010]]    The administration's response to this pandemic and the implementation  of bipartisan legislation providing trillions of dollars in support  require meaningful oversight. As our public health experts continue to  recommend social distancing, this rule will allow the House to execute  its constitutional obligations in a way that respects their advice and  limits the spread of COVID-19.   I also am here to support the HEROES Act. The additional funding  included in this bill is needed immediately.   The HEROES Act builds upon the progress of our previous bills by  providing nearly $1 trillion for State and local governments to pay  healthcare workers, police, fire, teachers, transit workers, and other  essential personnel.   It also increases flexibility in the PPP to help small businesses use  money in a way that makes sense for them. I have heard from restaurants  and small businesses across Sacramento that these changes are needed,  and I am glad that this bill responds directly to their concerns.   And to contain the virus, the HEROES Act provides additional  resources for testing, tracing, and isolation, and ensures every  American has access to free coronavirus treatment, covers the cost of  COBRA premiums for 9 months, and opens up special enrollment periods  for ACA exchanges and Medicare.   As we come to fully appreciate the scale and severity of this  pandemic, it is clear that additional support is necessary to prevent  more deaths and job losses.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to supporting this bill and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.
