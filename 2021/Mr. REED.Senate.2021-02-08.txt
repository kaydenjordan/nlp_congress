 Madam President, today I pay tribute to a very special  Rhode Islander, COL Ray Renola, USA (Ret.), who holds a unique  distinction among all Americans.   Mr. Renola, at 104 years old, is the oldest living graduate of my  alma mater, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. A member of the  class of 1940, Mr. Renola stands at the head of the Long Grey Line of  West Pointers who have served the Nation since 1802.   As described in a recent column by Mark Patinkin in the Providence  Journal, Ray was the son of Italian immigrants and one of eight  children raised on the West End of Providence. He was a graduate of  Classical High School in Providence and then entered Brown University,  but in 1936, he made the decision to serve his country and restart and  complete his college education at West Point.   Like many of our World War II veterans, Ray did not talk much about  his service on the western front as a lieutenant colonel and commanding  officer of the 375th Field Artillery Battalion. In short, he deployed  his battalion and led them against fierce enemy resistance,  unpredictable weather, harsh terrain, and austere conditions. And he  led them as they made great contributions to Allied forces during the  push toward Berlin in 1944-1945. After the war, Ray continued his  service to our country with postings from Belgium to the Pentagon,  before retiring from the military after 20 years of service. He had a  similarly successful career in the private sector, working for Bulova  and GTE.   He found the love of his life with Lucille, to whom he was married  for 30 years, until her passing in 2010. They shared an active life of  sport and travel. He remains the loved and revered patriarch of the  larger, extended Renola family.   Ray embodies what it means to live an extraordinary life: love for  his country; love for his family; a life of duty, honor, and country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Timely  Reauthorization of Necessary Stem Cell Programs Lends Access to Needed  Therapies (TRANSPLANT) Act of 2021 with Senators Richard Burr, Tina  Smith, and Tim Scott. This bill offers promise to the tens of thousands  of individuals diagnosed with leukemia and lymphomas, sickle cell  anemia, and rare genetic blood disorders.   Our bipartisan legislation renews the C. W. Bill Young Cell  Transplantation Program and the National Cord Blood Inventory (NCBI),  the only programs in the Country that maintain donor registries for  individuals in need of a bone marrow and umbilical cord blood  transplantation. Over twenty-two million Americans are registered bone  marrow donors resulting in nearly 6,500 transplants just last year. In  the years since NCBI was established, more than 300,000 cord blood  units have been collected, facilitating more than 100,000 blood stem  cell transplants. The TRANSPLANT Act would reaffirm the commitment to  these life-saving programs, which have been helping to connect  individuals in need of bone marrow or umbilical cord blood transplants  with donors for more than two decades.   The public registries, made up of donors from all over the country,  have been a true lifeline for the Americans who have found an unrelated  match. By strengthening and enhancing the important programs operating  these registries, many more Americans will be afforded the opportunity  to find a match if they are ever in need. I look forward to swift  consideration of this legislation in the Senate Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee and working toward passage in the full  Senate.                                  ______                                         By Mr. WARNER (for himself, Ms. Hirono, Ms. Klobuchar, and Mr.          Kaine):   S. 299. A bill to amend section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934  to reaffirm civil rights, victims' rights, and consumer protections; to  the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
