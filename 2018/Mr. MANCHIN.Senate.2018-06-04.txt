 Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the  100th birthday of Charles T. Jones, or better known to the people who  love him as Captain Charlie, a proud West Virginian, military veteran,  legendary businessman, servant of the community, and a dear friend.  Throughout his century of life, Charlie has often been referred to as a  coal miner, farmer, riverboat captain, and a Renaissance man.   While he grew up on the banks of the Kanawha River in West Virginia,  Charlie attended school in New Jersey, where he spent many afternoons  rowing on Lake Carnegie. This is where he met Albert Einstein, who  would observe his rowing each afternoon. He would later earn a degree  in business from Babson Institute in Massachusetts.   Charlie served his country in the U.S. Navy during World War II with  the Navy Seabees in Guadalcanal and on a mine sweeper as an engineering  officer off the coasts of Japan and the Philippines. The sense of  service and duty he demonstrated while in the military is still  something he carries with him to this day.   After the war's end, Charlie went to work for his family's coking  coal business, Star Coal and Coke Company, which later became Amherst  Coal Company, in 1946. The company was started by his grandfather in  1893. Due to the downturn in production and demand of coking coal, out  of necessity, the company ventured into river transportation. In 1951,  the family bought the Hatfield-Campbell Creek Coal Company, a business  that operated steamboats, barges, and river terminals along the Kanawha  and Ohio Rivers. He took over the river operations of the company and  renamed them ``Amherst Barge Co.'' Along the way, the company became  Madison Coal and Supply Co. and is now known as Amherst Madison and  still specializes in marine services, like towing, construction,  shipping, and equipment repairs. Amherst and its affiliated companies  have proudly employed thousands of West Virginians over the past 70  years.   Charlie is one of the most hard-working, humble, and giving people  West Virginia has ever known. He is a longtime supporter of many  business and charitable and community organizations throughout the  Kanawha Valley. Over the years, he has served or currently serves on  numerous boards and committees including Yeager Airport Authority  Board, board of trustees for the University of Charleston, chairman  emeritus of the Inland Waterways User Board, trustee emeritus of the WV  Chapter of the Nature Conservancy, director emeritus of the Mariner's  Museum, past chairman of the WV Mining and Reclamation Association,  former director of the Charleston Area Medical Center Foundation, One  Valley Bancorp, and the Western Pocahontas Corporation, Ohio Valley  Improvement Association or DINAMO, and so many more.   His lifelong contributions have not been overlooked. Just last year,  Charlie was honored as a Distinguished West Virginian by the Governor,  entered into the Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels by the people of  the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and inducted into West Virginia  University College of Business and Economics' Business Hall of Fame,  and recognized as a West Virginia ``Who's Who'' by the State Journal.  Additionally, he has received previous honors such as the Charleston  YMCA's Spirit of the Valley Award, induction into the Coal Mining Hall  of Fame, Charleston Gazette-Mail's West Virginian of the Year, Seamen's  Church Institute Lifetime Achievement Award, and the National Rivers  Hall of Fame Achievement Award, to name only a few.   He credits his longevity to good genes, good luck, and a great wife  and very supportive family, associates, and friends. Charlie and his  wife, Mary Ellen, have been married for more than 45 years. He has four  children: Laura Jones Pray, C. Tandy Jones, Jennifer Jones, and the  late O. Nelson Jones. He is a member of the Oak Hill Baptist Church and  the St. Matthew's Episcopal Church in Charleston.   I know I speak for all West Virginians when I wish Charles T.  ``Captain Charlie'' Jones a Happy 100th birthday and wish for many  more.                            ____________________
