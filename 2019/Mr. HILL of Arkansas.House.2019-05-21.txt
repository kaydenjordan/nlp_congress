 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to  the historic vote taken exactly 100 years ago when this body passed the  19th Amendment, giving women the right to vote.   The most powerful tool we have is to share our voice, cast our  ballot, and exercise our right to vote. This momentous vote finally  allowed women to use that tool and forever have a voice in the future  of our beloved Nation.   Adolphine Fletcher Terry, a civic-minded woman from a prominent  Little Rock family in the late 1800s and early 20th century, served her  State and her country tirelessly to promote the education of women and  women's rights. Terry marched for voting rights for women during the  ratification process in 1920, saying: ``To me, the vote represents more  than just saying how a person feels about an issue or a candidate. It  represents human dignity and the fact that a citizen can express his or  her opinion on any subject without fear of reprisal. That, I think, is  what real human dignity consists of.''    In advance of the final State's ratification vote in Tennessee, both  suffragists and antisuffragists began wearing roses to identify their  respective sides. Those favoring women's voting rights wore yellow  roses; those against wore red roses. I proudly, today, have worn a  yellow rose on my lapel throughout today's activities to show my  support of women's right to vote.   What a thrill it is and a proud thing to say, thank you, Madam  Speaker, for your service.                              Fentanyl Sanctions     Madam Speaker, across Arkansas, heartbroken  families have told me of their stories about the opioid crisis and how  it has claimed the lives of their loved ones. We can't allow more  families to be destroyed by this truly national nightmare that is  killing more than 130 Americans every day.   Furthermore, the Centers for Disease Control reported that fentanyl  is now considered the number one U.S. opioid killer in 2018. Targeting  the source of the world's largest producers and distributors of  fentanyl will begin to stop the flow of these drugs coming across our  borders and onto our streets.   Madam Speaker, in just one Sweet'N Low packet, about a gram, an equal  amount of this as fentanyl has the power to kill 500 of our citizens.  That is why I am pleased to support the bipartisan legislation that I  recently helped introduce, H.R. 2483, the Fentanyl Sanctions Act. This  takes the necessary steps to target the bad actors responsible for  illegally trafficking fentanyl into the United States.   I applaud my colleagues Max Rose of New York, Anthony Brindisi of New  York, and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania for their support in  introducing H.R. 2483.   This legislation is the first ever fentanyl sanctions effort by the  House of Representatives. It will apply pressure on the Chinese  Government to honor their commitment to make all fentanyl illegal in  China. This bill will also provide the United States with more tools  and resources to go after illicit traffickers in China, Mexico, and  other countries.   H.R. 2483 has support from both parties and both Chambers, and we  need to act now in order to get this done. We cannot wait any longer.          Association of Military Banks of America 60th Anniversary     Madam Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the  60th anniversary of the Association of Military Banks of America.   Just as they did back in 1959, military banks today consider  themselves privileged to provide financial services, support, and  education to the military and veteran communities across this country.   I am particularly proud that First Arkansas Bank and Trust, which  serves our airmen and -women at Little Rock Air Force Base, is one of  these military banks.   On base, financial institutions have proven to be the single best  sources of financial education and support available to our troops.  They ease financial burdens and stress faced by our troops and their  families so that they can focus on their mission of protecting our  great Nation.   Congratulations on 60 years of serving the financial needs of our  Nation's heroes.             Court Security Officer of the Year, Jimmy Howington     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  life of a security officer who continues to have an indelible impact on  my State of Arkansas, Mr. Jimmy Howington, who this year was the Court  Security Officer of the Year.   Jimmy is one of 33 court security officers in Arkansas and serves  under the jurisdiction of the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.   He was chosen for the award from roughly 600 court security officers  working in 30 courthouses in the seven States within the Eighth  Circuit's jurisdiction.   Jimmy was recommended for this honor for noticing and investigating  two suspicious situations on courthouse property during a period of  several bomb threats at Little Rock's Richard Sheppard Arnold U.S.  Courthouse, where he has worked since 2016.   A former state trooper and sergeant major in the United States Marine  Corps Reserve, Jimmy's life of service makes him well deserving of this  award.   I would like to extend a hand of gratitude and congratulations to him  for his selfless service to Arkansas and our Nation.                        Brigadier General Paul Rowlett     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  accomplishments and to congratulate Brigadier General Paul Rowlett, who  recently was promoted to brigadier general of the Arkansas Air National  Guard.   Rowlett is a native of Salem, Arkansas, and as a brigadier general  will serve as the chief of staff for the Arkansas Air National Guard.   He joined the military in 1988 and is currently an intelligence  officer with the National Guard and works with remote-piloted aircraft.  His duties include strategic planning on current and future missions.   Rowlett has been assigned to Active-Duty positions throughout his  career, including locations such as Guantanamo Bay, and recently he has  been assigned to Little Rock Air Force Base for the majority of the  time since 2001. He has become one of only three general officers in  Arkansas.   My congratulations and best wishes for Brigadier General Rowlett and  his bright future defending our beloved Nation.             National Wildlife Refuge System Employee of the Year     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Eric  Johnson of the Central Arkansas National Wildlife Refuge Complex for  being named the National Wildlife Refuge System Employee of the Year by  the National Wildlife Refuge Association.  [[Page H4061]]    Eric is an administrative forester that is in charge of restoring and  managing some 90,000 acres of forested habitat for waterfowl and  migratory birds in the lower Mississippi Valley.   While protecting this extensive acreage, he developed the Nation's  first Spatial Habitat Management Plan. This plan will serve as a new  national standard for refuge systems and protect all of Arkansas' five  refuges, including Bald Knob's Wildlife Refuge in my district.   His service to the State of Arkansas and to wildlife conservation  will not be forgotten, and I join all Arkansans in congratulating Eric  on this recognition and wish him much continued success.                             U.S. Policy in Syria     Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak out  against the daily atrocities in Syria.   Few would have predicted that 8 years ago peaceful protests would  turn into violent conflict that has left more than half a million men,  women, and children dead, millions more displaced, and the entire  region feeling like a lit fuse ready to explode into further conflict.   Shortly after coming to Congress, I met Mouaz Moustafa, a young  Syrian American from Arkansas who has been leading a Syrian pro- democracy group here in Washington called the Syrian Emergency Task  Force.   After meeting Mouaz, I studied his efforts and learned more and more  about the horrific events happening in Syria over the past few years.                                time  1915    Mouaz led me through the Caesar file photos in a special exhibit at  the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Earlier this year, he  introduced me to Omar Alshogre, who was arrested as a teenager and  survived the torture, starvation, and other brutalities in Assad's  prisons for more than 3 years. Seeing those photos and hearing Omar's  personal testimony were powerful experiences.   I believe what is happening in Syria today is a modern-day holocaust,  and our obligation to end Assad's reign of terror is something that all  Americans must confront.   I am grateful for The New York Times and its recent extensive front- page story, in last Sunday's newspaper, going inside Assad's torture  prisons.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a link to this article:  www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/world/middleeast/syria-torture-prisons.html   Madam Speaker, it is the experiences shared by former prisoners like  Omar that remind us of the likes of Hitler, Mao, and Stalin. Bashar al- Assad can add his name to this list of barbarous thugs who rule with  evil, torture, and mass murder.   We have known about these atrocities for years but have only  expressed outrage while we twiddled our thumbs as these modern-day  Hitlers annihilate the civilian population in Syria.   I commend Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for passing S. 1,  the Strengthening America's Security in the Middle East Act.   Last week, many of us, including myself, signed the discharge  petition for the companion legislation to S. 1 here in the House, H.R.  336 sponsored by  Mike McCaul from Texas. This legislation includes the  Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act, which has critical provisions to  hold Assad accountable for his atrocities.   As Speaker Pelosi well knows, this House, under Republican  leadership, has passed the Caesar bill three times over the last three  Congresses, only to have it bogged down in the Senate.   Now Leader McConnell has acted, and we, in the House, must now act  with expedition and pass H.R. 336 to end this step back into darkness,  to stop the torture and the murder of thousands, and to move to convict  Assad and his henchmen for war crimes.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                 ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 7 o'clock and 18 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, May 22, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.
