 Correct.    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. The idea that there was some sort of coverup is  further destroyed by the simple fact that everyone who as part of their  job needed access to that transcript, still had access to it, including  Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. The person who raised the complaint still  had access to the transcript the entire time.   This is the way Mr. Morrison's testimony explained that.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Once it was moved to the departmental system?       Yes.         I spoke with the NSC executive secretariat       staff, asked them why, and they did their research and they       informed me that it had been moved to the higher       classification system at the direction of John Eisenberg,       whom I then asked why. I mean, if that was the judgment he       made, that's not necessarily mine to question, but I didn't       understand it. And he essentially told me: I gave no such       direction. He did his own inquiry, and he represented back to       me that it was his understanding that it was kind of an       administrative error, that when he also gave direction to       restrict access, the executive secretariat staff also       understood that as an apprehension that there was something       in the content of the Memcon that could not exist on the       lower classification system.         Correct.    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Everyone who knew something about it and who  testified agreed there was no malicious intent. The call was still  available to everyone who needed it as part of their job, and it  certainly wasn't covered up or deep-sixed in some way. The President  declassified it and made it public. So why we are even here talking  about these accusations about a coverup, when it is a transcript that  was preserved and made public, is somewhat absurd.   The other point I would like to turn to--another accusation from the  House managers--is that the whistleblower complaint was not forwarded  to Congress. They have said that lawyers at the Department of Justice,  this time, they accused OLC, the Office of Legal Counsel, of providing  a bogus opinion for why the Director of National Intelligence did not  have to advance the whistleblower's complaint to Congress.   Manager Jeffries said that OLC opined ``without any reasonable basis  that the Acting DNI did not have to turn over the complaint to  Congress.''   The way he portrayed this--now, there is a statute that says if the  inspector general of the intelligence community finds a matter of  urgent concern, it must be forwarded to Congress. And Manager Jeffries  portrayed this as if the only thing to decide was were these claims  urgent. He said: ``What can be more urgent than a sitting President  trying to cheat in an American election by soliciting foreign  interference?''   Except that is not the only question. The statute doesn't just say,  if it is urgent, you have to forward it. It talks about ``urgent  concern'' as a defined term. If the House managers want to come and  cast accusations that the political and career officials at the Office  of Legal Counsel, which we all know is a very respected office of the  Department of Justice, provides opinions for the executive branch on  what governing law is, they should come backed up with analysis.   So let's look at what the law actually says, and I think we have the  slide of that.   ``Urgent concern is defined as a serious or flagrant problem, abuse,  violation of law relating to the funding, administration, or operation  of an intelligence activity within the responsibility and authority of  the Director of National Intelligence involving classified  information.''   So the Office of Legal Counsel was consulted by the General Counsel  at  [[Page S622]]  the DNI's office, and they looked at this definition, and they did an  analysis. They determined that the alleged misconduct was not an urgent  concern within the meaning of the statute because they were not just  talking about ``Do we think it is urgent?'' ``Do we think it is  important?'' No. They were analyzing the law, and they looked at the  terms of the statute.   ``The alleged misconduct is not an urgent concern within the meaning  of the statute because it does not concern the funding, administration,  or operation of an intelligence activity under the authority of the  DNI.''   Remember, what we are talking about here is a head-of-state  communication between the President of the United States and another  head of state. This isn't some CIA operation overseas. This isn't the  NSA's doing something. This isn't any intelligence activity going on  within the intelligence community under the supervision of the DNI. It  is the head of the executive branch, in the exercising of his  constitutional authority, engaging in foreign relations with a foreign  head of state.   So, in reaching that conclusion, the Office of Legal Counsel looked  at the statute, case law, and the legislative history. It concluded  that this phrase ``urgent concern'' included matters relating to an  intelligence activity subject to the DNI's supervision, but it did not  include allegations of wrongdoing arising outside of any intelligence  activity or outside the intelligence community itself.   That makes sense. This statute was meant to provide for an ability of  the inspector general's of the intelligence community, in overseeing  the activities of the intelligence community, to receive reports about  what was going on at intelligence agencies, those who were members of  the intelligence community, and if there were fraud, waste, abuse-- something unlawful--in those activities. It was not meant to create an  inspector general of the Presidency, an inspector general of the Oval  Office, to purport to determine whether the President, in exercising  his constitutional authorities, had done something that should be  reported.   This law is narrow, and it does not cover every alleged violation of  law, the OSC explained, or other abuse that comes to the attention of a  member of the intelligence community. Just because you are in the  intelligence community and happen to see something else doesn't make  this law apply. The law does not make the inspector general for the  intelligence community responsible for investigating and reporting on  allegations that do not involve intelligence activities or the  intelligence community.   Nonetheless, the President, of course, released the July 25 call  transcript, and it was also not the end of the matter that the  whistleblower complaint and the ICIG's letter were not sent directly to  Congress. As the OLC explained, if the alleged complaint does not  involve an urgent concern but if there is anything else there that you  want to have checked out, the appropriate action is to refer the matter  to the Department of Justice, and that is what the DNI's office did.   They sent the ICIG's letter, with the complaint, to the Department of  Justice, and the Department of Justice looked at it. This was all made  public some time ago. The Department of Justice examined the exact  allegations of the whistleblower's and the exact framing and concern  raised by the inspector general, which had to do with the potential of,  perhaps, a campaign finance law violation. The DOJ looked at it--looked  at the statutes, analyzed it--and determined there was no violation,  and it closed the matter. It announced that months ago.   When something gets sent over to the Department of Justice to  examine, you can't call that a coverup. Everything here was done  correctly. The lawyers analyzed the law. The complaint was sent to the  appropriate person for review. It was not within the statute that it  required transmission to Congress. Everything was handled entirely  properly.   Again, actually extraneous to the matters before you, there is  nothing about these two points in the Articles of Impeachment, but it  merits a response when reckless allegations are made against those at  the White House and at the Department of Justice.   With that, Mr. Chief Justice, I yield my time to Mr. Sekulow.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Majority Leader  McConnell, Democratic Leader Schumer, House managers, Members of the  Senate.    What we are involved in here, as we conclude, is perhaps the most  solemn of duties under our constitutional framework--the trial of the  leader of the free world and the duly elected President of the United  States. It is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts. That is  politics, unfortunately, and Hamilton put impeachment in the hands of  this body--the Senate--precisely and specifically to be above that  fray. This is the greatest deliberative body on Earth.   In our presentation so far, you have now heard from legal scholars  from a variety of schools of thought, from a variety of political  backgrounds, but they do have a common theme with a dire warning-- danger, danger, danger. To lower the bar of impeachment based on these  Articles of Impeachment would impact the functioning of our  constitutional Republic and the framework of that Constitution for  generations.   I asked you to put yourselves--in quoting Mr. Schiff's statement that  his father made--in the shoes of someone else, and I said I would like  you to put yourselves in the shoes of the President. I think it is  important, as we conclude today, that we are reminded of that fact.   The President of the United States, before he was the President, was  under an investigation. It was called Crossfire Hurricane. It was an  investigation, led by the FBI, the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  James Comey eventually told the President a little bit about the  investigation and referenced the Steele dossier. James Comey, the then- Director of the FBI, said it was salacious and unverified--so salacious  and unverified that they used it as a basis to obtain FISA warrants.  Members--managers here, managers at this table right here--said that  any discussions on the abuse from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Act, utilized to get the FISA warrants from the court, were conspiracy  theories.   At the very beginning, I asked you to put yourselves in the shoes of  not just this President but of any President who would have been under  this type of attack. FISA warrants were issued on people affiliated  with his campaign--American citizens affiliated with the people of his  campaign, citizens of the United States being surveilled pursuant to an  order that has now been acknowledged by the very court that issued the  order that it was based on a fraudulent presentation.   In fact, evidence specifically changed--changed by the very FBI  lawyer who was in charge of this, changed to such an extent that the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court--as I said earlier, and I will  not repeat it again--issued two orders, saying that when this agent-- this lawyer--made these misrepresentations to the National Security  Division, they also made a misrepresentation to a Federal court--the  Federal court--the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. This is a  court where there are no defense witnesses and is a court where there  is no cross-examination. It is a court based on trust. That trust was  violated.   Then the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James  Comey, decides he will leak a memo of a conversation he had with the  President of the United States. He is leaking the memo for a purpose,  he said--to obtain the appointment of a special counsel. Lo and behold,  a special counsel is appointed. It just so happens that that FBI  agent--lawyer--who committed the fraud on the FISA Court, became a  lawyer for the Mueller investigation, only to be removed because of  political animus and bias found by the inspector general.   Then we have a special counsel investigation. Lisa Page, Agent  Strzok--I am not going to go into the details. You know them. They are  not in controversy. They are uncontroverted. The facts are clear. But  does it bother your sense of justice even a little bit--even a little  bit--that Bob Mueller allowed the evidence on the phones of those  agents to be wiped clean while there was an investigation going on by  the inspector general?  [[Page S623]]    Now, if you did it, or if you did it, Manager Schiff, or if you did  it, Manager Jeffries, or if I did that--destroyed evidence--if anyone  in this Chamber did this, we would be in serious trouble. Their serious  trouble is their getting fired. Bob Mueller's explanation for it is, I  don't know what happened. I don't know what happened. I can't recall  conversations.   You can't view this case in a vacuum. You are being asked--and I say  this with the utmost respect--to remove a duly elected President of the  United States. We have referenced the law school exams, and I love  that. I thought there was great analysis yesterday. I appreciate all of  that, but I want to focus today on my section, on what you are being  asked to do. You are being asked to remove a duly elected President of  the United States, and you are being asked to do it in an election  year--in an election year.   There are some of you in this Chamber right now who would rather be  someplace else, and that is why we will be brief. I understand. You  would rather be someplace else. Why would you rather be someplace else?  Because you are running for President, for the nomination of your  party. I get it, but this is a serious, deliberative situation. You are  being asked to remove a duly elected President of the United States.  That is what the Articles of Impeachment call for--removal.   So we had a special counsel, and we got the report. Just for a  moment, putting yourselves in the shoes of this President--or of any  President who would be under this situation--you are No. 4 at the  Department of Justice. His wife is working for the firm that is doing  the opposition research on him and is communicating with the foreign  former spy, Christopher Steele, who put together the dossier. It is  being handled by Christopher Steele, through Nellie Ohr, to her  husband--then, the fourth ranking member at the Department of Justice,  Bruce Ohr. All of this is going on, and he doesn't want to tell  everybody--and he has testified to this--what he is doing because he is  afraid he might have to stop.   Might have to stop?   How did this happen? This is the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And  then we ask why the President is concerned about advice he is being  given?   Put yourself in his shoes. Put yourself in his shoes.   We have given you--and our approach has been to give--an overview,  and to be very specific, to remove a duly elected President, which is  what you are being asked to do, for essentially policy disagreements-- you heard a lot about policy, although the one that I still--it still  troubles me, this idea that the President--it was said by several of  the managers--is only doing these things for himself.   Understanding what is going on in the world today, as we are here-- they raised it, by the way. I am not trying to be disrespectful. They  raised it: This President is only doing things for himself while the  leaders of opposing parties, by the way, at the highest level, to  obtain peace in the Middle East--to say you are only doing that for  yourself? I think the irony is that those statements were made while  all of that was going on and other acts that this body has passed, some  of them bipartisan, to help the American people.   Policy differences--those policy differences cannot be used to  destroy the separation of powers. House managers spoke for--I know we  have had disagreements on the time. It was 21 hours or 23 hours. They  spoke during their time--a lot of time--most of it attacking the  President, policy decisions. They didn't like what they heard. They  didn't like there was a pause on foreign aid.   I have laid out before that there were pauses on all kinds of foreign  aid. He is not the first President to do it.   But the one thing I am still trying to understand from the managers'  perspective--and maybe it is not fair to ask the managers because you  are not the leader of the House. But remember the whole idea that this  was a dire national security threat, a danger to our Nation, and we had  to get this over here right away. It had to be done before Christmas.  It was so important; it was so significant; the country was in such  jeopardy; the jeopardy was so serious that it had to be done  immediately.   Let's hold on to the Articles of Impeachment for a month to see if  the House could force the Senate to adopt rules that they wanted, which  is not the way the Constitution is set up.   But it was such a dire emergency, it was so critical for our Nation's  national interests, that we could hold them for 33 days. Danger,  danger, danger. That is politics.   As I said, you are being called upon to remove the duly elected  President of the United States. That is what these Articles of  Impeachment call for.   They never really answered the question of why they thought there was  such a national emergency. Maybe they will during questions; I don't  know. If there was such a national emergency, they never did explain  why it was that they waited. They certainly didn't wait to have the  proceedings, as my colleagues have laid out; I mean, those proceedings  moved in record time. I suspect that we have been here more than the  House actually considered the actual Articles of Impeachment.   Is that the way the Constitution is supposed to work? Is that the  design of the Constitution?   And then their question, of course, came up yesterday on the whole  situation with Burisma and the Bidens and that whole issue, and my  colleague went through that a great deal, and I am not going to do  that.   But do we have a--we used to call this, in free speech cases, like a  free speech zone. You could have your free speech activities over here;  you can't have them over there. Do you we have like a Biden-free zone?  Was that was this was? You mention someone or you are concerned about a  company, and it is now off limits? You can impeach the President of the  United States for asking a question? I think we significantly showed  the question.   I am not going to go through a detail-by-detail analysis of the  facts, but there are some that we just have to go through.   You heard a lot of new facts yesterday in our presentation. On  Saturday, what we were pointing to was a very quick overview, and then  yesterday we spent the day--and we appreciate everybody's patience on  that--going through the facts: They showed you this, but they didn't  show you that.   The facts are important, though, because facts have legal  ramifications; legal ramifications impact the decisions you make. So I  don't take facts lightly, and I certainly don't take the constitutional  mandate lightly, and we can't.   The facts we demonstrated yesterday and briefly on Saturday  demonstrate that there was, in fact, a proper governmental interest in  the questions that the President asked and the issues that the  President raised on that phone call.   A phone call--now, let's--again, put your feet in the shoes of the  President. Put yourself in the President's position. Do you think he  thought, when he was on the call, it was him and President Zelensky he  was talking to, and that was it? Or as I heard one commentator say it  was--people listening in on the call--the President and 3,000 of his  closest friends.   Let's be realistic. The President of the United States knew, when he  was on that call, there were a lot of people listening from our side  and from their side. So he knew what he was saying. He said it. We  released a transcript of it.   The facts on the call that have been kind of the focus of all of this  really focused on foreign policy initiatives both in Ukraine and around  the globe. They talked about other countries. The President has been  very concerned about other countries carrying some of the financial  load here, not just the United States. That is a legitimate position  for a President to take. If you disagree with it, you have the right to  do that, but he is the President. As my colleague Deputy White House  Counsel Philbin just said, that is the executive branch prerogative.  That is their constitutional, appropriate role.    So the call is well documented. There were lots of people on the  call. The person that would be on the other end of the quid pro quo, if  it existed, would have been President Zelensky. But President  Zelensky--and we already laid out the other officials from Ukraine--has  repeatedly said there was no pressure. It was a good call. They didn't  even know there was a pause in  [[Page S624]]  the aid. All of that is well documented. I am not going to go through  each and every one of those facts. We did that over the last several  days.   President Zelensky's senior adviser, Andriy Yermak, was asked if he  ever felt there was a connection between military aid and the request  for investigations, and he was adamant that ``We never had that  feeling'' and ``We did not have the feeling that this aid was connected  to any one specific issue.'' This is coming from the people who were  receiving the aid.   So we talk about this whole quid pro quo, and that was a big issue.  That is how this--actually, before it became an impeachment proceeding,  there was--as the proceedings were beginning in the House Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence under Chairman Schiff's role, there  were all these discussions: Is it a quid pro quo? Was it extortion? Was  it bribery? What was it?   And we are clear in our position that there was no quid pro quo. But  then yesterday, my cocounsel, Professor Alan Dershowitz, explained last  night that these articles must be rejected--he was talking about from a  constitutional framework--even if it was a quid pro quo, which we have  clearly established there was not.   And this is what he said, and I am going to quote it verbatim:         The claim that foreign policy decisions can be deemed       abuses of power based on subjective opinions about mixed or       sole motives that the President was interested only in       helping himself demonstrate the dangers of employing the       vague, subjective, and politically malleable phrase ``abuse       of power'' as a constitutionally permissible criteria for the       removal of a President.    He went on to say:         Now, it follows from this that if a President--any       President--were to have done what ``The Times'' reported       about the content of John Bolton's manuscript, that would not       constitute an impeachable offense.    I am quoting exactly from Professor Dershowitz. He said:         Let me repeat it. Nothing in the Bolton revelations, even       if true--    Even if true.       would rise to the level of abuse of power or an impeachable       offense. That is clear from history. That is clear from the       language of the Constitution. You cannot turn conduct that is       not impeachable into impeachable conduct simply by using       words like ``quid pro quo'' and ``personal benefit.''        It is inconceivable that the Framers would have intended so       politically loaded and promiscuously deployed a term as       ``abuse of power'' to be weaponized--    Again, Professor Dershowitz.       as a tool of impeachment. It is precisely the kind of vague,       open-ended, and subjective term Framers feared and rejected.    Now, to be specific: You cannot impeach a President on an unsourced  allegation. But what Professor Dershowitz was saying is that even if  everything in there is true, it constitutionally doesn't rise to that  level.   But I want to be clear on this because there is a lot of speculation  out there with regard to what John Bolton has said, which referenced a  number of individuals. We will start with the President. Here is what  the President said in response to that New York Times piece:         I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied       to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. In       fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very       public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to       sell a book.    The Department of Justice.         While the Department of Justice has not reviewed Mr.       Bolton's manuscript, the New York Times' account of his       conversation grossly mischaracterizes what Attorney General       Barr and Bolton discussed.        There was no discussion of ``personal favors'' or ``undue       influence'' on investigations, nor did Attorney General Barr       state that the President's conversations with foreign leaders       were improper.    The Vice President's chief of staff issued a statement:         In every conversation with the President and the Vice       President, in preparation for our trip to Poland--    Remember, that was the trip that was being planned for the meeting  with President Zelensky.       the President consistently expressed his frustration that the       United States was bearing the lion's share of responsibility       for aid to Ukraine and that European nations weren't doing       their part.        The President also expressed concerns about corruption in       Ukraine, and at no time did I hear him tie Ukraine aid to       investigations into the Biden family or Burisma.    That was the response responding to an unpublished manuscript that  maybe some reporters have an idea of maybe what it says. I mean, that  is what the evidence--if you want to call that evidence. I don't know  what you call that. I would call it inadmissible, but that is what it  is.   To argue that the President is not acting in our national interest  and is violating his oath of office, which the managers have put  forward, is wrong based on the facts and the way the Constitution is  designed.   When you look at the fullness of the record of their witnesses--their  witnesses--the witnesses' statements, the transcripts--there is one  thing that emerged: There is no violation of law. There is no violation  of the Constitution. There is a disagreement on policy decisions.   Most of those who spoke at your hearings did not like the President's  policy. That is why we have elections. That is where policy  differentials and differences are discussed. But to have a removal of a  duly elected President based on policy differences is not what the  Framers intended.   If you lower the bar that way, danger, danger, danger, because the  next President or the one after that--he or she would be held to that  same standard. I hope not. I pray that is not what happens, not just  for the sake of my client but for the Constitution. Professor  Dershowitz gave a list of Presidents, from Washington to where we are  today, who, under the standard that they are proposing, could be  subject to abuse of power or obstruction of Congress.   We know that this is not about a President pausing aid to Ukraine. It  is really not about the law. It is about a lot of attempts on policy  disagreements that are not being debated here. My goodness, how much  time--how much time has been spent in the House of Representatives  hoping? They were hoping that the Mueller probe would result in--I  mean, I am not going to play all the--I was thinking about it, playing  all the clips from all the commentators the day after Bob Mueller  testified. Bob Mueller was unable to answer, under his examination,  basic and fundamental questions. He had to correct himself, actually.  He had to correct himself before the Senate for something that he said  before the House. So that is what the President has been living with.   And we are today arguing about what? A phone call to Ukraine or  Ukraine aid being held or a question about corruption or a question  about corruption that happened to involve a high-profile public figure?  Is that what this is? Is that where we are?   Then what do we find out? The aid was released. It was released in an  orderly fashion. The reform President, President Zelensky, wins, but  there was a question on whether his party would take the Parliament. It  did. They worked late into the evening with the desire to put forward  reforms. So everybody was waiting, including--and you heard the  testimony from, I will say, their witnesses--you heard the testimony-- everybody was concerned about Ukraine. Everybody was concerned about  whether these reforms could actually take place. Everybody was  concerned about it. So you hold back.   It didn't affect anything that was going on in the field. We heard  Mr. Crow worrying about the soldiers. I understand that, I appreciate  that, but none of that aid was affecting what was going on in the  battlefield right then or for the next 4 months because it was future  aid. Are we having an impeachment proceeding because aid came out 3  weeks before the end of the fiscal year, for a 6-minute phone call? You  boil it down, that is what this is.   It is interesting to me that everybody said: Well, the aid was  finally released September 11 only because of the committee and the  whistleblower we have never seen. Mr. Philbin dealt with that in great  detail. I am not going to go over that again. But, you know, the new  high court, the anti-corruption court, wasn't established and did not  sit until September 5, 2019. So while the President of Ukraine was  trying to get reforms put in place, the court that was going to decide  corruption issues was not set until September 5.   I want you to think about this for a moment too. They needed a high  court of corruption for corruption. Think  [[Page S625]]  about that for a moment. Now, it is good that they recognized it, but  remember when I said the other day that you don't wave a magic wand and  now Ukraine doesn't have a corruption problem? The high court of  corruption, which they have to have because it is not just past  corruption--they are concerned about ongoing corruption issues.   You could put all of your witnesses back under oath in the next  hearings you will have when this is all over, and you are going to be  back in the House and you are going to be doing this again, putting  them all back under oath, and ask them, Mr. Schiff, is there a problem  with corruption in Ukraine? If they get up there and say: No.  Everything is great now, hallelujah--but I suspect they are going to  say: We are working really hard on it. But this idea that it has just  vanished and now we are back into ``everything is fine'' is absurd.   Mr. Morrison testified that while the developments were taking place,  the Vice President also met with President Zelensky in Warsaw. That was  the meeting of September 1--the one, by the way, where the Vice  President's Office said in response to this New York Times article that  nobody told him about aid being held or linked to investigations.   Are you going to stop--are you going to allow proceedings on  impeachment to go from a New York Times report about someone that says  what they hear is in a manuscript? Is that where we are? I don't think  so. I hope not.    What did Morrison say? You heard firsthand that the new Ukraine  administration was taking concrete steps to address corruption. That is  good. He advised the President that the relationship with Zelensky is  one that could be trusted. Good.   President Zelensky also agreed with Vice President Pence--this is  interesting--that the Europeans should be doing more and related to  Vice President Pence conversations he had been having with European  leaders about getting them to do more.   In sum, the President raised two issues he was concerned with to get  them addressed.   Now I have already gone over--again, this is just the closing moments  here of our portion of this proceeding. Aid was withheld or paused, put  on a pause button not just for Ukraine but for Afghanistan, South  Korea, El Salvador, Guatemala, Lebanon, and Pakistan. I am sure I am  leaving countries out. But do you think the American people are  concerned if the President says: You know, before we give a country, I  don't know, $550 million--some countries, only $400 million--we would  like to know what they are doing with it. You are supposed to be the  guardians of the trust here. It is the taxpayers' money we are  spending.   There was a lot of testimony from Dr. Fiona Hill, John Bolton's  deputy. Here is what she said about aid that was being held. This was  her testimony: There was a freeze put on all kinds of aid and  assistance because it was in the process at the time of an awful lot of  reviews of foreign assistance.   Oh, you mean there was a policy within the administration to review  foreign assistance and how we are doing it because we spend a lot of  money?   By the way, I am not complaining about the money. I don't think  anybody doesn't want to help. But we do need to know what is going on,  and those are valid and important questions.   Manager Crow told you that the President's Ukraine policy was not  strong against Russia, but Ambassador Yovanovitch stated the exact  opposite. She said in her deposition that our country's Ukraine policy  under President Trump actually--her words--``got stronger'' than it was  under President Obama.   So, again, policy disagreements. Disagreements on approach. Have  elections. That is what we do in our Republic.   For 3 long days, House managers presented their case by selectively  showing parts of testimony. Good lawyers show parts of testimony. You  don't have to show the whole thing. But other good lawyers show the  rest of the testimony. And that is what we sought to do to give you a  fuller view of what we saw as the glaring omissions by my colleagues,  the House managers.   The legal issues here are the constitutional ones, and I have been I  think pretty clear over the last week, starting when we had the motions  arguments, in my concern about the constitutional obligations that we  are operating under. I have been critical of Manager Nadler's  ``executive privilege and other nonsense.''   I want you to look at it this way. Take out executive privilege;  First Amendment free speech and other nonsense; the free exercise of  religion and other nonsense; the right to due process and other  nonsense; the right of equal protection under the law and other  nonsense. You can't start doing that. You would not do that. No  administration has done that, in fact, since the first administration,  George Washington. They wanted information. He thought it was  privileged. He said it was executive privilege.   Let's not start calling constitutional rights ``other nonsense'' and  lumping them together. This is from the House of Representatives that  actually believes the attorney/client privilege doesn't apply, which  should scare every lawyer in Washington, DC, but more scary for their  clients. They say that in writing, in letters. They don't hide it.   I would ask them--I am not going to; it is not my privilege to do  that--do you really believe that? Do you really believe that the  attorney/client privilege does not apply in a congressional hearing? Do  you really believe that? Because if that is what is believed or  implied, then there is no attorney/client privilege--or is that the  attorney/client privilege and other nonsense? Danger, danger, danger.   We believe that article I fails constitutionally. The President has  constitutional authority to engage in and conduct foreign policy and  foreign affairs. It is our position legally--the President at all times  acted with perfect legal authority, inquired of matters in our national  interest, and, having received assurances of those matters, continued  his policy that his administration put forward of what really is  unprecedented support for Ukraine, including the delivery of a military  aid package that was denied to the Ukrainians by the prior  administration.   Some of the managers right here, my colleagues at the other table,  voted in favor of those--wanted Javelin anti-tank missiles for Ukraine.  Some of the Members here did not, didn't want to do that, voted against  that. I am glad we gave it to them. I am glad we allowed them to  purchase Javelins.   I never served in the military. I have tremendous, tremendous respect  for the men and women who protect our freedom. I have tremendous  respect for what they are doing and continue to do.   This President actually allowed the Javelins to go. Some of you liked  that idea; some of you did not. Policy difference. Were you going to  impeach President Obama because he did not give them lethal aid? No.  Nor should you. You should not do that. It is a policy difference.  Policy differences do not rise to the level of constitutionally  mandated or constitutional applications for removal from office. It is  policy differences.   By the way, it is not just on lethal weapons; President Obama, as I  said, withheld aid. He had the right to do that. You have allowed him  to do that.    Oh, but we don't like that this President did it, so the rules  change. So this President's rules are different than--he has a  different set of standards he has to apply than what you allowed the  previous administrations to apply. And you know what--or the future  administrations to apply. That is the problem with these articles.   We have laid out, I believe, a compelling case on what the  Constitution requires. When they were in the House of Representatives  putting this together, did they go through a constitutionally mandated  accommodation process to see if there was a way to come up with  something? No, they did not. Did they run to court? No. And the one  time it was about to happen, they ran the other way.   Separation of powers means something. It is not separation of powers  and other nonsense. If we have reached now, at this very moment in the  history of our Republic, a bar of impeachment because you don't like  the President's policies or you don't like the  [[Page S626]]  way he undertook those policies--because we heard a lot about policy.  If partisan impeachment is now the rule of the day, which these Members  and Members of this Senate said should never be the rule of the day--my  goodness, they said it--some of them--5 months ago, but then we had the  national emergency, a phone call. It is an emergency, except we will  just wait.   But if partisan impeachment based on policy disagreements, which is  what this is, and personal presumptions or newspaper reports and  allegations in an unsourced--maybe this is in somebody's book who is no  longer at the White House--if that becomes the new norm, future  Presidents, Democrats and Republicans, will be paralyzed the moment  they are elected, before they can even take the oath of office. The bar  for impeachment cannot be set this low.   Majority Leader McConnell, Democratic Leader Schumer, House managers,  Members of the Senate--danger, danger, danger. These articles must be  rejected. The Constitution requires it. Justice demands it.   We would ask the majority leader for a short recess, if we can, about  15 minutes.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                                    Recess
