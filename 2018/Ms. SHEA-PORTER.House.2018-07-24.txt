 Mr. Speaker, I would like to read an op-ed from  former EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman, who worked for Richard  Nixon and George Bush:         President Trump's disgraceful performance in Helsinki,       Finland, and, in the days since, is an indication that he is       not fit to remain in office. Trump's 2016 ``America First''       platform might be more aptly named ``Russia First'' after the       disaster that occurred last week.        Trump's turn toward Russia is indefensible. I am a lifelong       Republican. I have campaigned and won as a member of the       party, and I have served more than one Republican President.       My Republican colleagues--once rightfully critical of       President Obama's engagement strategy with Russia leader       Vladimir Putin--have to end their willful ignorance of the       damage Trump is doing, both domestically and internationally.       We must put aside the GOP label, as hard as that may be, and       demonstrate the leadership our country needs by calling on       the President to step down.        Trump's sycophantic relationship with Putin is unsurprising       given his previous comments about Russia and its dictator.       What is shocking is how long he has possessed, and       disregarded, hard evidence of Putin's direct role in       undermining our elections. According to New York Times       reporting, he saw dispositive emails and texts early in       January 2017.        Trump's repeated public dismissals of the intelligence       coming from his own deputies is deeply disturbing. Along with       his walk back  [[Page H7093]]       of statements last week, and then walking back the walk       backs, it's impossible to keep up, and his behavior warrants       a fresh evaluation of whether the President can be trusted       with the future of the United States.        His apologists will argue that the current outcry is just       another attempt by moderates and ``establishment''       Republicans to discredit the President. But what does this       man have to say or do for his supporters to finally see that       his actions are detrimental to the country?        We must put aside the GOP label, as hard as that may be,       and demonstrate the leadership our country needs.        Trump's avowed respect for the word of a dictator who has       spent decades undermining the U.S. and its allies is utterly       dangerous. Putin is not our ally. Despite the President's       dismal attempt to change the narrative by explaining that he       misspoke in Helsinki, the pattern is clear: As a candidate       and as President, he has constantly praised Putin just as he       has constantly undercut the core of our democracy: the       courts, the media, and the FBI. He has a history of       discrediting members of his own Cabinet and the agencies they       lead. These are not the actions of someone who should be       navigating delicate diplomatic discussions and setting       foreign policy.        If the President did genuinely misspeak on Monday, it       demonstrates his inability to articulate accurately U.S.       foreign policy at the highest level, for the highest stakes.       As the leader of the free world--as ridiculous as that title       sounds when applied to Trump--his words matter. If he cannot       take his place at a podium next to an adversarial foreign       leader and stand up for America's interests and principles,       he should not be President.        Trump has alienated our true allies in Europe and       undermined the United States' reputation as a consistent,       reliable moral force for good in the world. He disdains       democracies and admires dictatorships. What appears to matter       to him is not what leaders represent but how they flatter       him. North Korea's Kim Jong Un and Putin have cracked that       code and fan Trump's ego in a way that respected heads of       state do not.        Yet many Republicans continue to defend him. In this       election year, opposing Trump is risky for GOP candidates.       Invoking the need to choose country over party is an overused       trope. But it is essential now.        The Republican majority in Congress can fully implement       promised sanctions against Russia to show its opposition to       Russia's meddling in our election. Putin needs economic       growth in Russia because it benefits the oligarchy. Tougher,       tangible sanctions would weaken him and hurt those who       benefit from his power. House Speaker Paul Ryan indicated       earlier this week that additional sanctions were on the       table. This would be a start.        Congress can also ensure that the Robert S. Mueller, III,       investigation is not compromised. Any interference in it       after this week should raise many red flags. The special       counsel and his team, who, despite the President's attacks,       show every sign of unbiased professionalism, need to finish       their work without tampering.        Finally, even if the Russian efforts to undermine State       voting systems were unsuccessful in 2016, this is a       vulnerability that may be exploited in the future. With the       help of Congress, States must strengthen their processes       and security to stop future meddling from Russia or other       foreign actors.        Republican voters, including those who supported Donald       Trump, have the obligation to demand action from their       elected officials. Vocal opposition is expected from       Democrats, but it is Republicans' disapproval that will have       the most sway on Capitol Hill and at the White House.        Those Members of the party in Congress who have stood up to       the President should be commended. More must follow, with       more than private talk and tepid tweets. Only bold leadership       can put the United States back on a path that values freedom       and democracy, and truly puts America first.                            ____________________
