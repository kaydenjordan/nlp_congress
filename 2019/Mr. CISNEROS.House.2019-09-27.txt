 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the incredible  performance of schools and students in the 39th Congressional District  in California.   Yesterday, the Department of Education recognized 362 schools across  the country as National Blue Ribbon Schools for their academic  excellence. I am proud to say that two schools in my district have  received that honor: Acacia Elementary School and Robert C. Fisler  Elementary School in Fullerton.   This recognition is a testament to the outstanding work of the  teachers, faculty, staff, students, and families who, together, create  a culture of success at our schools.  [[Page H8075]]    Additionally, I want to congratulate the students at the Placentia- Yorba Linda Unified School District for their 84 percent pass rate on  their advanced placement, or AP, exams, one of the highest averages in  the Nation. They were included in the prestigious Advanced  Placement District Honor Roll. Less than 3 percent of school districts  across the country have received this honor.    As a longtime education advocate, it is with immense pride that I  stand here able to recognize these schools and their students for their  achievements. All of these schools and students are shining examples of  academic excellence in the 39th Congressional District, worthy of their  national distinction.   I ask my colleagues to join me in offering my sincerest  congratulations.                            ____________________
