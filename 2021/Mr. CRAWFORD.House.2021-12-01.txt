 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for  hosting this Special Order.   Madam Speaker, I stand today alongside my colleagues, my  constituents, and millions of Americans in support of life and in  defense of the democratic process.   Human life begins at conception. Just 5 weeks into a pregnancy, an  unborn baby's heart begins to beat. At 10 weeks, they have fingers and  toes.   However, for 48 years, the Roe v. Wade decision has trampled on the  democratic process and the unborn.   Since the 1973 decision, over 62 million abortions have been  performed. That is over 1 million per year. This is a disgraceful  attack on human life.   It is imperative that the legislative powers to make laws, especially  of this magnitude, be vested in the people's representatives and not  nine unelected judges.   Arkansans and citizens across this Nation want to protect life, but  their hands have been tied by the Supreme Court.   I urge the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade and Planned  Parenthood v. Casey. It is time to return the abortion debate back to  where it belongs, with the people.
