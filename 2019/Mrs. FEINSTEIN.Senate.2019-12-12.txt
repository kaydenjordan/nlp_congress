 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Small  Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 2019''.   This bill would prevent future tragedies like the one that happened  onboard the Conception passenger vessel off the coast of Santa Cruz  Island, California. This was the worst maritime disaster in modern  California history, and my thoughts continue to be with the victims and  their loved ones.   On September 2, 2019, thirty-four people were tragically killed  onboard the vessel when a fire started while passengers were sleeping  below deck after a nighttime swim. The victims of the boat fire-- thirty-three passengers and one crewmember--were athletes, immigrants,  CEO's, and students. All were united by love of the water, marine life,  and their adventurous spirit.   The Conception boat fire was a tragedy that must never be allowed to  happen again. Reports indicate the fire consumed the boat, including  the salon, galley compartment, and the aft deck, and causes include  overloading of the electric system, possibly from rechargeable devices  with lithium ion batteries. The lack of an interconnected fire alarm  system throughout the vessel meant passengers and crew were not made  aware of the fire until key areas of escape were already engulfed.  Critical time--time that could have saved lives--was lost. This bill  addresses these issues and potential causes.   While investigations by the National Transportation Safety Board and  the Coast Guard are still ongoing, it is  [[Page S7030]]  clear regulatory changes are needed to ensure small passenger vessels  have the right safety measures in place to limit the possibility of  fire and help evacuate the vessel of passengers in the event a fire  does start.   The Conception is one of about 325 small passenger vessels built  before 1996 and exempt from stricter safety standards imposed on newer  vessels.   This bill offers a number of common-sense provisions that will  improve passenger vessel safety. These include: requiring these types  of vessels to have no less than two avenues of escape from all areas  accessible to passengers; mandating safety standards for the handling,  storage and operation of lithium ion batteries; and, establishing  standards for interconnected fire alarm systems.   I appreciate the hard work of the National Transportation Safety  Board and the U.S. Coast Guard Inspections and Compliance Directorate.  I especially appreciate the Commandant's Marine Safety Information  Bulletin issued on September 10 reminding owners, operators and masters  of passenger vessels to adhere to the regulations related to  firefighting, lifesaving, emergency preparation and means of escape.  And, more specifically, I appreciate the attention to the issue of  unsupervised charging of lithium-ion batteries and the extensive use of  power strips and extension cords.   Given the horrific nature of this tragedy, it is imperative that we  establish stricter safety standards onboard these boats where so many  children and families have such enjoyment. I believe this bill is a  pragmatic, commonsense solution to improve safety on these older  vessels, and I urge it to be included in the Coast Guard  Reauthorization Act.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Sinema):   S. 3048.
