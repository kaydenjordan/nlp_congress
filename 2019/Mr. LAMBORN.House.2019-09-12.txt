 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize our newest  combatant command: U.S. Space Command, which was stood up on Monday in  Colorado Springs.   President Trump's decision to stand up SPACECOM could not be more  timely. In recent years, Russia and China have reorganized their  militaries and  [[Page H7671]]  pursued capabilities to threaten our space assets. Fortunately, our  Nation has no shortage of innovative and brilliant men and women in  uniform.   Our newest combatant command will harness the creative dynamo of  these space warfighters. Congress will give them the authorities and  funding they need to triumph in this newest contest of arms. With the  infrastructure, industrial base, and personnel already located at  Peterson and Schriever Air Force Bases in Colorado Springs, SPACECOM  can seamlessly transition into a fully functioning combatant command  immediately. This is a great and exciting milestone for our Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, environmentally responsible development of  ANWR will increase America's energy security and independence, create  jobs, and provide affordable, reliable energy for consumers while  providing much-needed revenue to both the State of Alaska and the  Federal Government.   While congressional authorization is required by law for any leasing  in ANWR, I, along with my Republican colleagues on the Natural  Resources Committee, believe that Alaska Natives should be able to  exercise their right to develop minerals on their lands if they so  choose.   As the gentleman from Alaska has pointed out, Native Alaskans who  actually live within ANWR fully support responsible development of  their local energy resources.   Who do we listen to? The people who actually live there or extreme  environmental activists here in Washington?   The oil and gas sector has historically served as a significant  source of employment, revenue, and reliable energy for Alaska and  Alaska Natives, and supports over 110,000 direct and indirect jobs.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to oppose this legislation,  which, fortunately, will never become law.
