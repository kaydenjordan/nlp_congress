 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to thank Donald and Sharon  Campbell, who have actively volunteered for more than a dozen years at  the Valatie Ecumenical Food Pantry, a ministry of the Ichabod Crane  Clergy Association in Columbia County.   With Don serving as chairman from 2006 to 2017, the leadership of  these two honorable individuals has enabled the food pantry to serve  hundreds of families in northern Columbia County. Utilizing grants,  community donations, local farms and markets, the Campbells have truly  supported their less-fortunate neighbors, enabling those folks to  better support their families and loved ones.   Don and Sharon's efforts extend beyond the food pantry, aiding many  other charitable pursuits in our community. We thank them as well as  the volunteers of the Valatie Ecumenical Food Pantry for their gracious  service to our Columbia County community.                            ____________________
