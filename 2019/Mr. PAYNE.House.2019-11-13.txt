 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize November as  American Diabetes Month.   It is a personal issue for me, as I am one of 30 million Americans  living with diabetes. This number is set to rise significantly. There  are an estimated 84 million Americans with prediabetes, and it is the  seventh leading cause of death in the U.S. In addition, people with  diabetes are twice as likely to have heart disease or a stroke.   The CDC estimates diabetes costs this country almost $330 billion per  year.   I hope my colleagues can spread the word about diabetes this month.  We need to do all we can to stop this deadly disease.                            ____________________
