 You keep going for 2 minutes. I will let you know.    Thank you.    Mr. President, first, I want to thank the Senator from  Oklahoma for, as usual, his courtesy, which I very much appreciate.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the CARES Act passed the Senate on March  27, 2020. It was a rare moment in bipartisanship--a legislative triumph  that saved our country from disaster in the very early days of the  pandemic. As you know, I sat and negotiated a great deal of that with  Secretary of State Mnuchin. And we all agreed it did a lot of good--a  lot of good. But, unfortunately, for the past 259 days, as the virus  continued to spread--when we did the CARES Act, we thought, well, maybe  COVID will be over by the summer. Everyone thought that, but obviously  it wasn't. And so the virus has continued to spread. Thousands of small  businesses have closed their doors for good. Tens of millions of  Americans lost their jobs and livelihoods. As American families waited  in 21st century bread lines, cars snaking for miles down American  highways; as tens of millions of Americans fell behind on the rent and  the mortgage and face eviction; as 15 million Americans got sick; and  as 292,001 Americans died, the Senate Republican majority, led by the  majority leader, made sure the Senate could not do anything of  significance to help the American people.   May, June, July, August--pause; we don't need to do anything, said  the leader. Let's wait and see what happens. Democrats didn't say that.  The leader did. Waited and waited and waited. Now it is December, and  we still, because of the leader's intransigence, have nothing of  significance to help the American people during the worst economic  crisis in 75 years and the greatest public health crisis in a century.   Why? Why can't we get together? Why can't there be the bipartisanship  that Americans search for and yearn for? At a time of such great  crisis, there is one reason why America's two major parties have not  gotten together during the time of acute national emergency, and that  is because the Republican leader has demanded a partisan poison pill--a  sweeping corporate liability shield--be included in any legislation.  Otherwise, he won't let it pass.   It sounds like an exaggeration, but that is what the leader has said.  ``We're not negotiating over liability protection,'' the leader said,  on July 28.         I'll be responsible for putting the final agreement on the       floor. And as I said, it will have liability protection in       it. We're not negotiating with the Democrats over that.    That is the fact. That is the history. There is not equality here.   Finally, yesterday, as the bipartisan group of Senators and House  Members were closing in on a final agreement, what happened? Yesterday,  the Republican leader's team told the other congressional leaders that  the bipartisan group would be unable to satisfy Senate Republicans.  Why? Because it might not grant the exact sweeping liability  protections for corporations that Leader McConnell has demanded. It is  an unconscionable position. No relief for the American people unless  corporations receive blanket immunity from lawsuits.  [[Page S7436]]    That particular poison pill that has foiled bipartisan agreement for  more than 8 months is the nub of the problem. If we could just get past  that, if the Republican leader would only back off maximalist demands  on corporate immunity, we could get something done. I mean it. We could  actually get something done.   Now, I know the Republican leader will say: Wait a minute, Democrats  have partisan demands of their own, like providing assistance to save  State and local services. But to equate State and local aid--money for  policemen and firefighters, busdrivers, sanitation workers--to complete  corporate immunity is a false equivalence. We know the two policies are  not equivalent.   First of all, there is broad bipartisan support for State and local  aid. It is not a Democratic demand. Many Republicans support it too.  There are bipartisan bills on the floor of the Senate demanding $500  billion in aid for the States. There are Governors--Democrats and  Republicans--sending letters to all of us saying we need money; we need  help. But the leader's corporate immunity provision doesn't have the  support of a Democrat. Not a single person voted for it. It is  expressly partisan. There is not equivalence.   I know the media likes to say, on the one hand, on the other. There  is not equivalence here. One is helping people who desperately need  help. The other is a partisan demand that has been around for a long  time that simply does not get bipartisan support.   State and local aid is a solution to a real and urgent problem.  Corporate immunity from lawsuits is not. They are not equivalent. State  and local budgets are deeply in the red. Since the beginning of the  pandemic, State and municipalities have laid off 1.3 million public  employees--firefighters, police, first responders, teachers. We are  talking about jobs--jobs--in red States as well as blue States.   The leader likes to cite one statistic about tax revenue in one blue  State to argue that no State--no State deserves Federal aid, not  Wyoming or Alaska, North Dakota, that have each seen sharp declines in  tax revenue; not Florida or Nevada or Louisiana, that depend on tourism  and face revenue declines of 10 percent or more.   State and local aid is a real and urgent problem. It is not abstract.  It is people, and it is workers. PPP that helps small businesses--one  of its main rationales, an important one, something I agree with-- prevents workers who work for small businesses from being laid off.  What is the difference between a worker being laid off by a small  business because they don't have funding or a worker being laid off  from a State and local government because they don't have funding?  There is no difference. There is no difference.   The leader's corporate immunity provision, on the other hand, is a  solution, ideological, in search of a problem. Almost a year into this  pandemic--15 million Americans infected, 290,000 lives lost to COVID- 19--there have been only 23 personal injury suits from exposure to the  coronavirus--23 in the entire country, over the entire year. And that  is why Senate Republicans can't reach a bipartisan agreement to help  the unemployed, feed the hungry, fund a vaccine, or support our  schools?   Corporations that want protection from a few dozen lawsuits is  equivalent to millions of workers from State and local governments  being laid off? Give me a break. Again, there are a few States that  don't need the help, but many more States do--many more.   This is mind-boggling. The Republican leadership is blocking a  solution for the entire country until they get a favor for corporations  who don't even need it. The American people, all of us, are sick of  this ridiculous gamesmanship by the majority leader.   We need to come together. We need to get something done. The American  people deserve an outcome. It is not going to happen if the Republican  majority insists on getting 100 percent of its partisan demands   I yield the floor.   I, once again, thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his courtesy.
