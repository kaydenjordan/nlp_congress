 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time.   Mr. Speaker, 2 minutes is not enough time to describe the fog of war.  Two minutes is not enough time to describe a level of heroism that  occurred more than half a century ago over the waters of North Korea.   But today, one of the amendments en bloc will, in fact, recognize for  the Congressional Medal of Honor the unsung hero of that war. Royce  Williams, who took on six MiGs of superior capability all by himself,  and defended the entire fleet on behalf of himself, came home to his  aircraft carrier with over 200 holes in his aircraft, landed it at  almost twice the speed that aircraft would be able to land, and his  record was impounded in secrecy and classified for decades.   Only now, after the Soviet Union fell, can we begin to understand his  heroism and his success.   Today, on behalf of all the members of the San Diego delegation of  both parties who support this amendment, on behalf of the more than 100  flag officers who have signed on recommending that he receive the Medal  of Honor, I am proud to say that it has been ruled in order, and I  thank all those involved in bringing it to the floor.
