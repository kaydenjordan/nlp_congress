 Mr. President, as a senior member and former  chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, each month I recognize and celebrate the American  entrepreneurial spirit by highlighting the success of a small business  in my home State of Idaho. Today I am pleased to honor Emsi Burning  Glass in Moscow as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for July 2021.   Emsi Burning Glass, initially named Emsi, is a labor market analytics  company founded by economists Hank Robison and Kjell Christophersen in  2001 that specializes in providing labor market data, analytics, and  consulting services for higher education institutions, private  enterprises, and workforce development agencies. One of the company's  initial goals was to provide at least 50 high-paying jobs to the Moscow  community. It has since surpassed that goal and employs 280 people.   Since its founding, the company has achieved outstanding success and  now has clients throughout the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United  States. The business has become one of the fastest growing companies in  Moscow, and its success has enabled it to provide hundreds of quality  jobs in the region and further invest in the local community. In 2019,  Emsi announced it would construct a new 3.7-acre campus that will allow  it to hire hundreds of new software developers, engineers, data  scientists, economists, sales representatives, and other high-paying  positions.   The company's success has not gone unnoticed. In June 2021, Emsi  announced a merger with Burning Glass, a fellow labor market analytics  firm in Boston and its name was formally changed to Emsi Burning Glass.  The merger will allow the company to continue its growth in Moscow  while expanding its presence in the global marketplace.   Congratulations to all of the employees of Emsi Burning Glass on  being selected as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for July 2021.  You make our great State proud, and I look forward to your continued  growth and success.                            ____________________
