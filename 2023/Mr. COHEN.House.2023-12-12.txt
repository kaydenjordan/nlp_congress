 Madam Speaker, it has been said that everything has been  said, but not everybody has said it. Everything really has been said. I  have heard such great oratory from such passionate, patriotic speakers.  What is clear is we have a duty as the leader of democracy in the world  to support our friends and to fight for democracy in Ukraine where they  are defending democracy and keeping us from having to go in. If Putin  wins and gets into a NATO country, saving our soldiers' blood and  lives--and that will happen. In Israel, where a similar foe, Hamas like  Russia, knows no limits, is threatening the existence of Israel.   I know the Speaker believes that we should support Israel. When he  was first elected, he went to the podium and said we will support  Israel, but later he said we will only support Israel if we cut $15  billion from the IRS and the budget, which would lose us $85 billion  overall. That is fiscally foolish and morally wrong.   Israel should be supported unconditionally and so should Ukraine--two  valiant countries whose existence has been threatened. These are  existential fights for Israel and for Ukraine. What happened in Bucha  right after the war started before the Ukrainians were able to repel  the Russians was similar to what happened on October 7 in Israel-- murders, rapes, crime.   If we allow Russia to win, which we will if we don't support Ukraine,  there will be ten times the devastation of what happened on October 7  in Israel to happen to the women and the children of Ukraine because  Russians have showed they have no respect for women, morality, or  mankind.   Madam Speaker, I urge Speaker Johnson to put these bills on the floor  to support Ukraine, to support Israel, to support Taiwan, to support  democracy, and to support human relief in Gaza for people who have been  innocent victims. Please put these bills on the floor and let us do  what America needs to do.
