 Is it still a requirement that you have to make a case that  it is a virus or COVID-related reason for voting by proxy?    Madam Speaker, in December 1992, my friend, Lewis Chitengwa,  defeated Tiger Woods in a tournament called the Orange Bowl in Florida.   A year later, my friend, Lewis Chitengwa, was denied entrance and  asked to go into the back where the caddies go in when he went to the  South African Amateur Championship. He went on to win that tournament,  becoming the first Black man to win the South African Amateur.   Unfortunately, 20 years ago this Wednesday, my friend, Lewis, my  brother in Christ, my teammate at the University of Virginia, went to  see the Lord when he passed away from viral meningitis.   My teammates will be regaling his life this Wednesday. I am going to  take to the floor for a Special Order in July to talk more about this  man, who was ultimately inducted into the Hall of Fame in South Africa  with a speech from the famous Gary Player.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for his  conviction and his dedication to this issue and getting us this  opportunity for all of us to share that.   I appreciate the remarks from my friend, the gentleman from Kentucky.  I couldn't agree more about how offensive what we heard from the  President of the United States with respect to our Second Amendment  protected rights; and then coming in and talking about the foolishness  of our desire to have our Second Amendment rights protected when, in  fact, we would be up against F-15s and potential nuclear weapons.   Imagine the absurdity of having the President of the United States  say that.   Meanwhile, I live in Austin, Texas, where currently crime rates are  skyrocketing. Murder rates almost double.   Why might that be?   The President of the United States gave a speech allegedly about  crime.   Did he talk about the defunding of police? Did he talk about the $150  million stripped out of the budget in Austin, Texas?   How about Oakland right now, doubling down on their foolish defunding  of the police?   It wasn't enough to take $15 million out of it last time, and now  seeing murder rates skyrocket. They are now doubling down for another  $16 million. They think that is going to solve their problems.   The genius of the current administration, my Democrats on the other  side of the aisle, is to take police off the streets and then come  after our Second Amendment rights.   How about the border of Texas?   The border of Texas is wide open with cartels operating fully from  the Gulf of Mexico all the way up through Big Bend. They have  operational control of our border. We have images of gunmen coming  across the Rio Grande. We have humans being sold into sex trafficking  and human trafficking. We have 7,500 pounds of fentanyl pouring across  our border; Americans dying in this opioid epidemic. We have Americans  in danger.    And what do Democrats want to do?   Take away our Second Amendment rights to defend ourselves as they  defund police and empower cartels.   That is your Democratic Party, ladies and gentlemen. They want you to  be in danger. They want you to have to suffer the consequences of their  rote incompetence and disbelief in your ability to take care of your  own families and your communities.   The President of the United States actually said the other day that,  in fact, you are not allowed to have a cannon.   Well, you know what?   In Texas, there was a moment when we had a cannon and we looked at  the Mexicans and we said: Come and take it, in 1835.   And that is what I say to the President of the United States: Come  and take it, because it is our Second Amendment rights and we are going  to defend ourselves.   And when he asks why we need 20 rounds of ammo, maybe it is because  he is saying that he wants to come after the American people with F-15s  and nuclear weapons.
