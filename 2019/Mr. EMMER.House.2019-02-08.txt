 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of Dick  Ames, a great friend who recently passed. Dick's contributions to the  great State of Minnesota are countless. His impact on our progress and  the future of our great State is unending. I was lucky to know Dick and  the generous heart he had for others, for everyone in our community.   Over the course of his life, he helped shape everything he touched.  Through his business, Ames Construction, or his farm, or even his  contributions to the athletic department at his beloved University of  Minnesota, Dick made a difference for our great State.   His hard work, honesty, and integrity were an example for us all, to  strive for greatness and serve those around you  [[Page H1486]]  as you achieve greatness. His selfless service was amazing. Again, I  was lucky to call him my friend, and I can only hope to follow in his  incredible example.   Our community has suffered a great loss. My deepest condolences go to  Lollie, his wife, and the rest of his family and all of his loved ones.   God bless you, Dick Ames.                            ____________________
