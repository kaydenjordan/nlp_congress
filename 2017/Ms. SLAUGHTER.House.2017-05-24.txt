 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, all of us in this Chamber today support the goals of  this legislation. We can and we must do more to protect children from  the plague of sexual assault and the prevalence of child pornography  permeating society today.   I am particularly glad to see such bipartisan support for H.R. 1973.  The young athletes that represent the United States on the world's  stage at the Olympics must not be taken advantage of by predatory  coaches and doctors who should be mentoring them. In fact, no child  anywhere should be taken advantage of; but this bill makes some  commonsense changes that strengthen the reporting of abuse and puts in  place policies that prevent future violations, and I am hopeful it will  become law.   It staggers the mind to believe that this assault on those children  had gone on for 20 years, and some 400 children were victimized for it,  and not a single adult anywhere around ever brought attention to it. In  fact, we owe a great newspaper in Indiana for telling us about it, so  be sure to read a good newspaper every day.   Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of agreement about the goals of the bills  before us today, but that wasn't the case 20 days ago when the majority  rushed through its partisan, slapdash healthcare bill repeal to rip  away healthcare from millions of people. They passed the bill without  holding a single hearing, listening to any experts, or, most  importantly, waiting for a score from the nonpartisan Congressional  Budget Office.   The Congressional Budget Office tells us what the bill will cost, how  many people it will help, how many people it would hurt, something  that, with healthcare, would have been vitally important.   But while the lack of a score didn't prohibit them from holding a  vote, it did, apparently, prevent the majority from sending the bill  over to the Senate. Mr. Speaker, this process is completely backwards  and a major breakdown of the integrity of the legislative process.   Most schoolchildren know that, when a bill passes the House, you send  it to the Senate. You don't hide it in a drawer for weeks until you  finally get the information from the Congressional Budget Office that  you should have had before you brought the bill to the floor for a  vote.   This is no way to develop a plan that will impact one-sixth of the  Nation's gross domestic product, and the process has finally laid bare  one of the biggest political hoaxes in recent memory: that notion of  repeal and replace. How often did we hear that over the last 7 years?   For the last 7 years, the majority voted more than 60 times to  undermine the Affordable Care Act without having a thing in the world  to replace it with, and now they are pushing the false notion that the  Affordable Care Act is collapsing. The reality is that some States  dealing with limited insurers never implemented the full benefits of  the law or enacted the exchange under the Affordable Care Act, which  would have cut their costs.   Mr. Speaker, one of my proudest moments as a Member of Congress was  chairing the House Rules Committee and bringing the Affordable Care Act  to the House floor. Almost every President since Theodore Roosevelt had  attempted to give healthcare to the American people. Millions of people  are now waking up to the benefits of this healthcare, and our Nation's  uninsured rate is at its lowest level in more than 50 years. Why would  you rip that away?   For the first time in a generation, we are actually slowing the  yearly growth of healthcare costs. A poll released just this last month  found that 61 percent of the public supports keeping and improving the  Affordable Care Act. That is in stark contrast to the 17 percent  approval rating for the repeal bill that was voted on here several  weeks ago.   Mr. Speaker, I wish the majority would stop turning a deaf ear to the  people it represents. The American people have been marching and  calling and writing against this bill in numbers none of us have ever  seen before. A bad process led to a bad product.   Mr. Speaker, none of us believe that the ACA was perfect. I urge the  majority to take the bill out of the drawer and shred it. Let's get  together, strengthen our healthcare system and the Affordable Care Act.  It is exactly what our constituents deserve.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the majority of Americans want us to work together to  improve upon the successes of the Affordable Care Act. We should be  expanding access to care and implementing the kind of reforms that will  keep American families healthy, not kicking millions of Americans off  their insurance to fulfill a deceptive campaign promise, as the  Republican healthcare repeal bill will do. Expanding paid sick leave to  the 45 percent of American workers who don't have access to it would be  a great start.    Each week, up to 3 million employees go to work sick, infecting their  coworkers and customers and delaying their own recovery. The benefits  of allowing working Americans to earn paid sick leave are undeniable.  It slows the spread of disease, lowers healthcare costs, and increases  productivity.   If we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the  rule that would allow us to also bring up Representative DeLauro's  bill, H.R. 1516, which would allow Americans to have paid sick time.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from New York?  [[Page H4523]]    There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, it is clear after The Indianapolis Star  uncovered the widespread abuse scandal that Congress must act to  implement consistent, stricter laws governing the reporting of abuses  to our Nation's athletes and to all our children. Once again, The  Indianapolis Star has shown us the importance of investigative  journalism and a free press.   Many of these athletes are too young and are not empowered to speak  out against authority figures when they are hurt or abused by them. But  each of us as Members of Congress is in a position to do something  about it, and we must.   Mr. Speaker, again, I urge my colleagues to listen to the voices of  the American people before hurling our Nation further toward disaster  with this dangerous healthcare bill.   The majority hasn't held any hearings or gotten input from experts,  advocates, or patients. They are ignoring the opposition from groups  like AARP, American Medical Association, March of Dimes, and American  Hospital Association.   The score later today from the Congressional Budget Office won't  change the underlying facts of this bill. It will gut protections for  people with preexisting conditions. It will gut essential health  benefits, kick millions of people off of health insurance, and place a  crushing age tax on those aged 50 to 64 whose premiums will go up. It  will also cut billions from Medicaid to pay for a major tax cut for the  wealthy. That is $880 billion that they want to take away from Medicaid  to give to the rich and corporations. This is so unAmerican, I stumbled  over saying it.   Mr. Speaker, a bad process has led to a bad bill. We should be doing  what the American people want and improving the Affordable Care Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
