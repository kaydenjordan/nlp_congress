 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize our Blount County  Sheriff, James Berrong, who is celebrating his 30th year in office.   Since 1989, Sheriff Berrong and his deputies have served the  community by maintaining safe neighborhoods, providing outstanding  emergency service, and busting lawbreakers.   Sheriff Berrong successfully advocated better pay for his deputies  and has prioritized hiring and retaining an excellent deputy force.  Under his leadership, Blount County continues to be a safe place to  live and raise a family.   Sheriff Berrong and his deputies remain focused on guaranteeing  safety at religious institutions and schools, increasing the Sheriff's  Office's presence when necessary.   Additionally, he ensures that sex offenders and human traffickers are  held accountable. Sheriff Berrong has effectively led the crackdown on  these dirtbags, and the Blount County Sheriff's Office has gained a  reputation as one of the best law enforcement agencies, if not in the  State of Tennessee, in the entire United States of America, for dealing  with sex-related crimes.   It is my honor to recognize Sheriff Berrong for his outstanding  career as Blount County Sheriff. I know I speak for many in east  Tennessee when I  [[Page H9211]]  thank him for his continued service to our community.                            ____________________
