 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a  creative solution to enacting term limits without amending the  Constitution, H.R. 5539, the Thomas Jefferson Public Service Act of  2018.   Under this proposal, after six terms in the House or two in the  Senate, Members of Congress will only receive $1 a year in compensation  for their service, effectively implementing real term limits. Again, no  constitutional amendment necessary.   Critics may say this will create a Congress full of rich people, but,  in fact, people using this argument are exactly the career politicians  we need to weed out. If a person were to ignore the effective 12-year  term limit, regardless of how much money they might have, the culture  of term limits would be set in and they would be widely opposed,  criticized, and should be thrown out.   Eighty-six percent of our customers, the voters, want term limits. As  a businessperson, I am just figuring out how to get them what they  want. That is what we do in the real world: satisfy customers.                            ____________________
