 Mr. Speaker, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and  the President said that their plan would not benefit the rich and would  grow the economy. They called it the Mnuchin rule.   If you make $730,000 a year in America, your income would rise by 8.5  percent, which is $129,000 a year, or $10,750 a month. That is your tax  cut under the Trump plan, a direct violation of what we were told.   We are also told that this plan was a middle class miracle. If you  make $67,000, your income will rise by 1.2 percent, which is $670 a  year, or a whopping $56 a month.   This is not a miracle. This is an illusion. This plan will increase  the deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next 10 years. I am wondering  where the deficit hawks are.   We were told that these tax cuts would pay for themselves. News  flash: tax cuts don't pay for themselves. In fact, economists from  Goldman say these tax cuts will have virtually no good impact on the  economy. The Treasury Secretary and the National Economic Adviser are  both immediately from Goldman.   This tax cut is a fraud being perpetrated against the American people  and against the American middle class.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, any budget requires an  examination of how and who pays for it and how that budget impacts the  economy.   We were told by President Trump and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin that  there would be no new tax cuts for the wealthy; and that this budget,  and its blueprint, is a middle class miracle. That was last Wednesday.   One week later, this Wednesday, the facts are in. If you make  $730,000 in America, next year your income will rise by 8.5 percent, or  $129,000, or $10,750 a month.   If you make $67,000, your income will rise by 1.2 percent, or $670  next year, or a whopping $56 a month. This is no miracle. This is fraud  being perpetrated against the middle class.   We are told that tax cuts pay for themselves through the magic of  dynamic scoring. Their budget will increase the deficit by $2.5  trillion over 10 years. Where are all the deficit hawks? Where are any  of the deficit hawks?   Goldman alumnus Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, the National Economic Adviser,  said that this bill will grow the economy. Goldman economists said that  their budget will have no good impact in terms of growth in the Federal  budget over the next several years.   Finally, infrastructure. The infrastructure budget for America, a  nation of 300 million people, for the next 10 years is about the same  as we spent rebuilding the roads and bridges of Iraq and Afghanistan  over the last 10 years. This is unacceptable. We can do much better.
