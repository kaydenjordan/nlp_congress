 Mr. Speaker, coming from my friend, a wise man from New  York, I appreciate that very much. And I appreciate the effort in  securing the whole hour for all of us to talk about this issue.   It really is a matter of wide-eyed justice. The blindfold was  removed, and real justice in America is hanging in the balance.   People in America have seen what happened; and I think because they  have seen the way justice has been abused for a number of years now, it  is what helped Donald J. Trump get elected President. People were ready  for significant changes so that we could get back to a country where  the rule of law mattered regardless of who was the President.   When we look back at Chuck Colson, he did a year and a half in prison  basically for having one FBI file in the White House. The Clintons had  nearly 1,000 in the White House. Nobody did a day. We saw that kind of  injustice come in and played out before us during the 8 years of Eric  Holder and Loretta Lynch in the Justice Department.   And now Americans who have seen--not all of them. Some are still  blinded by the very thick paint that is provided by the mainstream  media--but when you break through that, you brush that off, you get  down to the bare facts. What you have now is Deputy Attorney General  Rosenstein who was the U.S. attorney when Russia's illegal effort to  obtain U.S. uranium was going down. He and his dear friend, Robert  Mueller, as head of the FBI, were investigating what they knew. They  had the facts. They had the evidence. They had the person working  behind the scenes providing information, and they knew Russia was  illegally trying to corner the market on U.S. uranium.   They knew that bribes were taking place. They knew there were all  kinds of crimes taking place. Yet we don't know how it was with such a  powerfully important investigation going on, an investigation that has  led up to a time now where the head of Russia--whether you want to call  him czar, president, Vladimir, whatever you want to call him, he is the  head guy--and he has made clear that in Russia they have rockets now  that can deliver atomic weapons, nuclear weapons, that the United  States cannot stop.   And we know that while Rosenstein and Mueller were involved in  investigating the efforts of the President's friend, Vladimir, for whom  he had much flexibility after the second election, we know he is making  noise, rattling his sabre, as an existential threat to the United  States' very existence.   So the evidence was there. What we can't find out, because we can't  get a proper investigation, is who was it? What was it that caused Rod  Rosenstein and FBI Director Mueller to squelch the investigation into  Russia's effort to get our uranium? Because if it was going full board,  and if it had not been squelched by Mr. Rosenstein and Mr. Mueller,  Russia would never have ended up with 20 percent of U.S. uranium.    And since we now know Hillary Clinton will not be President, the  Clinton Foundation has gone away. But when it looked like everybody  thought she was going to be the next President--and she had been  Secretary of State. She had all of this power as Secretary of State.  She was one of the key critical people that had to approve this sale  that would end up putting uranium from the United States in Russia's  possession. They squelched the investigation.   The sale went through with Hillary Clinton and her friends' support.  The Clinton Foundation ends up with $145 million from those who had  invested in the effort to get Russia U.S. uranium. Bill Clinton got  $500,000 for a 20-minute speech that, from what we understand, wasn't  very good; but it wasn't about a good speech, it was about rewarding  the Clintons for Russia getting U.S. uranium.   There is no way, this side of heaven, that you could have a fair  investigation of former FBI Director Mueller and the former U.S.  attorney on the role they played in helping Russia--along with Hillary  Clinton, helping Russia get U.S. uranium, all to the detriment of the  United States.   I mean, we had prior Soviet spies, Communist spies, who were put to  death for providing designs for advanced weaponry. But in this case,  you have Hillary Clinton, Rod Rosenstein, and Bob Mueller not just  helping design. Here is what you need to create atomic weapons to  destroy the United States. They didn't care. We know on one hand money,  a great deal of money, was involved and changed hands, but there is no  way the FBI and the Justice Department, that we have seen has so many  close friends of Mueller and Rosenstein--there is no way they are going  to be able to investigate that matter.   Since the day Robert Mueller was appointed as special counsel, I have  been begging that we get a second counsel to investigate Mueller. He  ought to be fired, but that, politically, cannot happen without some of  our weak-kneed Republicans in the Senate deciding they need to remove  the President. That should not happen for what the Democrats did. So it  is critical.   If we have a second counsel--and by the way, let me just say, a great  patriot, ethical, honest, upright man named Jeff Sessions is seeing to  a number of critical things that we need investigated, seeing to them  being investigated. And I applaud his efforts to apply the rule of law  across the board.   But when it comes to investigating Rosenstein, Mueller, and Comey-- who has already admitted leaking things that should be a crime--that is  going to take a second counsel.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend Congressman Zeldin arranging for  this time to talk about it. I appreciate the effort my colleagues have  put into researching this. We have got to have a second counsel, or our  Justice Department is done.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend so much, bringing  back  [[Page H3340]]  the account of what happened. And I can remember--I majored in history  in college--reading about General Eisenhower ordering American troops,  Allied troops, to go gather people from the German communities near the  concentration camps where so many Jews were being killed, ruthlessly  killed.   It is horrific to even contemplate what went on. And Eisenhower had  ordered that, apparently, they bring the community citizens and have  them help clean up the concentration camps. And the reason that was  given was so that they could never say these things didn't happen--and  I thought at the time that really is going perhaps too far--because  these people turned a blind eye to what was going on. Surely they  suspected. They knew there was ash going over their communities. Surely  they suspected.   But I never dreamed we would reach a day when what Eisenhower feared  would occur actually came about, and that is a time when people are  finding it popular to deny that the Holocaust ever happened. So I am  grateful that Israel has this Yom HaShoah, the Israel Holocaust  remembrance day. But it should not just be for Israel. America needs to  stand with Israel.   There are those who are calling for extermination of Jews around the  Earth again. It is unbelievable. It is unbelievable. It has been  shocking to see anti-Semitism growing again around Europe. To me, as an  American, it has been even more shocking to see growing sentiment on  U.S. college campuses denying that the Holocaust ever happened. That is  the ultimate irony: having institutions of what are supposed to be  higher learning in the United States of America, where at one time we  had the best universities, everyone wanted to come to the U.S. for  universities; but now we have institutions of higher learning that are  actually the epitome of dumbing down and destroying history, rewriting  history, which would make them institutions of the least learning,  certainly not higher education. So it is important that we take time,  we remember the horrors.   I was just talking to my friend Claudia Tenney from New York about  the Jewish woman who came and spoke to her seventh grade class and  then, as I understood, spoke to her child's seventh grade class. And  that is so important, but the Holocaust survivors, we are losing them  day after day. It is up to us. I am so grateful to my friend, the good  Joe Wilson, for securing this time so we could talk about the  Holocaust.   The Bible makes clear that you must teach about what God has done. We  would never, ever want to see another Holocaust. After the horrors of  the Holocaust, that what was prophesied for thousands of years has now  happened, there is an Israel; it is making, has made, the desert bloom.  But we should never forget, as long as this Earth is populated by human  beings, another Holocaust is possible. And the blood would be on the  hands and head of everyone who has denied that it was even possible.                                time  2045
