 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, 2 days ago, the Democratic leader  threatened that if the Senate majority dares to play by the rules and  behave like a majority, it would mean ``the end of this supposedly  great deliberative body''--``the end of this supposedly great  deliberative body.''   Yesterday, we learned what he meant. We saw important Senate business  hurt by what amounted to a temper tantrum. For some reason, the  Democratic leader decided to vent his frustration by blocking the  Intelligence Committee--listen to this--from holding a bipartisan  counterintelligence hearing--by blocking the Intelligence Committee  from holding a bipartisan counterintelligence hearing.   The committee was set to hear from Bill Evanina, the Director of the  National Counterintelligence and Security Center. This is the Nation's  top counterintelligence official. Among other things, he works directly  on protecting our elections and our politics from foreign interference.  That is his job. They were going to hear from him.   This is the same Democratic leader who declared a few weeks ago that  if the Intelligence Committee did not stay close to Congress on  election security, it would be ``an abdication of [their] duty . . . to  protect our democracy.'' Just last week, he wrote me a letter saying  election security had to be ``above partisan politics.'' But now the  Democratic leader's temper is more important. He denied Chairman Rubio  routine permission for the bipartisan committee to meet. He said:  ``[W]e won't have business as usual here in the Senate.''   Today, both the Intelligence Committee and the Armed Services  Committee are scheduled to meet. They are set to speak with top  intelligence and military officials about election security. I guess we  will find out whether the Democratic leader's embarrassing theatrics  were just a 1-day matinee or whether he means to make this a series.   Our bipartisan committees have a great deal of work to do to  safeguard  [[Page S5796]]  our Nation and, in particular, to protect our elections, so I hope our  colleague from New York gets out of the way.   But the Democratic leader didn't stop there. A few minutes later, he  decided to cheapen a solemn and unifying moment and turned a draft  unanimous resolution honoring Justice Ginsburg into one more depressing  stunt for the TV cameras.   Over the weekend, I wrote a resolution honoring the late Justice's  amazing life. Normally, such measures are adopted with unanimous,  bipartisan support. That is exactly what we did after Justice Scalia  passed. Every Senator recognized that our collective eulogy was no  place to debate political questions--oh, but not this time. This time,  the Democratic leader copy-pasted the tribute I had written, put his  name on top, and added two divisive references to our debate over what  to do next. He didn't devote any time or attention to the language  praising Justice Ginsburg's life and career. He did not suggest a  single change to any of that. His sole focus was on turning a solemn  routine and unanimous moment for Justice Ginsburg into a platform for  himself.   Justice Ginsburg could not be more deserving of the honor of a formal  Senate tribute. I hope our colleague from New York will let us pass one  sometime soon.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, I have already  talked a lot about history this week, but before we shift focus to  President Trump's nominee, we need to review Senate history one more  time.   As we await the hurricane of misrepresentations and bad-faith attacks  that seem almost guaranteed to pour out, we need to understand, in very  clear terms, why our colleague from New York is a uniquely non-credible  messenger when it comes to the Senate's role in judicial confirmations.   It was Senate Democrats who began our modern challenges with their  treatment of Robert Bork in 1987, but the acrimony really got going in  the early 2000s when a group of Senate Democrats took the almost-never- used tactic of filibustering nominations and turned it into a constant  routine for the first time ever.   So who was the main driving force behind these tactics? Let's consult  some New York newspapers from the year 2003:         Schumer decided [to] put ideology on the front burner in       the confirmation process. . . . ``I am the leader (of the       filibuster movement), and you know, I'm proud of it,'' said       the senator from Brooklyn.        Mr. Schumer urged Democratic colleagues . . . to use a       tactic that some were initially reluctant to pursue, and that       has since roiled the Senate.    Throughout President Bush 43's two terms, our colleague built an  entire personal brand out of filibustering judicial nominees. Talented,  hard-working people's careers were destroyed, like the brilliant lawyer  Miguel Estrada, a close friend of now-Justice Elena Kagan, who says he  is ``extraordinary'' and ``thoughtful'' and would have made ``an  excellent addition to any Federal court.'' People like that, literally,  were destroyed by Democratic tactics.   This version of the now-Democratic leader said filibustering judges  was an essential part--an essential part--of the Senate. He said that  if Republicans ever used the nuclear option to ``change the rules in  midstream'' because ``they can't get their way on every judge . . .  it'll be a doomsday for democracy.''   But of course, in the very next Presidential administration, the  Democratic leader leapt at the chance to press that doomsday button  himself. Democrats could not abide by President Obama's being  constrained by the same rules they had imposed on President Bush. They  had no patience to taste their own medicine. So the Democratic leader  suddenly decided that ``the old rules need to be modified.'' He voted  to use the nuclear option to lower the bar.   So there actually has been one consistent principle all this time.  For the Democratic leader, two things qualify as a crisis when it comes  to the courts. The sky is falling when a Democratic President does not  get to confirm every last judge he or she wants, and the sky is falling  when a Republican President gets to confirm any judge.   Six months ago, our colleague walked across the street to the Supreme  Court steps, stood in front of a crowd, and yelled:         I want to tell you, Gorsuch! I want to tell you, Kavanaugh!       . . . You will pay the price! You won't know what hit you if       you go forward with these awful decisions!    That is the Democratic leader in front of the Supreme Court of the  United States.   Just last night he said this:         I tell the American people, everything you need and want,       just about everything, will be taken away inexorably, month       after month, year after year, decision by decision, by this       new court.    That is the argument. That is, apparently, the argument. ``Everything  you need and want will be taken away.'' Is this a discussion among  Senators or an overdramatic line from a bad movie?   The American people do not need any more revisionist history  lectures, any more threats, or any more performance outrage from the  side that launched this unfortunate fight and escalated it time after  time after time.   There is one right path before us. It does right by the judiciary,  the Senate, the yet-unnamed nominee, and the American people. It is a  fair hearing, a fair process, and a fair vote. That is what the  American people ensured in 2018 after the Democratic leader explicitly  asked for a referendum on this approach to the judiciary. He got that  referendum in 2018. The people decided. They shrunk his minority even  further.   Americans took care to ensure Senate Democrats could not stand in the  way of a fair process. So that is exactly what the Senate will provide.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on another matter, yesterday the  House passed a government funding resolution on a bipartisan basis. It  will now make its way through the Senate.   A few days ago, when House Democrats released their first draft,  Republicans immediately spoke out about a huge omission. It  intentionally neglected the needs of farm country and rural America.  They tried to use our Nation's farmers and ranchers as a bargaining  chip.   Fortunately, thanks to the leadership of our colleague Senator Ernst,  along with Senators Hoeven, Boozman, and many other Republican  colleagues, we made it clear right away that we would not let Democrats  leave farmers behind.   The Commodity Credit Corporation is an essential source of funding  for our farmers. For years it has been routinely refilled with  bipartisan support, but this year Speaker Pelosi tried to take Middle  America hostage for unrelated political brinksmanship.   I am grateful to Senator Ernst and everyone who fought hard to fix  the Democrats' bill. Republicans kept the Speaker of the House from  adding insult to injury in such a challenging year for rural America.   I know all Members will carefully review the continuing resolution  sent over by the House. I am optimistic that, with bipartisan  cooperation, we will be able to make law well before the government  funding deadline at the end of this month.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand there are two bills at  the desk due a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings, en bloc.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, more than 100,000 Kentuckians choose  every year to pursue a degree or develop their skills through the  Kentucky Community and Technical College System, KCTCS. Composed of 16  colleges within a short drive of virtually every Kentucky household,  KCTCS has helped over 1 million Kentucky students receive an affordable  and quality education. Today, I would like to recognize my friend, Dr.  Jay Box, who has served as KCTCS' second president for the last 5 years  and is a leading architect of its success. As Jay retires at the end of  this month, my home State will send him off with our sincere gratitude.   Nearly two decades ago, Jay and his wife Gayle left Texas to join  KCTCS. I am so glad they did. Jay brought with him a personal belief in  the importance of lifelong learning to adapt to a changing workforce.  That vision has served Jay and KCTCS' students well while preparing  them for 21st century careers.   Jay was quickly recognized for his transformative leadership at  Hazard Community and Technical College. Tapping into his talent, he was  given statewide responsibilities as KCTCS vice president, chancellor,  then finally its president. In each role, Jay has constantly delivered  for Kentucky students.   As president, Jay placed a renewed emphasis on helping students  complete their degrees with a record number of graduates and  credentials. He also encouraged schools to remove barriers, to support  students pursuing GEDs and college credit at the same time, and to form  partnerships with job creators to close the skills gap. As a result,  graduates are gaining the skills to meet local employers' demands and  enter the workforce prepared to fill good-paying jobs.   His many achievements have brought national acclaim for both Jay and  KCTCS. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and Advisor to the  President Ivanka Trump appointed him to be the voice for community  colleges on the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board. Jay  collaborates with leaders from educational institutions, governments,  and some of the country's largest employers to increase preparedness in  the workforce. Jay is also a member of the national board for  Rebuilding America's Middle Class and the Bill and Melinda Gates  Foundation's National Advisory Group.   I have had the privilege to work directly with Jay to serve  Kentucky's students. I am particularly grateful for his leadership to  save Southeast Kentucky Community and Technical College, SKCTC, from  losing its ability to offer Federal student aid. Working closely with  Jay, I inserted a legislative provision to give the school a reasonable  opportunity to make its case to the U.S. Department of Education. Jay  and his team did just that, showing SKCTC's many contributions to its  students and community. I am proud to say the school continues to  thrive and help prepare Kentucky students to excel in the workforce.   Jay announced he would begin his well-deserved retirement in July.  However, when the coronavirus crisis struck, he once again showed true  leadership. Jay delayed his retirement to continue serving Kentucky's  students and ensure KCTCS received the steady leadership transition it  deserves.   Over the years, Jay has helped educate students, encourage industry,  and drive growth in nearly every corner of Kentucky. It is a remarkable  legacy, and I hope he and Gayle are proud of their accomplishments. I  ask my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating Dr. Jay Box on  his retirement and to wish him many wonderful years to come.                            ____________________     Madam President, when my friend Tommy Turner was first  elected to lead LaRue County in 1985, he was the youngest Kentuckian to  ever serve as a county judge-executive. Now, 35 years later, Tommy  recently announced he would leave office as our Commonwealth's longest  currently serving county leader. Records bookend his service, and more  accomplishments fill the years between. I would like to take a moment  to congratulate Tommy on his decades of leadership for LaRue County and  to thank him for his many contributions to Kentucky.   Every county judge-executive is responsible for local services such  as the county's budget and road maintenance. As LaRue County's leader,  however, Tommy was given an additional--almost sacred--charge. He  helped preserve the birthplace of our most famous Kentuckian, Abraham  Lincoln. Tommy took seriously his role in honoring Lincoln, and  Kentucky will continue to benefit from his enthusiasm for our Nation's  16th President.   Along with a group of motivated citizens, Tommy helped establish the  Lincoln Museum in Hodgenville. In a typical year, thousands of tourists  will visit the museum and the nearby Abraham Lincoln National  Historical Park. Tommy championed an effort to expand the National Park  by coordinating a donation to include Lincoln's Boyhood Home on Knob  Creek. This year, Kentucky Living Magazine named the Lincoln Museum as  the Commonwealth's Best Museum, a well-deserved distinction for their  efforts to safeguard the Great Emancipator's legacy.   In 2000, Congress created the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission  to prepare national celebrations for the President's 200th birthday.  Recommended by Kentucky's Governor at the time and appointed by the  President, Tommy was a fine choice to serve as a commissioner.  Hodgenville would later host the celebration's National Opening  Ceremony and lead the country in honoring President Lincoln.   Over the years, I have worked with Tommy to preserve Lincoln's  heritage in LaRue County and to deliver for the community's bright  future. It has also been a privilege to join Tommy's radio show to  speak directly with local families about their priorities and my work  for Kentucky in the Senate.   Tommy spent half of his life as LaRue County's judge-executive. The  results of his leadership can be seen across the county in its growth  and opportunity. I would like to encourage my Senate colleagues to join  me in thanking Tommy for his service and for preserving the memory of  one of our country's greatest leaders. In whatever comes next for  Tommy, I wish him the best. I look forward to his continued  contributions to our great Commonwealth.                            ____________________     Madam President, I understand that there is a bill at  the desk, and I ask for its first reading.    Madam President, I now ask for a second reading, and  in order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule  XIV, I object to my own request.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate resume executive session.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Thursday, September 24; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the Senate resume the Young nomination.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order following the remarks of Senator Bennet.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate stand in recess subject to the call of the Chair.
