 Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. We are here today because Joe  Biden opened his mouth.   When Joe Biden took office, he had to do nothing. He had to do  nothing to secure our southern border. All he had to do was keep  President Trump's policies in place. Instead, he halted the  construction of the Trump border wall and left over 150 miles of  planned border wall unbuilt.                                time  1215    As I stand here today, materials are lying at our border, they are  lying on the ground, and they are rusting in the sun as hundreds of  thousands of illegal aliens wait to flood into our country.   To date, Mr. Speaker, over 5 million illegal aliens have invaded our  border, and an additional 1.5 million of them, the bad hombres, have  evaded capture since Joe Biden took over.   This historic legislation restores Trump-era immigration policies  that prioritize the safety of the American people, take away the  incentives that the Biden administration created to encourage illegal  aliens to enter our country, defend our brave Border Patrol agents,  and, of course, reform the asylum process.   H.R. 2 criminalizes those who overstay their visas, stops the abuse  of parole authority to bypass immigration law, and helps employers to  ensure that the workers they are hiring are legal and authorized to  work in the United States.   It is past time we restored law and order at our southern border. We  cannot continue to allow illegal aliens to infiltrate our country, kill  American citizens, rob hardworking Americans of healthcare and other  services, increase housing costs, crowd our Nation's public schools,  and create a country filled with chaos.   Mr. Speaker, if you think the homeless problem is bad now, just wait.  The Biden administration has failed to prioritize the safety of our  country, our families, our livelihoods, and our children's future.   House Republicans are committed to securing the border and ending the  national security crisis that the Joe Biden administration has created  and ignored.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  legislation. Let's take back control of our southern border and restore  the rule of law.
