 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1541,  legislation that would strike a prohibition in the Fort Scott National  Historic Site's enabling law that prohibited the incorporation of the  structure known as the Lunette Blair blockhouse into the site's  formation.   Fortunately, the blockhouse still sits right across the street from  the historic site, where, under the future care of the National Park  Service, it can remain on display in perpetuity without disrupting the  grounds' antebellum view shed, successfully linking the site's frontier  fort structures with the community's Civil War legacy.   Located in the historic town of Fort Scott, Kansas, the Fort Scott  National Historic Site preserves the important story of the original  frontier fort's role in nineteenth-century America. It serves as a  physical snapshot of the pioneer days of westward migration of a young  republic, from its initial construction 175 years ago, and portrays a  figurative stepping-stone upon the prairie toward a transcontinental  nation.   However, the story of the community of Fort Scott continues from that  point on as the town grew around the shuttered fort of the same name.  The community's history itself invokes the violent struggles of the era  we all know as Bleeding Kansas and the conflicts of the Civil War.   After the U.S. Army demobilized Fort Scott in 1853 following the  collapse of a permanent Indian frontier, private residents purchased  the last of its property; the buildings of the old fort became the new  town. Soon after, Americans of opposing sentiments, abolitionists,  free-staters, and Border Ruffians alike, settled the area throughout  the rest of the decade in turmoil. While the territory of Kansas  ultimately became the free state of Kansas on January 29, 1861, violent  conflict soon engulfed the entire nation.   During the Civil War, the Union Army militarized the town of Fort  Scott to store Union supplies and to deter Confederate invasions into  Southeast Kansas. The Union Army constructed many fortifications in the  surrounding area, including four garrisoned blockhouses, or  ``lunettes,'' fortified structures with designated names, such as Fort  Lincoln, Fort Insley, Fort Henning, and Fort Blair, in order to house  soldiers and armaments while protecting the town's approach.   While these structures successfully deterred such attacks, the U.S.  War Department considered these four blockhouses as surplus property  after the Civil War and sold them at auction to private individuals.  The structure called Fort Blair, known locally today as Lunette Blair  is the sole remaining Civil War blockhouse standing today.   Mr. Speaker, it is only through the diligent stewardship of the  citizens of Fort Scott, Kansas, and their dedication to preserve the  community's heritage, that the Lunette Blair blockhouse still stands  after all these years.   Members of the Fort Scott community support the donation of the  blockhouse to the National Park Service and this proposal is in line  with the sites' overall mission: to tell the encompassing story of Fort  Scott's role in westward migration and to demonstrate the community's  contribution in preserving our Union during the Civil War.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 1541.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  [[Page H5408]]  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
