 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the Republic of  Turkiye--the more I learn, the more I am appalled that they are allowed  to remain in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.   From their historic and well-documented persecution of Armenians,  human rights abuses--even today--and their objections to Sweden and  Finland joining NATO, why do we keep or even trust Turkiye as a partner  in maintaining world order?   In major issues related to Iran, Syria, Russia, Armenia, and  Azerbaijan, Turkiye is involved and not always helpful to our  interests. It is time to rethink this arrangement.   My district in New York has a sizable population of Armenian  descendants, multigeneration, first generation, and new arrivals. These  citizens have close ties and legitimate concerns about what is going on  over there in Armenia.   To my constituents: Yes, I will cosponsor H. Res. 108, but I will  also ask this legislative body and my friends in the Senate to  reconsider our continued partnership with Turkiye.                            ____________________
