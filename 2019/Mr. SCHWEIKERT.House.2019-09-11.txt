 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Maloney for  telling the story. You know, it is not just New Yorkers, I can't  imagine there is an American who doesn't remember exactly where they  were in that horrific moment. And it's a moment yet where those of us  in the West and all over the country ached to see what happened to your  community.    I yield to the gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Maloney. We  always have to be careful when we are friends not to go around calling  each other by our first names.   But I was not here at the time of 9/11, I did not come for another  decade. And yet today, even with the young people we have in our office  that were just children, I mean young children, and you can still feel  that sort of somber tone. It is a powerful example and something that  is devastating. And we can come together. I desperately wish there were  more opportunities where we remember, not the horror, but the fact that  there was unity. And how do we deal in a world right now where so much  of our politics is toxic and in not allowing that broken sort of  political system to ever sort of be more powerful than those moments  where we must come together and both heal, deal with the heartbreak and  then also make sure it never ever happens again.   So my reason for being on the floor this evening is I wanted to spend  a moment and just touch on 9/11 and how that just affects so many of  us. I am told now in Arizona we have 30 or 40 of those first responders  or others who were affected who are receiving their healthcare in our  community. I know of only one or two Arizonans, I believe, who lost  their lives, so we always sort of pull back to our communities and  personalize it.                            The Math Doesn't Work     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Kansas who  represents my wife's family.   Hopefully, I won't take a couple of minutes, but there were a couple  of things as we were doing some economic numbers before.   The modeling right now says if USMCA passes, it is another half a  point on GDP growth. In a $21 trillion economy, that is real money, but  it is also hundreds and hundreds of thousands of jobs.   But there is even another complexity that I am going to ask for folks  to think about. Think of the issues we have, particularly with China.  So many of us would love to have a healthy relationship with China, but  we don't believe they are playing by the WTO rules. They are breaking  the rules.   So we are seeing a world right now where lots of manufacturers are  thinking about moving parts of their supply chain. Wouldn't it be an  amazing thing that we do our job here, we get this trade agreement  passed, and those components, those issues, parts of those supply  chains are back here in North America? Our ability to say our  continent, our trading block, our ability to not only have robust  economies for ourselves, but these labor provisions.   And this is the last thing I really wanted to hit on. The gentleman  and I are on the whip team for passing this. We have had a number of  visits with our brothers and sisters on the left. With a lot of them, I  will get this: Well, David, I am concerned about the enforcement of the  new labor standards that the Mexican Government has passed.   Remember, their legislature has passed this. Their President has  signed it. There are dramatic changes in their labor rules. I will  bring them a copy and say: But you don't understand, it is not the  1940s and 1950s anymore. You don't send in a team of union  representatives to go inspect one of the 70,000-some facilities and  inspect and then write up a report saying we don't think you are--in  today's world, we have that thing called the internet.   The law the Mexican Congress passed actually has provisions in there  for privacy and secrecy and the ability to use technology that if you  believe your labor rights are being abused in a Mexican factory, you  can actually document it. You can actually put it on a blog and those  things.   So how do we drag our brothers and sisters from the left to actually  walk away from the excuse of the labor improvement enforcement, and get  them to understand that it is not the 1950s anymore; that now we are  going to use technology and the ability to have these new labor  standards in Mexico which can be enforced on a very large scale using  technology?   This is incredibly important to our economic growth, and our entire  regions. Let's get this done.
