 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Culberson not  just for his leadership of this special tribute to Barbara Bush, but  for keeping the legacy of President Bush and the Bush family alive in  the eastern region in the district that he represented.   Mr. Culberson has now worked his way up into such a key position for  our region, our State, and our country, advancing space in such a major  way for the world, in my view, and then leading the effort for  Hurricane Harvey relief, a record $146 billion for Hurricanes Harvey,  Maria, Irma, and some of the wildfires in California, all of which are  the largest amount of disaster recovery and really the first prevention  funds to help rebuild the levees and the dams, and all that can prevent  these floods. I thank the gentleman for his leadership in that.                                time  1915     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Barbara Bush. Our country mourns the loss of a truly incomparable First  Lady.   For many of us, Barbara Pierce Bush is the original ``thousand points  of light'' by her urging, her applauding, and, at times, insisting that  we should all live up to higher standards when it comes to family,  honor, and duty.   Barbara Bush deserves to be honored because of her dedication to  making our world a better place, specifically, through her work as an  advocate for adult and child literacy. The Barbara Bush Foundation for  Family Literacy, the leading advocate for family literacy in America,  will continue her great work to give children and parents the skills  they need for a brighter future.   I had the honor of representing Texas A&M at College Station when the  George H.W. Bush Presidential Library was dedicated. It is a remarkable  library in so many ways, as is President Bush and the First Lady.   But it was, to me, remarkable how much time and access the President  and Barbara Bush gave to the young people of College Station and the  region, bringing in leaders from around the country and the world;  having deep discussions about freedom, about faith, about family, about  leadership and service, all the things that made the Bush family so  special.   One time, early on a Saturday morning, I was driving up to College  Station to interview our applicants for West Point and the Naval  Academy and the Air Force and Merchant Marine. We were doing it at the  Corps of Cadets Center at Texas A&M. It was really early on a Saturday  morning.   So we were on 290, and I am not really paying attention. I look up  and I see this bluish green car just up ahead of me, and I notice the  license plate says: ``Read 1.'' I thought, Read 1; that is amazing.  [[Page H3698]]    So as we drive past her--I may have been pushing the speed limit a  bit--I noticed that famous white hair, and it was Mrs. Bush driving up  to the library on a Saturday morning for some work or the other,  probably focused on family literacy.   The Bush family is simply adored in Texas, and especially in the  Houston region, for so many reasons.   I had a chance, as Congressman Culberson talked about, to be able to  follow on the Ways and Means Committee, the seat that President Bush  once held, that Chairman Archer once held, and now that I have the  privilege to hold. So I always feel like I have a duty to uphold his  standards, his legacy, his commitment to honor and duty on our  committee as well.   When I won the seat on the Ways and Means Committee, President Bush  reached out to say: Congratulations. Come down and visit.   Then, when I was fortunate enough to succeed now Speaker Paul Ryan to  chair the committee, his office called again and said: Come down. The  President wants to visit about Ways and Means issues.   So I got a chance to visit with Mrs. Bush and the President, my good  friend Chase Untermeyer, and others. We talked about tax reform and  trade issues and Social Security and Medicare. Mrs. Bush was in the  thick of things in those discussions, and that is my last memory of  being able to visit with her in person.   Anyone who didn't leave a conversation with her better than when you  started probably wasn't paying attention to the conversation.   So we are blessed. It is a remarkable legacy she leaves for her  family, for Texas, for the United States and, really, for the whole  world. So, surely, Heaven rejoiced as Mrs. Bush joined her Saviour,  pearls and all.   Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for blessing us with such a remarkable woman  with a remarkable life and a remarkable family.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a resolution honoring the life  of First Lady Barbara Bush.
