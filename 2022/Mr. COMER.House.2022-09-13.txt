 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize the Carrico family  of Fancy Farm, Kentucky, who recently received the Angels in Adoption  Award from the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute.   Each year, CCAI selects individuals across the Nation who have  demonstrated a commitment to improving the lives of children in need of  loving homes.   I want to congratulate Janet, Ellen, Peyton, and the entire Carrico  family on their well-deserved recognition. They opened their hearts and  house by fostering over 10 children and adopting 6 into their family.   Their devotion to helping children extends to the Fancy Farm  community, as well. They can often be seen directing and volunteering  for various youth-centered programs within the St. Jerome Parish of  Fancy Farm, Kentucky.   Fancy Farm and the entire First Congressional District of Kentucky  should be proud of the Carrico family.   This beautiful Kentucky family has shown what love can really do.                            ____________________
