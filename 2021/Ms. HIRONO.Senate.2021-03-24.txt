 Mr. President, during the last year we have all  experienced the impacts of the coronavirus on everyday life. The  coronavirus has shuttered businesses, closed schools, cancelled events,  and overwhelmed hospitals and other health care facilities. It has  fundamentally changed how we live our lives.   I can think of few better examples of where this has been the case  than in our K-12 schools. Hawaii public school students, parents, and  teachers have told me about how they have been impacted by the  coronavirus. I have learned about the challenges they have faced with  school closures, and heard about how they have adjusted to distance and  hybrid learning--two terms that were pretty unfamiliar just a year ago.  They are ready to return to the classroom.   But they need to return safely. That's why Congress recently provided  an additional $130 billion for K-12 schools--to make sure that when  they do reopen, they have the necessary resources to provide healthy  and safe learning environments for students. If nothing else, the  coronavirus has demonstrated how important these environments are for  student success.   Unfortunately, however, we know that even before the coronavirus many  students lacked access to these environments--including students in  federally impacted school districts.   In many ways it comes down to school facilities. A recent survey  identified $4.2 billion in school facility needs in federally impacted  schools. These were basic health and safety needs to address issues  like lead and mold remediation; electrical, HV AC, and plumbing  upgrades; leaky roofs; expired boilers; outdated technology; and  others--hardly conditions where students can be expected to succeed.   We need to make bold investments. We need to make them now.   That's why I am reintroducing the Impact Aid Infrastructure Act (or  ``IAIA'') for the 117th Congress. IAIA provides $1 billion in  supplemental funding for Impact Aid Construction Grants in FY2022.  Specifically, the bill provides funding for competitive and formula  grants that would help our federally impacted schools build, renovate,  repair, and otherwise improve their facilities.   With these funds, federally impacted schools that are severely  disadvantaged when it comes to raising revenue to finance projects  would receive much-needed assistance.   We can certainly do more for these districts, but this investment is  a start.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.   I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Tester, Mr. Hoeven, Ms. Smith,          Ms. Ernst, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Rounds, Mr. Booker, and Mr. Daines):   S. 949. A bill to amend the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to  foster efficient markets and increase competition and transparency  among packers that purchase livestock from producers; to the Committee  on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.    Mr. President. I rise today to condemn violence and  discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI)  that has surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since March 2020, Stop  AAPI Hate has received nearly 3,800 reports of discrimination and hate  incidents nationwide. Unfortunately, the recent surge in xenophobia and  hate specifically targeted against AAPIs is not new.   More than 180 years ago, when the first Asian immigrants came to the  United States, members of the AAPI community experienced prejudice and  legalized discrimination. Xenophobic policies such as the Chinese  Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Federal government's incarceration of  more than 120,000 Japanese Americans during World War II, were born  from fear, ignorance, and anti-immigrant hostility. More recently,  after the 9/11 terrorist  [[Page S1776]]  attacks, Arab, Muslim, Sikh, and South Asian Americans faced a wave of  hate incidents and blame similar to what AAPI individuals are  experiencing today. As George Santayana said, ``Those who do not  remember the past are condemned to repeat it.''   The former president espoused and amplified virulent intolerance  using slurs such as the ``China virus'' and ``kung flu'' to  characterize the COVID-19 virus, putting the lives of 23,000,000 AAPIs  at risk, including more than 2,000,000 AAPI frontline workers. Every  day, these heroic individuals put their personal health and safety on  the line to serve other Americans as health care professionals, first  responders, transit operators, and in supermarkets and other essential  service industries. However, AAPI frontline workers are not immune from  discrimination and hate, which impacts both their personal and  professional lives. Some AAPI nurses and doctors have reported  workplace harassment from other staff and patients who refuse their  care, while others have experienced terrifying encounters, including  being violently shoved, spit on, and called racial slurs during their  evening commute.   The rise in attacks against older AAPI individuals are both alarming  and unconscionable. In January 2021, three AAPI elders were violently  attacked in separate incidents in California. Tragically, one of these  individuals, Vicha Ratanapakdee, died from injuries he sustained during  an unprovoked assault, which his family believes was racially  motivated. This discrimination which includes acts of physical violence  is an additional threat elders now face as a result of the pandemic.  Older adults are at higher risk of contracting severe COVID-19 and AAPI  elders, particularly those who are recent immigrants or have limited  English proficiency, may face additional challenges in obtaining health  care, enduring economic insecurity, and suffering from language  isolation.   Recently, on March 16, 2021, eight people, including six women of  Asian descent, were shot to death at three Atlanta-area businesses.  During a year of increasing racism and attacks targeting AAPIs, this  latest senseless act of violence adds to the pain and fear felt by many  in the AAPI community. Our leaders must step up and confront racial  hatred and violence.   At Merrick Garland's hearing to be Attorney General of the United  States, I highlighted the surge in discrimination and hate crimes  against the AAPI community. In contrast to the Department of Justice  under the Trump administration, then-Judge Garland recognized the harm  and fear that these incidents have caused and pledged that under his  leadership, the Civil Rights Division would vigorously review and  prosecute these cases. This is the kind of leadership we need in order  to combat these crimes. I will continue to raise the issue of anti- Asian hate with other nominees and officials to call attention to the  alarming rise of hate crimes against AAPIs and the critical need for  action.   The legislation that I have introduced, the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act,  will help to address the ongoing surge in violence against AAPI  communities. It will focus federal leadership to investigate and report  hateful acts of violence, and provide resources for our communities to  come together and take a stand against intolerance and hate. The  actions of our leaders matter, and I call on my colleagues in the  United States Senate to condemn anti-Asian racism, and swiftly pass the  COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act during the 117th Congress.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
