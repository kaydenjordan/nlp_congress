 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Titusville Area Hospital on earning an achievement  award from the Hospital & Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania for  its outstanding efforts to improve healthcare in the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania.   The hospital's entry was titled: ``Enhancing Emergency Care: Because  Seconds Count in an Emergency,'' and it was chosen as an Excellence in  Care Award winner. Twelve award recipients were selected from 91 total  submissions. It is a tremendous achievement for CEO Lee Clinton and  everyone on the staff at the Titusville Area Hospital.   The goal was to lower the overall wait time for patients seeking  emergency care. The hospital began collecting data in November 2016. At  that point the door-to-doctor wait time was 46 minutes, and today the  current average wait time is approximately 21 minutes. This is below  the State and national averages.   The progress that has been made during this time is remarkable. It  translates to not only better patient experience, but better care.   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly congratulate CEO Lee Clinton and  everyone at the Titusville Area Hospital on this outstanding  achievement. The community is most proud of their efforts.
