 Madam Speaker, today, I am so thrilled to join my colleagues  around the country to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Pell grant.   The Pell grant is essential to fulfilling our Nation's promise of  higher education by ensuring low-income students have the same access  and opportunities as their wealthy peers.   As a former college educator for over 20 years, I know firsthand how  life-changing a college degree can be for a student. That kind of  opportunity should not be reserved for only the richest amongst us.   During the 2021 academic year, nearly 850,000 students in my State of  California received a Pell grant to help them access and complete a  college degree. Nationwide, about 40 percent of all undergraduate  students benefit from the Pell grant.   With most of these students coming from working families, it is  clear: Pell grants help make college more affordable, enabling students  to focus on their education and complete their degrees faster.   The Pell grant has spent the last 50 years helping students across  the country access higher education, and it is now easier than ever for  eligible students to apply.                            ____________________
