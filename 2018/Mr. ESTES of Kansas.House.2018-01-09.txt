 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4578) to authorize certain counter terrorist  networks activities of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4578         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Counter Terrorist Network       Act''.       SEC. 2. DUTY TO COUNTER TERRORIST NETWORKS; DETAILS AND                     ASSIGNMENT.         Section 411 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       211) is amended--        (1) in subsection (g)(4)--        (A) in subparagraph (C)--        (i) in clause (vi), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (ii) by redesignating clause (vii) as clause (viii); and        (iii) by inserting after clause (vi) the following new       clause:        ``(vii) collaborate with appropriate agencies, including       Federal, State, local, tribal, and international entities, to       enhance border security through operations such as operations       that seek to disrupt and dismantle networks, including       foreign terrorist organizations (as such term is described in       section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.       1189)), that pose terrorist or other threats; and'';        (2) by redesignating subsections (p) through (r) as       subsections (q) through (s), respectively; and        (3) by inserting after subsection (o) the following new       subsection:        ``(p) Assignment of Personnel.--The Commissioner may detail       or otherwise assign personnel of U.S. Customs and Border       Protection to other appropriate agencies, including to serve       overseas in support of global information sharing partnership       operations in furtherance of enhancing border security,       including by preventing entry into the United States by       individuals known or suspected of being associated with a       network, including a foreign terrorist organization (as such       term is described in section 219 of the Immigration and       Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189)), that poses terrorist or       other threats.''.       SEC. 3. BRIEFINGS.         The Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection       shall biannually brief the Committee on Homeland Security of       the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland       Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate regarding       activities, during the prior six months, in furtherance of       clause (vii) of section 411(g)(4) of the Homeland Security       Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 211(g)(4)), as added by section 2 of       this Act. Such briefings may be provided in a classified       setting if the Commissioner determines such is appropriate.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Estes) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Vela) each will  control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kansas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kansas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4578, the Counter Terrorist  Network Act.   The fine men and women in uniform at U.S. Customs and Border  Protection are tasked with an incredibly important mission. Every day,  they protect our Nation from transnational criminal organizations,  human traffickers, and terrorists who wish to exploit vulnerabilities  at our Nation's borders.   To execute this critical mission, the CBP has developed a cadre of  subject matter experts that are well versed in counternetwork  operations. These experts work tirelessly at our Nation's seaports,  airports, and land border crossings, honing their skills, stopping the  flow of illicit goods and people, and creating actionable intelligence.   Given the fact that the CBP is uniquely positioned on our Nation's  front line, it would seem expected that members of the CBP would have  the authority to participate in counternetwork activities that target  terrorists and transnational threats, both domestically and  internationally.  [[Page H41]]    However, this is not the case. Currently, the CBP lacks the statutory  authority to assign CBP personnel to specialized counternetwork details  and liaison assignments with a national security focus.   H.R. 4578 seeks to mitigate this deficiency by giving the  Commissioner of the CBP the statutory authority to assign personnel to  these specialized task forces and collaborate with appropriate Federal,  State, local, and Tribal entities to enhance border security operations  that focus on disrupting and dismantling transnational criminal  organizations and foreign terrorist networks.   By granting this authority to the Commissioner, the CBP's  collaborative efforts will result in enhanced information sharing and  an increase in intelligence-driven enforcement operations.   Lastly, H.R. 4578 requires the Commissioner to provide a report to  Congress within 6 months of enactment, substantially describing the  ongoing efforts to defeat threats posed by transnational criminal and  foreign terrorist groups.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee  Ranking Member Vela for introducing this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the law enforcement  community and to vote in favor of this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge my colleagues  to support H.R. 4578, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes) that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill, H.R. 4578.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4559) to conduct a global aviation security review,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4559         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Global Aviation System       Security Reform Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Estes) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kansas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kansas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Katko for his leadership on this  important piece of legislation.   It is essential that we continue to improve aviation security in  order to stay ahead of the evolving threat posed by Islamist  terrorists. It is clear that terrorists around the world remain intent  on attacking aircraft.   That is why over the past year the Department of Homeland Security  and the Transportation Security Administration have worked to raise the  global level of aviation security. One area of potential improvement is  through working to increase security at overseas last point of  departure airports.   In October, I joined a bipartisan delegation of congressional members  from the House Homeland Security Committee to several of the largest  last point of departure airports, including Amman, Jordan; and  Frankfurt, Germany. We examined current threats to aviation security  and got to look at how our foreign partners have worked to stay ahead  of all the potential threats.   This legislation seeks to improve global aviation security standards  by directing the Administrator of the Transportation Security  Administration to conduct a comprehensive review of aviation security  implementation and challenges across the global aviation system. This  legislation will help improve coordination and outreach, both within  the United States Government and with foreign partners regarding  improvements to aviation security.   It makes sense for our security agencies to work with our foreign  allies who are facing the same security threat that we face. This  legislation will help the DHS locate and implement best practices,  which are being used overseas. The fight to protect travelers isn't one  that we face alone in America, and this threat isn't going to dissipate  anytime soon. That is why this legislation is focused on ensuring that  our agencies build partnerships and can learn from our foreign  partners.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4559, the Global Aviation  System Security Reform Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his leadership on this  legislation.   This legislation would require the TSA to conduct a global aviation  security review in order to improve aviation standards across the  global aviation system within 180 days of enactment.   The security review within this bill is required to include input  from the TSA's Office of Global Strategies, Office of Intelligence and  Analysis, and the Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement,  and must identify best practices for foreign partners.   While the TSA has taken tremendous steps to improve aviation security  at airports with direct service to the U.S., there is more that can be  done.   In the last 12 months, we have seen the global aviation threat  landscape evolve to include an increased threat to cargo security, and  passenger planes being targeted with bombs hidden in large electronic  devices.   The TSA is continually working with global partners and stakeholders  to ensure that aviation standards are being maintained and elevated as  needed.   Under this legislation, improvements that should be made to aviation  security will be highlighted for Congress.   This legislation has the potential of providing a very good roadmap  for Congress to address areas of improvement for global aviation  security and to ensure that we constantly strive towards the safest and  most secure aviation community.   Mr. Speaker, I note that, in the last couple of days, through the  holiday season, those people who were either stuck in airports, and  bags that were stacked, and people couldn't find bags are not  considered a security issue. It was a weather issue. But we understand  how crucial it is that the traveling public has needs in the free  flowing and secure flowing of aviation. Giving the Congress a roadmap,  I believe, is a very important step.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4559, the ``Global Aviation  System Security Reform Act of 2017.''   This legislation would require TSA to conduct a global aviation  security review in order to improve aviation standards across the  global aviation system within 180 days of enactment.   The security review within this bill is required to include input  from TSA's Office of Global Strategies, Office of Intelligence and  Analysis, and the Office of Security Policy and Industry Engagement,  and must identify best practices for foreign partners.

Under this legislation, improvements that should be made to aviation  security will be highlighted for Congress.   This legislation has the potential of providing a roadmap for  Congress to address areas of improvement for global aviation security,  and ensure that we constantly strive towards the safest and most secure  aviation community.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4559 will give this body a strong sense of the  direction for global aviation security improvements.   As threats to aviation security grow more sophisticated, this bill  seeks to ensure that TSA is keeping pace with the threat landscape.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me again emphasize the importance of identifying  best practices to be utilized by our system and to utilize these best  practices to improve the security for the traveling public.   H.R. 4559 will give this body a strong sense of direction for global  aviation security improvements. As threats to aviation security grow  more sophisticated, this bill seeks to ensure that the TSA is keeping  pace with the threat landscape.                                time  1330    Since I have no further speakers, I am closing by saying, with that,  I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4559.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. One of the  things that we are seeing today, in an increasingly dangerous world, is  how do we face these threats and work together. This bill is intended  to help work to be more efficient across not just America but with our  allies in making our aviation travel more safe and secure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3202) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security  to submit a report on cyber vulnerability disclosures, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3202         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cyber Vulnerability       Disclosure Reporting Act''.       SEC. 2. REPORT ON CYBER VULNERABILITIES.         (a) Report.--Not later than 240 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security       shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security of the       House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland       Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report that       contains a description of the policies and procedures       developed for coordinating cyber vulnerability disclosures,       in accordance with section 227(m) of the Homeland Security       Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 148(m)). To the extent possible, such       report shall include an annex with information on instances       in which such policies and procedures were used to disclose       cyber vulnerabilities in the year prior to the date such       report is required and, where available, information on the       degree to which such information was acted upon by industry       and other stakeholders. Such report may also contain a       description of how the Secretary is working with other       Federal entities and critical infrastructure owners and       operators to prevent, detect, and mitigate cyber       vulnerabilities.        (b) Form.--The report required under subsection (b) shall       be submitted in unclassified form but may contain a       classified annex.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Estes) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kansas?   There was no objection.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Kansas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerability  Disclosure Reporting Act.   It is hard to find an electronic device today that doesn't connect to  the internet. From smartphones to alarm clocks, everything is part of  the Internet of Things. Americans can do everything, from personal  banking to unlocking the front door, with the palm of their hands.   As the world has become increasingly interconnected, vulnerabilities  in computer code underlying these devices and the applications they run  can often expose the average American to exploitation by hackers,  criminals, and even bad actors from nation states.   As more and more critical and personal information is being stored on  the internet and more industrial systems are being operated  autonomously, it is vital that we are able to plug the holes in  vulnerable technology.   It seems like every day we read about another data breach that could  have been prevented if only the company had known about a vulnerability  in the product or network, occurrences such as the WannCry ransomware  that affected hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150  countries, and the recently reported meltdown that could affect  millions of personal computers throughout the world. That is why, in  this world of ever-increasing intrusions, we must do our best to make  sure our computer systems are as invulnerable to attack as possible.   The Department of Homeland Security was given the authority by the  Cybersecurity Act of 2015 to improve cybersecurity in the United States  through enhanced sharing of information about cybersecurity threats.   The Homeland Security Act of 2002 allows the Secretary to coordinate  with industry to develop departmental policies and procedures for  coordinating the disclosure of cyber vulnerabilities as described in  the Vulnerabilities Equities Policy and Process published by the White  House on November 15, 2016. This disclosure is important, as it  highlights vulnerabilities and allows the public and private sector to  work to prevent and mitigate cyber threats.   H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act, is an  important tool, in that it requires the Secretary of Homeland Security  to submit a report to Congress on their policies and procedures for  disclosing vulnerabilities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I thank the manager for his kind words.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerability  Disclosure Reporting Act. I very much want  [[Page H44]]  to thank the committee for bringing the Jackson Lee bill to the floor  and the work that we did on it in committee.   I wish to speak specifically to the work that is done on the Homeland  Security Committee as I discuss this legislation. I think it is very  important to take note of the fact that the ranking member works very  hard to generate very positive legislation and that we have been able  to see a large number of bills, some that I have been able to sponsor,  come to the floor of the House.   Mr. Speaker, therefore, I thank the chairman, Mr. McCaul, and the  ranking member for making the Homeland Security Committee so productive  in generating important legislation to ensure the security of this  Nation. I thank them for their leadership in putting the security of  our Nation's cyber assets first, whether they are computing resources  used in voting technology, or industrial control systems that support  the delivery of electricity, oil and gas, or management of  transportation systems that are vital to our Nation's economic health.   Mr. Speaker, I was chairman of the Transportation Security and  Infrastructure Protection Subcommittee some few sessions ago. This was  when infrastructure was included in the transportation and security  domain. I can tell you that, even then, we began to acknowledge the  crucialness of protecting the cyber system and how far-reaching cyber  systems can go, as far away as water systems, to bridges, to dams, and  in between, and to note that a lot of our cyber system, 80 percent of  it was in the private sector, probably more at this point.   H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act, which I  introduced, requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a  report on the policies and procedures developed for coordinating cyber  vulnerability disclosures.   The report will include an annex with information on instances in  which cybersecurity vulnerability disclosure policies and procedures  were used to disclose details on identified weaknesses in computing  systems or digital devices at risk.   The report will provide information on the degree to which the  information provided by DHS was used by industry and other  stakeholders.   The report may also contain a description of how the Secretary of  Homeland Security is working with other Federal entities and critical  infrastructure owners and operators to prevent, detect, and mitigate  cyber vulnerabilities.   It is important to restate that our cyber system is largely in the  private sector. It does not alleviate or eliminate the role that the  Federal Government should play. This legislation squarely places with  the Federal Government the responsibilities of dealing with  those critical infrastructure owners and operators to prevent, detect,  and mitigate cyber vulnerabilities.    The reason that I have worked to bring this bill before the full  House for consideration is a problem often referred to as a zero-day  event. A zero-day event describes a situation that network security  professionals may find themselves in when a previously unknown error or  flaw in computing code is exploited by a cybercriminal or terrorist.   The term ``zero-day event'' simply means that there is zero time to  prepare a defense against a cyber attack. That is not the place that we  would like to find ourselves.   When a defect in software is discovered, their network engineers and  software companies can work to develop a patch to fix the problem  before it can be exploited by those who may seek to do us harm.   We have evidence that the cyber world is a good world, but it can be  a dangerous world and impact the life and quality and democracy and  freedom of Americans. We want to be prepared and never have to face, in  this most powerful country in the world, something called a zero-day  event.   H.R. 3202 seeks a report on the ongoing Department of Homeland  Security's policies and procedures for coordinating cyber vulnerability  disclosures, such as zero-day events, with private sector partners.  Because vulnerabilities can be used by adversaries, it is important  that this sensitive information be managed securely so details are not  routinely made available, neither to the public nor to Congress.   H.R. 3202 provides the Congress with the opportunity to understand  the process and procedures used by the Department of Homeland Security  and the benefit these disclosures may have for private sector entities  participating in programs in support of cybersecurity.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Lillie Coney of my district and Jean de Pruneda,  a fellow on the Committee on Homeland Security, for their work on this  important legislation.   I urge Members of the House to vote in favor of H.R. 3202, the Cyber  Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act.   Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize again a point that I made earlier.  Because vulnerabilities can be used by adversaries, it is important  that this sensitive information be managed securely so details are not  routinely made available, neither to the public nor to Congress.   It is important to take note of the fact that the work we have to do  is ongoing and continuing.   H.R. 3202 will give this body important information on our  governmentwide efforts to secure civilian agency networks and the  collaborative ongoing work to provide information to private sector  partners on computing vulnerabilities. There is no security in keeping  zero-day events secure from disclosure and not working on solutions.   Cybersecurity is found in finding the zero-day events, creating  solutions to defend against them, and sharing the solutions broadly so  that they can be deployed. Once solutions are in place, the zero-day  event should be disclosed to the public so that scholars and  researchers can learn from the experience.   In essence, what we are saying is that we want to make sure that we  are in the driver's seat, that we know the vulnerabilities, that we can  confront the zero-day events, and that we can do that, meaning the  Federal Government, in working with the private sector to ensure that  we do protect this Nation.   Before I close, since we are dealing with Homeland Security Committee  issues, I think it is important to take note of the fact of the  crucialness and the importance of having a DACA fix and working  together, as we have been doing, to ensure that the thousands and  thousands of young people located across the Nation, who came here  through no fault of their own, have a serious pathway of protection, in  particular, the 140,000 that are in the State of Texas.   If we can stand here as bipartisan Members, I know that we can  continue to work on that crucial and important issue, which I stand  with those young people to ensure to get that done.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article by Morgan Chalfant,  ``Lawmakers approve `cyber vulnerability' bill,'' written in The Hill.                       [From the Hill, July 26, 2017]                Lawmakers Approve `Cyber Vulnerability' Bill                            (By Morgan Chalfant)         A House panel advanced legislation on Wednesday requiring       the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to give lawmakers       more information on how it discloses cyber vulnerabilities to       the private sector.        The legislation was sponsored by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee       (D-Texas) and received broad support from members of the       House Homeland Security Committee, including Chairman Michael       McCaul (R-Texas).        The bill would require Homeland Security Secretary John       Kelly to send a report to relevant congressional committees       describing policies and procedures used by the DHS to       coordinate the disclosure of what are called ``zero days''--      cyber vulnerabilities that are unknown to a product's       manufacturer and for which no patch exists.        The federal government decides whether to disclose zero       days to the private sector through the vulnerabilities       equities process (VEP), which was first acknowledged by the       Obama administration in 2014 but is still shrouded in       secrecy. While the government is said to err on the side of       disclosure, the VEP has proven controversial because so       little is known about it.        The process has attracted increased scrutiny in the wake of       the outbreak of the ``Wanna Cry'' ransomware, which is       believed to be based on a hacking tool developed by the       National Security Agency.        Lawmakers in both chambers have sought to boost       transparency of the VEP.        On Wednesday, Jackson Lee touted the legislation as       providing an opportunity for Congress to better understand       the process by which the DHS shares threat information  [[Page H45]]       with private companies and how that information benefits the       private sector.        ``Because vulnerabilities can be used by adversaries, it is       important that the sensitive information is managed securely       and the details are guarded against premature disclosure,''       Jackson Lee said during a committee markup.        ``There's no security in keeping zero day events secure and       not working on solutions,'' she said. ``The protection is in       finding the zero day events, creating solutions, sharing the       solutions broadly, then disclosing the vulnerabilities to the       public.''        The report mandated by the legislation would include an       annex of information on specific instances when the DHS       disclosed vulnerabilities to private sector companies in the       previous year and information on how industry acted on the       information. It could also contain information about how the       DHS is working with other federal agencies and departments,       as well as owners of critical infrastructure, to mitigate the       threat of these vulnerabilities.        Kelly would be required to submit the report, which would       be unclassified but could have a classified annex, within 240       days of the enactment of the legislation.        The committee approved the legislation in a voice vote with       no amendments, sending it to the full House for a vote.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support  H.R. 3202, and I thank my manager as well.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 3202, the Cyber  Vulnerabilities Disclosure Reporting Act.   I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for their  leadership on putting the security of our nation's cyber assets first  whether they are computing resources used in voting technology or  industrial control systems that support the delivery of electricity,  oil and gas, or management of transportation systems all are vital to  our nation.   H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act, which I  introduced, requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a  report on the policies and procedures developed for coordinating cyber  vulnerability disclosures.   The report will include an annex with information on instances in  which cyber security vulnerability disclosure policies and procedures  were used to disclose details on identified weaknesses in computing  systems that or digital devices at risk.   The report will provide information on the degree to which the  information provided by DHS was used by industry and other  stakeholders.   The report may also contain a description of how the Secretary of  Homeland Security is working with other Federal entities and critical  infrastructure owners and operators to prevent, detect, and mitigate  cyber vulnerabilities.   The reason that I worked to bring this bill before the Full House for  consideration is the problem often referred to as a ``Zero Day Event.''   Zero Day Events are vulnerabilities in software or firmware that have  gone undetected or undisclosed, but if exploited by terrorists could  cause great harm to computer networks, data, or complex computing  dependent systems.   Our nation's electric power grid; industrial control systems that  operate bridges, dams, water treatment facilities or food processing  plants are all vulnerable to the potential harm that could be caused if  a weakness in software or firmware goes undetected.   Critical infrastructure must be secured against terrorist attacks  that may use Zero Day Event vulnerabilities to attack critical  infrastructure or civilian government agency computing assets.   Zero Day Events discovered in commercial software applications such  as the ``Heartbleed'' and OpenSSL cryptographic software library  vulnerability.   Proactive and coordinated efforts are necessary to strengthen and  maintain secure critical infrastructure including assets that are vital  to public confidence in the cyber nation's safety.   This bill supports the ongoing work of the Department of Homeland  Security in security civilian agency and coordinating with private  sector computing network owners and operators.   The nation's critical infrastructure is diverse, complex, and  interdependent.   The overwhelming majority of critical infrastructure is privately  owned or managed.   Critical Infrastructure owners and operators are uniquely positioned  to manage risk to their operations and assets.   What is needed is a better understanding of how vulnerability  discoveries lead to better protection for computing networks.   Zero Day Events require a coordinated approach to assignment of  responsibility for developing patches or solutions, and a means of  effectively distributing the solution without alerting potential  terrorist or cyber criminals.   H.R. 3202 provides the Congress with the opportunity to understand  the process and procedures used by the Department of Homeland Security  and the benefit these disclosures may have for private sector entities  participating in programs in support of cybersecurity.   I thank Lillie Coney of my staff and Jean de Pruneda a Fellow on the  Committee on Homeland Security for their work on this important  legislation.   I ask my colleagues to vote for H.R. 3202.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of 3202, The ``Cyber Disclosure  Reporting Act.''   I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for their  leadership on putting the security of our nation's cyber assets first  whether they are computing resources used in voting technology or  industrial control systems that support the delivery of electricity,  oil and gas, or management of transportation systems that are vital to  our nation economic health.   H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act, which I  introduced, requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a  report on the policies and procedures developed for coordinating cyber  vulnerability disclosures.   The report will include an annex with information on instances in  which cyber security vulnerability disclosure policies and procedures  were used to disclose details on identified weaknesses in computing  systems that or digital devices at risk.   The report will provide information on the degree to which the  information provided by DHS was used by industry and other  stakeholders.   The report may also contain a description of how the Secretary of  Homeland Security is working with other Federal entities and critical  infrastructure owners and operators to prevent, detect, and mitigate  cyber vulnerabilities.   The reason that I worked to bring this bill before the Full House for  consideration is the problem often referred to as a ``Zero Day Event.''   A Zero Day Event describes the situation that network security  professionals may find themselves when a previously unknown error or  flaw in computing code is exploited by a cybercriminal or terrorist.   The term ``Zero Day Event'' simply means that there is zero time to  prepare a defense against a cyberattack.   When a defect in software is discovered then network engineers and  software companies can work to develop a ``patch'' to fix the problem  before it can be exploited by those who may seek to do harm.   H.R. 3202 seeks a report on the ongoing Department of Homeland  Security's policies and procedures for coordinating cyber vulnerability  disclosures such as Zero Day Events with private sector partners.   Because vulnerabilities can be used by adversaries it is important  that this sensitive information be managed securely so details are not  routinely made available neither to the public nor to Congress.   H.R. 3202 provides the Congress with the opportunity to understand  the process and procedures used by the Department of Homeland Security  and the benefit these disclosures may have for private sector entities  participating in programs in support of cybersecurity.   I thank Lillie Coney of my staff and Jean de Pruneda a Fellow on the  Committee on Homeland Security for their work on this important  legislation.   I urge members of the House to vote in favor of H.R. 3202, the Cyber  Vulnerabilities Disclosure Act.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3202 will give this body important information on  our government wide efforts to secure civilian agency networks and the  collaborative ongoing work to provide information to private sector  partners on computing vulnerabilities.   There's no security in keeping zero day events secure from disclosure  and not working on solutions.   Cyber security is found in finding the zero day events, creating  solutions to defend against them, and sharing the solutions broadly so  that they can be deployed.   Once solutions are in place the Zero Day Event should be disclosed to  the public so that scholars and researchers can learn from the  experience.   With that, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3202.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support this bill.  With an ever-increasing reliance on technology today, we need to make  sure that it is secure and safe for us to use and that the  vulnerabilities are addressed so that we can maintain a safe and secure  environment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by  [[Page H46]]  the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Estes) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 3202.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
