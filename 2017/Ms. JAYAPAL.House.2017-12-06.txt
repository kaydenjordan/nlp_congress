 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 38, the  Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act.   Our country is still reeling, Mr. Speaker, from two of the worst mass  shootings in modern American history.   From the 58 people murdered in Las Vegas to the 25 killed in a Texas  church, how can we face the families of these people and say that this  bill is the best we could do?   Studies show that States with laws permitting concealed carry  experience an estimated 13 to 15 percent increase in violent crime than  there would have been without the right to carry laws.   But we don't need academic studies, Mr. Speaker, to know that this  bill is wrong. We just need to look at real people.   One of my constituent's sisters was shot in Las Vegas and survived.  She is one of the lucky ones. They won't have any empty spots at the  holiday table this year because they lost someone to gun violence. Over  14,000 Americans, including parents of nearly 700 children, are not as  fortunate, and my heart goes out to them, especially as we enter the  holiday season.    Today, we have a critical opportunity to say enough is enough, and I  strongly urge my colleagues to stop this heinous bill from moving  forward.
