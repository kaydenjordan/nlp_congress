 I would yield my----    Madam President, in the summer of 2020, the senior  Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner, and I introduced the CHIPS for  America Act to reshore semiconductor manufacturing here in the United  States.   I didn't know much about semiconductors when we got started, but I  have learned a lot, and what I have learned is that this is an  essential commodity that we have over time offshored to places like  Asia that we need to reshore or bring back to America for our economy  and for national security.   Currently, 90 percent of the semiconductors in the world are  manufactured in Asia. Sixty-three percent of the semiconductors in the  world come from one place: Taiwan. If COVID has taught us one thing, it  has taught us how vulnerable our supply chains can be. And the truth  is, semiconductors have become so critical to our way of life, to our  economy, and to our national security, to everything we do, that if  that supply were blocked for some reason--either as a result of another  pandemic or a natural disaster or, Heaven forbid, a military conflict-- it would be devastating to the United States and our economy and our  national security.   That is why, when our bill was introduced as an amendment to the  Defense authorization bill, it passed 96 to 4. Clearly, we had strong,  bipartisan support here in the Senate. It took less than 7 months from  the time we introduced the bill until it became law, and then 6 months  later, the Senate passed the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, with  $52 billion in funding for the CHIPS Program.   Had this legislation been introduced years ago, before the pandemic,  I don't think it would have received either such quick action or such  broad bipartisan support. That is not because this type of investment  wasn't needed. There is clear data that showed a concerning trend in  U.S. chip manufacturing.   We saw big investments made by other countries in their own  capabilities and a business model primarily by Taiwan Semiconductor  Manufacturing Company, which I visited along with colleagues in Taipei  just a few months ago, where their business model is to manufacture  chips made and designed--I should say designed by companies that need  those semiconductors. But rather than build their own manufacturing  capability, their own foundry, they outsourced that to Taiwan  Semiconductor. So Taiwan and particularly Taiwan Semiconductor have  become the focal point for the production of semiconductors around the  world.   Well, there was general agreement that something should be done  before COVID-19, but it certainly wasn't at the top of everyone's  priority list. But, as I said, when the pandemic hit, the vulnerability  of our supply chains for everything from PPE--personal protective  equipment--to semiconductors became apparent.   Well, how has that affected everyday Texans, folks from Nevada or  Colorado? Well, we found out that an absence or a lack of  semiconductors meant empty car lots. You couldn't buy a new car. You  couldn't get a computer, perhaps for your child to be able to study  virtually during a quarantine period or during a period of virtual  learning at schools across the country.    We saw higher prices adding to the problem with inflation. Suddenly,  those concerning data points turned into real-world problems. Consumers  who never even dreamed or thought about a semiconductor before found  themselves impacted by this global shortage. The new car they had been  saving up for wasn't available. The Christmas gift they planned to  order for their children was out of stock.   While the lack of consumer products is a big problem, it pales in  comparison to the security risk created by the chip shortage. Simply  put, semiconductors are vital to our critical infrastructure. Our grid  keeps on the lights and makes it possible to heat our buildings during  the cold of winter. They run our cell towers that enable us to talk on  our cell phones or download data and do  [[Page S513]]  searches on the web. They are critical to our energy grid, our water  treatment plants, and our agricultural sector. Semiconductor chips make  it all possible.   As I said, our national defense also depends on semiconductors. When  we send our troops on any mission by air, sea, land, or cyber space,  they need the best equipment available, and usually what that means is  the most advanced technology available. Advanced fighters, quantum  computing, missile defense--all rely on semiconductors.   I asked my staff to research back when Israel was using the Iron Dome  missile defense system to knock rockets out of the sky that were  destined to hit population centers in Israel. I said: Find out for me  how many semiconductors are in each one of those missile defense  interceptors. They came back with a figure of 750 chips in each one of  those missile defense interceptors.   So it is not hard to imagine we would be in big trouble if a lack of  supply crippled any of these functions, and unfortunately, it is a real  possibility. Over the years, domestic chip production has steadily  dropped as other countries have upped their manufacturing capabilities.  As I said, 90 percent of that manufacturing is now in Asia.   We had the idea--and it is not a crazy idea--that if somebody could  make things cheaper overseas, then that is the most efficient way for  that product to be made, but we didn't calculate these supply chain  problems which COVID-19 exposed.   But we know, as I said, that if there were another pandemic or let's  say a natural disaster or a military conflict, the People's Republic of  China has made no secret about its plan to unify with Taiwan. President  Xi has explicitly said invasion of Taiwan will happen, and he has asked  that his military be ready by the year 2027. But we don't actually know  what his timetable may be, and if China follows through on its threats  to invade Taiwan and interrupts that supply chain of critical  semiconductors, it would be dramatically bad for the United States and  the world. Our national security and critical infrastructure could be  hobbled by a single decision made by the President of the People's  Republic of China.   I was reminded of Jimmy Carter's 1980 speech at the State of the  Union when he spoke about instability in the Persian Gulf and Soviet  threats to the movement of Middle East oil through the Strait of  Hormuz. President Carter said at the time--when we were so dependent on  imported oil from the Middle East--he said any attempt to gain control  of the Persian Gulf and to block the Strait of Hormuz would be  ``regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of  America.''   You could say the same about a blockade that prevented us from  getting semiconductors from Asia. Just as the Soviets could have  blocked the Strait of Hormuz and choked off the global supply, the  People's Republic of China could seize Taiwan's supply of chips and its  manufacturing facilities and hold the rest of the world at risk. The  United States and our allies would be left fighting for the crumbs,  what was left over.    Our country isn't the only one, fortunately, that spotted this  blinking red light. Other countries are pouring tens of billions of  dollars into new semiconductor foundries. The European Union is now  investing up to $35 billion. South Korea is investing $65 billion. The  People's Republic of China is reportedly investing $150 billion in  semiconductor manufacturing.   The United States cannot be left behind, and we can't drag our feet.  Unlike PPE--personal protective equipment--or hand sanitizer shortages,  this one cannot be solved quickly. Companies that make other  technologies can't just adjust to the lack of semiconductors. In order  to build a single chip, you need very expensive, highly advanced  equipment, you need very skilled workers, and you need a lot of time.  It can take literally months to build a single chip, and that is  assuming you have the facilities and the expertise to do so.   So it is not hyperbole to say that there are life-or-death  consequences to a reliable semiconductor supply chain, which is why  this has been such a high-priority item on a bipartisan basis here in  the Senate.   The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act included $52 billion to fund  this program and ensure that, once again, we could maintain a strong  supply of advanced semiconductors. That legislation, which included an  emergency appropriation, passed by a vote of 68 to 32, which is pretty  impressive these days with the polarization that we are all dealing  with--a strong, bipartisan vote.   Unfortunately, the momentum that bill had ended when it got to the  House of Representatives. The Speaker of the House had other  priorities, and months and months went by. Our House colleagues said  they wanted to pass their own version of this legislation, and they  have every right to do so, but time is not on our side, and they need  to act quickly. Every day that goes by is a day that China inches ahead  of the United States and that we fall further behind.   We need to get this funding out the door and to begin that  construction of these fabs, which take a considerable amount of time to  build, underway as soon as we can.   In a year's time, Senator Warner and I introduced the CHIPS Act, it  became law, and the Senate funded the program we created. We are not  ordinarily known for our speed, and the quick timeline is indicative of  how urgent this problem really is.   I don't have any excuse for the House's failure to address this issue  for 7 months, but now it sounds like they are beginning to think about  addressing it.   Well, I can understand why the process would take so long if the  House was actually engaged in a bipartisan negotiation, but,  unfortunately, it looks like they are going to pass a partisan bill  with no Republican support because they were not included in the  discussions. The Democratic committee chairmen refused to consult with  the Republican ranking members, and it looks like they are going to  produce a partisan bill.   Well, that bill I do not believe would pass the U.S. Senate. The  House bill contains $8 billion for an unaccountable U.N. climate slush  fund, which has provided more than $100 million for the People's  Republic of China.   What we are talking about--what we should be talking about--is  countering threats from China, not helping China.   The partisan bill from the House has also added provisions related to  immigration, from creating new types of visas to removing green card  caps. Immigration is an important issue. We ought to be talking about  it. We ought to be doing something about it, but not on a partisan  basis.   These changes should not be tacked on to this legislation at the last  hour. They need to be debated and marked up by the appropriate  committees and given the sort of careful consideration that they  deserve.   The House bill also includes additional handouts to favorite  political constituencies, from massive slush funds to burdensome new  labor requirements. Organized labor would be the big winner in the  House bill, but not rank-and-file Americans.   It is not just what is in this bill that is a problem. I am talking  about the House bill, now. It is what was left out. The bill's trade  title is completely inadequate. It extends and expands trade adjustment  assistance, but it completely excludes trade promotion authority. We  know that trade promotion authority is critical to negotiating strong  trade agreements without lengthy delays.   So I regret and I am very disappointed that the House has wasted  available time, particularly when this vulnerability to the  semiconductor supply chain is so grave and so urgent.   We have a responsibility to secure our most critical supply chains  while creating thousands of high-paying American jobs and boosting our  global competitiveness. So I hope that once the House does pass a bill  that we quickly form a formal conference committee in order to make the  final product look a whole lot like the Senate bill that we passed with  strong bipartisan majorities.   Let me just comment in closing that I am a big fan of the Wall Street  Journal. I read it or, at least, parts of it every day. But I was  concerned that a treatment of this legislation in the  [[Page S514]]  Wall Street Journal editorial yesterday--actually, it was this  morning--either was unclear or provided misinformation about the  importance of these semiconductors.   The title of the editorial was ``The Be More Like China Act.'' And  suffice it to say, they were not fans of either the House or the Senate  bill.   But they made this statement. They said: ``[T]he Pentagon is already  providing incentives to make advanced chips in the United States, and  [Taiwan Semiconductor] is building a $12 billion plant in Arizona.''   To the second issue, the reason why Taiwan Semiconductor  Manufacturing Company is building a fab in Arizona is in the  expectation that the Senate will pass this $52 billion incentive  program, and through the Department of Commerce, grants will be made  which will level the playing field. When it comes to the cost of  building these fabs in the United States, it costs roughly 30 percent  more to build a manufacturing facility, a fab, in the United States  than it does in Asia, which is the reason why they are mainly there.   But I think what the Wall Street Journal was talking about was  something very different than what we are trying to do here with  reshoring manufacturing of semiconductors.   The Wall Street Journal, I believe, is talking about the Department  of Defense's zero-trust semiconductor purchasing model. In other words,  we needed a trusted foundry to build semiconductors for our most  important weapon systems and aircraft, like the F-35, and so this is  not a manufacturing facility that will supply the semiconductors that  are needed by our growing economy and for national security. This is a  very narrow, targeted program at the Department of Defense, and, like I  said, the Department of Defense's secure foundry or trusted supplier  program is not a substitute for what we are trying to do here.   Finally, let me say that there is broad bipartisan agreement about  how important it is that we get this CHIPS Act passed.   Secretary Raimondo, the Secretary of Commerce, whom I have come to  know and come to work with and respect, said to CNBC yesterday: ``The  U.S. is dangerously dependent on Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturing,  which is in a fragile situation, which I have tried to describe.''   I agree with Secretary Raimondo. This is something that the President  wants done. This is something the Senate has spoken to and passed on a  broad bipartisan basis, and this is something that we need to do  without further delay.   So I hope the House will pass the bill if for no other reason than to  give us a bill that we can conference the Senate bill with. But in the  end, the Senate bill needs to be the template for what is ultimately  done by the conference committee and what is ultimately passed by the  U.S. Congress.    Madam President.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, due to  the winter storms that are shutting down airports around the country,  Senator Lee, the Senator from Utah, who objects to this unanimous  consent request is not here, and I had the bad luck to be here when he  communicated to me his desire that I make an objection on his behalf.   I would say to my friend from Colorado, I am a noncombatant on this  issue. I didn't hold his bill. But I know Senator Lee does have an  amendment, I believe, he wants to offer, and certainly he wants to be  here to participate in the discussion and vote on the bill. So on his  behalf, I object.    Mr. President, I want to recognize and  congratulate Gary Kelly, the CEO of Southwest Airlines, as he hands  over the reins of this great Texas-based company and transitions to a  new role as executive chairman.    Southwest is a remarkable success story that captures the spirit of  Texas--bold, innovative, and unafraid to take risks, while also warm,  hospitable, and focused on people. Those words describe Southwest, and  they equally describe the company's devoted leader, Gary Kelly.    Gary is a seventh-generation Texan who has served the people of  Southwest in various capacities since 1986, including nearly two  decades as CEO. Looking back on those years, it is incredible to recall  the many storms Gary and the people of Southwest navigated--years of  depressed travel demand following the September 11 attacks, the great  recession, and now a global pandemic. Through it all, Gary provided  steadfast leadership and support to the airline's more than 56,000  employees and countless beloved customers.    I've been proud to work with Gary and his incredible team over the  years, most notably on the Payroll Support Program, which protected the  jobs of airline employees during the most turbulent days of the  pandemic. Throughout its 50-year history, Southwest has never laid off  employees--a point of great pride for the airline's people-focused CEO.  It's abundantly clear that the love flows both ways. I remember  visiting Southwest's headquarters in Dallas and seeing the admiration  on employees' faces as they spoke about their dedicated and talented  leader.    Congratulations to Gary Kelly on nearly two decades as the CEO of  Southwest Airlines. As he transitions to a new leadership role, I have  no doubt that he will build upon his legacy of dedicated service to  Southwest and its employees.                            ____________________
