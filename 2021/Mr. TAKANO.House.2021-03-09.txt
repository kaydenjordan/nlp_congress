 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Over the years, Republicans and wealthy corporate interests have  chipped away at labor rights, stripping workers of their power and  worsening economic inequality in the process.   Since March 2020, as the pandemic has ravaged our communities,  billionaires' wealth has grown by $1.3 trillion. Meanwhile, millions of  Americans are still unemployed, and working families are struggling to  pay for food, rent, medical bills, and other basic necessities.   It is time to put an end to antiunion activities. They are illegal  power grabs by antilabor special interests that put profits over the  needs of working people.   On our path to economic recovery, unions will offer us a way to build  back our middle class stronger than ever before. Let's pass this bill  to give more power to American workers, reduce economic inequality, and  support working families.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letter from The Leadership  Conference on Civil and Human Rights in support of the Protecting the  Right to Organize Act of 2021.                                          The Leadership Conference                                       on Civil and Human Rights,                                      Washington, DC, March 8, 2021.      Vote Yes on H.R. 842, the Protecting the Right to Organize           Act of 2021.         Dear Representative, On behalf of The Leadership Conference       on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition charged by its diverse       membership of more than 220 national organizations to promote       and protect the civil and human rights of all person in the       United States, we urge you to vote YES on H.R. 842, the       Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act of 2021.       Protecting the right to collectively bargain is a top       priority for the civil and human rights community, and The       Leadership Conference will include your vote on H.R. 842 in       our Voting Record for the 117th Congress.        Economic security is inextricably linked to civil and human       rights, and enabling working people to exercise the right to       form unions and engage in meaningful collective bargaining is       one of the most effective, efficient, and comprehensive ways       to promote economic security for individuals and their       families. Unions allow working people to have a stronger       voice to advocate for fair wages, safer working conditions,       and better workplace standards. A working person covered by a       union contract earns, on average, 11.2 percent more in wages       than a nonunionized worker in the same sector with similar       education and experience, and the gains are even more       pronounced for workers of color. Black workers, for example,       earn 14 percent more than their non-union counterparts, and       Latino workers earn 20 percent more. Unions also help close       race and gender wage gaps, and unionized workers enjoy safer       workplaces, stronger health care benefits, more predictable       work schedules, greater access to paid sick days, and better       retirement benefits.        The benefits of unions have become even more pronounced       during the COVID crisis. Too many essential workers during       this pandemic have lacked basic protections on the job,       leading to thousands of working people becoming infected with       the coronavirus, some dying as a result. Many sites of       coronavirus outbreaks during the pandemic were at workplaces       that offered low-pay and limited, if any, benefits to       workforces with large concentrations of people of color,       women, and immigrants--communities, who because of decades of       systemic discrimination, have fewer resources to withstand a       health emergency. Working people with a union, however, were       better able to negotiate enhanced health and safety measures,       premium pay, and paid sick leave during this crisis. Research       also shows that unionized workers have felt less fearful       speaking out about health and safety hazards on the job.        Despite the right to form unions and collectively bargain,       attacks on unions have led to a decline in the share of       working people covered by collective bargaining agreements       over the past 40 years, a trend that has mirrored the rise in       income inequality in America. It is clear, however, that       working people want to join unions. There is a 400 percent       gap between the percentage of working people who say they       want a union--48 percent--and the percentage of unionized       workers, around 12 percent. Workers want unions because they       have seen how having a collective voice allows them to win       better pay and benefits, stronger health and safety       protections, and more fairness on the job. The PRO Act would       streamline the process for forming a union, ensure that new       unions are able to negotiate a first collective bargaining       agreement, and hold employers accountable when they violate       workers' rights.        Though the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) was meant to       encourage collective bargaining, in the 80 years since its       passage, nearly every amendment to the law has made it harder       for working people to form unions. This allows employers to       take advantage of weaknesses in the law to undermine the       rights of working people, including firing pro-union workers,       holding mandatory meetings to bash unions, and refusing to       bargain a first contract after a union is formed. These       hostile behaviors, which occur at the expense of the       employee, are often without consequence for the employer. The       PRO Act seeks to remedy this imbalance by bolstering workers'       rights and creating accountability for employers that engage       in anti-union behavior.        The PRO Act would reform existing labor laws and protect       the right to join a union by:        Imposing stronger remedies when employers interfere with       workers' rights. The PRO  [[Page H1145]]       Act would institute civil penalties for violations of the       NLRA and would also require the National Labor Relations       Board (NLRB) to go to court for an injunction to immediately       reinstate terminated workers if the NLRB believes an employer       has illegally retaliated against workers for union activity.       The PRO Act would also give workers the right to go to court       on their own to seek relief, bringing labor law in line with       other workplace laws that allow for a private right of       action.        Strengthening workers' right to join a union and       collectively bargain over working conditions. The PRO Act       would prohibit employers from holding mandatory anti-union       meetings and engaging in other coercive anti-union tactics.       The law would establish a process for reaching a first       agreement when workers organize, employing mediation, and       then, if necessary, binding arbitration. The PRO Act would       also allow employers and unions to agree upon a ``fair       share'' clause requiring all workers who are covered by the       collective bargaining agreement to contribute a fair share       fee towards the cost of bargaining and administering the       agreement, even in so-called ``right-to-work'' states. The       PRO Act will also help level the playing field for workers by       repealing the prohibition on secondary boycotts and       prohibiting employers from firing workers during lawful       strikes.        Unrigging the rules that are tilted against workers. The       PRO Act tightens the definitions of independent contractor       and supervisor to help prevent misclassification and make       sure that all eligible workers can unionize if they choose to       do so. The PRO Act also makes clear that workers can have       more than one employer, and that both employers need to       engage in collective bargaining over the terms and conditions       of employment that they control or influence. To create       transparency in labor-management relations, the PRO Act would       require employers to post notices that inform workers of       their NRLA rights and to disclose contracts with consultants       hired to persuade workers on how to exercise their rights.        Through organizing, bargaining, litigation, legislative,       and political advocacy, unions and the labor movement have       played a significant role in advancing the rights and       interests of people of color and women in the workplace and       in our society overall. Unions can best play this role when       the right of workers to organize and bargain is fully       protected and can be freely exercised.        Working people in America need--and have a right to enjoy--      the benefits that result from collective bargaining and union       membership. We urge you to vote yes on H.R. 842, the       Protecting the Right to Organize Act of 2021, to help ensure       that working people are paid fairly, treated with dignity,       and have a voice on the job.            Sincerely,      Wade Henderson,        Interim President and CEO.      LaShawn Warren,        Executive Vice President for Government Affairs.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on Veterans' Affairs be discharged from further consideration of the  bill (H.R. 1276) to authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  furnish COVID-19 vaccines to certain individuals, and for other  purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
