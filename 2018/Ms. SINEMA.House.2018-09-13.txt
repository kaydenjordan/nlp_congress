 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of our country's  veterans, who make great sacrifices to keep America safe.   When they return home from service, it is our responsibility to  ensure they receive the care and support of a grateful Nation. For far  too many veterans, that responsibility is not fulfilled. The  government's failure has tragic consequences for those struggling with  mental health illnesses.   September is Suicide Prevention Month. Americans across the country  take time to raise awareness about the tragedy of suicide. We lose an  estimated 20 veterans to suicide each day, and that is unacceptable.   Every year since I have been in Congress, we have brought together  Republicans and Democrats to draw attention to veteran suicide and send  a clear message that this epidemic must end.   Honoring our commitment to veterans is not a partisan issue. We know  the only way to achieve real, lasting change for our Nation's bravest  men and women is to bring both parties together to solve this problem.    Today, Members from both sides of the aisle have joined me to bring  awareness to veteran suicide and we are working together to find  solutions. I know we can make bipartisan progress, because we have done  it before. We have shown it is possible for both parties to work  together to improve veterans' mental healthcare.   After hearing the tragic story of a young Arizona veteran who lost  his life to suicide in 2013, my team worked across the aisle to pass a  bill that improved lifesaving VA mental health services for veterans  with classified experience. It took 3 years of hard work, but our bill  is now law, and it helps veterans successfully transition to civilian  life.   It is important progress, but there is still so much work left to do.   We must serve our bravest men and women, just as they have served us.   We challenge the VA, the Department of Defense, and our fellow  lawmakers to join us in confronting the tragedy of veteran suicide. We  must do more to honor our commitment to American's veterans.   Today and every day, we stand with military families who have lost a  loved one to the tragedy of suicide, and we say to you, your family's  sacrifice will not be forgotten. We will not stop until every veteran  receives the care that he or she needs.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Fitzpatrick), my friend and colleague, and I am grateful to be joined  this afternoon in this Special Order for his comments.    Mr. Speaker, for many veterans, the return to civilian  life can feel overwhelming. Ensuring enough community support and  mental health resources are available is essential.   We recently heard from Andrew, who lives in Chandler, Arizona. He  joined the Marine Corps at 17 years old when he said he was ``full of  motivation and excitement'' to serve. ``I wanted to do my part to  protect America,'' Andrew said.   As an antitank assaultman, Andrew fought beside incredible marines in  Iraq, and when he finally returned  [[Page H8252]]  home, he said he returned with memories of death. Andrew leaned on  loved ones and his faith to pull him out of his darkness.   Ever since, he has continued his healing journey by serving his  fellow veterans. He presses forward with the values instilled on him by  the Marine Corps: honor, courage, and commitment.   Responsibility to care for our veterans belongs to all of us. That is  why we are working with those who interact with veterans each and every  day: letter carriers, librarians, grocery store clerks, and academic  advisers. We are giving community members the tools they need to  support veterans every day right where they live and work. We are also  working to increase the number of peer supports available to veterans.   There are veterans like Andrew who used their experiences, struggles,  and accomplishments to help fellow veterans successfully navigate the  transition to civilian live.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to have a colleague and friend of mine  joining us in this Special Order this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms.  Kuster), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Mast), my friend and colleague. I thank the Congressman so much for the  work that he has done to join us today. I appreciate it.     Mr. Speaker, I want to take a moment to thank my  colleague and friend, Congressman Mast. While he spoke very eloquently  about his fellow veterans, and commitment to service, and leaving no  man behind, he is very humble, and didn't share all of his own  experiences.   Congressman Mast served as a staff sergeant in the United States Army  and has earned a Bronze Star, Purple Heart, and many other awards for  his bravery during battle. And when Congressman Mast joined Congress, I  will never forget the first time we had a few moments to spend  together, and I asked him about his own experiences in the military and  since then, and the change that happened in his life after he was  injured in battle defending our country.   I will never forget Congressman Mast's response, which is one of such  strength and character, and, I believe, provides such inspiration to  other men and women in our country, both those in uniform and those who  have returned to civilian life as veterans.   I want to thank him for his service and for his incredible dedication  to helping his fellow men and women who have returned home from battle  as well.   Earlier in our Special Order, I mentioned the story of a young  veteran in my district. His name was Sergeant Daniel Somers. Sergeant  Somers was an Army veteran of two tours in Iraq. He served on Task  Force Lightning, an intelligence unit. He ran over 400 combat missions  as a machine gunner in the turret of a Humvee. Part of his role  required him to interrogate dozens of terror suspects. His work was  deemed classified.   Like many veterans, Daniel was haunted by the war when he returned  home. He suffered from flashbacks, nightmares, depression, and  additional symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, made worse by a  traumatic brain injury. Daniel needed help.   He and his family asked for help, but, unfortunately, the VA enrolled  Sergeant Somers in group therapy sessions, which he could not attend  for fear of disclosing classified information.                                time  1645    Despite requests for individualized counseling, or some other  reasonable accommodation to allow Sergeant Somers to receive  appropriate care for his PTSD, the VA delayed providing Sergeant Somers  with support and appropriate care.   Like many, Sergeant Somers' isolation got worse when he transitioned  to civilian life. He tried to provide for his family, but he was unable  to work due to his disability.   Sergeant Somers struggled with the VA bureaucracy. His disability  appeal had been pending for more than 2 years in the system without  resolution. Sergeant Somers did not get the help he needed in time.   On June 10, 2013, Sergeant Somers wrote a letter to his family. I  share a part of his letter every year here on the floor, in memory of  Daniel's pain and in love for his family. In this letter, Daniel said:  ``I am not getting better, I am not going to get better, and I will  most certainly deteriorate further as time goes on.''   He goes on to say: ``I am left with basically nothing. Too trapped in  a war to be at peace, too damaged to be at war. Abandoned by those who  would take the easy route, and a liability to those who stick it out-- and thus deserve better. So you see, not only am I better off dead, but  the world is better without me in it.   ``This is what brought me to my actual final mission.''   No one who returns home from serving our country should ever feel  like he or she has nowhere to turn, which is why I am committed to  continuing to work on both sides of the aisle to ensure that no veteran  ever feels trapped like Sergeant Somers did and that all of our  veterans have access to appropriate mental healthcare.   But Sergeant Somers' story is too familiar to many military families.  His parents, Howard and Jean, were devastated by the loss of their son,  but they bravely shared Sergeant Somers' story and created a mission of  their own.   Their mission is to ensure that their son's memory brought to light  America's deadliest war: the 20 veterans that we lose every day to  suicide.   Many of my colleagues here in Washington have met with Howard and  Jean. They are working with Congress and the VA to share their  experiences with the VA healthcare system and find ways to improve care  for veterans and their families.   We worked very closely with Howard and Jean to develop and sign into  law the Sergeant Daniel Somers Classified Veterans Access to Care Act.  This is a law that ensures that veterans like Daniel, who have had  classified or sensitive experiences, can access appropriate mental  health services at the VA.   Our law directs the Secretary of the VA to establish standards and  procedures to ensure that any veteran who participated in classified  missions or served in a sensitive setting may access mental healthcare  that fully accommodates his or her obligation to not improperly  disclose classified information.   The law also directs the Secretary to disseminate guidance to  employees of the Veterans Health Administration, including mental  health professionals, on standards and procedures about how to best  engage veterans during the course of mental health treatment with  respect to classified information.   Finally, our law directs the Secretary to allow veterans with  classified experiences to self-identify, so they can quickly receive  care in an appropriate setting.   But that victory is just one small step forward. We still have so  much work left to do.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for joining us this evening to  talk about the scourge of veteran suicide. This is our sixth year of  hosting this Special Order in a bipartisan way together. I look forward  to the year when we do not need this Special Order because we have  ended the crisis of veteran suicide in our country.   Until such time, I pledge to continue working with my colleagues to  not just tell the stories of veterans who are struggling, veterans who  have made it, or veterans we have lost, but to celebrate our victory of  overcoming this crisis and ending this scourge.   Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), my friend, who is going to share some of his  thoughts and close out our Special Order hour. I thank Congressman Hill  for joining us this evening.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
