 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today at a time of great sorrow,  anger, and fear for our Nation. We face the confluence of a health  crisis, an economic depression, and a killing that laid bare the racial  injustice that still taints our country.   The horrific death of George Floyd in Minnesota was reprehensible. It  was beyond a tragedy. It was a crime.   As Americans, we all need to frankly acknowledge and work to resolve  our longstanding, ongoing struggles with racial inequality. The  President should help to heal the racial divisions in this country. It  is at times like this that a President needs to speak to the Nation to  pledge to right wrongs and to calm inflamed passions.   The right to gather in protest of injustice is enshrined in our  Constitution. The desire for reconciliation is in our national  character. We must join together to ensure that the legacy of George  Floyd is of progress, not deepening division and hatred.   Let me be clear. The vast majority of our law enforcement officers  are brave men and women devoted to protecting our families, our  belongings, and our communities. They deserve our heartfelt gratitude  as they willingly risk their lives for ours when danger strikes.   In Maine, we are fortunate to have so many terrific professional law  enforcement officers devoted to their duty and devoted to doing what is  right.   It is, however, imperative that we examine and act on the racial  disparities in law enforcement where they occur.   I cannot believe that George Floyd would have had his neck stepped on  and the life squeezed out of him had he been White. Sadly, there are  many other examples as well.   I remember our own Senator Tim Scott describing his being stopped by  a police officer while driving many times during one year, even though  he was abiding by all the traffic laws. That is harassment and simply  wrong.   In confronting these problems, we would do well to heed the words of  Congressman Lewis in response to the violence that overwhelmed peaceful  protests in his city of Atlanta last weekend. Of course, we all know  that the Congressman is a civil rights icon as well as an extraordinary  Member of Congress. He said this:         Justice has, indeed, been denied for far too long. Rioting,       looting, and burning is not the way. Organize. Demonstrate.       Sit-in. Stand-up. Vote. Be constructive, not destructive.       History has proven time and again that non-violent, peaceful       protest is the way to achieve the justice and equality that       we all deserve.    Those are powerful words from Congressman Lewis. Those are words that  should motivate and guide all of us.   Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once said:         Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that.       Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.    By continuing to listen to one another and being guided by the words  of Congressman Lewis, Dr. Martin Luther King, and the mayor of Atlanta,  we can work toward improving social justice and eliminating racial  disparities in this country, and we can drive out the forces of  bigotry.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
