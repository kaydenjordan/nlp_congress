 Mr. Speaker, this is an excellent piece of  legislation.   Like Ms. Frankel mentioned during her comments on the floor, we had  the opportunity to go to Peru together to visit children who were way  up in the mountains being protected from those deviants who wanted to  traffic them not only in Peru, but other parts of South America.   I had, also, the opportunity to go to Costa Rica and meet some young  girls who were being trafficked in Costa Rica and into other foreign  countries. I remember one girl named Lilli. She was 7 years of age when  I met her. She did not talk at all, even though she had the physical  ability to talk, but she did not talk because of the trauma that she  had been through before she had been rescued and put in that shelter in  Costa Rica.   There are a lot of little girls like Lilli throughout the world,  including in the United States. Societies must make the decision now  that we will not tolerate the stolen innocence of young children by  those who sell them on the marketplace of slavery for money, whether  that is the trafficker, the slave master, or the buyer, the consumer.  We, as a world, cannot tolerate that.   The United States has taken the lead on international trafficking  and, I believe, on trafficking here in the U.S. This legislation, the  TARGET Act, makes it clear that we are not going to tolerate this  conduct and that those people who act this way in the slave trade are  going to be held accountable for their conduct, and the consequences  for what they do are not going to be pleasant. Plus, we are going to  rescue those young children.   I support this legislation, Mr. Speaker.   And that is just the way it is.    Madam Speaker, it looks like Turkish President  Erdogan has brought his brutal crackdown on human rights to Washington,  D.C.   For years, Erdogan has attacked Turkey's democratic institutions,  undermined the rule of law, and violated Turkish civil liberties. On  Tuesday, several bullies violently assaulted protesters outside the  Turkish Embassy here in Washington. These Gestapo-type body guards beat  peaceful demonstrators, in one case kicking a woman lying on the  ground. This type of behavior is unacceptable.   Erdogan is becoming a Turkish dictator. One of the traits of a  dictator is to violently quash opposition. He is showing he doesn't  believe in the democratic principles of free speech and peaceful  assembly. But, Madam Speaker, we will have no foreign tyrant violating  these sacred rights on American soil without consequences.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
