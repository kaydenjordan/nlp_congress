 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and  for his extraordinary leadership on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 372, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of  2017, would partially repeal a longstanding antitrust exemption  established by the McCarran-Ferguson Act with respect to the business  of health and dental insurance.   To qualify for this limited antitrust exemption, an insurer must be  engaged in the business of insurance regulated by a State that is not  designed to boycott, coerce, or intimidate.   While these requirements somewhat constrain anticompetitive conduct,  it is clear that they do not preclude the most egregious antitrust  violations, such as price fixing, bid rigging, and market allocation,  by health insurance providers.                                time  1500    Health insurers should not be immune from antitrust scrutiny,  particularly when they collude to increase prices, reduce availability,  or otherwise engage in anticompetitive behavior.   That is why House Democrats passed a measure that is substantively  similar to H.R. 372, in 2010, by a vote of 406-19, and in 2009, as  well. In 1988, 1992, and 1994, Judiciary Democrats likewise favorably  reported legislation to completely repeal the McCarran-Ferguson Act.   While H.R. 372 is only a partial repeal of this exemption, I  encourage my colleagues to support this measure. But let me be  perfectly clear about three things:   First, promoting competition in health insurance markets cannot occur  at the expense of the strong protections established by the Affordable  Care Act to make health markets more efficient and prohibiting  discriminatory insurance policies. These protections are ``textbook  measures that help promote competition in the insurance marketplace,''  as Professor Tim Greaney, a leading antitrust expert, testified in  2015.   Second, contrary to President Trump's suggestions on Twitter,  repealing McCarran-Ferguson's antitrust exemption for health insurance  will not remove State barriers or create new pathways for insurance  companies to compete and offer products across State lines.   This simplistic approach to healthcare policy overlooks the fact that  the Affordable Care Act already allows States to establish healthcare  choice compacts to provide for cross-State insurance sales, while five  States have already enacted out-of-State purchasing laws. But these  laws have done little to encourage cross-State insurance sales because  health insurers are simply not interested in selling these products  across State lines.   The barriers to entry into health insurance markets ``are not truly  regulatory, they are financial and they are network,'' as Professor  Sabrina Corlette of Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute has  observed.   Notwithstanding President Trump's exaggerated claims to the contrary,  it is also clear that enacting this legislation is not a precondition  for Congress  [[Page H2270]]  authorizing cross-State insurance sales.   My Republican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee agree, noting in  their report on the bill that ``the general consensus, including among  witnesses at the most recent Judiciary hearing on the Competitive  Health Insurance Reform Act, is that if Congress decides to allow  insurers to sell across State lines, such action does not necessarily  require a repeal of McCarran-Ferguson.''   And third, there is no evidence that enacting this bill alone will  improve the affordability or availability of health insurance.   According to the Congressional Budget Office, the effect of H.R. 372  on health insurance premiums ``would probably be quite small,'' and  enacting the bill will have ``no significant net effect on the premiums  that private insurers would charge for health or dental insurance.''   Additionally, because the McCarran-Ferguson Act does not apply to  mergers, H.R. 372 will not prevent further concentration in health  insurance markets.   The truth is, Mr. Speaker, if Republicans were serious about actually  enforcing the antitrust laws, they would fully fund the antitrust  agencies. But as we know from the Trump administration's budget  blueprint, Republicans plan to make deep cuts to the funding of  enforcement agencies like the Justice Department, likely to the  detriment of economic opportunity and fair competition.   In addition, President Trump has not even nominated heads to the  antitrust agencies. According to the Partnership for Public Service,  even though he has been in office for 60 days, President Trump has not  picked a nominee for 497 of the 553 positions requiring Senate  confirmation.   Worse still, President Trump is reportedly considering appointing a  former lobbyist for a health insurance giant to run the Justice  Department's antitrust division, which is tasked by Congress ``to  protect economic freedom and opportunity by promoting free and fair  competition in the marketplace.''   Citing lobbying reports, the International Business Times notes that  this particular lobbyist participated in the ``antitrust issues  associated with Anthem's proposed acquisition of Cigna,'' and his firm  received $375,000 in lobbying fees.   Just last month, the Justice Department won an important lawsuit  initiated under the Obama administration to block this merger, which,  according to the Department of Justice, would have harmed consumers  through increased health insurance prices, while stifling the exact  innovation that is necessary to lower healthcare costs.   It is unsurprising that President Trump's corporate cabinet will  probably include yet another lobbyist that will pursue an extreme  agenda on behalf of special interests. But the significance of this  potential appointment cannot be overstated and absolutely will not  result in lower prices or more choices for the American people.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, while I support H.R. 372 as a complement to  the Affordable Care Act, I agree with the ranking member that this bill  is not a solution to improving the availability or affordability of  health insurance.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California  (Mr. Garamendi) for leading this Special Order hour where we can really  talk about the impact of what is about to happen if the Republicans get  their way and pass TrumpCare.   I think it is important to recognize that this proposal that is  currently before the House will substantially hurt the American people,  beginning with, as your chart demonstrates, the loss of coverage, when  fully implemented, for 24 million Americans who will no longer have  access to affordable health care and will be uninsured by 2026. Those  are our friends, our neighbors, our family members who no longer will  have health coverage.   In addition, it provides an enormous tax break for the wealthiest  people in this country. In fact, the total value of these tax breaks  over the decade is $600 billion to the richest individuals and the  biggest corporations. It is the largest transfer of wealth for working  families to the very rich in our Nation's history.   To accommodate this tax break, to give this huge tax benefit to the  richest Americans and the largest corporations, they achieve this by  stealing health care from millions of families all across this country  and by cutting billions of dollars from Medicaid and Medicare. As the  gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) said, the 400 richest  families will each enjoy a $7 million tax cut; and the way they paid  for that is they take away health care from millions of Americans.   There is also the impact on our economy. There is a new analysis from  the Center for American Progress, and they conclude that TrumpCare will  destroy 1.8 million jobs.   We are all focused on: How do we get people back to work? How do we  create good-paying jobs?   This is a job killer. TrumpCare will cost 1.8 million jobs, a loss of  an ability to provide for yourself, for your family, and for your  future.   As you said, people will be paying more money for less quality care.  Deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses will skyrocket, leaving sick  people unable to afford the care they need.   Particularly, as you mentioned, there will be an age tax because  older Americans will pay more. Their premiums will go up at an even  faster pace because they are allowed to charge even more based on their  age.   Young people are also hurt. Young people are hit with a millennial  tax. They put a 30 percent premium surcharge on those reenrolling after  a lapse in coverage, which is often the case, particularly with young  people where people may have lost a job and be out of work. So they are  going to be penalized with a 30 percent premium.   The impact of the Republican proposal, this TrumpCare proposal, on  women is devastating. In addition to new restrictions on comprehensive  health care for women, this Republican bill, TrumpCare, defunds Planned  Parenthood and will make it much more difficult for women to access  essential preventative care and affordable contraception.   As I mentioned, the middle-aged American--the age tax--will pay more.  For example, a 64-year-old individual with an income of $26,000 in the  individual market will pay $12,900 more in their premiums each year.  That is almost half their income under the Republican plan. So it is  going to really get those who are above 55 but haven't yet hit the age  to receive Medicare especially hard.   Also, TrumpCare hurts our seniors by weakening Medicaid and Medicare.  It shortens the life of the Medicare trust fund by 3 years. It steals  $880 billion from Medicaid, which, as you mentioned, is the principal  source of long-term care for seniors.   Also, it does damage to the protection for people who have  preexisting conditions, because someone who has a lapse in coverage  will be subjected to a 30 percent premium on top of their base premium.  So there is another penalty for people who have preexisting conditions.   If you take all of this together, it is worse coverage, worse care,  higher costs, huge tax cut for the richest people in this country--for  drug companies, for insurance companies, CEOs. To pay for their tax  cut, we take away insurance from the most vulnerable and working people  in this country.   We have all received both emails and phone calls and had  conversations with those whom we have the privilege of representing,  and they have shared with us these heart-wrenching stories of what it  would mean to lose their health care.   In my State, I am proud to say that, with the implementation of the  Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, we have the highest rate of coverage  that we have ever had in our State's history. Ninety-seven percent of  Rhode Islanders have access to quality, affordable health care. It is  great. It makes a difference in the lives and quality of the lives of  everyone.   I want to share with the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) an  email that I got from a constituent, just recently, from Lincoln, Rhode  Island. Brenda said:         If all goes well, I am literally going into surgery for hip       replacement on March 16 of this year. Though hip replacement       is seen as elective, the pain I deal with now interferes with       my quality of life. Without it, I will end up in a wheelchair       in a few years once I can't handle the persistent pain.        Without the ACA, I would not be able to have this       operation. I do not own a home for collateral and have a 19-      year-old car. I work full-time in a hotel for $12 an hour. I       have not had a raise in 4 years. We have no benefits at all,       including health care. We have no paid time off at all for       sick days, personal days, or vacation.        I am not confident enough to move to another job with my       current physical limitations, which have reached a point       where it interferes with every activity, including sleeping.        My doctors, who are aware that I get my medical through the       ACA, have been helpful and diligent about getting me in soon,       knowing there is a major threat for those whose only way for       medical coverage is through the ACA. My condition may not be       life-threatening, but left untreated, it would limit where I       can live, if and where I can work, and, most likely, leave me       on permanent disability or Social Security, which most people       can't live on.        I am only 52. I still have several functional, productive       years ahead of me, and I receive a subsidy to help make my       coverage affordable.    Brenda is just one example of someone whose life is literally being  preserved. Her quality of life is being protected because she has  access to health care. She can have the surgery she needs. She can  eliminate the pain she is suffering and lead a productive life.   There are millions and millions of Americans who have the same kinds  of stories, who have benefited from the Affordable Care Act, who will  be deeply harmed when that insurance is ripped away if Republicans get  their way and pass TrumpCare.   I want to end by just saying thank you again to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi) and to also mention that he referenced, in  his remarks, the process that has produced this very, very troubling  piece of legislation, unlike the process that produced the Affordable  Care Act that occurred over many, many months and many hearings, where  121 Republican amendments were accepted into the bill and it still  didn't earn a single Republican vote. Yet, through TrumpCare, over 100  Democratic amendments were offered in three committees of jurisdiction  and not a single Democratic amendment was accepted.  [[Page H2283]]    So even efforts to try to improve a terrible bill were rejected in  the committee process, and that is because they are intent on making  sure they deliver this big tax cut to the special interests who sent  them here to Washington, and they are going to try to do it on the  backs of the hardworking people of this country. We have to continue to  stand up and fight and do everything we can to prevent it from  happening.    Mr. Speaker, there are so many people that I have  heard from in my own district, and I know colleagues have heard the  same thing when we talk about these numbers: 24 million people will  lose their insurance and billions of dollars in tax breaks for the  richest people in this country. Behind every one of these numbers is a  real person whose life will be destroyed or devastated because they  don't have access to quality, affordable health care.   This is the richest, most powerful country in the world. We are well  on the way to having a system in which everyone can afford and have  access to quality, affordable health care. We made huge progress in the  Affordable Care Act. It is not perfect. We have always been willing to  say: How do we make it better? How do we build on the success of it?   The notion, in the midst of this progress, that we would deprive or  pass a piece of legislation, this TrumpCare, that will take away  insurance from 24 million people, that will raise premiums, raise out- of-pocket costs, undermine Medicaid and Medicare, and also give a big  tax cut to the richest people in this country is just so wrong.                                time  1800    I just think it is very important, as we speak about this, to  remember, behind every one of these numbers is a story of a real  person, a real family, just like the woman you described, just like  Brenda in Lincoln, Rhode Island, whose lives are going to be really  hurt and who are going to face devastating consequences because they  don't have access to basic quality health care, which is a right in  this country every American should have access to.   This sets us back so far it is difficult to imagine what our  colleagues on the other side of the aisle are thinking.
