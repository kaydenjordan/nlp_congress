 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to  Nevada's longest-serving Senator, Harry Reid, who passed away on  December 28, with his beloved children: Lana, Key, Josh, Leif, and  Rory; and his devoted wife of 62 years, Landra, by his side. My  condolences and prayers are with them all and with the countless people  whose lives he has changed, his friends, staff, and all of those in the  great State of Nevada.   This tribute could be about Senator Reid being the most consequential  Senate majority leader in modern history. It could also be about how  Senator Reid was the true embodiment of what it meant to be battle  born, a boxer as a young man who never backed down from a good fight  for the least among us.   It could be about the story of his American Dream, rising out of  severe poverty in Searchlight, Nevada; hitchhiking 40 miles to school;  working as a Capitol Police Officer to put himself through law school,  to becoming one of the most powerful political leaders of our time.   It could also be about his legislative accomplishments, such as the  Affordable Care Act, which gave millions of  [[Page H14]]  Americans access to affordable healthcare, saving our economy during  the Great Recession, taking on Wall Street, or making sure that Nevada  would not become the Nation's nuclear waste dumping ground.   However, I want to focus on Senator Reid's role in advancing women in  politics.   In Nevada, Senator Reid is known for his quiet yet sometimes curt  demeanor; his incredible, strategic mind; and his work ethic beyond  compare.   He built a team, known as Team Reid, that has roots throughout this  Capitol, throughout Nevada, and throughout this country, which will  have an impact long beyond his life.   There is no doubt that Senator Reid was a visionary when it came to  politics. His vision in making sure that women had a runway into  politics has left an indelible mark.   Within his own legendary team, women occupied the most senior posts.  At the same time, Senator Reid recruited and mentored women up and down  the ballot. It is no surprise, therefore, that Nevada became the first  State to have a woman-majority State legislature. We have a woman- majority supreme court, as well as a woman-majority congressional  delegation, with two female Senators, Cortez Masto and Rosen.   Harry Reid's devotion to Landra is legendary. Perhaps it was her  enormous role in his life and his utter respect for her as a partner  that seeded his unspoken yet strong commitment to women's leadership.  Maybe it was the role that his mother played, raising him out of  extreme poverty in Searchlight, Nevada. Whatever the motivation, the  results speak for themselves.   Growing up in Searchlight, Harry Reid was given a nickname, Pinky. I  am not sure what it referred to, and I actually don't think he  particularly liked it. But as Senator Reid lies in state in our  Nation's Capitol this week, this woman, who benefited from his  mentorship and guidance, will believe that perhaps that nickname was a  premonition of his role in changing the face of leadership in Nevada  and this country.   We all know that Senator Reid was infamous for not saying goodbye. I  myself was the recipient of that dial tone on many occasions. But those  occasions were because he never failed to pick up the phone when I  called for advice. I will miss those phone calls, but I will take this  opportunity to say goodbye to a man who showed how to fight for the  little guy; a man who could take a punch and outwork anyone; a man who  led through example of compassion and strength.   I say goodbye to Senator Reid and thank him.                            ____________________
