 Madam President, as the junior  Senator from South Carolina, it is my pleasure to honor George Fennell,  who was inducted into the South Carolina Business Hall of Fame. George  became interested in solid waste disposal after a 6-year stint with  Milliken & Company in Greenville, SC. In 1972, George returned to his  hometown of Walterboro and began impacting the waste-hauling industry.   Mr. Fennell's drive for excellence pushed him to innovate and gave  him a vision for the future of his business. The Colleton Environmental  Services, later renamed the Fennell Container Company, was initially  created by George and his wife Sandra, who built the modest business  from a barn on a dirt lot to the largest privately owned waste  management company in South Carolina. His entrepreneurial spirit paved  the way to his American dream and has motivated his family, friends,  and community. When hurricanes devastated South Carolina, George  Fennell stepped up to support the American Red Cross' effort to bring  the necessary aid to those affected by the storms. This only scratches  the surface of who he is and how deeply he cares for his neighbors and  friends.   Today, it is my pleasure to recognize Mr. George Fennell and his  dedication to making a difference in his community and the lives of  those around him. Congratulations on this incredible honor and a  distinguished career.                            ____________________
