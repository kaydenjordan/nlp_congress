 Madam Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to  anchor this CBC Special Order hour. I would like to thank the CBC  chair, Chairman Richmond, for his leadership in this effort.   For the next 60 minutes, we have an opportunity to speak directly to  the American people about issues of great importance to the  Congressional Black Caucus and many of the constituents we represent.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I am going to do something highly unusual  today, because my colleague who is here from the District of Columbia  knows an awful lot about this subject. I have watched her; I have  observed her. She has taught a few classes and a few people on this  subject matter, and she is an expert.   So I think the best way to start off is with a person who was a  former law professor who teaches, who really understands what our  Supreme Court means as the third element, with the legislative and the  chief executive. I have heard her in Congressional Black Caucus  meetings.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from the District of  Columbia, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton.    Mr. Speaker, I would ask my good colleague from the  District one or two questions, if I could.   I listened very intently. One of my favorite decisions that came down  was May 17, 1954, Brown v. Board of Education.   Mr. Speaker, the President asked Black Americans, after he came to  the city of Philadelphia, he said: What do we have to lose? I think,  ``what the hell do we have to lose?''   So I ask the gentlewoman that question in the context of Brown v.  Board of Education, and that is over 64 years ago now. And for where we  are, I just heard her very succinctly say about his ability to chip  away and not, you know, be able to fully overturn.   So I would ask her to talk a little bit about how would she see  anything relating to Brown v. Board of Education and his ability in any  of his writings relating to that particular decision that came down.    Mr. Speaker, I would ask one other question.   The gentlewoman also laid out the percentages of numbers. Does the  gentlewoman think there is some sort of philosophical packing taking  place here when she describes the 8 percent versus the 2 percent. But  just the 8 percent, is there some type of strategy  [[Page H6642]]  going on here relating to packing the Court, the Highest Court in the  land, at least in some way influencing for years, 25, 50 years down the  line? Is there something going on here that the public should know and  be aware of?   The gentlewoman has obviously studied the court system, the judicial  system herself over many, many years. Has the gentlewoman ever seen-- and I heard her make the comparison of President Bush, and I understood  the comparison she made.   It seems like there is something else going on here besides just  putting individuals on the Court, but there is something like some type  of philosophical strategy going on here.   Am I missing some point in what the gentlewoman just laid out to us?    Mr. Speaker, the one last question I would ask the  gentlewoman: The Congressional Black Caucus gave a document, as a  matter of fact, to the President that said we have a lot to lose.   In asking that question--and the gentlewoman has again done an  excellent job in laying out historical perspective for where we are-- obviously, as African Americans, it seems like, to me, there has to be  a huge fear factor because, if the only check and balance, obviously,  is the Congressional Black Caucus being the conscience of the Congress,  and the United States Senate, you know, is that check and balance, what  would you say to African Americans, Latinos, others relating to where  we are, because this is a very crucial time.   What would the gentlewoman say when he says, ``What the hell do you  have to lose?'' and we say, ``We have a lot to lose''? What would you  say? What would you say to the people?    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the great District  of Columbia, where we need to make sure that she has a right to vote in  this body is also something that needs to take place in terms of the  District of Columbia and representation, and I thank her for that  knowledge and information that she has provided to us.   I have someone else, Mr. Speaker, who I have grown deeply in  understanding her thoughts and her comments. I had the chance of  visiting the Seventh Congressional District in the great State of  Alabama. She is moving and making a lot of things happen there in  Alabama. She definitely said: ``I have to speak on this.'' I heard her  give some comments before on this, and she has some real thoughts about  what is taking place in the courts.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell).    Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleague from the  great State of Alabama a question.   This President talked about cleaning up the swamp. She may recall he  talked about that issue. From listening to her just now, it appears  that we know how it was taking place with his Cabinet, but we are  talking about something very sacred, and that is the courts. Can she  talk a little bit about, does she see cleaning up the swamp taking  place here relating to the courts? Because as I listened to her, it  sounds like the courts are not being cleaned up.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleague another  question, but before I do that, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, in the past, Judge Kavanaugh has emphasized  the importance of ``checking political alliances at the door.''   So I ask the gentlewoman that question relating to what she just said  because, in addition to the dark future for landmark decisions like Roe  v. Wade, voting rights, affirmative action, Brown v. Board of  Education, accessibility to affordable healthcare could be greatly  diminished, the gentlewoman said that has consequences. And this is his  quote. He said ``check political alliances at the door.''   So tell us now, we have got about 4 minutes, tell us, can we believe  that he will check the political alliances?    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Alabama, and I  really appreciate her comments and help.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus, with both of  my colleagues, all of them today, really have shown how we need to be  very conscious of this decision that the Senate is about to make. This  is extremely important in talking about the future in America, and we  need to understand that we must operate under the Constitution and the  rule of law.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
