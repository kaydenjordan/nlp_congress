 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize September as  National Recovery Month and to celebrate the millions of Americans who  are recovering from substance abuse.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues Representatives  Trone, Riggleman, Kuster, and Fitzpatrick for leading this initiative.   Like so many communities across America, my district in east  Tennessee has been affected by the ongoing opioid crisis. I am proud to  work with my fellow Members in the Freshman Working Group on Addiction  to bring attention to the severity of overdoses and how we can support  those in recovery.   Almost 70,000 Americans overdose on drugs each year, and some 23  million Americans are recovering from substance abuse.   Friends, family, local organizations, and healthcare providers must  do everything they can to combat this horrible addiction, and Congress  also needs to play its part.   I sponsored the Effective Drug Control Strategy Act to improve  federally funded drug demand reduction programs and prevent addiction  before it begins. Madam Speaker, the House should seriously consider  this legislation and the positive impacts it would have on preventing  drug addiction.                            ____________________
