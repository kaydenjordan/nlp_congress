 Mr. President, today I rise to recognize and pay  tribute to Thomas Kane Gilhool, who championed the rights of inclusion  for children and adults with disabilities and changed public policy in  our country for all people with disabilities. His work was pivotal in  affirming the constitutional right of children with disabilities to a  public education, increasing community-based services for people with  developmental disabilities, and creating a pathway for people with  autism and other developmental disabilities to leave institutions and  live with neighbors, friends, and family.   Tom Gilhool was an originating member of Philadelphia's Community  Legal Services. At the start of his career, he helped to organize,  train, and then represented the Philadelphia Welfare Rights  Organization and the Residents Advisory Board, as well as other  organizations representing residents in low-income neighborhoods. The  recognition agreements he secured empowered those organizations to  effectively represent welfare recipients and public housing tenants and  served as models that were replicated throughout the country.   Tom Gilhool's seminal accomplishment was his groundbreaking  representation of plaintiffs in the Pennsylvania Association for  Retarded Citizens (PARC) v. the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the  Nation's first civil rights case brought on behalf of children with  disabilities. Kate Fialkowski, sister of two boys represented in the  case, remembers Tom as ``an intellectual giant, lawyer, and legal  historian,'' someone ``who used his gifts not for self-aggrandizement,  but instead to raise up the lives of others, including those with  intellectual and developmental disabilities.'' Prior to this case,  children with disabilities were all but excluded from attending public  schools. The decree of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District  of Pennsylvania in 1972 paved the way for the 1975 passage of the  Education for All Handicapped Children Act, now known as the  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--IDEA--which affirmed every  child's right to a free and appropriate public education in the least  restrictive environment.   Tom Gilhool's work on PARC v. Pennsylvania led to another landmark  case on behalf of people with disabilities. In Pennhurst State School  and Hospital v. Halderman, 1981, Tom Gilhool was lead counsel for  residents of Pennhurst State School and Hospital, the residential home  to almost 3,000 people with intellectual and developmental  disabilities. By 1968, Pennhurst was exposed as an overcrowded,  violent, and abusive setting. Through Tom's work, the right to  habilitation in non-segregated settings was established. The ruling in  Pennhurst v. Halderman was the forerunner of the 1999 Olmstead v. LC  Supreme Court decision, establishing the right to treatment and  services in community-based settings. Since that case, nearly 200,000  people have moved from abusive, segregated settings where they had been  deprived of dignity, respect, and their basic needs. Tom Gilhool's work  made it possible for millions of children and adults with intellectual  and developmental disabilities to avoid such places.   The cases Tom Gilhool argued laid much of the foundation for the  passage of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. Judith Gran, a  long-time colleague of Tom Gilhool at the Public Interest Law Center  said, ``Tom was the most effective civil rights lawyer of his  generation. Without his vision and strategic gifts, [people with  disabilities] might not have the right to education and the right to  live in the community.''   In 2012, Pennhurst v. Halderman was cited by Chief Justice John  Roberts in upholding the constitutionality of key provisions of the  Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the National Federation  of Independent Business v. Sebelius.   When my father was elected Governor of Pennsylvania in 1986, he asked  Tom to serve as Secretary of Education. Tom worked hard for the  children of Pennsylvania from 1987 to 1989.   Thomas Gilhool's tremendous contributions to the lives and rights of  people with disabilities and their families are immeasurable. His  accomplishments will continue to benefit all people with disabilities  and inspire all who continue to work to protect the rights and freedoms  of people with disabilities.                            ____________________
