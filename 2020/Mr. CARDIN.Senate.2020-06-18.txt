 Mr. President, tomorrow, we will commemorate the 155th  Juneteenth, the celebration of the end of chattel slavery in the United  States. On June 19, 1865, Major General Gordon Granger and Union  soldiers delivered the news of liberation to one of the last remaining  confederate outposts in Galveston, TX. The Civil War had ended, and the  last remaining enslaved Black Americans were free. General Gordon's  decree would arrive over 2 years after President Abraham Lincoln issued  the Emancipation Proclamation.   For millions of Black Americans, Juneteenth traditionally has been a  celebration of this freedom; it is also a day of reflection and  education on a history that we all must confront. There is much to  inform us about our present times that we can learn from the story of  Juneteenth. It is the story of America, the story of my home State of  Maryland. Each year, I aim to share these lessons and resources with my  constituents through my office and in recognizing the continued work we  must do to elevate Black history and create a more tolerant society.  This year, my office will close to commemorate the holiday and allow  staff the time to reflect on its important historical lessons.   Juneteenth is a reminder that, even after the signing of Abraham  Lincoln's seminal declaration, that even in a Nation whose founding  documents should have enshrined liberty and justice for all of its  inhabitants, freedom was a dream deferred for Black Americans. It is a  reminder that liberation was hard fought by those who were denied it,  including abolition leaders like Marylanders Frederick Douglass and  Harriet Tubman, who then passed the torch to civil rights leaders and  social movements past and present who are still fighting to realize  equal justice under law. Equal justice under law is a promise the  Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, and the  Emancipation Proclamation all made, but it remains elusive, so the  struggle continues.   In this way, Juneteenth is a quintessential American holiday. The  institution of chattel slavery is interwoven throughout American  history and would become the architecture for unjust systems that still  stand today. The Juneteenth liberation would precede over a century of  continued oppression, oppression through stigmatization, policymaking,  voter disenfranchisement, and Jim Crow segregation laws, which  continued to widen the gaps of social, economic, and political  achievement for Black Americans in our society. Acknowledging its  sinister legacy and the efforts to chip away at it are critical to  understanding how to dismantle it from its core.  [[Page S3099]]    Through the lens of recent tragedies--the police killings of Breonna  Taylor, George Floyd and, just this week, Rayshard Brooks--and the  worldwide anti-racism protests they have sparked, this education is  more important than ever. We are being called to connect the dots in  our history and take action to bring about meaningful change, to save  lives, and to right the wrongs of the past. We are being called, yet  again, to answer in what ways are our constitutional promises still  left unfulfilled for Black Americans?   Answering this question is essential to addressing police and  criminal justice reform. From the establishment of deputized slave  patrols in the American South, to the enforcement of segregation laws  through the 1960s, to mass incarceration and disproportionate police  violence in our present day, Black Americans have often faced systemic  racism that the law either required or permitted. The same 13th  Amendment that abolished slavery did so in all forms except  incarceration, shrouding the institution in a new light and enabling  the continued suppression of freedom and rights.   Today, Black Americans are still twice as likely to be killed by  police as White Americans. And despite representing only 12 percent of  the U.S. adult population, Black Americans make up 33 percent of the  sentenced prison population. We have seen the brutal videos. We see the  painful list of names of men and women killed at the hands of police  brutality. We see the effects of this cyclical system on the health of  our communities and families every day. We must act to stop it.   The roots of systemic racism in law enforcement were planted  centuries ago and can be unraveled with targeted and conscious action.  This is why I have been proud to work with my colleagues Senators  Booker and Harris on crafting police reform legislation that works  toward justice and systemic change, the Justice in Policing Act. This  broader legislation includes two bills I have introduced for several  years, the End Racial and Religious Profiling Act and the Law  Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act. The Justice in Policing Act would  prohibit racial profiling, improve officer training, and hold officers  accountable for the misconduct that keeps alive the culture has  reinforced centuries of oppression. I hope the Senate can pass this  bill. Equal treatment of individuals under the law must not be a  partisan issue.   All Americans must recognize and celebrate Juneteenth so that we may  face these harsh realities about our past and present and understand  that the fight for freedom is ongoing. We cannot ignore our past, for  it is with us here in the present in many forms. The wounds of our  Nation will not heal until we identify and name their source and commit  to doing the work in Congress and in our communities to mend them.  Freedom has never been free, nor has it ever come easily. Let us  celebrate liberation by doing everything we can to fight for it for  generations to come.                            ____________________
