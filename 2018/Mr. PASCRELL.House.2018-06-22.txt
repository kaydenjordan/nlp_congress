 Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I want to  thank Representatives Chris Collins and Frank Pallone and Senators  Menendez and Lisa Murkowski for the support and work to get this  bipartisan bill to protect the health and wellbeing of our Nation's  firefighters across the finish line.   I am pleased this bill, which has the strong support of the  firefighter community, will finally be on its way to the President's  desk. I look forward to working with all the stakeholders to create a  firefighter cancer registry with this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
