 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congressional Black Caucus  and Congresswoman Yvette Clarke for anchoring this important Special  Order.   On the 150th Anniversary of the ratification of the 14th Amendment, a  landmark moment for progress and equality, the President announced his  nominee to fill a seat on the highest court in the land.   Unfortunately, however, the search for the next jurist to take a seat  on the United States Supreme Court resembled a circus and I am  concerned that the person selected, Brett Kavanaugh, will be  antagonistic and hostile to the progress that the 14th Amendment has  helped achieve.   As a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, I am appalled by  the manner in which the President is pursuing this solemn obligation  and concerned by the choice this process may yield.   The President has used the levers of his office to divide, rather  than unite.   The Supreme Court is not just any court.   In our great Republic, it is the tribunal of last resort and  routinely resolves constitutional questions of first impression.   The American people rely on it to interpret some of society's most  difficult policy concerns, and to correct the excesses of the  popularly-elected branches.   The nature of the Court requires justices, not ideologues, and  individuals who have integrity and empathy.   This is why this task requires seriousness and solemnity, and not  spectacle.   Instead, this process resembled a circus: contenders were selected  based on their ability to pass a litmus test of a narrow perspective of  conservativism which limits justice; a group of judges, similar in  background, training and experience, curated by the hyper-conservative  Federalist Society; and, a heavily-promoted, prime time television  announcement, replete with different frontrunner candidates on  different days.   Given this reality, Americans are rightly concerned that the  President's jurist selection to one of this country's three coequal  branches of government is being outsourced to the whims of a narrow  ideological and partisan organization when, in actuality, a seat on the  Supreme Court should be reserved for only the most profound jurists in  the nation.   By great numbers, the American people support reform in any number of  areas.   In a time of mass incarceration and overcrowded prisons, a poll  conducted earlier this year by a Republican-leaning organization  indicates that over three-quarters of the American people support  significant criminal justice reform.   Americans are also skeptical of comments made by this President,  advocating for the deprivation of due process rights for a variety of  individuals, from refugees seeking safety within our borders, to those  already here, charged with crimes.   Indeed, a poll commissioned by the Bucknell Institute for Public  Policy within the last year reveals broad and deep support for due  process rights.   In a time when our political parties appear polarized, 67 percent of  Democrats, 77 percent of Republicans and 67 percent of Independents  support due process for individuals who face serious criminal charges.   Last, the Supreme Court is also the tribunal that resolves major  questions about the form and contours of our federal government,  including sensitive questions like ``can a sitting president pardon  himself?'' or ``can a sitting president be indicted?''   In fact, for over the past year of this President's administration,  the country has been forced to consider these questions as it learned  that the Russians interfered with the 2016 presidentia election and  associates of the president may have abetted that endeavor.    Recent polls indicate that, by clear margins, the American people do  not believe the President is above the law or that a president can  pardon himself.   It is vital that this extremely influential position is filled by  someone who subscribes to these core principles.   Brett Kavanaugh, however, has demonstrated a long-standing record of  troubling opinions, including the beliefs that: the president is above  the law and should never be criminally indicted; the Affordable Care  Act should be dismantled; religious expression trumps individuals'  right to health coverage for birth control; access to abortion should  be diminished; and Obama-era environmental regulations should be rolled  back.   The Supreme Court is also required to examine contemporary policies  through the prism of our nation's long history.   In that regard, the ongoing struggle for civil rights cannot be  subjugated as a priority of a nation seeking to bind the wounds of the  slavery, the Civil War and its vestiges.   The next jurist will replace a Supreme Court justice who recognized  the importance of affirmative action as a necessary means to help heal  the scars of segregation and Jim Crow.   The next jurist will likely be required to further calibrate the  balance of power between labor unions and their employing entities.   Given the importance of these and other issues, like voting rights,  reproductive rights, the rights of the LGBTQ community, and countless  others, scholars of the Supreme Court and others who believe the Court  is the arbiter of fair justice are looking to this nomination and are  looking for a jurist who will dispense justice which is not one-sided  or tilts to the right, but rather fair justice.   As I stated before the nomination, I call upon the United States  Senate to reject any nominee that is a well-documented ideologue and to  nonetheless probatively, seriously, and deeply question whether and how  this jurist could damage rights of minorities, women, children, and  society's most vulnerable.   When confronted with a replacement to the Supreme Court's swing vote,  this President has chosen an ideologue and a foot soldier of the  Republican Party and the conservative movement.   Among other swing decisions, Justice Kennedy acted as the deciding  vote in almost every reproductive health case since his confirmation,  including casting the deciding vote to ensure abortion remained legal  in Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992.   The President has stated numerous times that he will appoint someone  who will reverse Roe v. Wade, and many anti-choice groups have rallied  behind Judge Kavanaugh's nomination.   In addition to women's rights and health care, other paramount issues  are on the line, such as voting rights and affirmative action.   Bedrock civil rights principles such as Brown v. Board of Education  could be at stake.   To be sure, Brett Kavanaugh has very good credentials but an  undistinguished record as a jurist on the United States Court of  Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.   But it is not his credentials or his pedigree that is worrisome.   Rather, throughout his entire career--as a deputy in the right-wing  crusade against President Bill Clinton during the 1990s, as a political  operative fighting against the statewide recount in Florida in 2000,  paving the way for the Supreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore, and as  a conservative stalwart on the country's most important federal  appellate court--Brett Kavanaugh has used his talents in the service of  decidedly and uncompromisingly reactionary causes.   I urge the United States Senate to reject this nomination and send  this President a message: select a nominee that will not politicize the  Court and one who will protect the rights of minorities, women,  children, and society's most vulnerable.                            ____________________
