 Madam Speaker, I rise today to join President  Biden and my colleagues in Congress in calling for action, long-overdue  action, to protect the right to vote.   President Biden delivered a powerful speech this week in Georgia, and  I am hopeful that this stiffened the spines of some of those here in  the Capitol. I know that I want to live in the America of John Lewis,  not Bull Connor, and the America of Dr. King, not George Wallace.   Today, I was proud to vote for the vital legislation to protect the  essential right to vote. Now the Senate must act, using all available  means.   The filibuster is not a law and it is not in the Constitution. It is  a tradition that has been misused throughout history to deny civil and  voting rights, and it is being used again today. What is in the  Constitution? The right to vote.   Ahead of Dr. Martin Luther King Day, it is time to honor those who  came before us to secure the America that we live in today. The eyes of  history are upon us. We cannot let this moment pass us by.                            ____________________
