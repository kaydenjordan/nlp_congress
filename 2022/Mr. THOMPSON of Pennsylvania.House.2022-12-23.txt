 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember  the life and legacy of Franco Harris, an iconic Steelers and Penn State  football running back.   The Hall of Fame running back who was known for the ``Immaculate  Reception,'' considered the most iconic play in NFL history 50 years  ago today, passed away at the age of 72 this week.   Before the infamous play, Franco was a proud Nittany Lion. During his  time donning blue and white, Harris helped lead Penn State to a 29-4  record from 1969 to 1971. Harris is among Penn State's top 20 rushers  in program history with 2,002 career yards and 24 touchdowns.   Franco not only impacted the game of football, but he also affected  the lives of many, many people in profoundly positive ways.   Following his retirement from the NFL, Harris returned to Pittsburgh,  opened a bakery, and became heavily involved in several charities,  including serving as chairman of The Pittsburgh Promise which provides  college scholarship opportunities for Pittsburgh public school  students.   Franco is survived by his loving wife, Dana Dokmanovich, and his son,  Dok. My prayers and thoughts are with Dana, Dok, and Franco's friends.                            ____________________
