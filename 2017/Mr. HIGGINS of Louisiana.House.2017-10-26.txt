 Mr. Speaker, the image beside me is of a  young lady named Halle Thompson, who was tragically killed in a car  crash in my district. I penned this letter to her parents:   ``Dear Mr. and Mrs. Thompson,   ``Ryan, Janna, my own heart is rended as I pen this letter of  encouragement and condolence.   ``Your beautiful daughter Halle is, no doubt, in the presence of our  beloved lady and our loving, forgiving Savior. You are each, no doubt,  surrounded by the angels of Christ, as you endeavor each day to endure  the grief of your loss, even as you present a strong and determined  front to honor the life and spirit of your daughter.   ``I have personal insight relative to your pain, having lost my own  firstborn, my beautiful Daniela, long ago on the 10th day of November  1990.   ``I wish to compassionately convey it has come onto my heart that  your Halle is present at this moment with my own Daniela, looking upon  you both with adoration as you prayerfully honor and respect our Lord's  mysterious will.   ``Please know that my prayers are with you and that my own quiet  service to America and our fellow man is dedicated this day to the  beautiful Halle, angelic now, as she lives amongst the Heavenly Host.   ``Respectfully, I remain, your humble servant.''                            ____________________
