 Mr. Speaker, I rise today ahead of National  Entrepreneurship Week and during Black History Month to acknowledge and  celebrate the remarkable contributions of Black business owners.   Entrepreneurship drives economic growth and creates jobs, yet too few  Black businesses have the capital and connections to start and scale  successful companies, contributing to the racial wealth gap through  entrepreneurial inequity.   Here are the facts. Of the 6 million employer businesses in the U.S.,  just 130,000 are Black owned, barely more than 2 percent.   My district's entrepreneurs are helping drive our region and Nation's  economy forward, and I will share their stories as we celebrate Black  Americans' past and present achievements.   That includes people like Kanisha Harwell, owner of Balance Cheer and  Gymnastics in my hometown of Warrensville Heights. Kanisha started her  gym after experiencing the lack of support for diversity in gymnastics,  taking on multiple jobs to fund the creation of an inclusive  environment for Black athletes.   Minority entrepreneurs are a vital asset to our economy, and I urge  my colleagues to work with me to build a more equitable economy for  all.                            ____________________
