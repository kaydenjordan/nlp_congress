 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, my amendment would move $500,000 from the  United States Fish and Wildlife general administration account to the  National Wildlife Refuge program specifically for the wildlife and  habitat management of invasive species.   This amendment is identical to an amendment I offered last year that  passed this body by a voice vote, and I  [[Page H6435]]  urge my colleagues to support this amendment again this year.   Invasive species threaten native plant and animal species and their  vital habitats. Currently, invasive species are the most frequently  mentioned threat within the National Wildlife Refuge System Threats and  Conflicts database and are a growing risk to our ecosystems.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is the only agency in the United  States Government with the primary responsibility of the conservation  of our Nation's fish, wildlife, and plants. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife  Service manages more than 561 refuges encompassing more than 150  million acres of habitat within the National Wildlife Refuge System.   As of 2013, more than 2.4 million acres of the refuge system are  impacted by invasive plants, including Lake Hatchineha in my home  district in central Florida with approximately 1,715 invasive animal  populations residing on the refuge lands. It is important we provide  enough funds to enable the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to combat and  reduce the harmful impact of invasive species.   Again, this amendment would increase funds to combat invasive species  that threaten native species in their vital habitat.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2000     Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from California for his  support, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would increase funding for the  National Estuary Program and Coastal Waterways Program by $468,000. It  does so by removing and then reapplying $468,000 within the $2.4  billion appropriation for the Environmental Programs and Management  Account within the Environmental Protection Agency.   This amendment is identical to an amendment I offered last year that  passed this body by a voice vote, and I urge my colleagues to support  this amendment again this year.   Currently, the House Report accompanying this bill calls for a  funding level of $26,723,000. This amendment will restore funding to  the level that passed the House for the last 2 years.   This amendment is intended to increase funding for the National  Estuary Program that protects and restores water quality and ecological  integrity of estuaries of national significance. Currently, 20  estuaries located along the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific  Coasts and Puerto Rico are designated as estuaries of national  significance. Four of these estuaries are in my home State of Florida.   This program is efficient at leveraging funds to increase estuaries'  ability to restore and protect ecosystems. The National Estuary Program  has obtained more than $10 for every $1 provided by EPA, generating  nearly $4 billion for on-the-ground efforts since 2003. This amendment  will result in a real return on investment for the American people.   With more than half the U.S. population living within 100 miles of  the coast, including the shores of estuaries, this amendment will  result in an enhanced quality of life for those living along the coast,  while maintaining a healthy ecosystem that supports endangered and  threatened species.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from California for his  support, and I yield back the balance of my time.
