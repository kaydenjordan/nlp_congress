 Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague from Georgia,  Senator Warnock, for leading this amendment with me.   The amendment is simple and straightforward: designating future  Interstate 14 across Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and  Georgia. The amendment does not have any cost associated with it;  rather, it is a first step in the process of upgrading this system of  roads to add freight capacity and connect strategic military  installations across our States.   In Texas, our part of I-14 will be expanded to the west so that it  will serve San Angelo, Goodfellow Air Force Base, Midland-Odessa, and  the Permian Basin. It will connect with I-20 at Midland-Odessa, which  runs westward to connect with I-10 and leads to El Paso and Fort Bliss.  This will complete the linkage between six military facilities across  three States, which is critical for economic development and national  security.   I would like to add that this amendment has the support of the  departments of transportation in Texas, in Louisiana, in Mississippi,  in Alabama, and in Georgia, as well as untold numbers of local leaders  and coalitions of businesses and local governments.   So, again, I want to thank my colleague Senator Warnock for leading  this bipartisan amendment with me.    Mr. President, a voice vote would be fine if it would be  fine procedurally.
