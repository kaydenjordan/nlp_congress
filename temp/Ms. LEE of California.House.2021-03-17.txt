 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1620,  the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. I am proud to cosponsor  this bill, and I want to thank Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee and  Chairman Jerry Nadler for, once again, their leadership and bold  efforts to bring this bill to the floor.   This reauthorization bill builds upon the landmark 1994 legislation  by expanding protections and services for survivors, while also working  to prevent violence from occurring in the first place. It makes vital  investments in preventing sexual assaults and stalking and increases  victims' access to safe housing and economic stability. It also  increases funding of programs for culturally specific services.   An estimated one in three women experience domestic violence in this  country. I personally know what strong and consistent support means to  emerge as a survivor.   When I was in the California State Legislature, I authored the  Violence Against Women Act for the State of California. And today, I am  so proud, along with Congresswoman Jackson Lee, that we passed the  Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act with bipartisan support.  When I was in the California State Legislature, a Republican Governor  signed my bill into law, so I thank the gentlewoman very much for her  leadership.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to  thank the Democratic Women's Caucus, Congresswomen Frankel, Speier, and  Lawrence, for hosting this Special Order on Women's History Month.   I want to thank Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence for insisting that  Black women and women of color be seen in this body.   Last year, we celebrated the centennial of the ratification of the  19th Amendment, which gave some women the right to vote. We know that  women of color were not able to vote until decades later, and Black  women fought until they got suffrage in 1965.   I am proud that this January, my bill, with the support of both  Republicans and Democrats here in this body and in the Senate, passed.  It is called the Women's History and Nineteenth Amendment Centennial  Quarter Dollar Coin Program Act, and it was signed into law. This  measure will ensure that prominent women from American history can be  honored on our circulating quarter dollar coins.   The currency we use is one of the most important shared ways that we  have in memorializing what is important to us as Americans. Making sure  that prominent American women are featured on our coins is an important  step in recognizing the contributions women have made in furthering  civil rights and making our country a more equitable place.   As the mint solicits public input for these coins, it is my hope that  diverse American women will be chosen and depicted, celebrating our  Nation's leaders, thinkers, and innovators.   Last election also brought a record number of women in Congress, and  there are, I believe, 120 women now in the House. I know my mentor, the  first African-American woman elected to Congress, Congresswoman Shirley  Chisolm, would be so proud. Yes, we brought our folding chairs, but I  have to just tell you, we are here to stay.   I salute my late mother, Mildred Parish Massey tonight, who blazed so  many trails. She instilled in her three girls that women are equal to  men, from day one.   She was one of the first 12 Black students to integrate the  University of Texas at El Paso. She was the first Black female civilian  at Fort Bliss, Texas, to work there for years, and she was the first in  so many segregated places.   But you know what? She told my sisters and me that ``can't'' is not  in the dictionary and that we can fulfill our dreams. But in doing  that, we have to break these barriers so that others can enter, and she  insisted that we open the doors for other women and girls.   It is so important that we celebrate Women's History Month and honor  the women trailblazers who came before us. Not only should we celebrate  women, but we should also ensure that they are protected and granted  equality. I can't think of a better way to honor Women's History Month  than for this body to pass bills to guarantee and enshrine women's  equality. It is a shame we have to do that.    One important action we can take to do that is to remove barriers to  ratifying the equal rights amendment. I have to thank my good friend,  Congresswoman Jackie Speier, for her leadership on these efforts. It is  way past time we do that.   For 244 years, women have not been able to claim the full protections  and opportunities afforded by the Constitution. Women and girls face a  devastating wage gap, gender-based violence, inadequate access to  healthcare, pregnancy discrimination, sexual harassment, the list goes  on. Yet, our Constitution does not explicitly protect them, and women  of color have had to fight twice as hard.   I thank Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence for leading the Special Order  tonight. It is an important moment for women in this country.
