 Madam Speaker, I almost heard my colleague Mr.  Larson appreciate, I thought I heard him say President Trump, but then  he did say ``Trumka,'' so I guess maybe not so much similarity there.  But the fact of the matter is I appreciate the few nudges that we have  seen over the last few weeks that have brought us to this point.   And I certainly appreciate the work of Ambassador Lighthizer and many  on President Trump's team who have worked so hard to get us to this  point.   Representing an agriculture powerhouse district, the Third District  of Nebraska, where our farmers and ranchers work very diligently and  very efficiently to help feed America and the world, we need good  markets for them. Trade relationships in North America are so  important, and we have this opportunity to modernize NAFTA, heading us  in the direction of even more markets and really reflecting the needs  of our economy and the economy across North America.   We have got this opportunity to bring people together, especially in  light of events this week. I certainly appreciate this opportunity and  our leaders on the Ways and Means Committee, both Mr. Brady and the  chairman as well.   This is a great time to work together. I look forward to its passage  and urge everyone to vote ``yes.''    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as  I may consume.   I must admit, I am a bit puzzled today as to why we are here for this  bill. Our work in the House is almost done for the year.   We have funded the Federal Government and extended expiring programs  like flood insurance. We are about to pass USMCA with a record vote.  Our Democratic colleagues can go home and celebrate that they voted to  make history in impeaching the President.   But apparently, before we go home for Christmas, we also need to give  Ebenezer Scrooge a tax cut, even though we know the Senate won't take  up the bill.   Before we get into the problems with today's bill, we should review  the positives of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which this bill seeks to  undermine.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered tax rates for all Americans and  increased the child tax credit.   We doubled the standard deduction from $6,000 for individuals and  $12,000 for married couples to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for  couples.   And to help ensure Federal tax policy doesn't reward States and  cities for raising their taxes sky high, we instituted a $10,000, very  thoughtful, cap on State and local tax deductions to ensure Americans  in low-tax States don't pay an unfair share of Federal taxes.   Thanks to the combination of lower rates, larger child tax credit,  and higher standard deduction under TCJA, for example, a single mom  with two kids doesn't pay a penny in Federal income tax until her  income exceeds $53,000.   In other words, we ensure that that mom doesn't owe Federal income  tax until her income exceeds not just $15 an hour, but $25 per hour.   For Americans who do pay income tax, the higher standard deduction  means 29 million more households had their tax returns simplified  because they could take the standard deduction instead of itemizing.   How does the majority propose to improve our tax code today? Not by  simplifying the code or ensuring our tax code is more equitable, but by  passing a temporary--emphasis on ``temporary''--tax cut, which largely  benefits people with incomes between--  [[Page H12273]]  please, listen--$200,000 and $1 million per year--perhaps a new  definition of the middle class--paid for by permanently increasing  taxes on small businesses.   Let me say that again. If you make between $0 and $75,000, this bill  does not give you tax relief, or a tax cut.   If you make between $75,000 and $200,000, there is a small chance you  could get a small tax cut.   If you make between $200,000 per year and $1 million per year, you  have the best chance of getting a tax cut.   Madam Speaker, we should continue working together to find ways to  improve the tax code for all Americans.   This bill makes the code both more complex and less progressive.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a  series of statements in opposition to H.R. 5377 from Americans for Tax  Reform, Americans for Prosperity, National Taxpayers Union, Heritage  Action, and Parity for Main Street Employers.        Key Vote: ATR Urges No Vote on H.R. 5377, a Pledge Violation     Posted by Alex Hendrie on Wednesday, December 18th, 2019, 3:00 PM                                 PERMALINK         The House of Representatives is set to vote on H.R. 5377,       the ``Restoring Tax Fairness for States and Localities Act.''        ATR urges a ``NO'' vote.        This legislation is a violation of the Taxpayer Protection       Pledge, a commitment made by 218 members in the House and       Senate to oppose any and all net tax increases.        If passed into law, it will raise taxes on individuals and       small businesses that file through the individual income tax       system. This bill trades a temporary rollback of the SALT cap       for a permanent rate hike.        This legislation is a net tax increase of $2.4 billion over       the ten-year budget window, according to the Congressional       Budget Office.        H.R. 5377 also rolls back the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed       by Republicans and signed into law by President Trump.        ``The Trump tax cuts reduced taxes across the board. This       legislation is step one toward abolishing the entire Trump       tax cuts and increasing taxes on the middle class, a key goal       of every Democrat presidential candidate,'' said Grover       Norquist, President of Americans for Tax Reform.        The legislation raises the cap on the state and local tax       deduction from $10,000 to $20,000 for 2019 and removes the       cap entirely for 2020 and 2021.        The legislation also raises the top rate from 37 to 39.6%       and lowers the threshold that this top rate kicks in for all       filing statuses.        Under current law, the 37 percent bracket kicks in for a       single filer at $518,400 in income. Under the legislation,       the new top rate is increased to 39.6 percent and the       threshold is lowered to $441,475 of income.        Similarly, a family taking the married filing jointly       status currently hits the 37 percent bracket at $622,050 in       income. Under the legislation, this family will hit the 39.6       bracket at $496,000 in income.             Repealing or rolling back the SALT cap is regressive         94 percent of the benefits from repealing the SALT cap       would go to taxpayers making more than $200,000 a year.        The left leaning Center for Budget and Policy Priorities       has stated that this proposal would be ``regressive and       costly.''        The Center for American Progress has stated that repeal of       the SALT cap ``should not be a top priority'' as it would       ``overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy, not the middle class.''        Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO) recently criticized efforts       to repeal the SALT cap noting that it runs counter to       Democrat ideals: ``We can say we're for a progressive tax       bill and for fighting inequality, or we can support the SALT       deduction, but it's really hard to do both of those things.''          Repealing or rolling back the SALT cap is also unnecessary         While Democrats claim the SALT cap raised taxes, this is       overstated and misleading.        The TCJA reduced taxes for roughly 90 percent of Americans       and for taxpayers at every income level through lower rates,       the expanded standard deduction, and the doubling of the       child tax credit.        Furthermore, repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax meant       that 4.5 million families were able to claim $10,000 in SALT       deductions, as the AMT disallowed this deduction.        The SALT deduction subsidizes high tax, big government       states. This deduction is rarely used by middle class       families as they take the standard deduction instead of       itemizing. Capping this deduction has meant that the federal       government is no longer providing a benefit to upper income       earners in blue states.        ATR urges a NO vote on this regressive legislation that       violates the Taxpayer Protection Pledge.                                   ____    AFP Key Vote Alert: Vote No on H.R. 5377, the Restoring Tax Fairness                       for States and Localities Act                                                   December 16, 2019        Dear Representatives: On behalf of Americans for Prosperity       activists across America, I urge you to vote NO on H.R. 5377,       the Restoring Tax Fairness for States and Localities Act.        This vote may be recorded in our 2019 session legislative       scorecard.        H.R. 5377 would temporarily undo some of the many benefits       of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Temporarily increasing the cap       on the SALT deduction (from $10,000 to $20,000) would make       the tax code less fair and more complex, but also increase       bad incentives for state and local governments to raise       taxes. The benefits of lifting the SALT cap would go to       states with higher tax levels. Meanwhile, states with lower       tax levels, like Florida and Texas, will be once again forced       to subsidize the federal tax tab for states like New York,       California, and New Jersey.        Moreover, H.R. 5377 would temporarily raise the top tax       rate on the highest earners and increase the number of       taxpayers paying that rate--one of the very groups that will       benefit from lifting the SALT cap. This makes no sense.        For these reasons, we urge you to vote NO on H.R. 5377.            Sincerely,                                                  Brent Gardner,                                   Chief Government Affairs Officer,      Americans for Prosperity.                                   ____              [From the National Taxpayers Union, Dec. 19, 2019]         National Taxpayers Union urges all Representatives to vote       ``NO'' on H.R. 5377, the ``Restoring Tax Fairness for States       and Localities Act.'' This legislation would undo some of the       many benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), raise       taxes on small businesses across the country, and add to the       complexity of the federal tax code.        Enacted in 2017, the TCJA made several important changes to       the individual side of the federal tax code. By significantly       reducing income tax rates and increasing the standard       deduction, the tax code is fairer and simpler than before.       TCJA rightly reformed many deductions and credits to reduce       the complexity of the tax code, notably by capping the State       and Local Tax (SALT) deduction. Prior to tax reform, the tax       code allowed taxpayers to deduct an unlimited amount of state       and income and property taxes from their federal tax       liability. As a result, many low-tax states were forced to       subsidize the choices of high tax states.        This legislation, however, would reverse these positive       alterations to the tax code by increasing the top marginal       tax rate, lowering the threshold for which this rate kicks  [[Page H12274]]       in, and scrapping the cap on the SALT deduction. Most       concerningly, the effects of uncapping SALT would       disproportionately benefit the wealthiest of our society.       According to IRS data from tax year 2015, over 84 percent of       the benefit of the SALT deduction went towards those with       incomes above $100,000. A mere 3.5 percent went to those with       income levels below $50,000. While some middle class       taxpayers would see benefit from this change, nearly all the       benefit would be for those at the very top of the income       scale.        Ensuring all taxpayers keep more of their hard earned       dollars was a priority of the TCJA, which is why only one       percent of taxpayers paid more in tax under the reformed tax       system. However, giving a tax break to the wealthiest among       us, paid for by an increase in the tax liability of small       businesses, is not a good use of taxpayer dollars. Many       states have adopted pro-taxpayer reforms due to TCJA and the       SALT cap, so we should not reverse course now.        Roll call votes on H.R. 5377 will be significantly-weighted       in NTU's annual Rating of Congress and a ``NO'' vote will be       considered the pro-taxpayer position.                                   ____              [From Heritage Action for America, Dec. 18, 2019]             Congress Should Reject Handouts for High-Tax State         Washington.--Heritage Action released the following       statement from Executive Director Tim Chapman:        The tax bill House Democrats have put on the schedule this       week claims to promote fairness in the tax code, but it       really promotes the interest of liberal states. It is       anything but fair. It will only benefit a minority of       Americans at the expense of those who have chosen to live in       states with smaller tax burdens. SALT deductions are nothing       more than a federal subsidy for high state and local taxes,       which in turn makes individuals in lowtax states responsible       for subsidizing more expensive governments elsewhere.        With the backdrop of partisan impeachment, House Democratic       leadership is desperate to hand legislative ``wins'' to their       members who represent purple districts. House Republicans       should not give them any cover on this bill. It is nothing       but a subsidy to the most liberal states at the expense of       the rest of the country. Americans should be treated equally.                                   ____                                                     Parity for Main                                                Street Employers,                                                  December 10, 2019.      Hon. Richie Neal,      Chairman, Committee on Ways & Means, House of           Representatives,      Washington DC.        Dear Chairman Neal: The Parity for Main Street Employers       coalition has serious concerns with the ``Restoring Tax       Fairness for States and Localities Act'' to be considered by       the House Ways and Means Committee tomorrow.        Individually and family owned businesses organized as S       corporations, partnerships and sole proprietorships are the       heart of the American economy. They employ the majority of       workers, and they contribute the most to our national income.       They also pay the majority of business taxes. A recent study       by EY found that pass-through businesses pay 51 percent of       all business income taxes.        The legislation introduced today would raise these taxes by       1) increasing the top rate passthrough businesses pay from       the current 37 percent to 39.6 percent and 2) lowering the       income threshold of the top rate from $622,050 to $496,600       (Joint) for the years 2020 through 2025, after which the 37       percent rate is scheduled to expire under current law.        This rate hike would be used to offset relief from the SALT       deduction cap, including one year of marriage penalty relief       (2020) and two years of full relief from the cap (2021 and       2022). While this SALT relief will benefit some pass-through       businesses, those savings will be reserved only for       businesses residing in certain states, while the tax hike       will apply to businesses in all fifty states.        It would also undo a critical balance achieved in tax       reform. The lower individual income tax rates coupled with       the 20-percent pass-through deduction was designed to       maintain tax parity for passthrough businesses and the new       21-percent corporate rate. EY recently reported that tax       reform largely succeeded in this balancing act, but only if       the deduction and the lower individual tax rates stay in       place.        The Parity for Main Street Employers coalition represents       millions of individually and family owned businesses       employing tens of millions of private sector workers in every       community and every industry, including contractors,       engineers, retailers, wholesaler-distributors, manufacturers       and more. On behalf of these employers, we ask that you       reconsider this legislation.        Sincerely,        American Council of Engineering Companies, Associated       Builders and Contractors, Associated General Contractors of       America, Independent Community Bankers of America, National       Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, National Beer       Wholesalers Association, National Electrical Contractors       Association, National Federation of Independent Business,       National Roofing Contractors Association, S Corporation       Association, Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America.     Madam Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Rice), an expert on tax policy.                                time  1430     Madam Speaker, I might add that Nebraska, the  State that I represent, actually is considered to be a donor State, as  well, and there is great support for the SALT cap in Nebraska.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Schweikert).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1445     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would just add that there  will be a chance here in a few moments to answer the concerns that the  prior speaker had, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, in the interest of accuracy in  this debate, I would like to reiterate that we doubled the standard  deduction for all Americans--not just selective groups, but all  Americans. We doubled that standard deduction, therefore, helping the  middle class, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from  Texas an additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from New  York an additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I would remind my colleague who  just spoke that the average family of four in his district received a  benefit through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of about $5,000 per year.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr.  LaMalfa).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin).    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, if  there are no other speakers on the other side, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume. Madam Speaker, in the interest of spreading holiday cheer,  I will be brief.   I believe the bill we are about to vote on is bad policy. If you look  at the SALT cap, it is good policy.   A State that has lower taxes should not be forced to pay more to  subsidize a State that has higher taxes. There are generally reasons  that a State is a higher tax State, and that was generated locally or  at that State level.   But I think it is bad policy, as Mr. Zeldin was pointing out, to have  a permanent tax increase to pay for a temporary tax benefit. That is  bad policy.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
