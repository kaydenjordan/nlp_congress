 Madam Speaker, I rise to get  Americans the support to keep them safe and make sure New Mexicans and  rural communities get their fair share. By refilling small business  forgivable loans and dedicating money to small lenders, this package  will help New Mexicans who were crowded out of the first wave of  funding.   I am also voting to save rural hospitals and to get testing and masks  and gloves and gowns, all the things we need to keep us safe and to  rebuild our economy.   There is still so much work to be done, and let's do that next step  together.
