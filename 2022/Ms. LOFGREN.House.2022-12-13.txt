 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  proceedings during the former Members program be printed in the  Congressional Record and that all Members and former Members who spoke  during the proceedings have the privilege of revising and extending  their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1508, I call  up (H.R. 3648) to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to  eliminate the per-country numerical limitation for employment-based  immigrants, to increase the per-country numerical limitation for  family-sponsored immigrants, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 3648.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today the House is considering H.R. 3648, the EAGLE Act,  a bipartisan bill that raises the per-country caps on family-sponsored  immigrant visas and phases out the per-country caps on employment-based  immigrant visas. The bill also includes significant improvements to the  H-1B visa program that add protections for U.S. workers.   Our immigration system has not been significantly updated since 1990,  and it really just follows the basic outlines for the bill that was  enacted in 1965. The failure to evolve the immigration system has  significantly damaged America's ability to compete in an increasingly  global economy. The system is supposed to encourage immigration based  on an individual's family ties to the United States or their ability to  contribute to our economy. It often falls short.   For example, there are backlogs for families seeking reunification.  That could be legal residents of the United States trying to get their  spouse a legal residence visa. There are backlogs in some countries but  none for Western Europe. In addition, in the employment-based context,  before a foreign national can apply for a green card--here is the  process--their employer has to advertise and demonstrate that there are  no U.S. workers who are here who can do the job that they are being  offered. This is to make sure that green card applicants are providing  services and skills that are not readily available in America.   But after this initial test, which is merit-based, the per-country  caps kick in. For example, under current conditions, an individual from  Western Europe, a Western European country, applying for a green card  in the employment-based second preference category based on a  bachelor's degree would be able to gain their permanent residency in  about a year. In contrast, an Indian national with a Ph.D. and  potentially superior skills might have to wait approximately 200 years.  That doesn't help America.   I would note also that the individuals who would ultimately benefit  from the elimination of what amounts to a racist system of allocating  visas, 95 percent of those individuals are already in the United States  legally working on a temporary visa, but in limbo. As that limbo  continues, their children who have been raised in the United States age  out, and when they hit 21, they have to go back to the country their  parents are from, but their parents remain legally in the United  States.   We are losing individuals who we need in America, including  physicians--25 percent of the MDs in the United States are foreign- born; many of them are from India. I have personally met physicians  whose children have aged-out who decided they have to move to Canada  where they can get a green card equivalent in under 6 months.   Now, the disparity, as I mentioned, in the family-sponsored context,  there are some family-sponsored immigrants from Mexico whose wait time  is over 200 years before they are eligible to receive a green card.                                time  1230    That doesn't make any sense at all, and in fact, it is a fraud on  those applicants.   We have been trying to change this system for over a decade. The  Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act, an earlier version of this  legislation, first passed the House in 2011 and again last Congress.  Iterations of this bill have been led by both Democrats and  Republicans, received over 350 ``yes'' votes in the House, and passed  by unanimous consent in the Senate.   The EAGLE Act is based on a bill that passed the Senate last  Congress, with additional restrictions to protect American workers and  a longer transition period to ensure that no country's nationals are  excluded from receiving visas while the per-country caps are phased  out.   Why is this important? People base their expectations on the  situation as it exists. The Congressional Research Service has analyzed  this bill and stated that no one currently in line is negatively  impacted by this legislation.   I thank Representative   John Curtis from Utah for working with me to  introduce the EAGLE Act. I appreciate my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle who have previously supported this legislation, and I urge  that we, once again, vote in favor of this bill.   A system that is based on where you are born instead of what you can  do is not what serves America well. A system that is designed to  advantage someone born in Western Europe over the entire rest of the  world doesn't really recognize merit, which is what this bill is all  about. We should have a system based on competitiveness, not the  country where you were born.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, before I recognize my colleague from the  Judiciary Committee, I would just like to note that the issue about the  EB-4, which is the children, is not correct.   Under current law, if you are a minor and have been abandoned by your  parent, you can go to State court, and the State court will make a  finding that you have been abandoned by your parent. Then, you can  become eligible for legal permanent residence in the EB-4 category.   By the way, you are not, under law, able to then petition for a  parent once the parent abandons you. They are out of the picture. That  is backlogged right now from Central America. This bill will have the  effect of easing those backlogs for orphans from Central America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Ms. Jayapal), a distinguished member of the House Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Chu).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to address the issue of membership in the  Communist Party. It has long been part of the Immigration and  Nationality Act that if you were a member, you are not admissible. I  will read the section. ``Any immigrant who is or has been a member of  or affiliated with the Communist or any other totalitarian party (or  subdivision or affiliate thereof), domestic or foreign, is  inadmissible.''   Now, there are some exceptions, for example, if your membership was  not willing. We do know that in some cases, and not just in China,  Russia signed up, essentially, Boy Scouts as members of the Communist  Party against their will, and they were 12 years old. So the consular  officer can find exceptions based on that, and that is sensible.   Now, the one point that the gentleman did make in committee had to do  with applying this Communist Party inadmissibility provision explicitly  to H-1B applicants, and we did take him up on that suggestion. In fact,  that is a reasonable thing to do. The gentleman made that point because  H-1B visa applicants have dual intent. So the application is eminently  reasonable when it comes to those dual-intent immigrants.   Although we did not draft the amendment at the markup, we did contact  the gentleman's legislative director and went back and forth with the  lawyers on the staff, so there was full knowledge of this provision,  and I thank the gentleman for raising the issue.   There have been complaints that we haven't had hearings. We have had  a lot of hearings on this issue. In fact, I can recall so well,  physicians--a quarter of the physicians in the United States are  foreign born. Most of those medical doctors were born in India, and  they are providing medical services to underserved communities  throughout the United States. I have met many of them. We have had  testimony from them at our hearing in the Committee on the Judiciary.   To tell the people who are getting their medical care from these  physicians that it doesn't matter, these physicians have to go to  Canada and leave them without a doctor in their small town, that is not  reasonable. Failure to act will result in that type of situation. In  fact, it is already resulting in that type of situation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  [[Page H9716]]    Mr. Speaker, I just want to make a note on the issue of nursing,  which is very important. As you know, we have had a very tough time  with nurses in America. They have been through COVID; the trauma has  been enormous, and we have a need for more nurses while nurses are  leaving the profession for understandable reasons.   Part of the answer is nurses who want to come to the United States  and practice nursing. That is not the whole answer, but it is part of  the answer, and so at the request and suggestion of Senators who we  have been talking about, there is a carve-out of 4,400 visas for nurses  and physical therapists during the transition period. We think once the  transition is over, we will be adequately accommodated, but during the  transition, that is included.   I would note that the Society of Hospital Medicine does support this  bill.   We had three hearings in the Immigration and Citizenship Subcommittee  on this topic, and I think we had an understanding on the subcommittee  kind of on what all the issues were.   This is our best effort at dealing with those issues. It has received  broad support in the past, bipartisan support in the past, and I hope  it would do so again.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, just a couple of notes. First, this bill does not add  any additional visas to the visa system. There were efforts to do that,  plans to recapture visas. That was never agreed to by the Senate, and  so this is an allocation of existing visas. It doesn't add a single  visa.   As I said before, 95 percent of the individuals who would be impacted  are already here legally in the United States. They are legally working  in the United States. So it is no new people coming in, either. It is  people who are already here, no additional visas.   We asked the Congressional Research Service to do an analysis because  people wanted to know--and they were right to want to know--is there  any adverse impact on Africa or the Caribbean, and CRS told us there  was no impact on Africa or the Caribbean.   Referring to the EB-5 category, I think those who are concerned don't  realize that we actually changed the EB-5 Act through the Integrity Act  earlier this year, and due to those changes, 32 percent of the green  cards available every year for investments go to a new category. It is  completely current. There is no backlog.   I just want to talk a little bit about what we are doing here. My  colleague from California said we are talking about picking winners and  losers.   In 1965, the Congress did pick winners and losers when they designed  this structure. The winners were Western Europe, and the losers were  everyone else. Now, that system, although not, I am sure, intended to  be called racist, did advantage people from Western Europe to the  disadvantage of the rest of the world, and we are still working on that  system today.    I think it is time to change that system. It is time to move to  merit, not to  [[Page H9717]]  race, not to the country you were born in. I am not accusing any  critics of this bill, I am not talking about their motivation, but the  fact is, if we don't change this system, we are supporting something  that we did in 1965 that really has an effect of having race play a  role in who gets a visa instead of merit on the employment side. I  don't think that serves our country well.   Put aside for a minute our ideals just to discuss the economic  impact. We do well economically when the very most able people who want  to come here and be Americans, to start companies, to invent things are  able to do so. The current system throws a wrench into that, and it is  not good for the United States of America.   I hope, once again, that we can vote to approve this bill. It doesn't  do everything I would like to do in reforming immigration law. As the  gentleman knows, I have worked for many decades to do a variety of  improvements, but this fixes something.   Let's not say we can't do anything unless we do everything. That is a  path toward mediocrity.   Let's do what we can do to make this system work better, to move it  away from its racist origins and have a system based on merit.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
