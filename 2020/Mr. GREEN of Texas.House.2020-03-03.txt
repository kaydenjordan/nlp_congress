 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, proud to be an  American, proud to be a Member of the U.S. House of Representatives.   I rise today because I refuse to accept the notion that we should get  back to bigotry as usual in the House of Representatives. I am one who  has fought bigotry most of my life, and I will continue to fight it for  the rest of my life.   Today, I want to talk about bigotry, not only within the country, but  I also want to talk about those who aid and abet bigotry in the House  of Representatives. Right here in this House there are people who aid  and abet bigotry.   I spoke last on the floor about a Newsday report. It concerned an  investigation that took place in the State of New York. And within this  investigation it was uncovered that, with reference to real estate  agents, after having tested them, it was uncovered that 19 percent of  the time Asian Americans were treated unequally when compared to White  Americans. Thirty-nine percent of the time Hispanic Americans were  treated unequally. And 49 percent of the time African Americans were  treated unequally.   We sought to do something about this in the Financial Services  Committee. We have a piece of legislation that will provide for testing  and expand the testing that was started in this country by President  Ronald Reagan.   President Reagan gave us the paradigm which we seek to enhance, which  we seek to expand because that is the means by which we can eliminate  this kind of invidious discrimination. It is not a question of way; it  is a question of whether we have the will to challenge it and take it  on.   I want to tell you that in my committee there were those who would  aid and abet. They came up with specious arguments, fallacious  contentions, the notion that we can do without, without saying we can  do without the improvements.   I believe this kind of aiding and abetting is the reason we still  have this level of invidious discrimination in this country. There are  people in this Congress who aid and abet racism and discrimination. We  have to call this out. We cannot continue to pretend that it does not  exist right here in the Congress of the United States of America.   I plan to come back to this podium, and I am going to say more about  what happened and who caused it to happen. Those who tolerate bigotry  and racism perpetuate bigotry and racism. I refuse to be among those  who tolerate it.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, March 3, 2020, I missed  the following votes:   1. H.
