 Mr. Speaker, it is simply unacceptable  that the Nation's total student loan debt has surpassed credit card  debt in our country. Student loan debt can follow a person for life,  making it more difficult to raise a family, start a business, buy a  home, or save for retirement.   That is why I introduced the Student Loan Repayment Assistance Act  which will help college graduates more easily repay their student loan  debts by incentivizing more employers to offer student loan repayment  assistance.   This bill will help alleviate the financial and emotional burden of a  student loan debt, and help employers attract and retain skilled,  qualified employees. It is a win-win for all.   In Congress, I will continue to fight for a strong middle class where  everyone can achieve the American Dream.                            ____________________
