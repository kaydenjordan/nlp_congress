 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Add at the end of title II the following:       SEC. 213. ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN LEASING AUTHORITY OF THE                     COMMISSION.         Section 12(b)(3) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C.       16(b)(3)) is amended--        (1) by striking ``including, but not limited to,'' and       inserting ``excluding''; and        (2) by adding at the end the following new sentence: ``In       the case of an existing lease contract entered into under       this paragraph, the Commission may not extend the lease term,       but may agree to any other contract modification that does       not result in any additional cost to the Federal       Government.''.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 40, the gentleman from  Alabama (Mr. Aderholt) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I present to you an amendment, as the chairman of the  Appropriations Subcommittee for Agriculture, that provides funding  oversight for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, known as the  CFTC.   This amendment that is before us this afternoon is a simple, yet a  very necessary solution to issues identified at the CFTC regarding its  leasing practices by its own inspector general and the Government  Accountability Office.   This amendment, Mr. Chairman, would allow the CFTC to manage its  leases through a third party, such as the General Services  Administration.   Up until now, the CFTC has demonstrated they have not responsibly  managed their own leases, and such missteps have created a number of  problems for the agency itself. These include poor management and  oversight of the agency's leasing practices, resulting in millions of  dollars in excess space and leasing costs.   The GAO legal division has identified instances of the CFTC violating  the appropriations law with regard to its leasing payments and  contracts.   GAO is further reviewing four additional legal issues that are  related to the CFTC's leasing contracts, and we expect the issuance of  opinions in the near future that will justify the need for this very  amendment that we are talking about this afternoon.   Let me add that at the CFTC, they are experts at their oversight of  the commodity and the futures and the swap markets. However, the CFTC  is not expert in leasing practices, and they should be relieved from  the burden of doing this as we move forward.   I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment at the desk.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment has been vetted by the  House Legislative Counsel and the staff at the CFTC.   The CHAIR. The gentleman from Alabama has yielded back. Does the  gentleman from Alabama seek unanimous consent to reclaim the balance of  the time?  [[Page H422]]         Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim my  time.   The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from  Alabama?   There was no objection.    The amendment has been vetted by the House Legislative  Counsel and the staff at the CFTC. I understand and I can appreciate  any concerns that the ranking member would have.   Let me say, as we move forward, we will take any of this into account  as we move forward on this process, any technical changes that are  necessary before this bill becomes law, and we will be happy to work  with the ranking member as we move forward with this amendment.                                time  1330     I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota.    Reclaiming my time, I would just add that, for this  amendment, we will work with any concerns that they may have and try to  fix anything that may be, but this is something that needs to be  addressed, as there are real problems at the CFTC regarding the leasing  issue.   I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt).   The amendment was agreed to.            Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Austin Scott of Georgia    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in  part B of House Report 115-3.   Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of title II, add the following:       SEC. 213. REFORM OF THE CUSTOMER PROTECTION FUND.         Section 23(g) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C.       26(g)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (2)--        (A) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by striking       ``or fiscal year limitation'';        (B) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``; and'' and       inserting ``, without fiscal year limitation;''; and        (C) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``thereunder.'' and       inserting ``, the total amount of which shall not exceed       $5,000,000 per fiscal year.'';        (2) in paragraph (3)(A), by striking ``unless the balance       of the Fund at the time the monetary judgment is collected       exceeds $100,000,000'' and inserting ``, but only to the       extent that the resulting balance of the Fund does not exceed       $50,000,000''; and        (3) by redesignating paragraph (5) as paragraph (6) and       inserting after paragraph (4) the following:        ``(5) Reversion to treasury.--Notwithstanding the preceding       provisions of this subsection, to the extent the balance of       the Fund exceeds $50,000,000, the excess amount shall be       deposited in the Treasury of the United States as       miscellaneous receipts.''.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 40, the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.   AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer the Scott amendment to H.R. 238, the  Commodity End-User Relief Act.   This commonsense amendment brings much needed reforms and guidance  for the consumer protection fund at the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission. The drafters of Dodd-Frank envisioned the consumer  protection fund to be capped at $100 million. However, through agency  interpretations, this fund currently has a balance of nearly $250  million.   While the fund is certainly well-intended and can be used to pay  whistleblower awards and fund customer education initiatives, there is  no limit on the amount of the fund that can be spent on these customer  education initiatives.   There is also a very broad definition of what constitutes a customer  education initiative. For instance, the vast majority of the fund is  currently being spent on programs like advertising, opening offices in  cities with little need, and paying for CFTC staff travel.   This amendment would do two things. First, it would place a hard cap,  one which administrators can't bypass, on the fund of $50 million. This  would simply make a commonsense decision to return approximately $200  million to the Treasury and keep the fund from carrying an excessive  balance in the future. Should whistleblower payouts exceed $50 million,  the Treasury would place additional money into the fund.   The amendment's second reform would limit spending on customer  education initiatives to $5 million per year. This limit would bring  discipline to the provision that has been used to spend millions in  advertising and social media outreach.   The Congressional Budget Office informally indicates that these  changes would save more than $40 million and would preserve the  customer protection fund while making commonsense reforms to protect  taxpayer resources.   I encourage adoption of my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
