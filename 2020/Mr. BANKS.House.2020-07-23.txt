 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from the  great State of Texas for organizing this important conversation that we  are having here this evening. There is so much, as the gentleman has  already said, that makes America great, our history, our culture, our  values, our people.   But, Mr. Speaker, 300 years ago, colonists left their homes to come  to these shores and become free. They didn't want to be bullied for  their beliefs anymore.   Our Founding Fathers thought this freedom was so important they  enshrined it in the First Amendment. But it is under attack more than  ever today in the form of what has become known as the ``cancel  culture.''   If you hold the wrong beliefs; if you support the wrong candidate; if  you affiliate yourself with the wrong party; if you watch the wrong  news network, you can get canceled; which means that they can take your  job, they can take your privacy and your reputation away from you in a  flash.   You can even get canceled for not doing something. If you refuse to  utter or endorse the so-called politically correct movements or  phrases, they will come to destroy you.   This is an affront to the very idea of what America is and who we  are, as Americans, and I vow to fight it with every fiber of my being.   I appreciate my colleague from Texas organizing this Special Order to  talk about these important issues, but from the bottom of my heart,  this is what is on my mind and my heart as we serve in this body today.  We have got to do everything we can to change it.
