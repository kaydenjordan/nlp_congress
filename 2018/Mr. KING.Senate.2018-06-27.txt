 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the town of  Falmouth, ME, which is celebrating its 300th anniversary this year.  Falmouth is renowned for its jagged coastline, vibrant rural area, and  picturesque forest preserve. Located on the coast of southern Maine and  spanning approximately 32 square miles, Falmouth is proudly home to  roughly 11,000 residents. The town's rich history dates back to 1718,  when Falmouth was incorporated as a part of New Casco. For its third  centennial, Falmouth community members have dedicated 2018 to honoring  their past, celebrating their present, and investing in their future.   Around the time of the Revolutionary War, Falmouth separated from New  Casco and became the settlement that we are familiar with today. In  1820, Falmouth was among the towns that voted with an overwhelming  majority to secede from Massachusetts and become the State of Maine. At  the time of its establishment, the townspeople's primary occupations  were forestry, agriculture, and fishing. The original settlers of  Falmouth possessed a strong work ethic that ensured their families'  survival in the northern wilderness.   Today, the town of Falmouth prides itself on fostering a colorful,  modern and ever-changing environment. Town officers effectively balance  the scenic atmosphere of the coastal Maine town with the 21st century  need for economic development to keep Falmouth a thriving and  innovative community. This year, a series of events including  charitable fundraisers, outdoor education activities, and historical  learning opportunities will be held to celebrate Falmouth's local  businesses and organizations as integral members of the community.  These efforts create a comfortable environment to live, work, and  learn.   In the coming years, this Falmouth community will continue to  celebrate  [[Page S4504]]  the accomplishments of the town's remarkable schools, stunning  geography, and outstanding local businesses. I commend the people of  Falmouth for drawing attention to the town's esteemed history and  providing a driving force to propel it into the future. A special  recognition goes out to the Falmouth 300 planning committee. These  dedicated residents have spent the last 2 years planning a mix of  educational and entertaining events that will take place in the coming  year. The work that the Falmouth 300 committee has done is sure to have  a lasting effect that will be felt for years to come.                            ____________________
