 Mr. President, first of all, I compliment Senator Thune  with his remarks and agree with everything that he said and  particularly to emphasize his call for a hearing before the Senate  Agriculture Committee, something we have been trying to get done for a  long period of time, and I hope that will soon happen.                           Remembering John Warner    Mr. President, secondly, I would like to follow up on the comments  that the two Senators for Virginia made about Senator Warner.   Senator Warner came to the Senate 2 years before I did, and I  remember him almost constantly talking about the No. 1 responsibility  of the Federal Government: our national security and protecting the  American people. And he was always, whether he was Secretary of the  Navy or whether he was a Senator from Virginia--he was always speaking  strongly about keeping and making sure that our military was strong to  meet its constitutional responsibilities.   I also remember that he was a person that quite frequently would  speak up in Republican caucuses when he had a disagreement with the  leadership of the day or the position of the caucus for the day or  maybe he would even be in the minority of the caucus speaking on  something that he felt strongly about.  [[Page S3475]]    And I also remember his speaking in terms of--after Reagan Airport  was shut down because of 9/11 and the consequences that brought to the  economy of Northern Virginia, how we worked so hard to get that airport  opened up again.                           Anti-Semitic Hate Crimes    Mr. President, the third and last reason for coming to the U.S.  Senate floor at this time to speak is to, like all of my colleagues  would do, condemn the troubling increase in hate crimes, whether it is  on any minority group, but today I come to the floor because of the  recent attacks on Jewish Americans.   Anti-Semitism has been called the oldest hatred. Throughout the  history of the Jewish people, they have been subjected to cruelty,  discrimination, and violence. Even in modern times, even here in  America, Jews are still not safe from this hatred, and that is a  profoundly bad and sad situation. No Jewish American should ever  experience bigotry based on their religion, nor should they be  subjected to threats, harassment, or injury because there is a Jewish  State of Israel.   We can express disagreements about foreign policy and about conflict  in the Middle East, but we should never allow those disagreements to  become dehumanizing and abusive. Yet, in response to the terrible  conflict in Gaza recently, Jewish Americans have been attacked in  recent weeks.   The Anti-Defamation League has said that the reporting of anti- Semitic incidents has gone up 63 percent since the start of the war  between Israel and Hamas.   In New York, two Jewish teenagers were surrounded by an angry mob  just this last Saturday. The boys were told that they had to chant  ``free Palestine'' or chant ``kill all Jews'' before they were beaten  and choked.   On Thursday, a man wearing a yarmulke was beaten by a gang of men who  chanted words like ``Hamas is going to kill all of you.''   In Los Angeles, anti-Israel protesters attacked Jewish patrons at a  restaurant. The attackers reportedly said ``death to Jews'' and ``free  Palestine.''   An orthodox Jewish man was chased by cars flying Palestinian flags in  another incident in Los Angeles.   I hope that we all condemn this horrible wave of violence against  Jewish Americans, but Members of Congress can do more to take down the  temperature. We should never vilify Israel or Israelis. This only  fosters other hateful attacks, encouraging others to do dehumanizing  things. We can talk about geopolitical problems without demonizing a  people. That is pretty common sense.   I remember how far anti-Semitic violence can go. In October of 2018,  Robert Bowers attacked the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, PA,  killing 11. He did so after complaining that our first President with  Jewish members in the first family--President Trump, that is--was  surrounded by a Jewish ``infestation.'' Those were his words. It was  the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in U.S. history.   While battling the recent spike in Asian-American and Pacific  Islander hate crimes, we need to remember to combat all hate crimes. I  look forward to opportunities in hearings or in legislation to see if  we are doing everything that we can to protect our Jewish brethren and  all Americans.   I yield the floor.
