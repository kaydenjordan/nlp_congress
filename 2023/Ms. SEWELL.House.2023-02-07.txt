 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my distinguished  guests for the 2023 State of the Union, the Curry family of Selma,  Alabama.   Mr. Thomas Curry is a native of Selma who bravely served our Nation  for over 30 years in the United States Air Force. Mrs. Annie Curry, his  wife, spent over a decade working as a teacher and a counselor at Selma  High School.   The Currys have been married for over 60 years and are currently in  their nineties. Tragically, as a result of the tornadoes that tore  through Alabama on January 12, the Currys lost their home of over 50  years, displacing them and destroying the place where they raised their  five children. Luckily, the Currys escaped without injury. God is  indeed good.   The people of Alabama's Seventh Congressional District are indeed  resilient, and the Curry family represents the very best of us. Their  story is yet another reminder of the need for increased Federal  assistance for Alabama families impacted by the tornadoes.   I was honored to lead a delegation letter to President Biden asking  for 100 percent Federal share, given the dire straits of the historic  city of Selma, Alabama, and that of Autauga County.   Mr. Speaker, I am asking my colleagues to welcome the Currys to our  Nation's Capitol and keep them in your prayers. We are indeed Selma  strong.                            ____________________
