 Mr. Speaker, today we are in the midst of a  manufactured crisis that would have very real devastating consequences  for the American people.   The extreme MAGA Republicans have taken the American economy hostage  and presented the country with two disastrous choices: default or  draconian spending cuts.   A default would erase millions of jobs, trigger a recession,  devastate retirement accounts, and increase borrowing costs.   On the other hand, the cuts being promoted by the extreme MAGA  Republicans would take Medicaid away from millions, snatch food  assistance away from families, and even slash veterans' healthcare.   We need five moderate Republicans to sign the petition. New York  State sent five moderate Republicans to the House.   Where are they today?   New York State, please take notice. When we needed them, they were  not here doing right by the American people.                            ____________________
