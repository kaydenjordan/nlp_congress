 Mr. Speaker, the Iranian regime  continues to enrich weapons-grade uranium, oppress its people, and  export missiles and terrorism.   Yesterday, the regime threatened that the West could not stop it from  a nuclear arms program, fulfilling the chant of death to Israel, death  to America. Iranian drones murder innocent Ukrainians every day.   In a Wall Street Journal column last week, John Bolton, former  National Security Advisor, wrote, incredibly: ``During Mr. Biden's  term. . . . his administration still seeks to resuscitate the Iran  deal.''   President Donald Trump was correct in pulling the U.S. out of the  Iran deal as Iran shamefully continues ICBM development to kill  Americans.   I am grateful to have joined a bipartisan group of 35 House  colleagues in sending a letter to leaders of the United Kingdom,  France, and Germany, encouraging them to reimpose sanctions on Iran.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with open Biden borders.    Our sympathy for the family of beloved civic leader Lottie Gregg.                            ____________________
