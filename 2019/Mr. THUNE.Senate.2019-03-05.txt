 Madam President, last week, we learned that the economy  grew at a rate of 3.1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the  fourth quarter of 2018. That is the strongest economic growth in over  10 years. Economic growth for the fourth quarter of 2018 smashed market  expectations.   In January, the economy created more than 300,000 jobs. More than 5.3  million jobs have been created since President Trump was elected. Job  openings hit a record high of 7.3 million in December, substantially  exceeding the number of those looking for work. The Department of Labor  reports that the number of job openings has exceeded the number of job  seekers for 10 straight months. Unemployment is low. January marked the  11th straight month that unemployment has been at or below 4 percent.  That is the longest streak in nearly five decades.   Wage growth has accelerated. Wages have now been growing at a rate of  3 percent or greater for 6 straight months. The last time wage growth  reached this level was in 2009. Median household income is at an  alltime high.   U.S. manufacturing has rebounded. The Wall Street Journal reported on  Friday:   [[Page S1639]]              America's factories are hiring again.        After years of job losses, U.S. manufacturing employment       has risen for 18 straight months among those holding       production or nonsupervisory jobs, the longest stretch of       gains since the mid-1990s.    That is from the Wall Street Journal.   The list goes on.   The economic growth we are experiencing is the direct result of  Republican policies. Economic growth has accelerated over the past 2  years, thanks to the lifting of the burdensome regulations and a  historic reform of our Tax Code.   Before we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, our Tax Code was acting  as a drag on economic growth. Small businesses faced heavy tax burdens  that frequently made it difficult for them to expand and create jobs or  even to get their businesses off the ground in the first place.  America's global businesses faced the highest corporate tax rate in the  developed world, which put them at a competitive disadvantage on the  international stage.   Of course, all of that had real consequences for American workers. A  small business owner facing a huge tax bill was highly unlikely to be  able to expand her business or to hire a new employee. A larger  business was going to find it hard to create jobs or improve benefits  for employees while struggling to stay competitive against foreign  businesses paying much less in taxes. So we reformed our Tax Code to  make it easier for businesses to grow, create jobs, and expand  opportunities for American workers. Now we are seeing the results-- economic growth, low unemployment, higher wages, a record-high number  of job openings, and more.   Importantly, the benefits of this growth are being experienced  widely. The Wall Street Journal reports:         Racial minorities, those with less education and people       working in the lowest-paying jobs are getting bigger pay       raises and, in many cases, experiencing the lowest       unemployment rate ever recorded for their groups. They are       joining manufacturing workers, women in their prime working       years, Americans with disabilities and those with criminal       records, among others, in finding improved job prospects       after years of disappointment.    Again, that is from the Wall Street Journal.   The Obama administration was characterized by a weak recovery and  years of economic stagnation. There were predictions that 2 percent  growth would be the new normal. But Republican economic policies have  turned the economy around. Now we need to focus on ways to extend the  benefits of tax reform even further and to secure the gains we have  made for the long term.   Unfortunately, our colleagues across the aisle are more focused on  dismantling the policies that created the growth we are experiencing  today. Apparently, it doesn't matter to them that workers are doing  better after years of economic stagnation or that jobs and  opportunities are increasing. They are set on dismantling tax reform  and raising rates to fund their socialist fantasies. They want to spend  $93 trillion--more money than the GDP of the entire world--to put the  government in charge of Americans' healthcare, energy usage, and more.   I wish I were joking, but Democrats' turn toward socialist insanity  is all too real. The kinds of tax hikes that would be required to pay  for Democrats' proposals would cripple our economy and severely  downgrade America's standard of living--not to mention robbing  Americans of their freedom to make their own decisions about all the  various aspects of their lives.   It is mind-boggling that more and more Democrats are embracing  socialism and the less free and less prosperous future it would bring.  Let's hope their socialist fantasies stay just that--fantasies--because  our economy might never recover from the reality of Democrats'  proposals.   I yield the floor.
