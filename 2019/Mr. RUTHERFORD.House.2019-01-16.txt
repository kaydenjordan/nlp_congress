 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 46th  annual March for Life.   In Congress, I believe I have the responsibility to support life  beginning at conception, which is why I voted last Congress to defend  life and defund Planned Parenthood. However, I am disheartened this  legislative body continues to funnel taxpayer money to the abortion  industry.   The often repeated talking point that Planned Parenthood exists as a  woman's health organization has now been refuted by its very own  president. She had this to say about Planned Parenthood: ``Our core  mission is providing, protecting, and expanding access to abortion and  reproductive healthcare.''   Madam Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor of the Defund Planned  Parenthood Act, which reroutes Federal dollars to community health  centers, where women can still get the care they need while protecting  the sanctity of life. An organization whose core mission has taken the  lives of 61 million unborn children should not be receiving taxpayer  funds.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the  political ultimatum that has now poisoned this bill.   I had anticipated originally that I would support Chairwoman Lowey's  proposal to provide disaster relief to American families who were  struggling to rebuild from these recent disasters, like Hurricane  Michael that tore up my State of Florida. However, last night, the  majority slipped into this bill another short-term continuing  resolution that they know will hold this bill back from ever becoming  law.   Instead of doing the right thing and passing a clean disaster relief  bill, the other side of the aisle continues to play games in an effort  to resist the President's call for border security with Mexico.   The Senate and the President have made it clear that government  funding bills brought to the floor without border security will not be  signed into law.   It is time to accept the reality of the situation that we find  ourselves in. Compromise is the only path forward.   But the other side of the aisle seems content to blame the President  while punishing victims of natural disasters, including those in the  Speaker's own home State of California, who desperately need this  relief as they recover from devastating wildfires. Attempting to score  political points at the expense of innocent disaster victims is  despicable and no way to legislate.   This bill before us today could have provided much-needed relief for  Florida families recovering from Hurricane Michael. And it is not just  families who will suffer; it is also the Florida farmers, and many  Americans who rely on them, who had their crops devastated by this  storm.   It is 26 days into the shutdown, and we are still playing these  games. Madam Speaker, if you are serious about providing disaster  relief to Americans, bring a clean supplemental funding bill to the  floor. Stop playing these games with constituents in the northeast and  the Panhandle of Florida.    Madam Chair, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Madam Chair, I rise again today in opposition to the political  ultimatum that has poisoned this bill.   I had anticipated that I would support Chairwoman Lowey's proposal to  provide disaster relief to American families struggling to rebuild from  recent disasters like Hurricane Michael that devastated my home State  of Florida.   I do thank her and her staff for the hard work that they have done in  putting together this disaster relief bill. However, in the dark of  night, the majority leadership slipped into this bill another  continuing resolution that they know will hold this bill back from ever  becoming signed into law.   Some on the other side have asked why adding a CR would be a poison  pill  [[Page H635]]  in this measure. The answer is really simple: This bill will never be  considered by the Senate or signed by the President. Leadership knows  this, but they continue to place politics over helping hardworking,  taxpaying American citizens.   So what are we here to accomplish? Is the majority trying to help  American citizens recover or simply content to blame the President  while punishing hardworking taxpayers who have been devastated by  natural disasters, including those, by the way, in the Speaker's home  State of California? Those folks are desperately in need of this relief  as they recover from devastating wildfires.   Instead of doing the right thing and passing a clean disaster relief  bill, the other side of the aisle continues to play childish games in  an effort to resist the President's call for border security.   If the goal of this bill is to provide disaster relief, why on Earth  would the majority attach something that effectively ensures its  defeat?   Madam Chair, this move has again effectively victimized those  devastated by hurricanes and fire.   It is time to accept the reality of the situation in which we find  ourselves. Compromise is the only path forward. President Trump has  made clear, I believe, that he is ready to negotiate and to compromise.  But this bill before us today could have provided much-needed relief to  Florida families recovering from Hurricane Michael. It is not just  those families who will suffer. It is the Florida farmers who had their  crops decimated by the storm, and the Americans who rely on them, who  will suffer also.    Madam Chair, we are 26 days into this shutdown, and leadership is  still playing these games. If the majority is serious about providing  disaster relief, bring a clean supplemental funding bill to the floor  and stop playing games with so many hurting American lives.
