 Mr. Speaker, last week we passed the American Rescue Plan  to help our Nation get through a COVID-19 public health and economic  crisis. This historic legislation is already helping millions of  Americans and hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans.   When I think about this piece of legislation, it is widely, on a  bipartisan basis, supported in a swing district like mine back in  Minnesota. But if Congress fails to take action--and we are not going  to let that happen--to prevent sequestration, countless Federal  programs that our constituents rely on could be impacted.   If we fail to pass H.R. 1868, cuts to programs at USDA could  devastate family farmers who are already reeling after years of trade  instability and stupid trade wars. We must act because we cannot allow  cuts to Medicare, risking seniors' access to care at a time when they  need it the most, in the midst of a deadly global pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  crucial legislation to ensure that the Federal Government can meet the  needs of Minnesotans and the American people during a public health  crisis. This body that I joined just over 2 years ago; this body has  come together numerous times to make sure that we do not allow  sequestration to take cuts for worse ideas than helping the American  people through a public health crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please support this bill today.    Madam Speaker, last weekend, I visited women-owned  businesses in Shakopee, and I had the pleasure of meeting Elise Steger  who owns ShakRa Yoga & Fitness.   Throughout the past year, Elise has done everything she can to comply  with COVID restrictions while continuing to pay her employees and keep  her business open. With the help of the Paycheck Protection Program  loans she has also turned to creative solutions like virtual classes,  but she has been able to keep her business going.   The Paycheck Protection Program has served as a lifeline to small  businesses like Elise's, but in less than 2 weeks it is due to expire.  This week we passed legislation in the House on a bipartisan basis to  extend this critical program through May 31. We must ensure that that  extension becomes law.                            ____________________
