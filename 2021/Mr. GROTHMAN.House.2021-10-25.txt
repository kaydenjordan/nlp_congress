 Madam Speaker, a lot has been said about the  reconciliation bill that we may or may not vote on. Obviously, the  spending is tremendously out of control and will further fan the flames  of inflation. There are several provisions in there designed, one more  time, I would argue, to replace fathers and the family.   Madam Speaker, today, I will address, one more time, the majority's  obsession with abortion. We have already seen this cycle, efforts made  in the White House to get rid of the Mexico City policy and have the  United States involved in pushing abortion around the world, kind of a  very strange and sad thing given how blessed this country has been by  the Almighty during our tenure.   In this bill, one more time, be it including $10 billion in public  health funding grants that do not include the Hyde amendment, or  abortion coverage for ObamaCare and plans covering individuals up to  138 percent of the Federal poverty line, this is one of the most  extreme pro-abortion bills that I have seen yet, and it is another  reason not to vote for the reconciliation bill.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I would also like to speak on behalf of  Congressman Keller's bill.   One of the things we do as Congressmen back in our district is  constituent work. Probably one of the areas which we are busiest is in  the areas of helping our veterans. Whether it is getting burial  benefits, veteran benefits, or lost military awards, we have to contact  the National Personnel Records Center.   Unfortunately, as has been mentioned, for over a year now, the  National Personnel Records Center has been operating at well under  capacity. This is an insult to our veterans.   Their excuse for not operating is, of course, the COVID. My staff has  toured the National Personnel Records Center, and it is a large  warehouse, very spread out. Unlike where most Americans have had to  work the last 2 years, you are not squeezed up in a cubicle next to  somebody else.   Unfortunately--and this maybe is an indication of the overall caring  of the Federal Government. Unfortunately, they have not been open at a  time when not only our veterans have given so much, but a time when so  many taxpayers have been working around the clock.   Every night I go home, I go by a couple of cheese factories. I can  drive by there at 1 in the morning. They are packed with people. They  never stopped working.   Here we have a massive warehouse with lots of space between people,  and we are told it is too dangerous to go to work. That is  preposterous. It is an insult to our veterans. It is an insult to our  taxpayers.   I urge this body to pass Congressman Keller's bill as soon as  possible.
