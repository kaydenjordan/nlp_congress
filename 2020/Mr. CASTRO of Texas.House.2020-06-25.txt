 Mr. Speaker, for far too long, far too many  people have lost their lives to police brutality. And for far too long,  the government has failed to protect the people. That changes today.  This is a first, yet significant step to save lives, especially Black  lives.   In my hometown of San Antonio, police violence has existed for  generations. In just the last few years, Marquise Jones was killed by  an off-duty officer during a routine fender-bender.   Antronie Scott was killed by an officer who thought a cell phone was  a gun.   Charles Roundtree was killed by police. He was only 18 years old.   The Latino community has also suffered from police brutality. Andres  Guardado and Carlos Lopez are the latest to be killed.   Forty years ago, in San Antonio, Hector Santoscoy was killed by a  police officer who had also killed a Black man, Bobby Jo Phillips, in  1968.   The cases we see on video are only a fraction of the misconduct and  abuse that occurs every day, leaving long-lasting physical, mental, and  sociological damage. The good, lifesaving work of police is undercut by  the blue code of secrecy, officers who refuse to tell on each other,  police unions that never admit when they are wrong, and politicians who  have been afraid to take on police unions.   This Congress must have the courage to act now and pass this  legislation.
