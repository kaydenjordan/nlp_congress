 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 944 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes of  debate equally divided.    Mr. President, my amendment would fix the proposed new  formula that benefits New York at the expense of other States. The bill  provides $30 billion for transit on top of the nearly $40 billion  Congress already gave transit in the CARES Act and the December COVID  bill.   I oppose the extreme funding, but my amendment at least fixes one  troubling detail. The bill directs $26 billion in transit to urbanized  areas but gives 30 percent of that to New York City, nearly double of  what it would receive under the normal formula. By voting for this  bill, my colleagues from States like Arizona, Georgia, and West  Virginia would lose out on transit money to New York.   The bill also has $2.2 billion for FTA to allocate based on another  new formula that just happens to reward the largest urban transit  systems. My amendment would reinstate the regular formula. It will  ensure transit money is at least distributed fairly instead of  benefitting one or two cities, and I urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. President, do I have time?    Could I ask unanimous consent for 15 more seconds,  please?    New York would receive 30 percent more under this new  formula compared to the 18 percent they have now. For example, Reno,  NV, would lose $2 million, and other cities like that lose as well  under this new formula.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
