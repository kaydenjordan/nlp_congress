 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Morelle for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the rule and the underlying  bills. I am pleased to see the House make significant progress this  week by passing these appropriations bills which include important  funding for my district, our communities, and for people all across the  country.   I do want to highlight two bipartisan amendments made in order under  this rule which I have offered to H.R. 4505, the Commerce, Justice, and  Science Appropriations bill.   First is amendment No. 43, which I introduced with Representatives  Brian Babin, Chrissy Houlahan, and   Donald Norcross. Our amendment  would elevate the Office of Space Commerce by moving it out of the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and into the Office of  the Secretary of Commerce. This relatively small office has growing  responsibilities to license remote sensing activities or satellite  imagery of the Earth and implement a pilot program on space situational  awareness.   Elevating this office would better leverage the expertise of the  entire department to support their work and improve interagency  collaboration, which is critical to their responsibilities. This  proposal has been discussed for years, and it is time to finally make  this move. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee to further define these new roles and  responsibilities.   I also want to highlight another bipartisan amendment No. 44, which I  introduced with Representatives   Ken Buck,   Joe Neguse, Doug Lamborn,  Diana DeGette, and Jason Crow from the Colorado delegation. Our  amendment is a plus-minus amendment to NASA's exploration account to  show our support for additional funding for the Orion Multipurpose Crew  Vehicle totalling $1.45 billion.                                time  1045    Orion is America's deep space exploration spacecraft which will carry  our astronauts back to the Moon and on to Mars as part of the Artemis  program. This additional funding for Orion will reduce costs in the  program over the long term by maximizing reuse of Orion's systems and  establish efficient production flows for the Artemis III Orion  spacecraft and beyond.   Our amendment would fully fund Orion while also supporting full  funding for the Space Launch System and Exploration Ground Systems, as  all three are critical to the Artemis program. The entire NASA  Exploration program should be increased to meet these standards, and I  hope to work with Chairman Cartwright and our Appropriations Committee  to do just that and support NASA's important work without cutting other  programs.   I encourage all of my colleagues to support these amendments, the  rule, and the underlying bills.
