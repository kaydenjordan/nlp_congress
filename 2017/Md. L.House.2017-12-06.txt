 Rev. 1205, 1212       (2012).        Our experience as attorneys general further reinforces this       data. Law-abiding individuals who choose to exercise their       constitutional right to carry a firearm for self-defense       promote public safety. Our states have chosen to respect the       rights of residents and non-residents alike to carry arms for       their defense, and we ask Congress to protect the same rights       of our law-abiding residents as they travel throughout the       United States.        States should not be able to deny citizens of other States       the basic constitutional right to self-defense. We thus urge       Congress to enact legislation such as the Constitutional       Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 (S. 446) or the       Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 (H.R. 38). These       bills aim to protect the rights of law-abiding citizens to       carry a concealed handgun. They do not allow for carrying       firearms by felons, those involuntarily committed to mental       health facilities, and other persons prohibited by federal       law from possessing or receiving firearms. And these bills       would not prevent States from allowing governmental and       private entities to preclude concealed carry on their own       property.        As the Supreme Court held in McDonald, it is       ``unmistakably'' true that ``the Second Amendment right to       keep and bear arms'' is ``fundamental to our scheme of       ordered liberty'' and ``deeply rooted in this Nation's       history and tradition.'' McDonald, 561 U.S. at 767-68.       Congress should act to safeguard and implement this deeply       rooted right for those traveling across state lines.        Thank you for the opportunity to address this legislation.       As the chief legal and law enforcement officers of our       respective States, we urge Congress to pass this important       legislation implementing one of the most basic American       freedoms, the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.
