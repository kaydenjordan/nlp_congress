 Mr. Speaker, as the Representative of one of the  largest Jewish populations in the State of New York, I rise today to  voice my support for H. Con. Res. 25, which would authorize the use of  Emancipation Hall in the Capitol Visitor Center for a ceremony  remembering the victims of the Holocaust.   It is vitally important that this legislative body and the Federal  Government at large do everything possible to ensure the horrors of the  Holocaust are never forgotten and the victims are always remembered.   Holding a ceremony right here in the Capitol's Emancipation Hall  demonstrates this Nation's unified commitment to honoring those who  fell victim to an evil ideology of racism, anti-Semitism, and thorough  hatred.   These ceremonies of remembrance are particularly important now as the  generation that survived the Holocaust continues to dwindle in numbers.  We must do everything possible to make sure those survivors' stories  are told, and their perseverance celebrated for years to come.   I personally will be observing Yom HaShoah this year by pausing to  remember the millions of lives senselessly taken during the Holocaust,  and thanking those survivors who continue to keep alive their stories.   The memories of 6 million murdered Jews and countless other victims  of the Holocaust serve as a reminder that evil exists, and we must  always stand guard against it and all hatred.   Let this Congress always stand firm as a force of good and forever  act justly to prevent such evils from ever being carried out again.   We must never forget the Holocaust, and this ceremony at Emancipation  Hall will keep that spirit of remembrance alive here in our Nation's  Capital and across this Nation.                                time  1800
