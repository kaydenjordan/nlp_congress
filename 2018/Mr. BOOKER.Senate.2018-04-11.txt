 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 50th  anniversary of the Fair Housing Act. On this day in 1968, President  Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law groundbreaking legislation to protect  Americans from housing discrimination and uphold the values of fairness  and equality under the law.   Prior to the passage of the law and its subsequent amendments, it was  legal for Americans to be denied access to housing based on their race,  color, national origin, religion, gender, disability, or familial  status. African-American soldiers returning from fighting for their  country on foreign shores would come home to find that they couldn't  purchase a house in certain neighborhoods because of the color of their  skin. The Fair Housing Act was a bold commitment to eradicating this  kind of discrimination, which still continues to this day.   When my own parents moved to New Jersey, illegal racial real estate  steering efforts nearly kept them from buying a house in an all-White  neighborhood. It took a sting operation coordinated by the local Fair  Housing Council with a White couple posing as my parents to break the  cycle of segregation in the town in which I would eventually grow up.  The Fair Housing Act empowered my parents and their advocates and  lawyers to press for their right to fair and quality housing, and it  stands today as one of the seminal pieces of legislation passed in our  country's history.   Today, as we recognize the 50th anniversary of the Fair Housing Act,  we remember that this landmark civil rights law was not meant to be the  end of our efforts to make housing in this country more fair and more  just, but just the beginning.   We know we have so much work left to do when it comes to expanding  access to affordable, safe, and fair housing in America, and we must  remain committed to protecting and expanding on the progress made 50  years ago today by the Fair Housing Act.   Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  important contributions of the Sikh community in New Jersey and across  the country. New Jersey is enriched by the diversity of its residents  who have promoted a climate of social tolerance and intellectual  pluralism that has sustained our State throughout its history. Since  first immigrating to the United States from Punjab, India, over 100  years ago, the Sikh community has played a critical role in enhancing  and contributing to New Jersey and our Nation.   This month, Sikhs in New Jersey and across the country will celebrate  their most significant annual event, Vaisakhi, the Sikh New Year;  providing the Sikh community the time to remember history, celebrate  collectively, and recommit to their religious traditions.   The New Jersey Sikh community has demonstrated a strong commitment to  public service. Every Gurdwara, the Sikh place of worship, has a  Langar, a free community kitchen that serves all visitors regardless of  religion, caste, gender, economic status, or ethnicity. The Langar  instills the notion of equality and the brotherhood for all. Every  November, the New Jersey Sikh community expands on this tradition and  organizes the ``Let's Share a Meal'' event that distributes meals to  homeless shelters in the area. In 2017, 275 Sikh community members  prepared, packed, and delivered meals to 84 shelters over 2 days. This  served more than 15,000 New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania  residents.   New Jersey also recently welcomed three Sikh Americans as new public  officials. On January 1, 2018, Ravi Bhalla became Hoboken's 30th mayor  and the State's first Sikh mayor. Bhalla had previously served two  terms on Hoboken's city council. Although Bhalla experienced periodic  hateful attacks during his mayoral campaign, voters resoundingly  rejected such divisive rhetoric when they elected him mayor.   In addition to electing its first Sikh mayor, New Jersey also elected  Balvir Singh as a member of the Burlington County Board of Chosen  Freeholders, making him the first Sikh American to win a countywide  election in New Jersey. Singh, who served for nearly 2 years as a  member of the Burlington Township Board of Education, was sworn into  office on January 3, 2018.   New Jersey is also home to the Nation's first Sikh State attorney  general, Gurbir Grewal. Grewal had previously served as the Bergen  County prosecutor. The State Senate unanimously approved his  appointment by a 29-0 vote on January 16. Grewal will enforce the law  in a manner that protects all New Jersey residents.   The broad support that these three individuals garnered is a  testament to New Jersey's culture of inclusion of individuals of all  ethnicities and religious backgrounds.   However, we know that Sikh Americans across the country continue to  endure discrimination and hateful attacks, from school bullying to  verbal assaults to violence.   I invite my colleagues to join me in recognizing the important  contributions of the Sikh community across the country as it celebrates  its New Year festival. May we join with Sikh Americans in rejecting  discrimination of any kind and embracing the rich diversity that makes  each of our States strong and whole.                            ____________________
