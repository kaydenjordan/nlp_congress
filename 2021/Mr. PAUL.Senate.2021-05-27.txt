 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I will  recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the  American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to  recognize a family-owned small business and beloved staple, Lisa's  Fifth Street Diner of Bowling Green, KY, as the Senate Small Business  of the Week.   Located in the heart of Bowling Green, KY, Lisa's Fifth Street Diner  opened its doors in 2010. After operating a successful catering  business, founder and owner Lisa Parker decided to open a restaurant  with her husband, Cliff Parker. Together, they created a homestyle  diner with delicious food, friendly service, and a welcoming  atmosphere.   Over a decade later, Lisa's Fifth Street Diner has become a local  favorite. They continue welcoming customers from all over Kentucky,  from local Western Kentucky University students to baseball fans  traveling to cheer on the Bowling Green Hot Rods. But no matter how far  customers travel, they can always depend on Lisa and her team to serve  them a hot, country-style meal with a friendly smile. Their outstanding  service was covered by WNKY TV's SoKY Sunrise, which recognizes local  small businesses using their signature hashtag, ``Because Local  Matters.'' Additionally, Lisa's Fifth Street Diner has consistently  received outstanding reviews from local and industry outlets alike.   Like many small business owners, Lisa and Cliff are active in their  community, supporting various charitable organizations. For several  years, the Parkers have teamed up with local volunteers to provide free  Thanksgiving meals to folks in need. In 2018, Lisa's Fifth Street Diner  partnered with Meijer, a local grocery store, to provide 300  Thanksgiving meals to families in need. This support is not one-way,  however, with Bowling Green stepping up to support the Parkers through  thick and thin. When the COVID-19 pandemic occurred, Bowling Green  continued supporting Lisa's Fifth Street Diner, ordering carryout meals  and ensuring this small business stayed open throughout the year. In  early 2021, Lisa, a three-time cancer survivor, was diagnosed with  ovarian cancer. The community rallied around her, raising funds and  organizing a benefit to support her during this time.   Despite the challenges, Lisa has continued to be an uplifting  example. In April 2021, Lisa was honored as a Hughes & Coleman Hometown  Hero by local news station WBKO. In addition to her community  leadership, this award recognized Lisa's hard work, compassion, and  commitment to her staff and customers.   Lisa's Fifth Street Diner is a remarkable example of the critical  role small businesses play in every aspect of building community. Small  businesses like Lisa's Fifth Street Diner form the heart of towns  across Kentucky, regularly stepping up to support their communities.  Congratulations to Lisa, Cliff, and the entire team at Lisa's Fifth  Street Diner. I wish them the best of luck and look forward to watching  their continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I will  recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the  American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to  recognize Uncle Lee's of Greenville, KY, as the Senate Small Business  of the Week.   In 1975, founder Lee Fauntleroy established Uncle Lee's gun shop. The  store provided a wide range of supplies for sportsmen and hunters in  Greenville and the Muhlenberg County area. Uncle Lee's grew from 32,000  square feet, expanding twice over the next few decades. By 2015, this  small business had 76,000 square feet of retail space and featured the  largest gun inventory available in the State of Kentucky. After 40  years of owning and operating his small business, Lee was ready to  retire and spend more time with his family. In 2015, he sold Uncle  Lee's to Lexington-based entrepreneurs Rex McClanahan and Joe Murphy.   Today, Uncle Lee's continues to supply generations of Kentucky  hunters and sportsmen, drawing customers from all over the United  States and abroad. Together, Rex and Joe have applied their years of  experience running and managing several businesses to continue growing  Uncle Lee's. Notably, Uncle Lee's features an indoor archery range and  is the largest retail store in Greenville. Uncle Lee's is an active  member of the Greater Muhlenberg  [[Page S3891]]  Chamber of Commerce, advocating for small businesses throughout  Greenville. They are also involved with local advocacy and development  organizations, including the Muhlenberg County Tourism Commission.   Under Rex and Joe, Uncle Lee's has continued its proud tradition of  supporting Second Amendment rights. Through classes and workshops,  Uncle Lee's supports responsible firearms training for gun enthusiasts  of all ages. They regularly host competitions and events, building a  sense of community among sportsmen and hunters from all walks of life.  Additionally, Uncle Lee's supports wildlife conservation, encouraging  hunters and sportsmen to learn about and preserve Kentucky's ecosystems  through wildlife education programs, outdoor skills workshops, and  keeping their community informed about Kentucky Department of Fish and  Wildlife initiatives.   Uncle Lee's is a remarkable example of the critical role small  businesses play in building a community and preserving local  ecosystems. Small businesses like Uncle Lee's form the backbone of  local economies across Kentucky and regularly step up to support their  communities for generations. Congratulations to the entire team at  Uncle Lee's. I wish them the best of luck and look forward to watching  their continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
