 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Linda Rost of Fallon County for being named Montana's 2020  Teacher of the Year.   Linda is a highly qualified science teacher at Baker High School with  a master's degree in science education from Montana State University.  Linda has been inspiring students and motivating them to dig deeper  when it comes to science education. The folks in Fallon County are very  proud of Linda's prestigious recognition.   Because of the size of Baker High School, Linda teaches multiple age  groups. While it is a joy, it is also one of the many challenges that  comes from teaching at a small rural school. Linda goes above and  beyond to find a variety of ways to connect with each student ensuring  they understand the course material in a fun and engaging way.   The Montana Teacher of the Year award is a long and competitive  process. After interacting with several selection committees made up of  top education leaders from across Montana, Linda was selected as the  2020 winner. Linda will now go on to represent Montana in the 2020  National Teacher of the Year competition.   It is my honor to recognize Linda for her dedication to teaching  young Montanans. Fallon County and Montana are very fortunate to have a  teacher like Linda to ensure that our rural students are getting the  highest quality education possible.                            ____________________
