 Mr. Speaker, it has now been seven weeks since the  President signed the CARES Act into law to provide crucial relief to  small businesses around the country. While these funds have been  essential to keeping the doors open for many businesses, I want to draw  attention to the entities that remain unable to access the emergency  federal funding they desperately need despite providing invaluable  community services during this emergency.   Throughout this crisis, YMCAs across the state of North Carolina have  been on the front lines, working to ensure essential personnel have the  resources and assistance they need. In the last few weeks, the YMCA of  the Triangle in Raleigh, NC has provided child care services for over  1,700 healthcare workers and served roughly 50,000 meals to families  across the region. In Garner, NC, the Poole Family YMCA has provided  stability and care to essential personnel by setting up day camps for  their children. Their invaluable efforts are central to ensuring  healthcare workers can continue fighting this virus.   Despite their work supporting essential personnel, YMCAs continue to  be left out of key federal assistance programs. Under the Paycheck  Protection Program (PPP), which Congress passed specifically to help  groups like this, affiliated YMCAs that collectively employ over 500  people cannot access funds. As a result, the YMCA of the Triangle and  the YMCA of Greater Charlotte have furloughed over 95 percent of their  staffs as they continue serving communities at a net loss.   Mr. Speaker, Congress cannot sit idly by as these YMCAs continue  operating at a loss. I implore my colleagues to support an adjustment  to affiliation rules for the Paycheck Protection Program in the next  emergency package to ensure that YMCAs can access the assistance they  need regardless of affiliation.
