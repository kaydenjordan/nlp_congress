 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   For the past 6 months, the Republican majority, embroiled in chaos  and dysfunction, has wasted valuable time. Because they are unable to  perform the most basic job of Congress, working with Representatives  from both parties and across the country to fund the government, they  have brought us to the brink of a shutdown twice in the last 2 months.   Before that, they threatened to tank the global economy, and if their  proposals pass this week, we will likely face new shutdown threats  again in the new year.   This isn't serious governance. It is not serious or governance at  all. They are playing politics with Americans' lives and our country's  future.   It is outrageous that my constituents are yet again subjected to the  uncertainty and fear that their paychecks won't come next week and that  services they rely upon, like LIHEAP and WIC, will be interrupted.  House Republicans still refuse to come to the table where the majority  of the American people are and work with us in a bipartisan way to pass  the spending bills that Americans expect and deserve.   The Senate is doing it. Why can't the House?   Instead, House Republicans continue to try to force the entire  country to go along with their farcical and extremist approach to  government funding. Unsurprisingly, they continue to fail, over and  over again, on the House floor. Their proposals are so extreme that  Members of their own party won't even vote for them. The MAGA majority  may have new leadership, but it is the same old story.   They plan to kick the government funding can down the road, once  again, so they can try to pass all 12 spending bills, which are now 2  months overdue, that cater to the most extreme and noisy fringe of the  MAGA party.   These are bills that reject any bipartisan input, bills that contain  harmful spending cuts that violate the Fiscal Responsibility Act's  spending levels that were approved on a bipartisan basis and signed  into law last spring, and these bills include poison pill policy riders  to enshrine MAGA culture wars into law and force these extremist views  upon every American.   There is no clearer example of that than the unacceptable spending  bill they have brought to the House floor today.   The Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations  bill is supposed to help Americans access education, jobs, and  healthcare. These are the foundations of our constituents' lives and  livelihoods.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know about you, but they are three of the issues  that I hear about the most when I have the opportunity to be back home  rather than debating meaningless bills and amendments here on the House  floor. Yet the majority has proposed legislation that slashes funding  for existing programs supporting these parts of Americans' lives by a  shocking 28 percent across the board, back to 2008 spending levels with  even deeper cuts in certain critical areas.   Let me outline what these cuts will mean for Americans.                                time  0930    Mr. Speaker, our public schools are responsible for educating the  next generation of Americans: our civic leaders, our innovators, and  our taxpayers. They are the key to our country's present and its  future. However, this bill seeks to further efforts of MAGA extremists  to undermine our public school systems by ripping critical funding away  from the K-12 schools that need it the most.   This bill slashes billions--that is billions with a b; 80 percent-- from title I, the foundational Federal program that for over five  decades has helped schools ensure that low-income students have access  to a high-quality, well-rounded education to equip them for what lies  ahead.   These cuts will be devastating for the children who live in my  district, which houses one of the largest public school districts in  the country. Hundreds of millions of dollars in funding will be slashed  from Philadelphia public schools.   Thousands of teachers will lose their jobs, but it is not just my  district that will suffer. It is everyone's. Mr. Speaker, Virginia's  Sixth District will lose $23 million in title I funding. Mr. Burgess'  district, Texas 26, will lose $22 million. That is over 300 teachers  that will lose their jobs in each of those districts.   I challenge any of my colleagues to explain to the teachers and  families in their districts how they can support a bill that cuts  millions of dollars and hundreds of teachers from their local public  schools, particularly at a time when our children need extra help.  [[Page H5737]]    Members of Congress who vote for this proposal will be telling kids  and families clearly and cruelly that where they live or how much money  their parents make is the measure of whether they are worthy of a good  education and future success. That is un-American.   In addition to title I cuts, this bill also eliminates--not cuts,  eliminates--funding for programs that support English language  learning, academic achievement, professional development for educators,  and the emotional and mental health of our students.   In this bill, MAGA Republicans are going after preschool by slashing  hundreds of millions of dollars from Head Start, which has been proven  to provide young children with a critical early learning foundation  that sets them up for lifelong success and saves taxpayers dollars down  the road.   I want so much better than what is in this bill for our children, and  I find it deeply disturbing that my Republican colleagues don't feel  the same.   Early childhood and K-12 education aren't the only things on the  House Republicans' chopping block. With this bill, they are also  abandoning college students and hardworking people trying to improve  their lives and their futures through higher education and job  training.   This bill would eliminate the Federal Work-Study Program for hundreds  of thousands of hardworking students who use it to pay for a higher  education.   It would block regulations to implement income-based student loan  repayment programs, and this bill would rip need-based financial aid  away from over a million students. Consequently, it will be harder for  people from working families to get a degree, and it will stifle their  potential earnings and opportunities in the job market.   This bill also leaves behind Americans who want to work, who want to  access job training, or want to find a higher paying job to better  support themselves and their families. When employers across this  country are scrambling to find qualified job candidates, House  Republicans are defunding the programs that prepare Americans for the  21st century workforce.   The bill they have proposed eliminates job training for over half a  million Americans, the WIOA programs, youth job training, adult job  training, and employment programs for seniors.   The bill also cuts over a billion dollars from critical worker  protection agencies at the Department of Labor, including programs that  ensure worker safety and promote equality and economic security for  working women.   Every day, I see how my district's dozens of higher education  institutions, including community colleges, bring innovation and  prosperous futures to our region, but House Republicans' shortsighted  vision for our country undermines these accomplishments and jeopardizes  the strength of our workforce for generations to come.   Finally, the majority is using this bill to come after programs that  support Americans' health, safety, and well-being. My district and the  whole Philadelphia region is a hub for biomedical innovation, but the  bill before us would undercut this lifesaving work by slashing funding  for cancer and neurological research. Programs that help us fight  public health crises, like opioid misuse and HIV/AIDS, will be  eliminated.   As grieving Americans everywhere call out for action to bring an end  to senseless gun violence, MAGA Republicans in the House, rather than  answer these calls, want to eliminate funding for research on how to  keep communities safe from firearms, now the leading cause of death for  American children.   This bill also puts women's and children's health at risk. At a time  when the U.S. lags far behind all other developed countries in  addressing maternal mortality--not for lack of will and resources--and  outcomes for mothers, but particularly women of color, are getting  worse, this bill cuts hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for  programs that support safe pregnancies, healthy babies, and affordable  access to contraception and a full range of reproductive healthcare.   Of course, this bill also includes a toxic stew of unpopular,  extremist policy riders, yet another example of rightwing lawmakers  pushing their extreme agenda to ban abortion care nationwide.   This is a terrible bill, and the House majority knows it. It has been  dictated by its most extreme Members. It couldn't even survive a  committee markup. Therefore, the party that preaches regular order has  sent it straight to the floor. On the way, with no committee input,  this bill acquired additional policy riders, and no one in the Rules  Committee could explain last night how they got in there since they  didn't happen in committee.    This bill is so extreme it may have to be pulled from the floor, like  the two bills that preceded it last week, because it cannot win enough  votes even from the House Republican Conference. If it does pass the  House, it will not pass the Senate or be able to overcome a White House  veto.   The appropriations legislation that House Republicans have put in  front of us today does nothing to invest in Americans or America's  future. Instead, it slashes programs and support for children,  families, workers, and women. It is a cruel vision for our country as  House Republicans continue to worship at the shrine of trickle-down  economics, despite its failure for half a century. Instead of making  wealthy corporations and billionaires pay their fair share, they would  rather balance the budget on the backs of kids and hardworking  families, and undermine the U.S.' global reputation, credit rating, and  national security.   Americans, my constituents, are fed up. The people who send all of us  to Washington do so with a belief that we will work and fight to make  their and their families' lives better, but it seems too many of the  MAGA Republicans in the House aren't interested in keeping up their end  of that bargain. This bill doesn't live up to the promises I have made  to my constituents, and I absolutely can't support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The fact remains that under Democratic leadership, the House did pass  budget bills. It passed the actual bills. What we are seeing here is a  string of MAGA bills being brought to the floor and not passing and not  leading to an eventual budget, so we keep ending up in this Mobius loop  of potential shutdowns. The bills that we have seen so far will not  result in a budget.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to make in order amendment No. 81, offered by  Ranking Member DeLauro from the Appropriations Committee, which strikes  section 239 of the bill, which prohibits funding to Planned Parenthood  and other similar women's health organizations.   Mr. Speaker, when will Republicans in the House learn? The American  people want them to stop trying to tell women what they can do with  their bodies. At the ballot box, in Congress, in State legislatures,  women want them to stop. Republican politicians have no place dictating  decisions about women's reproductive health. These decisions should be  made between a woman and her doctor.   This MAGA messaging bill callously prohibits funding to an  organization  [[Page H5738]]  that provides many different health resources to women across the  country. I, myself, used Planned Parenthood when planning my family.  Planned Parenthood also offers vulnerable communities services they  wouldn't otherwise have access to, including critical preventive  services like breast and cervical cancer screenings, contraception, and  sex education. Simply put, blocking this grant funding endangers  women's health across the country. There is no reason we should  restrict access to Federal grant money simply to score political points  for the MAGA base while limiting reproductive healthcare options.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment into the Record, along with any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as I said before, this is a terrible bill. I remind all  my colleagues that this is kids' futures that we are talking about. It  is the jobs that support American families. It is the health and safety  of our loved ones.   If the House's MAGA Republicans had their way, our workers, students,  children, women, and families would all suffer if the cuts in this bill  were implemented. Our public schools, the centerpieces of our  communities and our democracy, would be decimated. Hardworking people  would be underwater, unable to find good-paying jobs to keep themselves  and their families afloat. Devastating diseases would go uncured and  unchecked, and women would be denied the right to make their own free  choices about their own healthcare.    America and the people who live here are worth investing in so much  more than this, and I won't accept the bleak and nihilistic picture  that House Republicans are trying to paint. Our country's future can  and should be brighter. It is what our constituents and our children  deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose the previous question and  the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
