 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the folks in  East Palestine, Ohio, and for bipartisan congressional action on 21st  century rail safety regulations.   On February 3, 38 train cars derailed in East Palestine, Ohio; 11 of  them carrying highly explosive material. There was a massive explosion,  and the community has been reeling ever since.   Congressman Bill Johnson pulled the entire Ohio delegation together,  Republicans and Democrats, to ask FEMA for additional action.   FEMA's response: Full aid will be provided, and teams are on the  ground to help now.   While Norfolk Southern will be responsible for making East Palestine  whole, we must now act to ensure this never happens again.   Congress, all of us, Republicans and Democrats, need to pass a  bipartisan package that ensures safety from the wheel bearings to the  brakes, from the detectors to the placards, for more frequent and  comprehensive inspections to clearer communications with our  communities.   We must do this for the folks in East Palestine, for Cincinnati and  southwest Ohio, and for every community in this great country of ours.                            ____________________
