 Mr. Speaker, I rise to clarify my position  on the Motion to Adjourn considered on the floor this morning.   I support full consideration of the For the People Act and the George  Floyd Justice in Policing Act. I was unable to vote this morning. Had I  been present, I would have voted: nay, on rollcall No. 56.
