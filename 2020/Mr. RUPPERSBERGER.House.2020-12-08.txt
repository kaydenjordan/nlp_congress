 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy  of Senator Paul Sarbanes, a titan of Maryland politics and a man I  considered a mentor during my time as Baltimore County Executive.   John, those were very warm comments that you gave about your father,  to be here as a Member of Congress and to make those comments. I know  your father is looking down and is very proud of you and his whole  family. It is a moment that we will never forget.   Anyone who values government accountability and integrity, anyone who  loves or lives off of the Chesapeake Bay, is benefiting from the  service of Senator Paul Sarbanes.   Though his legislative style was often described as quiet and  unassuming, the accomplishments of Senator Sarbanes were bold and  groundbreaking. He will go down as one of the Chesapeake Bay's fiercest  stewards in history.   In the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, he pioneered legislation that  continues to protect consumers today. From Watergate to Iran-Contra to  Whitewater, he fought government corruption. He was a man of integrity  and decency.   He didn't have a soapbox. He had sense. He led with respect, not  rhetoric.   Over the course of his three decades of public service, Senator  Sarbanes showed us what we can achieve when taking credit just isn't a  priority.   Today, we celebrate the legacy Senator Sarbanes has left for our  future generations.   I know Senator Sarbanes was very proud of his son John's work here in  the United States Congress and also his son Michael's work on behalf of  the Baltimore City Schools and his daughter, Janet Sarbanes, who is an  accomplished writer.   We will always remember Senator Sarbanes.
