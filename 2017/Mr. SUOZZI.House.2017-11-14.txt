 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Garamendi for bringing this  Special Order to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I am here to point out the unfairness of the Republican- led bill for tax reform, as they claim, that would be devastating to  New York's middle class families.   I want the people at home to know that the U.S. Conference of  Catholic Bishops have said:   ``This proposal appears to be the first Federal income tax  modification in American history that will raise income taxes on the  working poor while simultaneously providing a large tax cut to the  wealthy.''  [[Page H9242]]    Mr. Speaker, this bill is flawed and unfair on many levels. One thing  I have learned since taking office back in January, here in this  Congress, is how very different the regions of this country are. It is  different from State to State and it is different from place to place.  The amount of money that people make in different regions is different.  Their cost of living is different, their property tax bills are  different, and their State income taxes are as different as night and  day.   There are now 105 million full-time jobs in the United States of  America. Fifty-nine million of those jobs pay less than $50,000 a year.  Eighty-six million of those 105 million full-time jobs pay less than  $75,000 per year. In my district, the average salary is actually higher  than that, but so are their property taxes, so are their income taxes,  and so is there cost of living.   While this bill could be a net positive for some Americans in many  regions--in my region and in many other regions, and in my State and my  district specifically--this bill is a huge net negative for middle  class families.   One particularly devastating element of this proposal is the  elimination of the State and local tax deduction that would be patently  unfair to the over 250,000 hardworking families in my district that  rely on that important deduction. New Yorkers claim the State tax  deduction more than just about any other State. In my district, we have  more people in the State than any other place that claim the State and  local tax deduction. It is the top 10 of the Nation.   Let's look at the some of the specifics of what actually happens in  my district:   People making between $50,000 and $75,000 in my hometown of Glen Cove  will see a 39 percent tax increase. In my hometown of Glen Cove, a  family that makes between $100,000 and $200,000 will pay, roughly,  $2,100 more in taxes under this plan.   In Huntington, every single family making over $50,000 a year will  see a tax increase. Every family in Huntington making between $50,000  and $75,000 a year will see--get this--a 135 percent increase on what  they currently pay. Every family making between $100,000 and $200,000 a  year will see a $3,000 tax increase.   In Whitestone, every individual tax filer making $50,000 or more will  see a tax increase, regardless of their income.   Mr. Speaker, the evidence is crystal clear for people in my district  and in many places throughout this country.    This tax reform plan, as it is called, is a punch in the gut to  middle class taxpayers. These are hardworking people who deserve to be  lifted up, not slapped down, by draconian tax increases that offset tax  cuts going to the superrich.   How could anyone support a bill that targets our middle class in such  a way is unfathomable. When I was elected to Congress, I came here  ready and willing to work--and I still stand ready and willing to  work--across party lines to get things done, even tax reform. I want to  see tax reform in this country, but I can't compromise my values. I  can't let down the families in my district who are going to be hurt by  this plan.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to try  to do what is right: protect the hardworking Americans--the hardworking  New Yorkers--who play by the rules and ask for very little in return by  voting against this ill-conceived legislation, and protect the State  and local tax deduction for our middle class.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out that in the State  of New York, there are many Republicans who have come out against this  tax bill because of the fact that it will hurt so many middle class  families.                                time  1745    Eliminating the State and local tax deduction is completely and  patently unfair. This State and local tax deduction has been in place  for over 100 years. Why should someone pay taxes on taxes they have  already paid to their State and local governments?    Mr. Speaker, I just wanted to point out, in the State of  New York, we send $48 billion a year more to the Federal Government  than we get back from the Federal Government. We are the largest net  donor in America to the Federal Government.   We are contributing this money to subsidize many programs that our  colleagues don't want to support, but we are also supporting their  States. Many of the blue States in America, quite frankly, are huge net  donors to the Federal Government, and many of the red States are huge  net takers from the Federal Government. This is just another slap in  the face to States like ours.
