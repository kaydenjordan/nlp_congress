 Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the distinguished majority leader's comments about  President Trump.   I have been around Congress for 21 years, and I have never seen a  President of either party lean more forward in trying to get down the  cost of prescription drugs, to give taxpayers more of their hard-earned  income, to get an  [[Page H10130]]  economy up and running like we have never seen it before, to tackle the  issue of unemployment and get unemployment numbers down to the lowest  level in 50 years in every category all across the country, and to  reduce the burdens of overregulation. President Trump has done all  those things.   He also has called for getting down the price of prescription drugs.  I have been in several meetings where he has done that, and I share his  passion for that, and I know he wants a bipartisan bill that can become  law and be put on his desk.   Everything you heard from the distinguished majority leader about  President Trump's views are accurate, but he actually read H.R. 3. And  if you read the Statement of Administration Policy, he recognizes that  this goes too far and he would have to veto it, that it is a partisan- only bill--partisan only.   And here is part of the problem with H.R. 3: It hands the government  a club. There is no negotiation in here. If you don't agree to what the  government says the price should be, the government in Washington comes  after your revenues, and up to 95 percent of your revenues for selling  that drug they can just come and take.   By the way, when you throw in the cost of taxation and everything  else, it is well over 100 percent that a drug manufacturer who is  innovating some new drug and has the patent for that great American  innovation, the government says: If you don't sell it for what we want  within a band, we are taking it. We are not taking your patent--well,  they might come back and do that in another iteration, but: What we are  doing is taking all the revenues. We will bankrupt you.   That is why 138 different small innovative startup innovators in this  space wrote to the Speaker and the Republican leader. And I want to  quote from their letter, Madam Chair. It says: ``We represent the  community of emerging biotechnology companies whose researchers and  scientists strive daily to develop innovative life-changing therapies  and cures for patients. We take pride that we are providing hope to  patients and their families and changing the world through medical  breakthroughs. These dreams will be shattered if H.R. 3, the Lower Drug  Costs Now Act, is passed.''   They went on to say: ``Unfortunately, H.R. 3 is an unprecedented and  aggressive government intervention in the U.S. market of drug  development and delivery that will limit patient access to these  extraordinary advancements in healthcare.''   Look, we all agree drug costs are too high, and we want to work  together to stop the gaming and bring down the prices.   Our alternative, which we will debate in a few minutes, does that,  but it doesn't do it at the expense of completely upending the  ecosystem that allows American innovators to do what no one else in the  world does as well, and that is come up with new cures for diseases and  make them available.   Madam Chair, I enter into the Record the letter from 138 startup  innovators in its full context.                                                   December 5, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of the House,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      House Republican Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Republican Leader McCarthy: We       represent the community of emerging biotechnology companies       whose researchers and scientists strive daily to develop       innovative life-changing therapies and cures for patients. We       take pride that we are providing hope to patients and their       families and changing the world through medical       breakthroughs. These dreams will be shattered if H.R. 3, the       Lower Drug Costs Now Act, is passed.        We are at an incredible inflection point in science and       technology that is bringing forth transformative treatments       and even cures for cancer, infectious diseases, and a myriad       of other serious and rare diseases. These advancements are       benefiting lives of millions of patients and alleviating       human suffering, while helping to reduce other more expensive       parts of our health care system, such as hospital spending.       Our continued success depends on maintaining an environment       that supports investment in tomorrow's discoveries.        Unfortunately, H.R. 3 is an unprecedented and aggressive       government intervention in the U.S. market of drug       development and delivery that will limit patient access to       these extraordinary advancements in health care. This extreme       proposal will upend the ecosystem of U.S. biomedical       innovation, destroying our ability to attract private       investment dollars that allow us to develop new treatments       and change the course of healthcare delivery for so many       patients.        We strongly urge you to abandon H.R. 3. Further, in order       to keep pace with this biomedical revolution and ensure       America remains the world leader in innovation, we hope that       you will pursue bipartisan, holistic policies that modernize       our health care payment system and lower drug costs for       patients.

Madam Chair, I know the Democrats yesterday said: We  don't care. It is worth it. We don't need all those cures.   That is, in effect, what they said.   And then they said: Oh, those are just somebody's talking points.   No. This is the Congressional Budget Office's independent analysis  that said we will lose 38 cures right out of the gate in the next two  decades because of H.R. 3, and that for every year thereafter in the  2030s, we will lose 10 percent of what we otherwise would have.   Is that the cure for Alzheimer's? rheumatoid arthritis? ALS?  Parkinson's?   That is what Democrats are saying they don't care about, that it is  worth it to let those go in order to force the government price in this  market.   We don't think that has to be the case. I don't think it is an  either/or choice. They are making it that with H.R. 3.   I think we can have innovation without the heavy-handed club mugging  innovation by taking the revenues of companies when they don't agree  with what the government sets as the price.   And we know in foreign countries that they want to model America  after, upwards of 40 percent of cancer drugs are not available in those  countries, and they are available here in the United States.   You can go across every one of the six indicator countries, look at  how they control drug costs, and, yes, they do have lower drug costs-- and that is why we have a trade negotiator, so we can get lower drug  costs in these trade agreements and stop getting ripped off--but what  they do to really control is they control access.   There was a lot talked about in terms of death panels when ObamaCare  was considered. This bill actually represents that.   We are told that by the people who innovate in this space that they  will not be able to continue to innovate as they have in the past and  that drugs that save lives will not be available because they won't be  invented.   That is not just my words. That is the Congressional Budget Office;  that is the Council of Economic Advisers.   There isn't a think tank out there yet that I have seen, no  independent analysis that says H.R. 3 is going to do anything but that.   Innovation goes up on the rocks with H.R. 3. Lives will be lost;  cures will never be found; and Americans won't be better off.   It doesn't have to be that way. We have bipartisan legislation in our  substitute that will bring down prices, bring down drug costs, bring  about transparency, put a cap on what seniors spend on Medicare,  address the insulin cost issue, and it can become law.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  0930     Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is important to know that in our substitute we cut the costs of  cancer treatment for seniors in half, as well. There is bipartisan  agreement on this. In fact, everything in our substitute is bipartisan.   It is also important to note that in Canada it takes 14 months longer  to get access to miracle new medicines compared to what we have in  America. They have 52 percent of the medicines there that we have here.  They have 60 percent of the cancer medicines. That means 40 percent of  the cancer medicines, the latest cutting-edge ones, the ones we read  about and see on ``60 Minutes'' that are curing cancer here in America,  you can't get in Canada. I don't want to import that here.   And when it comes to reducing access to drugs, basic research is  essential. Nobody has done more to deal with that than the gentleman  from Michigan, former chairman of the committee, Fred Upton, who led  the effort with Cures to get more research in the National Institutes  of Health.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Upton).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minute to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Carter), Congress' only pharmacist.    Madam Chair, may I inquire as to how much time each side  has remaining.    Madam Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Holding).    Madam Chair, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes.   Madam Chair, I want to make clear that I am always willing to come to  the other side of the aisle to work these things out.   All of us came here with similar cause and calling, to lower the  price of prescription drugs, to stop the abuse and bad behavior of  pharmaceutical companies when they keep generics from coming to market.  But I don't think anybody came here to take away cures for patients who  come to our offices every year begging for a cure for Alzheimer's,  pancreatic cancer, or ASL, you name the disease.   My mother died of ovarian cancer. My father had bladder cancer. My  sister-in-law died of brain cancer. We lost a son to a heart defect. We  all want cures.   We know by independent analysis that H.R. 3 denies access to cures.  That is a fact. It is a fact that the Council of Economic Advisers says  up to 100 cures will be lost. The Congressional Budget Office says in  the next two decades, 38 cures would be lost. It doesn't have to be  that way.   We can lower drug costs. We can incent innovation. My friend from  Michigan talked about being involved in the innovation world. This is a  letter from 138 leaders of these incredible American innovators who beg  us not to shatter the dreams of Americans, which they say H.R. 3 will  do by completely upending the process.    That is why President Trump said he cannot sign this. No President  has ever leaned further than President Trump.    Madam Chair, I yield myself 15 additional seconds.   We have an alternative. Everything in our substitute bill is  bipartisan. Even if you feel like you have to vote for H.R. 3, there is  no reason you should have to vote against the proposals in here. There  is not a poison pill. They are all bipartisan. They will all bring  meaningful relief to our folks at home, and nothing in here will reduce  innovation.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.   I rise in support of the substitute amendment, H.R. 19, the Lower  Costs, More Cures Act.   There is a better way, ladies and gentlemen. We can reduce the high  costs of drugs. We can improve health and lower long-term costs without  stifling innovation and restricting patients' access to new, lifesaving  medications.   H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, is the bipartisan solution  that can be signed into law this year and immediately begin to provide  relief to patients and seniors from high prescription costs.   This bill lowers out-of-pocket spending. It protects access to new  medicines and cures. It strengthens transparency and accountability and  champions competition.   Every single proposal in this substitute is bipartisan, Democrats and  Republicans coming together.   First, H.R. 19 encourages innovation of groundbreaking new cures and  promotes the introduction of more low-cost generic and biosimilar  competition to the marketplace faster, through inclusion of the CREATES  Act, which streamlines the regulation of over-the-counter products,  stopping the pay-for-delay agreements and patent system gamesmanship.   These policies unanimously passed the Energy and Commerce Committee  earlier this year. They would have unanimously passed on this House  floor, had a poison pill not been put in up in the Rules Committee.   H.R. 19 also has a critical provision to make insulin more affordable  by requiring insurance companies to cap the costs of insulin for  seniors at $50 a month.   H.R. 19 increases transparency and removes uncertainty at the  pharmacy counter by requiring insurance companies to make information  about drug costs available in the doctor's office before a prescription  is written.   It reduces the cost of drug administration, including for cancer  treatment. We can cut that in half. We will pay for quality, not sites.   H.R. 19, for the first time, places a cap on seniors' out-of-pocket  costs for the year.   Critically, it stops the U.S. from subsidizing other freeloader  foreign countries by having a strong trade rep to negotiate better  deals for Americans.   This will lower costs, and it will bring about cures.   Mr. Chairman, I urge bipartisan support, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Brady), the leading Republican on the powerful House  Ways and Means Committee.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    That is true on the bipartisan, but every provision in  the bill has Democratic support as individual bills in other sectors.  We brought only bipartisan bills into this alternative.  [[Page H10202]]    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me say in response, the CBO also said  38 new cures as a result of H.R. 3 will never come about. The Council  of Economic Advisers says 100 new cures will never come about.   H.R. 3, the underlying bill the majority wants to put into law,  actually denies people who are desperately hoping for cures, that  innovation.   To answer further your question, there are 138 different Democratic  sponsors of the bill that we have put together here.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Foxx).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments.   Ours is the only bipartisan bill. Thirty-six different provisions  passed out of either the Ways and Means or Energy and Commerce  Committee with unanimous, bipartisan support, all these provisions  cosponsored by Democrats. Seventeen different bills passed out of the  House of Representatives with bipartisan support in here. This is the  bipartisan package.   I have always worked across the line to get things done, whether it  was in opioids or 21st Century Cures or modernizing the FDA. I pledge  to continue to do that.   The partisan bill on the floor today is H.R. 3. The facts of the  matter show that it will deny new innovation in America and new cures  for patients whose lives are on the line.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on H.R. 3 and a ``yes'' on the  substitute.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I commend my friend, and he is my friend, Mr. Tonko. He is  a very thoughtful legislator, and we have worked together on a lot of  different bills.   He offered and withdrew this amendment at full committee markup of  H.R. 3, and I continue to extend the offer to sit down and try to work  out the differences in the language.   Unfortunately, as it is currently constructed, though, this could  have unintended consequences, we believe, including actually increasing  drug prices, which none of us wants, which I know is not the  gentleman's goal either.   Star ratings to measure the quality of an insurance plan or a  specific benefit are a good tool for consumers and the government, but  to apply an automatic star rating change to a plan's coverage of  biosimilars could give a manufacturer too much negotiating leverage,  and we don't want to do that.   This would be a major shift in the type of quality measure the plans  would be rated on and would actually affect the way they would  negotiate with manufacturers and, unfortunately, we believe, not  necessarily be in a way that lowers costs for consumers in Medicare  Advantage.   Star ratings are an important factor consumers consider when they are  choosing their plan. If a plan knows they will be rated and reimbursed  based on coverage of one biosimilar, they do not have much ground to  stand on if they want to negotiate the cost of that drug down to  benefit the patient.   That means the manufacturer of the biosimilar has all the leverage  and they can keep the price high, knowing they will likely still be  placed on the plan's formulary because the plan is being rated on it.   But the gentleman is right. We should do more to incentivize  biosimilar development and coverage in this country. This is an  important issue. And, again, I would be happy to work with him and  others on the other side of the aisle on this and many other  provisions.    Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Montana (Mr. Gianforte).    Mr. Chairman, I understand my friend's comments. None of  us wants to accidentally create a situation where prices go up rather  than down, and I know that is not his intent. We have that concern on  this side.   Perhaps we can work this out along the way and get to the same place  here, because I think we share a similar goal.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1115     Mr. Chair, I am opposed to the amendment and seek time in  opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague's amendment on  this. I understand it. And I think it is important because it does  strike at the heart of the issue and the concerns many of us on this  side of the aisle have.   The California Life Sciences Association told us that, if enacted,  H.R. 3's Medicare part D foreign reference pricing proposal would  reduce by 88 percent the number of drugs brought to market by small and  emerging companies in California alone due to changed investor  behavior.   So they think up to 88 percent of the great innovations and cures  they are working on will never come to market. They also think it would  eliminate 80,000 biotech R&D jobs nationwide and reduce revenues by $71  billion a year.   So, these are the people, predominantly out in California, that do  this every day, that are living in this world of trying to create  innovation and new lifesaving drugs. And they are saying up to 88  percent of the new drugs they are working on would never come to  market. These are the small startups.   We have heard a lot from others on the floor in the last 24 hours  about Big Pharma. Well, we are not talking about Big Pharma here. We  are talking about small, little startups, American entrepreneurs. If  you think about Silicon Valley in the high-tech world, this is the  equivalent in the biotech world.   These are individuals who have an idea and a big brain, and they are  coming together to come up with a cure to these diseases like SMA,  Alzheimer's, sickle cell anemia, and things like that that we all  struggle with in our communities.   Our fear on this side of the aisle, as Republicans, is we know, based  on the facts and the independent analysis of our Congressional Budget  Office, based on the Council of Economic Advisers, based on the input  of the very people who are in the trenches every day in these  laboratories across America, where two-thirds of the world's innovation  comes from in this space, that H.R. 3 will significantly reduce new  cures coming to market.   Now, we are all for lowering drug prices. I think we would have a  unanimous vote on the provisions in our alternative here if we had a  fair opportunity to take these one at a time. We are glad we have the  opportunity to have the vote.   I think, because there are 138 Democrats on the measures that are in  what I would call our bipartisan proposal here, that we could get  bipartisan support for it. And we could lower drug costs. We can stop  the gaming in the system. And we can continue to have more cures in  America, not less.   And, let's face it--I do not believe it is an overstatement to say  people will die if we have fewer cures. We know that to be a fact. It  is not just a talking point. It is a fact. It is a truth. And in a time  when we should rely on more facts, this is one we should think about  seriously before we vote on H.R. 3.   That is why, Mr. Chairman, we came up with this combination of really  thoughtful proposals, some of which have passed out of committees in  the House or in the Senate--bipartisan support for them.   Now, on the Peters amendment itself: It is a laudable amendment. It  will not be able to substitute for the destruction, however, of the  American biomedical industry under H.R. 3.   The Congressional Budget Office says the effects on the new drug  introductions from increased Federal spending under the bill on  biomedical research would be modest. That is CBO.   I will let our Members vote as they want. Certainly, we all want to  do more to invest in our National Institutes of Health.   I have no real objection to the gentleman's amendment, but the  underlying bill eviscerates what he is trying to accomplish here in  terms of medical research and breakthrough cures.   Mr. Chairman, with that, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I recognize the serious impact prescription  drug prices have on all Americans. We all have constituents facing the  same problem: drug prices are too high. We all want to come together to  find a way to lower drug prices.   Where we separate is our proposal would lower drug prices, put a cap  on what seniors pay, and, for the first time, in Medicare part D,  reduce their insulin costs but not end the kind of incredible  innovation in America we see today. It would not cost 88,000 American  innovators their jobs, and it would not reduce this innovation that is  producing two-thirds of the world's cures.   Unfortunately, H.R. 3 would do that. H.R. 3--the underlying bill that  is a very disappointingly partisan bill--would cost patients cures to  their diseases. We know that.   It is not my conclusion. These are the people who innovate in this  space. These are Congressional Budget Office analysts and the Council  of Economic Advisers. There has not been a single piece of evidence  presented on this floor that says that H.R. 3 will do anything but  reduce investment and outcome of overall new cures.   In fact, a colleague of mine and I were talking during the last  amendment debate. In effect, we are trading $1 trillion in private- sector investment in new innovation in America for medical cures for  $100 million--in this case, the Peters amendment--in taxpayer money.   So you are trading $100 million for $1 trillion, and $1 trillion is  private-sector investment coming in, because we know a lot of these new  paths that our innovators pick to go down to find a cure just simply  end up being a dry hole and all that money is lost. So it takes a lot  to find a cure, but we stand on the cusp of something big and bold, and  that is cures for diseases where there is none today. We do have a  problem in America trying to figure out how to pay for that.   I am going to be retiring at the end of this Congress, and I know my  colleague is going off to the Senate at the end of this Congress if  voters in Massachusetts have their way, but together, we still, as a  country, have to come together and figure out with precision medicine  that may produce a cure for you and you only: How are we going to pay  for that?   We don't have a lot of answers. I don't think giving the government  the biggest club in history to take 95 percent of revenues if you don't  agree with what the government wants to pay for something is the right  approach. That is what H.R. 3 does. We know it takes $1 trillion out of  the pipeline of investment in innovation in America and costs 80-some  thousand jobs in innovation.   But in terms of the Jackson Lee amendment which was so ably brought  and described by Mr. Kennedy, I share the concern about what the costs  of medicines are putting as a burden on people, especially in rural  areas. My district would stretch from the Atlantic to Ohio--we could  put a lot of Massachusetts in my district--and our people are  suffering.   So I look forward to a day when, after our substitute becomes law, we  can continue to work together on these other issues.   I hope my friend will support our substitute because I think it is  all bipartisan; 138 Democrats have supported provisions in our  substitute amendment. There isn't a single partisan poison pill in our  substitute amendment. I think that is why it is attracting support on  both sides of the aisle.   Mr. Chairman, I know we have a lot of business to do. I appreciate  Mr. Kennedy bringing this to the floor on behalf of Ms. Jackson Lee,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for offering his  amendment today, and I really do. We work a lot of with Mr. Gottheimer  on a number of issues before the Congress, and I appreciate his  commitment to this cause.   Republicans fully support the goal of the amendment: to identify  those diseases and conditions in which there is an unmet medical need  and exploring ways to further incentivize getting treatments to market.   In fact, a study in unmet medical needs is especially timely with the  consideration of this underlying bill, H.R. 3, because we believe it  will crush development and hope for new treatments.   We are not alone. We have come to this conclusion based on others'  factual evaluation of the bill. There is no shortage of sources warning  us that H.R. 3 will lead to fewer cures. In fact, independently, the  Council of Economic Advisers estimates as many as  [[Page H10211]]  100 new treatments will be lost over the next decade under the partisan  H.R. 3.   I think the most disturbing, Mr. Chairman, is that the California  Life Sciences Association, the great innovators in America who come up  with these new cures that we all are counting on, predicts an 88  percent reduction in the number of drugs brought to market by small and  emerging companies. And that is only in California, apparently.   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, another source here, our  third independent source, estimates that, under H.R. 3, we will have  nearly 40 fewer drugs over, roughly, the next two decades; and then,  after that, you would see an annual--every year--reduction of 10  percent in the number of drugs entering the market in the later years.                                time  1200    That is what has led so many of us Republicans to oppose H.R. 3. We  support the goal of getting drug prices down. We think there are other  ways to do that, and we are open to working on those issues.   No President has ever leaned further forward on this matter and taken  the pharma companies' CEOs head on than President Trump. But even he,  after reading through the bill, said it goes too far. And you can't  sacrifice innovation and lifesaving cures for what else is in the bill.   H.R. 3 will undoubtedly lead to an increase in patients with unmet  medical needs, fewer drugs. Republicans believe the value of fostering  innovation is essential, that is why we led on 21st Century Cures, and  passed it into law, led by my friend from Michigan, Mr. Upton, and my  friend from Colorado, Diana DeGette, a bipartisan effort.   But we know there are diseases out there that still long for a cure.  This is why our bipartisan solution to lower drug prices, the  substitute amendment, H.R. 19, will lower costs, but also promote  innovation, and promote it from the private sector side. We want that  private venture capital money to continue to flow into this pipeline.   H.R. 3, we are told, the independent analysis tells us, a trillion  dollars in private sector money will leave this sector because the  punishment is so harsh.   Can you imagine, you are working your whole life, you have gone to  college, you have got this great degree, this big brain, you are coming  up with a solution to ALS or something, you finally get it done. It  goes through all the trials. It is perfected. It works. You get a  patent.   And then the government says, We are going to set the price, and if  you don't agree to that price, we are going to take 95 percent of the  revenues for wherever else you sell this.   By the way, Congressional Research Services warned Congress, and we  have had other constitutional experts tell us for sure, H.R. 3 is so  punitive and so unfair, it would violate the Fifth Amendment of the  Constitution and the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.   So the underlying bill, as we have been told, is unconstitutional. We  all stand down here and take an oath of office to uphold the  Constitution. We are being told by our own Congressional Research  Service it likely upends, is in violation of, the Constitution. We have  other experts say for sure it is.   I appreciate the gentleman's amendment. I do. We know there are unmet  needs that need to be dealt with. I think it makes a lot of sense.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again, I appreciate the gentleman's hard work on this issue. I know  we share a common goal of getting drug prices down and meeting unmet  needs of cures. But, tragically, the Democrat bill, H.R. 3, is a very  partisan bill.   We are told by the California Life Sciences Association that, if  enacted, you could see an 88 percent reduction in the number of drugs  brought to market by small and emerging companies in California alone.  That is their estimate. These are the people who do this work. They  also estimate we would lose 80,000--that is a lot--80,000 biotech R&D  jobs nationwide. That is what H.R. 3 does.   So, if you are for cutting jobs in America in biotechnical research,  and if you are for 88 percent fewer drugs coming to market from small  and emerging innovators in California, then I guess you are going to  vote for H.R. 3. I am not going to. I think we can do better.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, we certainly support clinical trials at the  National Institutes of Health. In fact, the Republicans have led on  this issue. In fact, Republicans have led for decades in increasing the  funding for NIH, going clear back to about 1995 when then-Speaker  Gingrich led an effort to double the funding for the NIH.   Our colleague Mr. Upton from Michigan led the effort to dramatically  increase the funding for NIH. We know that is extraordinarily important  to do.   Of course, while that is important, it is kind of the basic science.  The real  [[Page H10219]]  work that gets done takes that and then turns it into drugs eventually  through a whole clinical trial process with lots more innovation and  investment.   Tragically, H.R. 3 rips $1 trillion out of that innovation funding  cycle. That is why, for the life of me, I can't understand why my  friends are voting for that knowing that, and how they can vote for  H.R. 3 knowing that upward of 100 or more cures, lifesaving drugs,  medicines never will be developed.    Those aren't my numbers. Those are the numbers of the Council of  Economic Advisers. Those are the numbers from CBO. They tell us in  literally the next 20 years, 38 new drugs will never be developed, at a  minimum, upward of 38. It could be more. I suppose it could be less.  After that, it is 10 percent every year that don't get developed. We  think it is actually higher than that, but those are the facts. Those  are facts.   I want to emphasize that the ban on spread pricing in Medicaid  offered here as a Democratic amendment is actually, as my friend  recognizes, in H.R. 19. We agree. There are 138 Democrats who have  sponsored different provisions that are bipartisan in the substitute  amendment, and it should do no damage.   Why would you vote against your own stuff? I mean, it is in here. It  is good policy. It is bipartisan. I hope that some will have the  opportunity to be strong and vote for really good bipartisan  legislation. I would argue that H.R. 19, the substitute, is the most  bipartisan bill on the floor today, the only bipartisan bill on the  floor today.   This comprehensive collection of bipartisan policies from both the  House and the Senate are contained in the substitute, H.R. 19. We  looked a lot at the work that Senator Grassley and my own State Senator  Ron Wyden put together in their legislation. We probably got 90 percent  of that one way or the other incorporated in here.   I have learned over the years, from the time I got here as a freshman  until now, you don't get everything. Sometimes, you can make more  progress by getting together and getting what you can agree on done and  then continuing to work on the issues where you don't agree, and I  would say that is an issue that we face right now.   We have before us a substitute that could become law, and the  President basically indicated he would sign it. He clearly has  indicated he will veto H.R. 3. We have had word out of the Senate that  they have no plans to take up H.R. 3. To me, it makes it a nonstarter.   I also believe it is dangerous to innovation. It will cost 88,000  jobs U.S.-wide, and 80-something percent of new drugs coming out of  California won't be developed. That is according to the people who do  this work, California Life Sciences.                                time  1245    I don't think you have to trade that reduction in innovation and new  cures for lower prices. I think you can actually have both.   We have a common commitment here to lower drug prices. We have a  common commitment here to increase investment in NIH and to stop the  bad behaviors by the pharmaceutical companies, to stop them from  withholding samples so that generics don't get to market or actually  paying all generic brands not to come to market.   I wrote the legislation last Congress that modernized the FDA's  approval process for medical devices, generic devices, so we couldn't  get stuck--that is a bit of a pun--by another EpiPen issue. Because  there was no competitor, they raised the price the way they wanted to,  and they stuck it to people like my wife, who used to use an EpiPen,  and many other consumers.   We now have competition in that space, and the FDA has approved more  generic drugs as a result of our unanimous work on the FDA reform. More  generic drugs in the last year than at any time in the history of the  FDA were approved, over 1,100 new generic drugs, because, I think, when  you get more competition in the market, consumers benefit with more  choice and lower price.   Now, there is still some gaming that goes on, and we agree on that,  and we are putting a stop to that wherever we can find it. But I don't  want to vote for H.R. 3 as an unconstitutional measure, as we have been  warned by our own Congressional Research Service lawyers who looked at  it. They said it likely violates two provisions of the Constitution  because it is so punitive and damaging.   We had the outside science people look at it and say it is going to  cost cures.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.  [[Page H10225]]    The yeas and nays were ordered.
