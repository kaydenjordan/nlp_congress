 Mr. Speaker, one of the things we are going to do  tonight is touch on some of the numbers that have substantially come  out since last Thursday and Friday, and then even more numbers that  came out yesterday and today. This is sort of the continuation of the  theme that we have been doing since the very beginning of the year, a  theme of what do we as a society have to do to keep our promises.   The number of times--and I don't want to be too snarky--that we will  have Members come behind these microphones or in our committees and  want to do policy by anecdote--because telling stories is great. They  make people happy. It is easy to understand. But it is not math. It is  not public policy.   We have to stop trying to make public policy by feelings, by  impressions, by stories, and start doing it by the numbers because the  numbers ultimately make our lives better when we get it right.   The greatest fragility in our society right now, if you look, is the  unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare. We have a moral  obligation to keep our promises, but the only way mathematically we  keep our promises is to do a handful of things. It turns out, by doing  this handful of things, my 3\1/2\-year-old little girl has a great  future, and the person who is a baby boomer who has moved into  retirement also has a stable future.   We have been doing this every week, our five elements of economic  growth of things that would provide population stability, dealing with  the benefits and incentives to stay in the workforce, technology  disruptions, how there is a revolution coming in healthcare through  technology and these drugs that are curative, how we are going to  finance those and bring those into society, so that we stop having the  debate on who pays in healthcare but what we pay. We have this ability  to have this disruption.   Then the other thing is what we do to continue the employment cycle,  keeping people in the labor force, encouraging others to enter it. We  are going to walk through some of those different numbers.   The crazy thing is this stuff shouldn't be Republican or Democrat.  This should be society's goal, that growth is moral because it provides  opportunity.   I want to walk through a couple of things that have happened in the  last few days. Think about the data we received last Friday. If you  love and care about people, if you go back and look at some of the  economists' writings from just a couple of years ago about our brothers  and sisters who didn't graduate high school, who didn't have any  particular technical skill sets, we had written them off as being part  of the permanent underclass in our communities and our society. Yet  that is the very quartile that right now is having the fastest movement  in their wages.   How do we keep that going? How do we keep that going as long as  possible?   The jobs report, the unemployment reports we received, was amazing.  We are hitting a trend where we are basically breaking all the rules.  Those of us who grew up reading this stuff, the textbooks have to now  be rewritten.   This is moral. This is something both someone on the liberal side and  conservative side should have joy about the fact of the matter is that  populations we had thought were going to be functionally part of the  permanent underclass in our society are now seeing opportunity.   If this body was doing its actual work, we would be fixated on how we  keep it going and keep it going for as long as possible.   Let's walk through some of the things this economic growth is  providing. I will openly admit that this slide is out of scale because  of the margin on it, but what is important is the first 6 months of  2017--and that is the fiscal year, so October on is the beginning of  the fiscal year--the first 6 months of 2017 and then the first 6 months  of this fiscal year, prior to tax reform, after tax reform.   One of these days, I keep being told by my staff it would be far too  snarky to bring up here and just read the quotes that were said about  what would happen to the economy with tax reform, to read the quotes of  what would happen with employment and tax reform, what would happen to  Federal receipts with tax reform.   Guess what has happened? The first 6 months of this fiscal year, the  first 6 months of 2017--the reason we do 2017 is the first 6 months of  the 2018 fiscal year straddled part with tax reform, part without-- revenues were up.   They are not up a lot. It is about $10 billion. But the technical  term is receipts are actually up.   Do we get an apology from all those folks who basically got it wrong  or just a recognition that something amazing is happening right now and  we should be joyful?   So what is happening? Why revenue shortfalls compared to our  spending?   If you want to dig in, a year ago, spending on defense--but also, we  have to deal with the reality that, from 2008 to 2028, 91 percent of  the spending increase is going to be interest, Social Security,  healthcare entitlements. In 8.5 years, two workers, one retiree. In 8.5  years, 50 percent of the spending coming through this body less  interest will be to those 65 and older.   Demographics are not a partisan issue. They are just math. The  fastest growing population in our society is those of us getting older,  and somehow this body is trying to turn it into something partisan.   The fact of the matter is, if you go back to the end of 2017, the  modeling said a 0.4 percent growth in GDP over those 10 years. It would  pay for itself. Yet the base, the size of the overall economy, would  be dramatically larger, meaning more of our brothers and sisters having  jobs, opportunities, and economic vitality.    Guess what has happened so far? The chart is a little hard to read,  but if you look at the green, which is 2019, and you start to see where  our mean GDP growth is, you start to understand how far we have come on  that 0.4 percent economic expansion in GDP growth with the tax reform.   We are only 1.5 years into it. A year and a half isn't a complete  sample size of a 10-year tax policy, but at some point, where is the  joy? If you claim you care about the working men and women of the  country, and you care about people's economic vitality, and you care  about their economic futures, where is the joy?   Let's start to do a couple of things that should be joyful. Being  from the State of Arizona, where I have a fairly substantial Latino  population: lowest unemployment in modern history ever in our numbers.  There is the chart. Where is the joy?   The fact of the matter is that something is working in our society  right now. If you claim you love and care about people, we should be  trying to figure out what we are doing right and doing more of it. It  is working.   A lot of the really smart people who used to come lecture us and  testify to us even a couple of years ago, they got it wrong. They are  the same people we are going to invite to come testify in front of us  next week, and we will never get around to asking them why they got  their math so wrong.   What is the fragility? If you read the joint tax documents when tax  reform was being put together, or you think about what the headwinds  are, we have known our demographics, one of the biggest headwinds for  our society. Within that, if you remember our five points, one of those  points is population stability. That means we are going to have to deal  with ways to encourage family formation and deal with immigration in a  way that brings that population vitality to our society.  [[Page H3467]]    The two things that if you go back to the joint tax reports saying  the headwinds for economic vitality to work were capital stock, money  that was saved that could be loaned out to buy the capital equipment,  and those things that were being incentivized, it turns out if you look  at the savings rates the last 2 years after tax reform, savings rates  are substantially better than anyone modeled.   It is a combination of a lot of things. It is a combination of the  population getting older and getting ready for retirement, a population  that we just misestimated, the number of businesses that were going to  set aside cash. But remember, when those savings are set aside, they  become a multiplier effect in the economy because they become lending  capital.   As a simple example, take a look at interest rates. Take a look at  our interest rates today compared to what was being predicted. This is  one of the most unique times in modern history, where we have,  functionally, a full employment economy. You all fixated on the numbers  that happened today. Let me pull it up. U.S. job openings rebounded  sharply in March with 364,000, seasonally adjusted, additional job  openings posted up in March.   Functionally, we have a society right now with more jobs available  than labor. If I had come and told you that was going to happen a  couple of years ago, what would you have thought?   What this chart is basically talking about is labor force  participation. As a society, how do we deal with some of that  fragility? Because capital stock is working, and the numbers are  working, but we are bouncing up against a fragility. That is that we  have more jobs than we have available labor.   How do we encourage people to enter the labor force? Should we create  certain incentives and things for those who are older to stay in the  labor force?   This is one of my last slides here. We started seeing some really  interesting numbers if you really break down the data. It started in  December. Millennial females have started to substantially move into  the workforce. Wonderful.   Why do we have such a lagging effect with millennial males? It is not  Republican or Democrat. It is just that there is something we need to  try to understand in how we get these populations into the labor force.   Because if we are going to keep our promises--and if you are like I  am, where you believe growth is ultimately moral because it provides  opportunities, stability, and the ability to plan for our future, we  need this growth to continue.   What can we do to help our brothers and sisters out there that, for  some barrier, are not entering the labor force?   The other thing we also saw beginning in December, which should make  you joyful, is some interesting data of those who would be considered  to have a type of handicap moving into the labor force, which was  letting us know that businesses were finally making accommodations to  draw in that population. That is wonderful.   You could see some of that about 10 days ago, 2 weeks ago. The  Medicare-Social Security actuaries did one of their reports. We have a  problem, but you also saw Social Security gained an entire year. That  means someone out there is paying FICA revenues. But did you see the  number for those of our brothers and sisters on Social Security  disability?   Some of that is that we changed some rules. We tightened up some of  the mechanisms. But a big chunk of that was those who have life  challenges were finding opportunities to work. These are good things.   We should, once again, be joyful and figure out, in the partisan  divide of this place, not to try to find excuses of, well, this belongs  to so-and-so or someone gets credit, but to figure out how to do more  of it. Let's do more of it. Then, during the election cycle, we will  figure out who gets to take credit for it. We will all take credit for  it. But let's do more of the good things.   As we start to look at some of the labor force participation, one of  the other things we are also fixated on in our office is that we are  trying to really drill down to try to understand some of the  demographics.   I am personally fixated with the fact that demographics often have  much more impact on what happens in a society's vitality than the  policy we make around here.   The fact of the matter is that we have 74 million of our brothers and  sisters who are baby boomers. They were born in an 18-year period.  Remember, in 8.5 years, they are all 65 and older.                                time  2000    That bubble is the single biggest challenge to this body. How often  do you have anyone get behind these microphones and talk about: What  are we going to do to create as much economic vitality so we actually  have the revenues, the resources, the opportunity, and the adoption of  technology to keep our commitments there for those who are still vital  and want to stay in the workforce--there are opportunities--and, at the  same time, reaching the other direction, as we have seen this unusual  number with millennial males, helping them find a path into the labor  force?   I know this is a little geeky, but come back to the principle. If we  as a society are going to keep our promises on Medicare and we as a  society are going to keep our promises on Social Security, it turns out  that economic growth--and it is one of only five things, but we are  going to have to dramatically change the cost of healthcare. I believe  there is technology coming that is going to be the disruption.   As I was saying before, think about the ACA. Most folks know it as  ObamaCare, those of us who worked on the Republican alternative. They  were debates about who got subsidized and who paid; they were about the  financing.   We haven't had a debate about what we as a body are going to do to  encourage the technologies and the revolution that is coming to crash  the price, and here is the thought experiment.   I have already done multiple presentations here on the floor of the  technology that is coming, the thing that looks like a kazoo that you  can blow into and instantly tell you if you have the flu. If we will  make it legal, it can bounce off the data on your phone, which is your  medical records, to make sure you are not allergic to a particular  antiviral and could order your antiviral that could be delivered to  your house a couple of hours later. How much healthier did we make  society?   The other side is that 5 percent of our population is well over 50  percent of all of our healthcare spending. How do we help that 5  percent with chronic conditions live the type of life they deserve?   When you understand that--and I am hopeful it still stays on time-- something like the concept of a single-shot cure for hemophilia, which  may be available this November. Now, the shot is going to be really  expensive, but a hemophiliac may be about a quarter million dollars a  year in their clotting factor and other ancillary costs.   But what sort of revolution is in our society when you start to think  about these biological drugs that are cures, what happens to that 5  percent of our society that have chronic conditions and we as a body  start to say: Let's stop arguing about the financing side of healthcare  and start having this discussion of how we are going to finance the  cures that are really expensive but are revolutions to our society and  our community?   We have a whole proposal we have been working on on the idea of  selling a healthcare bond and then using the future savings to pay for  it, but we are going to have to come up with some sort of pricing  mechanism because, in many of these pharmaceuticals, it is a one and  done.   Even The Wall Street Journal, today, has a discussion about a  potential biological drug; $2 million is the discussion price, but it  is for this tiny population of very, very young children who have this  disease that wastes their body away, and they die within 2 years. It is  a moral imperative we find a way to make that drug available.   But what is the economic value of curing such a thing, even though it  may be a population of only a few hundred of these children in our  society?   These are optimistic, joyful, and powerful opportunities, and this  body needs to wake up and stop having the same debate we have been  having for 20 or 30 years here because it is now the  [[Page H3468]]  wrong debate. It turns out technology has passed us, and so have our  demographics.   So what do we do to incentive participation in the economy,  particularly when you have an economy with dramatically more jobs than  we have available workers?   Here is this last slide. My hat is off to millennial females. They  have begun entering the workforce in terrific numbers. If any of them  happen to know a millennial male, could you please grab him by the hand  and drag him into the workforce.   My wife blames video games. I still haven't seen actual data on this  yet.   So my reason for taking some of this time tonight, I actually think  there should be some joy out there. For those of us who get behind  these microphones and we claim we care about people, there are really  good things happening. How do we make more of it happen? How do we make  this last as long as possible? Because we as a body, Democrats and  Republicans, are in uncharted territory, and we have got to be brutally  honest about this. We are in uncharted territory.   If you actually read some of the financial, economic articles over  this weekend, lots of really smart economists and businesspeople are  talking about having this type of economy with functionally full  employment, with populations moving into the labor force at the same  time our available workforce is starting to bend pretty dramatically  because of baby boomers turning 65, and yet, functionally, no core  inflation--if there was ever a time for us to functionally go after a  number of societal ills with this type of opportunity to work.   And the last anecdote I am going to give after making fun of  anecdotes--well, it is more than an anecdote; it is an observation.   A few months ago, I visited the homeless shelter in Phoenix. It is  actually a fairly impressive facility. Over here is St. Joseph the  Worker; over here is the dental clinic; over here is where we help you  get ID; here is the 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week 12-step meeting.   You walked in and saw St. Joseph the Worker. It is a Catholic  charity. I believe it has been around 100-plus years. Their job is to  help the most disaffected of our population, of our world find work.   There was a stack of job posts, notes, on top of the desk. Their  greatest difficulty was how do they get someone from the homeless  campus to that dishwashing job or to the stocking job or these things  to get them back into the labor force in our society to begin that  nobility of work but also as becoming part of their rehab programs.    We came up with this idea of, well, if transportation is a  fragility--we all walk around with these in our pockets, and there are  these buttons that you hit and a ride sharing comes up, and many of  those very companies will actually provide the service at a fraction of  the cost as a societal good.   We need to start thinking through the types of technology that we all  use in our lives. How do we make it so that the mother who might be on  a Medicaid system can get to her prenatal appointment? the person who  has just gone through Goodwill's job training actually can get to their  job interview? the person at the homeless campus actually can get to  that job?   If you are from Phoenix, Arizona, asking someone to stand out and  wait for the bus when it is 110 degrees, you start to understand that  maybe we need to come up with a better solution.   I make the argument that we already know the solution. We already use  it for ourselves and our children. We now need to start thinking about,  if labor force participation is one of our great fragilities for future  economic growth and that economic growth helps us take care of our  promises, how do we get the most marginalized of our society and make  sure they have the same opportunities? So this is one of those moments.   I know I have covered a lot of things, but I get to come behind the  microphone. Even with all the sourness that happens around this place,  I think there should be some joy because we are seeing our brothers and  sisters who had a really tough decade back with some optimism and some  options and some hope. Our ethical obligation, I think, is: How do we  do more of it?   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
