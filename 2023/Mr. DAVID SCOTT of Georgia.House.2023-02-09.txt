 Mr. Speaker, I would like the record to  show that had my voted for H. Res. 104 been cast, it would be recorded  as AYE. I would also like the record to show that had my vote for H.J.  Res. 24 been cast, it would be recorded as ``nay.'' Had I been present,  I would have voted: ``yea'' on rollcall No. 117 and ``nay'' on rollcall  No. 118.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, Tommy Dortch was and still  is a leader of this Nation.   Tommy and I worked together to, first of all, elect Maynard Jackson  to become the first African-American  [[Page H805]]  mayor, and then Andy Young, the first African American to be elected to  Congress since Reconstruction, right here.   When I think of Tommy, I am reminded of that glorious song that God  Almighty has given to us: ``Them that's got shall get,'' and ``Them  that's not shall lose,'' because the Bible says and it still is news.  Your mama may have and your papa may have, ``But God bless the child  That's got his own.''   God bless Mr. Tommy Dortch, my friend.                            ____________________
