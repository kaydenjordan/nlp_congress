 Mr. Speaker, I will be brief.   Mr. Speaker, I am so glad to join with 55 other of my freshman  colleagues to pledge the commitment to civility. We all took different  paths to get here. We are all from different parts of the United  States. We all have different backgrounds and different stories. But  one thing we all did to get here in this freshman class is we  campaigned hard, and we listened to our constituents. Whether our  constituents were conservative or liberal, whether they lived in the  city or in small towns, they all shared a frustration about Congress.                                time  1745    They shared the frustration that Congress was at gridlock and both  parties fought. Many times, people filed bills, knowing they would  fail, just so they could get before a TV camera and grandstand and  blame the other party.   When I got to Congress, I didn't know what to expect. The first thing  that we did was attend a retreat. We got to know each other. I left  that retreat inspired because, Mr. Speaker, I believe that this  freshman class is committed to trying to work together to accomplish  things that we agree on.   There are issues that we will never agree on, but there are issues we  do agree on. We do agree that we need to create an environment where  every American has access to a good-paying  [[Page H1168]]  job. We do agree that we need to have a military that protects its  citizens. There are so many issues that we agree on.   I pledge to work with this freshman class in the future to try to  create a working environment in which we can put every American first  and try to accomplish things to work together.
