 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on this ninth day of SALT  because a bipartisan group of mayors in  [[Page H10603]]  my district have shared with me statements about how SALT is harming  residents in New Jersey's 11th District.   Mayor Molly Whilesmith of Sparta said: ``The current trend is to sell  the house and pack the moving truck right after the youngest child  graduates from high school. The cap makes New Jersey much less  attractive for the average, hardworking New Jersey family.''   Mayor Keith Kazmark from Woodland Park said: ``Fifty-one percent of  Woodland Park taxpayers pay more than $10,000 in local property taxes,  and that does not include their State taxes. That is over 1,800  residential property owners in our town.''   Mayor Bruce Harris of Chatham Borough said: ``The average property  tax bill in Chatham Borough is about $14,100, so 40 percent is no  longer deductible. That impacts people's pockets; it also impacts  housing values.''   Mayor John Kelley, the Borough of Caldwell, said: ``Caldwell families  manage their finances and tax liability closely, and for many years  have relied upon their State income taxes and Caldwell property taxes  to reduce their Federal income tax through itemized deductions.''                            ____________________
