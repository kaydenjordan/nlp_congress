 Mr. Chairman, it is a pleasure for me to be here in my  role as chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. I am also pleased to  have a couple of our new Members here today.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood), a new  member of the Joint Economic Committee.    Mr. Chairman, it is a pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Francis Rooney), a new Member of this  Congress, and a new member of the Joint Economic Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    I reserve the balance of my time.    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, there are several perspectives, important perspectives, to  health care and health insurance: one, value delivered to patients in  terms of insurance plan options, choice of doctors, access to  treatment, and, most importantly, health outcomes; two, health  insurance premiums and healthcare cost sharing; three, budgetary cost  to the Federal and State governments; four, supply of healthcare  services, including by doctors and hospitals and through medications;  and fifth, indirect costs to the economy, such as reduced job creation  and labor force participation.   The Affordable Care Act fails on all five counts, and that is why we  are here today, to start the process of repealing and replacing it. The  program is dysfunctional, and its costs have become and will become  more unsustainable.   Supposedly, the central objective for passing the ACA was to insure  those who did not have coverage. I was there.   Yet, the increased government sprawl shown in this chart in health  care is striking.    The Joint Economic Committee chart from the time of the law's passage  illustrates the law's mind-numbing complexity. Unsurprising to anyone  skeptical of bureaucratic solutions, the Obama healthcare system has  not worked.   Instead of empowering innovators, doctors, patients, ObamaCare has  implemented a complex scheme that relies on unelected bureaucrats. And  this chart demonstrates that clearly.   Mr. Chair, ObamaCare means fewer choices. In fact, Kimberly, a  constituent in my district, recently told me that she had a brain  tumor. She said:         Virtually no doctors take the marketplace insurance, so I       am left to change doctors who I have seen for 30 years and       switch to new doctors who I don't trust and cannot provide       the same healthcare benefits that I have received in the       past.    Traumatic for her.   Remarkably, the enrollment failure is happening, despite penalties on  individuals failing to obtain coverage and on employers failing to  provide it.   Even with billions of dollars in subsidies, in my opinion, this  illustrates that many would likely prefer to trade their subsidies for  more flexibility, the choice of their own doctors, and useful  alternatives.   ObamaCare also means higher premiums. Ohioans, on the individual  marketplace, have seen increased premiums by 111 percent since passage  of ObamaCare, and now in my State, the average premium is over $5,000.   Republicans agree that the system needs reform, but ObamaCare cannot  be reformed. The argument that parts of the American healthcare  insurance system were not working previously, and that more people now  have health insurance, is irrelevant to the decision to repeal  ObamaCare. Nobody claims that the former system was perfect. I  certainly don't.   Certainly, the government can increase coverage with subsidies,  increase coverage with mandates, but what has it done to the underlying  health care that is being provided?   The extent and method by which ObamaCare increases coverage has  caused huge and unnecessary collateral damage to all others in the  marketplace, all others with respect to patient choice of their  doctors, the quality of the care that they are receiving, the supply of  health care, and, certainly, State and Federal budgets.   The focus of ObamaCare advocates has been almost exclusively on  increasing the number of insured by government subsidy and mandate. I  get that. I understand that, but not on maximizing healthy outcomes.  Those aren't the same things.   Health insurance is not an end in itself. Effective treatment to  healthcare problems is.   Private investment is so needed to push forward medical discoveries,  innovation, accelerate drug development, personalize medicine, and  harness technology to coordinate our health care and help administrate  it.   There is a better way. You will hear from the other side of the aisle  that Republicans have no plan to replace ObamaCare. Here are the plans.  It is just not true. The goal of the Republican plan is not to go back  to the way things were before ObamaCare; it is to move forward.   We want to facilitate a well-functioning market in health care, and  health insurance as well. In the United States, we let the marketplace  work things out. Republicans want to fix those obstacles and make it  better.   Among the features of the Better Way is: portability, patient- centered care, insurance across State lines, medical liability reform,  new mechanisms for small businesses and individuals to power together  to negotiate, flexibility for our Governors, a patient-centered,  patient-focused program.   The government has a role and a responsibility to provide support for  those who can't afford it, for those who fall through the cracks. A  refundable tax credit is part of our plan, addressing preexisting  conditions is part of our plan, and keeping dependents up to 26 on  their parents' plan is part of our plan.  [[Page H508]]    But the deeper points to recognize are: One, there is no reason why a  free market could not offer insurance to individuals that provides  continuous coverage throughout their lives. There is no reason that  helping the poor should not limit the choices and flexibilities of  everyone else, which ObamaCare has done, much less interfere with the  larger economy.   Moreover, the law has had an impact on employment. I see it every  week. Economics Professor Casey Mulligan of the University of Chicago  estimated that the ACA taxes will affect nearly half of the working  population in America, reducing average wages, hours worked, and GDP.   And based upon CBO estimates, the overall impact of the ACA on the  supply of labor will become progressively worse as time passes.   ObamaCare took certain problems in healthcare insurance--a large  number of uninsured, lack of individual coverage for preexisting  conditions, higher premiums for individuals--and used them as an excuse  to create socialized medicine.   The repeal of ObamaCare will take us off that path and replacement  will offer shortcomings to other problems.   Going forward, Republicans stand ready to provide support away from  ObamaCare through a transition. And getting an improved healthcare  system in place improves consumer choice.   I understand the anxiety that many are feeling right now listening to  the Democrats tell them that health care is going to be yanked out from  under them.   When I was a kid, my dad, a steel worker, lost his job. We lost our  health care. We lost our insurance. I know what that anxiety is like.  And I want to assure everyone today, that is not what we are doing here  today.   I know what we are doing here today. We are empowering patients. We  are empowering doctors, not bureaucrats. We are giving them more  choices, more opportunities, and a better healthcare system.   Mr. Chair, I ask that we support this resolution.   I yield back the balance of my time.
