 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor United States  Marine Corps Corporal Wesley Alexander Rodd, who was killed during a  training accident off the coast of Southern California on July 30 of  this year and was just laid to rest last Saturday.   Born in Houston, he was a resident of Cypress for 17 years. Just 4  months ago, he became a father. After graduating from Cy-Fair High  School in 2016, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps, and he  served as a rifleman with the Bravo Company.   We are grateful to him for his service to our country--for his  dedication and for his sacrifice--and it is fitting that we, the people  he defended, honor him today on the floor of this House, in this  Chamber. And as we do so, we honor the loss and the grief and the  sacrifice of his wife, Jamie; his 4-month-old son, Ezra; his mother,  Valarie; and all of his family, his friends, and his fellow marines.  All Americans are forever in their debt--and he will be forever in our  hearts.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Maloney for all of her  efforts to bring this important bill to the floor of this House.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of Deputy  Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal. He was my constituent, and he was killed in the  line of duty nearly a year ago today on September 27, 2019.   As we reach this sad anniversary for our community, I am grateful  that this bill to pay tribute to Deputy Dhaliwal's lasting impact on  our community is on the floor of the House today. This legislation will  designate the postal facility on Addicks Howell Road in Texas' Seventh  Congressional District as the Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office  Building.   Deputy Dhaliwal was widely regarded as a role model for Americans of  all faiths wishing to serve their communities. He was the first  observant Sikh to serve in the Harris County Sheriff's Office, and he  was also one of the first officers in Texas to receive a policy  accommodation to practice his religion while serving as a police  officer.   As my colleagues have noted, he was born in Punjab, India, but his  parents soon decided to emigrate to Houston where Mr. Dhaliwal grew  deep roots.   He did have a successful business, but seeking to build a bridge  between law enforcement and the Sikh community and the greater Houston  community, he joined the Harris County Sheriff's Office, first as a  detention officer in 2009 and one year later he was deputized and  graduated to the rank of patrol deputy.   He was assigned to district 5 which covers much of northwest Harris  County, an area he would patrol for the rest of his career. Through his  years of service, he improved law enforcement's cultural understanding  of Sikhs and was an outstanding example of the tireless contributions  that religious minorities and marginalized communities make to our  country.   Deputy Dhaliwal was also known to have a giving heart, coordinating  relief efforts after Hurricane Harvey and traveling to Puerto Rico  after Hurricane Maria to help a colleague's relatives.   He volunteered countless hours for Sikh communities across the Nation  serving as the director of homeland security for United Sikhs, helping  to advise Sikh communities on dealing with potential hate crime  threats, and advocating for their religious rights.    Deputy Dhaliwal is survived by his wife and three young children. He  represented the very best of our community. He worked for equality,  connection, and community through his life of service to others. The  senseless slaying of Deputy Dhaliwal is a solemn reminder of the risks  assumed by police officers daily in serving and protecting our  communities.   Renaming this post office facility in his honor will serve as a  permanent reminder of Deputy Dhaliwal's commitment to and sacrifice for  the community that he lived in and served. It will show that we stand  in solidarity with the people of Houston, of Harris County, and the  Sikh community across the country as they celebrate the life and mourn  of loss of this remarkable and selfless hero.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Maloney for her support of this  important bill, I thank my colleagues in Texas for joining me  unanimously in bringing it forward as cosponsors, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes'' in favor of the bill.
