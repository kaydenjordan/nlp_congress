 Mr. Speaker, gas prices have hit an all-time high,  averaging over $4 nationally for the first time since 2008. The rising  price of fuel, groceries, and just about everything are an assault on  the pocketbooks of working families, and it is all a direct result of  President Biden's failed energy policies.   Under the Trump administration we were energy independent for the  first time in my lifetime. But within just his first few days in  office, President Biden reversed all the progress that we made.   Yesterday, we heard from President Zelenskyy who urged President  Biden to do more to support Ukraine as they defend themselves from  Russia. While banning Russian oil imports is a vital first step,  another way to support Ukraine is by unleashing American energy so we  can help make the world less reliant on Putin and dictators who use the  profits from oil exports to fund their malign activities.   President Biden would rather pay dictators than Americans all in the  name of climate change. What happened to Made in America? For the sake  of our Nation and our European allies who could use an alternative to  Russian fuel, I hope he listens to the American people--let's make  America energy independent again.                            ____________________
