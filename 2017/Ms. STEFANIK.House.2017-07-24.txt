 Mr. Speaker, my legislation gives military spouses the  choice to establish the same State of residency as the servicemember,  giving them the benefit of retaining the same State of residency for  voting and tax purposes.   As the proud Representative of Fort Drum and the Navy site at  Kesselring, which I visited just this past Friday, I have heard  firsthand about the challenges that military families face, and I have  the highest respect for the sacrifices these families make to help  protect our Nation and safeguard our freedom.   Military families must relocate every few years due to their spouse's  responsibility to meet the requirements within the military. They  sacrifice a great deal during these relocations, uprooting their lives  and disrupting their families, all while serving as the critical  support system for their loved ones. This is often a difficult and  challenging time, with the heaviest burden falling upon military  spouses.   Current law allows Active-Duty servicemembers to maintain one State  of legal residence for tax and voting purposes, even when  servicemembers receive military orders requiring them to relocate, but  this does not apply to the servicemember's spouse. Essentially, this  loophole requires spouses to establish residency every time the  servicemember receives a new assignment, adding undue stress and  anxiety to military families already under the pressure of managing  their relocation. This legislation fixes this inconsistency.   Military spouses serve, too, and this bill eliminates the daunting  task of documenting multiple tax jurisdictions and helps reduce  instances of military spousal unemployment.   Traveling across the north country in New York, I have listened to  the sacrifices our military families make to keep our Nation safe. We  have a duty to reduce these burdens they face.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill on a  bipartisan basis.
