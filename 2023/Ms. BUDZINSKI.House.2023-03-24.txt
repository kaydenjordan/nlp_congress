 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of a  beloved member of the Springfield Police Department who recently  passed, K9 Thor.   Thor worked second watch for 8 years as a dual-purpose police K9  until his retirement in 2019. Trained in apprehending criminals and  searching for evidence and narcotics, he played an important role in  keeping our community safe.   During his career, Thor won numerous awards at the United States  Police Canine Association region 16 trials, including four perfect  scores in suspect search and evidence search, distinctions that my  little, 20-pound Lulu just might not have cut it.   When Thor wasn't fighting crime, his favorite activity was chasing  tennis balls at home and spending time with his family.   As we reflect on Thor's service to the Springfield community, we are  reminded of the sacrifices that our law enforcement officers and their  K9 partners make every day to keep us safe.   Thank you, Thor, and thank you to all of the first responders in the  Illinois 13th Congressional District for your dedication to service.                            ____________________
