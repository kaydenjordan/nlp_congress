 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend and fellow  Rules Committee member for the time.   Mr. Speaker, 61 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck,  yet here we are today, considering another reckless tax-and-spend bill  that doubles down on the same failed economic policies that brought us  to the current situation in the first place.   Under Democrats' one-party rule, inflation has increased nearly 550  percent. Let me repeat that. Inflation has increased nearly 550  percent.   Americans are spending over $2,000 more a year on gas. Our economy,  despite the new definition, is actually in a recession.   Despite what the majority claims, this bill will do nothing to reduce  the record-high inflation that is forcing Americans to pay more for  just about everything.   But just don't take my word for it. Analysis from the Wharton School  found this bill will actually increase inflation through 2024. This  bill will also increase taxes on individuals earning under $400,000 a  year while funneling taxpayer dollars to the wealthiest Americans.   Under this bill, coastal elites, members from the ruling class, will  receive $7,500 to buy electric vehicles while everyday Americans will  have to pay more at the pump thanks to $12 billion in taxes on American  energy producers.   Unsurprisingly, this legislation is stuffed full of socialist Big  Government handouts, including more than $400 billion for the radical,  dangerous Green New Deal policies.   It also provides the IRS with $80 billion for 87,000 new agents to  apparently audit just 700 billionaires. The IRS doesn't need 87,000  agents to audit the rich; they need 87,000 agents to harass the working  class and pay for their far-left handouts.   Ultimately, this bill will push our Nation deeper into recession and  make life even more unaffordable for American families.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule.
