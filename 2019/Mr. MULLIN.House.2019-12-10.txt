 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a member of my  staff and a true servant of Oklahoma, Betty Ford.   Betty has served southeast Oklahoma, working as a congressional field  rep for 29 years. She has worked for five different Members of  Congress, including myself. At the end of the year, Betty is going to  retire.   I know she is looking forward to spending more time with her  grandkids and with her kids. While we will definitely miss her, we wish  her nothing but the best in her next chapter.   I thank Betty for serving with a servant's heart, and I thank her for  all she has done for all of us in Oklahoma.   May God bless her.                            ____________________
