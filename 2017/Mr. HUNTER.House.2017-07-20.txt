 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2825 includes H.R. 2518, the Coast Guard  Authorization Act of 2017, in division E. The Coast Guard Authorization  Act is a product of bipartisan efforts of the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, specifically through Chairman Shuster's  leadership and the efforts of Ranking Member DeFazio and Ranking Member  Garamendi and our great staff, Dave Jansen and John Clark Rayfield.                                time  0945    The Coast Guard Authorization Act includes an authorization of  funding for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 to support the Coast Guard and  its servicemembers. It is important to remember the Coast Guard is one  of the five Armed Forces, and even though it is outside of the  Department of Defense, the service plays a critical role in protecting  our country. It is unique in being the only armed force with law  enforcement authorities, and this combination allows the service to  perform its multitude of missions.   The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has been  overseeing the Coast Guard for more than two decades and moved  legislation to support the service in each Congress since 1995. The  text of the Coast Guard Authorization Act is a product of hearings,  discussions with the Coast Guard, and regulated industries.   The bill does four main things:   Clarifies acquisition authorities to be used by the Coast Guard;   Updates certain service authorities to provide them parity with the  other Armed Forces;   Amends a variety of Coast Guard regulatory authorities; and   Provides regulatory relief for fishing and maritime transportation  industries.   The Coast Guard Authorization Act is a great bill. I urge Members to  support it and the passage of the broader bill, H.R. 2825.
