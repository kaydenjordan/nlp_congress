 Mr. President, today I recognize Summit, SD. The  town of Summit will be celebrating its quasquicentennial on June 23  through 25, 2017. Summit will host quasquicentennial events, which  include school tours, alumni gatherings, a craft and flea market,  competitions, tournaments, and a parade.   Summit is located in the Coteau des Prairies in Roberts County. The  Summit area has long been known as a community enriched with various  outdoor activities, such as fishing, hunting, and camping. Since its  founding 125 years ago, the community of Summit continues to serve as a  strong example of South Dakota values and traditions. It is also known  as the location of the annual Fog Fest.   I offer my congratulations to the citizens of Summit on their  quasquicentennial celebration and wish them continued prosperity in the  years to come.                            ____________________
