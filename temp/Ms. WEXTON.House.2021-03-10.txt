 Mr. Speaker, we all want to get out of this pandemic and  back to normal. We want to ensure that our kids can learn safely and in  their classrooms. We want to get more shots into arms. We want to put  money directly into the pockets of the Americans in need. We want to  restore jobs in our communities.   We have to take action now, and the American Rescue Plan is the best  way forward. Our colleagues across the aisle want to gaslight the  American people on this, but they know that this bill has the support  of over 70 percent of Americans, and there is a reason for that. The  American Rescue Plan meets the needs of our families and communities  right now.   With this bill, we will finally put this pandemic behind us. We will  cut child poverty in half. We will deliver transformative tax cuts for  our families, especially working moms. This is a great day because help  is on the way.
