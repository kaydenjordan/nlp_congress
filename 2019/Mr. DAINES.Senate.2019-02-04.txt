 Madam President, last week, Governor Northam of Virginia  gave chilling remarks that defended a law legalizing abortion to the  point of birth--and even after. In fact, these were Governor Northam's  exact words:         If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would       happen. The infant would be delivered. The infant would be       kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that's       what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion       would ensue between the physicians and the mother.    I was asked by many what I thought about those words. The word  ``evil'' comes to mind. ``Chilling.''   On January 23, my wife Cindy and I celebrated the birth of our first  grandchild. Little Emma Rae Daines was born in Denver. She was about 10  days early. Her due date, in fact, was Groundhog Day. She is doing  wonderfully--a healthy, beautiful granddaughter, our first grandchild.   When I think about what the Governor said, I can't help but think  about looking at the pictures we receive. I think on darn near an  hourly basis, we are getting new pictures of our new, beautiful, little  granddaughter. But these comments the Governor made pull back the  curtain on an extreme and dangerous abortion agenda that shows callous  disregard for human life.   What the Virginia Governor is defending and what these ghoulish  abortion-up-to-birth laws enable is the free rein of brutal killers  like Kermit Gosnell. Babies who survive the violence of an attempted  abortion must not be subject to further violence or neglect, and that  is why we are here this afternoon.   Soon, Senator Sasse will be offering his legislation, the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act. What Senator Sasse is proposing is  that it would be a Federal law that born alive--let me say that again  on the floor of the U.S. Senate--what this law says is that born-alive  babies who survive an abortion must be treated the same as every other  living baby--with dignity.   As a nation, how is it that we can go to the OB-GYN, the delivery  section of our hospitals, and see the NICU areas where they are doing  all they can to save the lives of these preemies, and yet we are going  to hear--I think our colleagues across the aisle are going to object to  this law that would protect a baby who is born alive.   If we can't agree on something so fundamental--that babies born alive  deserve the right to life--I fear deeply for the direction that some  are taking our country. I implore my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle not to block legislation that would bring much needed  protections for the most vulnerable among us.   I found it interesting that at the March for Life, one of the best  tweets I saw that day was by someone who, in essence, said: It is the  only march in America where those who are showing up to march are not  marching for their rights; they are marching on behalf of those who  don't have a voice. That is worth standing up for on the floor of the  Senate today. Every human life must be valued. Every human life must be  protected from conception until death.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
