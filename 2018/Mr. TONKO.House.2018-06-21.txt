 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   This week marks 100 days until the expiration of the Land and Water  Conservation Fund authorization.   The LWCF has assisted New York State in many, many ways over its 50  years to protect some of New York's most special places and ensure  recreational access for hunting, fishing, and other outdoor activities.   Both the House and Senate have currently introduced bipartisan bills  to permanently reauthorize the LWCF. I am a proud cosponsor of the  House bill, H.R. 502, and I urge the House leadership to bring it up  for a vote.   Some examples of special places in New York's 20th Congressional  District include Thatcher Park in Albany, Frear Park development in  Troy, the bike-hike trail in Glenville, Schenectady, Niskayuna, Peebles  Island, Congress Park in Saratoga, and Mohawk Mills Park in Amsterdam.
