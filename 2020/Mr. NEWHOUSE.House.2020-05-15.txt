 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Article I, section 5 of the United States Constitution states that  only a majority can constitute a quorum in order to do the business of  the people's House. As a former member of the House Rules Committee, I  have a deep appreciation and a commitment to the precedence and  procedures of this hallowed body.   But under this democratic proxy voting scheme before us today, only  22 House Democrats would need to be present in this Chamber to pass any  and every single bill moving forward. This is a forced consolidation of  power to a select few insiders, and it simply does not reflect the  values of our constitution, our history, and our Nation.   The constituents of my Washington's Fourth Congressional District did  not vote for their Representative to simply defer to a proxy and shirk  the duties of serving as a U.S. Representative.   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve more, and I urge a ``no''  vote on this terribly ill-advised and unconstitutional resolution.
