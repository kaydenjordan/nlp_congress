 Madam Speaker, on January 6, President Trump launched an  attack against the United States Capitol. I, too, urge my colleagues to  unite, but to unite in love of country, and to hold this President  accountable.   What unites our country is respect for the rule of law. Without  accountability for those who would shatter the rule of law by  overturning a Presidential election, we cannot take seriously the cries  of being a united people.   This President remains a serious threat to our country and he must be  held accountable.
