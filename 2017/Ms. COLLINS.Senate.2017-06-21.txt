 Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from  North Dakota, Senator Heitkamp, in sponsoring the School Food  Modernization Act to assist schools in providing healthier meals to  students throughout the country.   School meals play a vital role in the lives of our young people. More  than 30 million children participate in the National School Lunch  Program every school day and more than 14 million eat school  breakfasts, with participation rising steadily in Maine and nationwide.  In Maine, 48 percent of children qualify for free or reduced-price  meals based on household income.   Moreover, the food served at schools affects children's health and  well-being. Many children consume up to half their daily caloric intake  at school and some get their most nutritious meal of the day at school  instead of at home. At the same time, too many of our children are at  risk of serious disease, which may have a lifelong effect on their  health as they grow to adulthood.   In response to these health concerns, our schools have stepped up.  For example, in the New Sweden Consolidated School in Aroostook County,  Maine, food service manager Melanie Lagasse prepares meals from scratch  instead of opening cans or pushing a defrost button. The school's 64  students, aged preschool to 8th grade, have grown to relish the chicken  stew, baked fish, and meatloaf that she makes fresh.   Many schools, however, lack the right tools for preparing meals rich  in fresh ingredients. Schools built decades ago often lack the  equipment and infrastructure necessary to do more than reheat and serve  one or two meal options each day.   To serve healthier meals, 99 percent of Maine school districts need  to acquire at least one piece of equipment and almost 50 percent of  districts need kitchen infrastructure upgrades. The median equipment  need per school alone is $45,000. Making the required changes to  infrastructure is even more costly, with 41 percent of schools needing  more physical space, 22 percent more electrical capacity, 21 percent  more plumbing capacity, and 19 percent more ventilation.   It is estimated that $58.8 million would be necessary just in Maine  for the equipment and infrastructure upgrades needed to serve healthy  meals to all of our students. That far exceeds the $89,000 in grants  that the U.S. Department of Agriculture awarded Maine last fiscal year.  Maine is not alone. In a recent survey of school nutrition directors,  the most frequently cited financial concern was equipment costs,  ranking higher than even labor and food costs.   The School Food Modernization Act seeks to help food service  personnel offer a wide variety of nutritious and appealing meals and  snacks to all students. First, the bill would establish a loan  guarantee assistance program within USDA to help schools acquire new  equipment to prepare and serve healthier meals. Second, it would  provide targeted grant assistance to provide the seed funding needed to  upgrade kitchen infrastructure or to purchase high-quality equipment  such as commercial ovens, steamers, and stoves. Finally, to aid school  food service personnel in running successful, healthy programs, the  legislation would authorize USDA to provide support on a competitive  basis to highly qualified third-party trainers to develop and  administer training and technical assistance, including online programs   Senator Heitkamp and I appreciate that provisions of this legislation  were incorporated into the Child Nutrition Reauthorization legislation  that was passed out of the Agriculture Committee last Congress. We  encourage our colleagues to continue to support school kitchen  equipment needs as the reauthorization process continues.   Mr. President, if our school children are going to be able to learn  and compete, they need to be healthy and their minds and bodies fully  nourished. This bill would help us achieve that goal.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from  North Dakota, Senator Heitkamp, in sponsoring the School Food  Modernization Act to assist schools in providing healthier meals to  students throughout the country.
