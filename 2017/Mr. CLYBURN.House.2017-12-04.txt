 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this  time.   Mr. Speaker, let me say to the gentleman from Pennsylvania, it is  time to do all of those things that he just spoke about, but this piece  of legislation does none of those things. In fact, it raises taxes on  87 million middle-income families, cuts $25 billion a year from  Medicare, kicks 13 million people off of their health insurance, makes  it easier for companies to ship jobs overseas, eliminates long-held  deductions for teachers, students, and the chronically ill, makes  individual tax cuts temporary but corporate tax cuts permanent, and  increases the deficit by more than $1.5 trillion.                                time  2000    The hypocrisy of so-called conservatives is staggering. Corporations  will save billions and shareholders will get richer, while our children  and grandchildren foot the bill.   The Democratic motion would instruct conferees to protect deductions  for State and local taxes and restore the Affordable Care Act's  individual mandate. Doing so will stop 13 million Americans from losing  their health insurance and put a halt to the 10 percent premium hike  that CBO estimates the Ryan-McConnell tax scam would cause.   Mr. Speaker, the individual mandate is at the heart of the Affordable  Care Act. Repealing it--as the GOP tax scam does--is a deliberate  attempt to undercut the law, create chaos in the health insurance  marketplaces, increase premiums, and decrease choice and coverage.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to restore State and local tax  deductibility and the individual mandate.
