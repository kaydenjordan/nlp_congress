 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R.  2, which is the Secure the Border Act.   Everyone knows that the southern border is not secure. At the start  of his Presidency, Joe Biden halted construction of the border wall,  essentially prevented Immigration and Customs Enforcement from doing  its job to keep our country safe.   And took steps to end the Migrant Protection Protocols as well as  other enforcement policies.   President Biden's open border policies have led to the humanitarian  and national security crisis at our southern border today. Since Joe  Biden took office, there have been over 5 million illegal border  crossings at the southern border. Customs and Border Protection  officers have seized over 14,000 pounds of deadly fentanyl that have  come across our southern border. For perspective, that is enough  fentanyl to kill every single American.   Furthermore, in just the first 6 months of this fiscal year, 2023,  the names of 80 people who appear on the terrorist watch list were  stopped trying to cross the southern border.    It is about to get much worse, because tomorrow, title 42, one of our  most powerful tools to quickly expel illegal immigrants, will expire.  Again, that happens tomorrow.   Title 42 is a public health order that allows migrants, who would  otherwise be held in processing facilities, to be quickly expelled due  to a risk of COVID-19 transmission.   The end of title 42 is expected to incentivize a worsening influx of  illegal migrants. Border Patrol officials at our border are already  seeing an unprecedented surge at our southern border with over 26,000  migrant apprehensions in just 72 hours.   For more than 2 years, President Biden and his administration have  ignored the crisis. I can tell you that House Republicans have listened  to the concerns of Americans and are working on solutions to the  crisis. In our Commitment to America, we promised to create a Nation  that is safe.   We are going to vote soon on the Secure the Border Act, to make sure  that our southern border is, in fact, secure and to combat illegal  immigration.   Just a few things that our Secure the Border Act will do:   Number 1, it will force the administration to restart construction of  the border wall.                                time  1015    It will deploy technology to the southern and northern border. It  will increase the number of Border Patrol agents, and it will increase  their pay. It will require transparency regarding illegal crossings  from the Department of Homeland Security. It will strengthen our  current law to protect unaccompanied children from human trafficking.  It will end catch and release. It will end the abuse of executive  immigration authority. It will strengthen and streamline the asylum  process.   This bill, the Secure the Border Act, fulfills our promise to the  American people to offer solutions to a crisis that affects not just  cities and States along the border but every city and every State in  this Nation.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  important piece of legislation.                            ____________________
