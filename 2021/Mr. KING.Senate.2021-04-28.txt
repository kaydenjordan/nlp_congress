 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, later today we will have one of the most  consequential votes we have had in this  [[Page S2265]]  body in years, perhaps the most consequential vote in terms of our  climate and the risk that climate change imposes on all of us here in  America and across the world. It is a pretty straightforward vote,  although it is an interesting procedural problem.   The vote is a Congressional Review Act vote to repeal the repeal of  the regulation on the release of methane from oil and gas, both  drilling and transportation. A repeal of a repeal is the legislative  equivalent of a double negative, and, of course, we all know a double  negative produces a positive, and that is exactly what will happen in  this case.   Some years ago, regulations were imposed upon the oil and gas  industry to control the escape of methane from drilling operations.  This isn't about natural gas or oil; this is about fugitive gases that  escape into the atmosphere as part of the drilling process or the  transportation process.   The problem is that methane is the nuclear weapon of climate change.  Methane is 80 times as dangerous as CO2 in the atmosphere,  in terms of capturing heat and contributing to climate change--80  times; not 80 percent more, not 8 times more, 80 times more.   Now, the good news is methane only persists in the atmosphere for  about 20 years; CO2, unfortunately, over 100 years. So  because of its short residence time and its high potency, removing it  now will have immediate and substantial effects on the overall amount  of greenhouse gas that is in our atmosphere.   There is nothing we can do in the short run to deal with climate  change that is more significant than the vote that will take place on  this floor in a few hours. This is probably, as I said at the  beginning, one of the most important votes that we will have in this  Chamber in order to forestall and slow the climate catastrophe that  everyone acknowledges is headed toward us--whether it is wildfires,  whether it is changes in ocean temperature that affect sea life,  whether it is hurricanes, whether it is pure temperature.   Let me talk a bit about climate change as a national security issue.  I serve on the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees. It is a  national security issue for a number of reasons. One is sort of dollars  and cents. It affects our military facilities around the world that are  going to be affected by rising sea levels. We are going to have to  spend billions of dollars in order to shore up those facilities. So  that is just kind of nuts and bolts, dollars and cents.   But the part that really worries me is migration. We all know about  the migrants from Syria, from the Syrian civil war. I don't know the  exact number--maybe 4 or 5 million. But those migrants upset the  political system of all of Europe and created a major political crisis.   The estimate for climate migrants because of the inhospitality of the  climate in the band around the central part of the Earth is in the  hundreds of millions--between 100 and 200 million climate migrants who  are escaping a place that they can't live in anymore because of  drought, because of famine, because of a lack of drinking water, or  just because of high temperatures.   Humans aren't evolved to live in places that are at 130 degrees of  heat. So people are going to be on the move. Think of the disruption  caused by the immigration or the migration from Syria and multiply that  by 10, 20, 30, 40 times. That is what we are talking about, and that  kind of pressure and famine and drought and all of those things  throughout history are what have caused wars.   It is a threat multiplier. It is a threat creator. It is, in fact, a  national security issue. This isn't about just being concerned about  whether we will have more warm days in April. This is a national  security issue, and it is of worldwide import   Now, why is this vote today important if it is a worldwide issue? I  have had people say to me: Angus, why are we going through all this?  Why are we going to cost ourselves any money when it is just as big a  problem coming from China or India?   We can shut down all of our businesses in Maine, and we are still not  going to be able to solve this problem, nor could we if we did it in  the United States. Molecules of methane or CO2 don't care  about borders. They go around the world, and they are causing this  problem to happen around the world.   But, yes, this vote today is important because it is a signal to the  rest of the world that we are serious about this problem. A negative  vote today is a signal to the rest of the world that we don't care, and  the rest of the world is going to be paying attention.   This is a global problem. It is going to take solutions from every  country and particularly from the larger emitting countries, like the  United States, like China, like India. But we have to show that we are  willing to do it here, if we are going to ask other people to make  these kinds of steps in their country. And that is why I think this  vote has international implications as well as national.   Now, what about the cost? Are we imposing some enormous cost, or are  we talking about new technology? No, this is a relatively cheap way to  get a major improvement in the emission of greenhouse gases.   We are not talking about carbon capture, which is very important, but  we are a ways away from cost-effective carbon capture technology, and  the costs are still very high. This is of relatively low cost.         Regulating methane emissions from oil and gas production is       the right thing to do for our climate and the air quality of       communities across the country.    I couldn't have said it better myself, but I am reading someone  else's words.         It's widely acknowledged that methane is a highly potent       greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 80 times       greater than CO2. Beyond the long-term impacts       related to climate change, methane emissions also have       implications for local air quality. We owe it to the       communities where we live and work to reduce these emissions.    Who said that? Angus King didn't say that. Shell Oil said that. Many,  if not most, of the major producers of oil and gas in this country are  supporting this vote today. This is not a vote where fossil fuel is on  one side and the environmental community is on the other. No, this is a  broad coalition of people worried about health, of people worried about  the environment, of people worried about climate change, and also  people in the industry who are worried about the effects of this on  their industry if we don't take care of this.   And here is very interesting data. We all know that different  technologies have different impacts on the environment, and these bars  are the emission levels per unit of energy produced of various  alternatives: air pumps, wood pellets, natural gas, propane, heating  oil, coal. These are all in use in the United States.   We have substantially lowered our emission of greenhouse gases  because of the conversion from coal and oil to natural gas, and that  hasn't been caused by regulation or by the dead hand of government.  That is because of the market, because of the enormous production of  natural gas in this country.   Now, here is the problem--and I have always thought of natural gas as  a transition fuel. Sixty percent of our electricity in New England  comes from natural gas, and, indeed, our CO2 is down because  of that. But here is the problem. See this little black line here? That  is the actual emission from natural gas if you count methane.   So the environmental, the climate advantage of natural gas disappears  if you count the methane that is released in the production of natural  gas. But it is controllable. It is not inevitable. It is not something  that is impossible.   There are now technologies to survey pipelines to detect leaks and to  prevent them. It is really pretty straightforward. If you have a  pipeline that is leaking and is putting methane in the atmosphere that  is 80 times as bad as CO2, let's fix it. And that is all we  are talking about today.   We are talking about restoring commonsense regulations on the release  of dangerous climate-change-inducing gases, principally, methane. Some  of the other things that are released are also dangerous for people  living in the area of the well or the pipeline leak.   I am not opposed to the use. I mean, right now, as I say, natural gas  is the preferred alternative--and you can see why--except for the  methane problem. So let's eliminate that. Let's make the chart look  like this. Then, natural gas works. But we have to deal with methane.  [[Page S2266]]    This is the low-hanging fruit of climate action. This is an  opportunity for this country to make a statement internationally, to  make a statement to our people, and to do something about the most  serious environmental problem we face.   Every day that goes by, it gets more expensive to deal with. Every  day that goes by, it is going to be more difficult for our people, the  impacts are going to be more catastrophic, and the impacts are going to  be more difficult in terms of what we have to spend to deal with it.   So let's spend relatively little now to eliminate one of the most  serious risks. It is not minor. It is a very significant part of the  climate issue, and it is one that we can do at a relatively low price,  with not a heavy hand of regulation but commonsense regulation. And we  can do something important for the American people and, indeed, for the  people of the entire world.   This is an important vote this afternoon. I hope it is a resounding  vote. It should be. It should be a resounding vote to say to the world  and to say to the people of this country: We are on your side. We  understand there is a problem heading for us, and we are going to act  to deal with it.   This is our responsibility. It is why we are here, and we have the  capability to do this starting today.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 15 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
