 Mr. Speaker, I grew up not understanding why people  throughout the country didn't hold Congress in high regard, but I can  just imagine the people turning on C-SPAN, turning on the news, hearing  the arguments that we are hearing from the other side of the aisle, and  then it just makes sense to me.   Let's recap what the American people have witnessed over the last few  years: A Member who physically assaulted a colleague, a Republican  Member who tried to bring a gun on the House floor, a Republican  colleague who brought January 6 insurrectionists into the Capitol.   This is the least productive Congress that we have had since the  Great Depression, and this entire party is pushing us toward a shutdown  and economic collapse daily, but it is Congressman Bowman, who is a  thoughtful former educator and staunch defender of democracy, who they  want to censure. What a pathetic waste of time. No wonder half of this  country doesn't vote when they turn on the TV and see their leaders  wasting time like this.   We need more educators in Congress like Congressman Bowman, not  fewer, and maybe if we had more educators here, they would be able to  give my Republican colleagues a class on how to truly govern.
