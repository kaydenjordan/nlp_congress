 Mr. President, yesterday evening, we learned that some  of the National Guard forces who were helping protect the Capitol  Complex were being made to rest in parking garages between their  shifts. I don't think a single Senator feels that was acceptable. I am  glad the situation was resolved, and I hope we learn exactly what  happened.   In that regard, I want to thank all the National Guard, including  more than 300 Kentucky Guardsmen, and local and Federal law enforcement  who helped supplement our very own Capitol Police in the wake of  January 6. Your Congress and your country appreciate all you have done  to secure the Capitol and the inauguration.   Later today, I will have the honor of meeting a number of my  Kentuckians who have been helping out here at the Capitol. It is going  to be the highlight of my day.   In the near future, Congress needs to smartly transition toward a  more sustainable security presence. Keeping the Capitol safe cannot and  will not require huge numbers of uniformed troops and vast systems of  emergency fencing to remain in place forever. With the inauguration  behind us, we should find the right middle ground between the  unacceptable lapses 3 weeks ago and the extraordinary short-term  measures that have been put in place since that time. In the meantime,  we need to make darn sure that we look after the men and women who look  after us.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on a totally different matter,  while business proceeds on the floor, the Democratic leader and I are  continuing to flesh out the structure of this 50-50 Senate.   When Leaders Lott and Daschle wrote a similar agreement 20 years ago,  there wasn't a need at all to reaffirm the basic standing rules that  govern legislation here in the Senate. It was safely assumed that no  majority would break this rule for short-term gain.   Floor remarks surrounding those 2001 discussions specifically cite  the legislative filibuster as an important and unquestioned part of the  backdrop that lay beneath the negotiations on the finer details. It was  assumed no one would ever take that step.   After the fact, Leader Daschle, the Democrat, praised the legislative  filibuster as a crucial rule. President Biden has praised this  distinctive feature of the Senate on many occasions.   Our current Democratic colleagues used it liberally--liberally--over  the last several years when they were in the minority. More than two  dozen signed a bipartisan letter in 2017 saying our Republican majority  should not break the rule by brute force. Let me say that again. Two  dozen Democrats signed a bipartisan letter in 2017 saying our  Republican majority should not break this rule by brute force. I  agreed. I didn't do it. President Trump was not happy with that. He  tweeted against me numerous times because I didn't put an end to the  legislative filibuster. So the Democrats used it constantly, as they  had every right to. They were happy to insist on a 60-vote threshold  for practically every major bill I took up.   So we will continue to request that our Democratic colleagues  reaffirm this standing rule of the Senate, which they have been happy  to use on many occasions, I can attest. If we are going to truly  replicate the 2001 agreement, we need to reaffirm this crucial part of  the foundation that lay beneath it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, yesterday I also shared a proposal for  the pretrial steps in the Senate impeachment process that appears to be  headed our way and, as I understand it, will be headed our way on  Monday. By Senate rules, if the article arrives, we have to start a  trial right then.   This impeachment began with an unprecedentedly fast and minimal  process over in the House. The sequel cannot be an insufficient Senate  process that denies former President Trump his due process or damages  the  [[Page S97]]  Senate or the Presidency itself. Senate Republicans strongly believe we  need a full and fair process where the former President can mount a  defense and the Senate can properly consider the factual, legal, and  constitutional questions at stake.   For that reason, we suggest the House transmit this article next  Thursday, but that apparently is going to be next Monday; that former  President Trump's answer and the House's pretrial brief, I suggested,  be due on February 4; and that the former President's pretrial brief be  due, I suggested, on February 11. That timeline would have provided the  Senate some more floor time before we step fully into the unknown of a  trial--which, by the way, would have been of substantial benefit to the  incoming administration and allowed them to get more of their Cabinet  confirmed, on which we are cooperating as best we can to expedite                            ____________________     Finally, Mr. President, on one final matter regarding  nominees, we are considering President Biden's nominees to key Cabinet  posts.   On Wednesday, Admiral Haines was confirmed as Director of National  Intelligence on a big bipartisan vote, including my own. We hope to be  able to consider Tony Blinken to be the Secretary of State early next  week.   Today, we are considering GEN Lloyd Austin, President Biden's nominee  to serve as Secretary of Defense. I voted to approve the waiver that  would allow him to serve in this post yesterday, notwithstanding the 7- year cooling-off period after military service, and I will be voting in  favor of his confirmation.   I am voting yes because the nominee is clearly qualified and because  Presidents should get real latitude to fill their teams with qualified  and mainstream people of their choosing. At the same time, the Senate  should pause and reflect on the fact that we will have begun two  consecutive Presidential administrations by issuing a waiver to a four- star general and former CENTCOM commander to lead the Pentagon.   The Armed Services Committee held a hearing last week to examine the  waiver and the current state of civil-military relations at the  Pentagon. I expect the committee will continue to pay close attention  to this important issue in the months ahead and will investigate steps  that Congress can take to help restore balance over at the Pentagon.   The law that we keep waiving actually exists for a good reason.  Civilian control of the military is a fundamental principle of our  Republic. We emphatically do not want high-ranking military service to  become a tacit prerequisite for a civilian leadership post over at the  Department of Defense.   It is not just about a simplistic fear that the military will end up  running itself. To the contrary, many experts worry that military  leaders' appropriate fixation on being nonpolitical may not prepare  them for the job, to forcefully fight for our armed services amid the  political rough-and-tumble in the executive branch and here in  Congress. To put it another way, they are taught from the beginning to  stay out of politics entirely. But we do want a Secretary of Defense  who is willing to engage in the issue-based discussions that we have  related to the Department.   Nevertheless, I will vote today to confirm a clear patriot with an  impressive career, but I will cast that vote with the understanding  that our new Secretary of Defense specifically commits to balancing  civil-military relations, empowering civilian leaders at the Pentagon,  and playing an active role in the inherently political budget process  to get our forces what they need. Our intensifying competition with  China, Russia, and all the other threats we face demand nothing less.                            ____________________
