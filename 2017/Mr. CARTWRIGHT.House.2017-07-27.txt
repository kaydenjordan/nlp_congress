 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.  [[Page H6504]]     Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that  would prohibit the Department of Defense from conducting what is called  new A-76 studies. I offer this amendment on behalf of myself, as well  as Mr. Cole of Oklahoma, Mr. Jones of North Carolina, Mr. Bishop of  Utah, Mr. Donovan of New York, Mr. Cook of California, Mr. Ratcliffe of  Texas, Mr. Loebsack of Iowa, Mr. Kilmer of Washington, Ms. Shea-Porter  of New Hampshire, and Mr. Beyer of Virginia.   These flawed A-76 studies are relying on a process that both the GAO  and the inspector general of the Department of Defense determined could  not demonstrate any savings to the American taxpayer. That is why A-76  studies have been subject to a congressional moratorium since 2010. The  amendment I am offering today would continue that moratorium.   The fundamental flaw inherent in the A-76 process is the erroneous  underlying methodology used to determine whether or not Federal  civilian jobs would be outsourced. 2003 was the last time this process  was updated.   Mr. Chairman, the inspector general's report notes that it simply  fails to keep track of costs and savings. It has no anchor in reality,  and incorporates an arbitrary 12 percent overhead factor cost for  Federal employees as opposed to contractors.   The inspector general concluded that: ``. . . multimillion-dollar  decisions are based, in part, on a factor not supported by data . . .  Unless DOD develops a supportable rate or an alternative method to  calculate a fair and reasonable rate, the results of future  competitions will be questionable.''   Decisions involving taxpayer money should never be based on such a  faulty process, especially when American jobs are at risk as well.   We are debating the appropriation of hundreds of billions of dollars,  the lion's share of our country's discretionary spending. This is as it  should be. We should spare no expense to provide the best care for our  veterans. We should not haggle over the national defense, but when we  spend this much money, we have a responsibility to do it carefully and  based on actual data.                                time  1545    As legislators, we should exercise care to ensure that we represent  the interests of our constituents as well as possible. A flawed process  based on pseudocalculations has no basis, no place in that reputation.   Ultimately, the A-76 process uses faulty, antiquated methodology to  determine whether Federal civilian jobs should be outsourced, a matter  we simply cannot approach so haphazardly. Both the GAO and the  inspector general of the DOD concluded the process could not  demonstrate any savings for the American taxpayer. This A-76 process is  outdated, antiquated, and simply not anchored in reality.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this body owes a duty to our  warfighters, a duty to the taxpayers, and a duty to the civilian  workforce. Allowing these flawed A-76 studies to move forward, it  really is a breach to all three groups.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment, to maintain  the moratorium currently in place on these A-76 studies and protect our  military readiness from a process in desperate need of radical  revision.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
