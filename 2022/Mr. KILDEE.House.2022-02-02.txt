 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the America COMPETES  Act. With this legislation we have an opportunity to strengthen  domestic supply chains, invest in American manufacturing, and to lower  costs for families, for small businesses, and seniors.   This pandemic has exposed deep weaknesses in our supply chains that  have increasingly relied on foreign manufacturing, instead of making  goods right here in America with American workers. This bill will help  fix our broken supply chains so that we can build more critical  components here in America, not overseas in China where government  exploits its own people.   For Michigan's auto workers, this includes addressing the  semiconductor chips shortage, which has shuttered auto plants and  forced thousands of auto workers to temporarily be laid off. This bill  will invest billions to bring chip manufacturing back to the United  States.   Also, this legislation includes my legislation to create a new Trade  Adjustment Assistance for Communities program, and it will help many  older industrial communities that have been negatively impacted by  trade communities like Flint, Saginaw, and Bay City. TAA for  Communities will address the needs in these places and develop local  economic development strategies.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
