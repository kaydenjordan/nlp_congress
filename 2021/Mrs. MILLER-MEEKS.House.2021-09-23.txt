 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a group of  Good Samaritans who recently brought Iowa nice to Louisiana.   Earlier this month, the New Sharon Fire Department of Mahaska County  joined dozens of recovery teams from across the Nation to perform  disaster relief efforts and assist in search and rescue operations in  Louisiana after Hurricane Ida.   Thanks to the generosity of the New Sharon and Mahaska County  community, the New Sharon Fire Department has aided in recovery efforts  both in the Hawkeye State and elsewhere across the country for 16  years.   In 2018 the New Sharon Fire Department assisted local Texas recovery  teams in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, and last year they traveled  to help local communities that were devastated by Hurricanes Laura and  Sally.   I thank the New Sharon Fire Department and the citizens of Mahaska  County for answering the call to serve and being incredible examples of  the generosity and selflessness of Iowans.                The Generosity of the Quad Cities Bicycle Club     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share an Iowa nice  story about looking out for one of our own.   Joseph Stewart, a resident of Bettendorf in Scott County, relied on  his bicycle for years to make his 3-mile roundtrip commute to work  every single day, but after his bicycle broke, the time of his daily  commute doubled. For over a month after losing his only means of  transportation, Joe would walk in between the highway and the railroad  tracks to make it to work, not missing a single day of work. This is  when Quad Cities Bicycle Club member Kathy Storm noticed Joe walking  with a big smile on his face despite his circumstances.   The Quad City Bicycle Club is known for their generosity, with  members donating bikes to share their love of cycling with other  members of the community.   After getting to talking, Kathy learned Joe's situation and later  showed up to his place of employment with a big surprise--a new bike  that was donated by the club.   It is stories like these that make us smile and inspire others to  help their own neighbors. And this is just one small example of why  Iowa is the best place to live, work, play, and raise a family.                              Iron Dome Funding     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the  importance of the United States continuing to support our allies,  specifically Israel.   Israel has long been a key strategic ally for the United States. Our  relationship is mutually beneficial, and it is important that we work  to support them whenever we can. That means fully funding the Iron Dome  missile defense system must be a top priority of this Chamber.   The Iron Dome is a mobile all-weather air defense system designed to  intercept and destroy short-range rockets and artillery shells whose  trajectory would take them to an Israeli populated area. This system is  purely defensive and designed to protect civilians. Innocent bystanders  of all ethnicities, nationalities, and faiths rely on the Iron Dome for  safety and protection.   When terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah fire thousands of  rockets into Israel, as they did earlier this year, the Iron Dome  system quickly destroyed them and saved countless lives. Unfortunately,  the majority wants to play games with this vital program. Earlier this  week, the funding for the Iron Dome was stripped from the majority's  continuing resolution amid protests from progressive Members.   For years, the United States has consistently funded the Iron Dome on  a strong bipartisan basis to help Israel defend itself from rocket  attacks from terrorist organizations. There has never been a situation  where military aid for Israel was held up because of objections from  Members of Congress. It is disgraceful that the majority would remove  the $1 billion in funding for the Iron Dome to appease the far left  that seems to have taken over their agenda. Not funding the Iron Dome  puts lives at risk for absolutely no reason. While I appreciate the  majority introducing  [[Page H5096]]  standalone legislation to fully fund the system, it should not have  come to this to ensure the safety of our allies.   After a summer that saw 2 weeks of fighting between Israel and  Palestine, it is beyond clear to me that we must support Israel. Israel  has long been a U.S. ally in a region marked by decades of conflict and  turmoil. They are a strong democracy and share our views on many  issues.   I am proud to say what many in the majority will not, that I firmly  stand in support of Israel and continuing to build our partnership for  years to come.                            ____________________
