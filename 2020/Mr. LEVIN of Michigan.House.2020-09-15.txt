 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R.  2639, the Strength in Diversity Act. I thank this bill's sponsor,  Congresswoman Fudge, and Chairman Scott for shepherding this bill  through the Education and Labor Committee.   Nearly 20 years after Brown v. Board of Education, lesser-known  Supreme Court cases like Milliken v. Bradley determined that  segregation was allowed, if not considered an explicit policy, of each  school district.   This meant schools and communities were not held responsible for  desegregation. Busing policies meant to integrate city and suburban  schools were abandoned and the inequality created by racist redlining  and exclusionary housing policies continued, keeping Black Americans  out of the suburbs and trapped in underfunded schools to this day.  Today, the school system at the center of Milliken v. Bradley,  Detroit's, is more segregated than it was in 1974.   This bill will provide grants to improve racial and socioeconomic  diversity in public schools, an essential step toward fulfilling the  promise of Brown v. Board, ending the segregation that continues to  plague school districts across this country, including in my own  district, Michigan's Ninth.   Thurgood Marshall, the Supreme Court's first Black Justice, warned in  his dissent in Milliken v. Bradley, ``unless our children begin to  learn together, there is little hope that our people will ever learn to  live together and understand each other.''   As we reckon with our Nation's past and work to dismantle racist  institutions that have stood for far too long, let us not forget our  children.   I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.
