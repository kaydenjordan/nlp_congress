 Mr. Speaker, as a former DOD employee, I know  our men and women in uniform must have the authorities and resources to  get the job done. They must be well equipped in order to deter and  defeat adversaries. That is why I strongly urge my colleagues to pass  the National Defense Authorization Act.   I thank Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith for their  leadership on this bipartisan bill. As a member of the Armed Services  Committee and of the conference committee that reconciled the House and  Senate versions of the bill, I am honored to have played a role in  crafting this final product.   We must fight for our servicemembers as hard as they have fought for  us. We must give them the tools they need to succeed not only on the  battlefield, but also once they leave the service.   Our military produces remarkably talented and well-trained  individuals, but too many of these warriors struggle to transition to  the civilian world. That is why I am so pleased that the core of my  bill, the BATTLE for Servicemembers Act, was included in the NDAA. This  provision improves DOD's Transition Assistance Program, which helps  departing servicemembers prepare for life after the military.   Specifically, my provision ensures departing servicemembers take a  specialized 2-day course to prepare them to attend college, learn a  trade, or start a small business. These targeted courses are optional  under current law, and, as a result, few servicemembers can take  advantage of them. I am hopeful my provision will lead to increased  participation in these courses so that more men and women in our  military will be prepared to make a successful transition to civilian  life.   I am also proud the NDAA includes the full text of my bill to  modernize SBA's microloan program, which provides small-dollar loans to  aspiring and existing entrepreneurs, including veteran entrepreneurs.   I urge my colleagues on both sides to support this bill.
