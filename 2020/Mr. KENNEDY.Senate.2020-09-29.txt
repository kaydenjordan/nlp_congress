 Mr. President, though my bill, S. 4403, a bill to amend  the Nutria Eradication and Control Act of 2003 to include California in  the program, amends P.L. 108-16, which calls specifically for the  Secretary to ``require that the program consist of management,  research, and public education activities carried out in accordance  with the document published by the United States Fish and Wildlife  Service entitled `Eradication Strategies for Nutria in the Chesapeake  and Delaware Bay Watersheds' dated March 2002'' and to ``give  consideration to the 2002 report from the Louisiana Department of  Wildlife and Fisheries titled 'Nutria in Louisiana,' '' the Secretary  and State participants should also consider data that has been  established since 2002, in developing strategies for the eradication of  Nutria.
