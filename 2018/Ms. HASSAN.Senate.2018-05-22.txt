 Madam President, I am proud to recognize second  grader MaKenzie Sheehan of Monroe, NH, as the May Granite Stater of the  Month for her bravery and quick thinking that helped save her family  when their house caught on fire recently.   On the night of the fire, MaKenzie woke to a crash in her bedroom,  and when she saw a wall of fire, she quickly acted to wake her sister.  Remembering from her fire education at school that the door would be  hot, she knew not to touch it and began screaming for help. Her cries  alerted the rest of the family, and they were able to make it out just  in time.   Her family is very proud and grateful for MaKenzie's grace under  pressure and considers her their hero.  [[Page S2829]]    I am honored to recognize MaKenzie as the May Granite Stater of the  Month. MaKenzie represents the strength of character that defines the  Granite State, and her actions are an excellent reminder that, no  matter our age, it is critical that we are equipped with the knowledge  of what to do in case of an emergency.                            ____________________
