 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4990) to codify the Institute for Telecommunication Sciences  and to direct the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications  and Information to establish an initiative to support the development  of emergency communication and tracking technologies, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4990         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Institute for       Telecommunication Sciences Codification Act'' or the ``ITS       Codification Act''.       SEC. 2. INSTITUTE FOR TELECOMMUNICATION SCIENCES.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) The test center within National Telecommunications and       Information Administration (in this subsection referred to as       the ``NTIA'') represents executive branch agencies on       spectrum issues before the Federal Communications Commission.        (2) Understanding radio frequency propagation       characteristics and modeling is a critical component of       making spectrum decisions.        (3) Federal agencies rely on expert engineering studies,       simulations, and analyses to make determinations about how to       make spectrum available for commercial use, including through       system relocations and identifying spectrum sharing       opportunities through the NTIA.        (4) Clearing of Federal spectrum, when feasible, is the       priority action to take to make Federal spectrum available       for commercial uses as required by section 113(j)(1) of the       National Telecommunications and Information Administration       Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 923(j)(1)).        (5) Sharing of Federal spectrum between Federal entities       and commercial entities provides access to Federal spectrum       for commercial uses in circumstances where clearing is not       feasible.        (6) The test center within NTIA, is the Government's       premier expert laboratory for spectrum research activities,       spectrum sharing innovation and testing, spectrum       interference studies, and all activities related to advancing       next generation wireless technologies.        (7) The test center within NTIA is critical for undertaking       engineering studies and analyses that inform clearing or       sharing opportunities and facilitate policy decisions to       maximize the efficient use of spectrum resources.        (b) Operation of Test Center.--Part A of the National       Telecommunications and Information Administration       Organization Act (47 U.S.C. 901 et seq.) is amended by adding       at the end the following:       ``SEC. 106. INSTITUTE FOR TELECOMMUNICATION SCIENCES.         ``(a) Establishment.--        ``(1) In general.--Under the authority provided to the       Assistant Secretary under section 103, the Assistant       Secretary shall operate a test center to be known as the       Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (in this section       referred to as `ITS').        ``(2) Functions.--        ``(A) In general.--In addition to any functions delegated       by the Assistant Secretary under subparagraph (B), ITS shall       serve as the primary laboratory for the executive branch of       the Federal Government to--        ``(i) study radio frequency emissions, including       technologies and techniques to control such emissions and       interference caused by such emissions;        ``(ii) determine spectrum propagation characteristics;        ``(iii) conduct tests on technology that enhances the       sharing of electromagnetic spectrum between Federal and non-      Federal users;        ``(iv) improve the interference tolerance of Federal       systems operating with, or using, Federal spectrum;        ``(v) promote activities relating to access to Federal       spectrum by non-Federal users and the sharing of Federal       spectrum between Federal and non-Federal users; and        ``(vi) conduct such other activities as determined       necessary by the Assistant Secretary.        ``(B) Additional functions.--The Assistant Secretary may       delegate to ITS any of the functions assigned to the       Assistant Secretary under section 103(b)(1).        ``(3) Agreements and transactions.--In carrying out the       functions described in paragraph (2), the Assistant       Secretary, acting through the head of ITS, may enter into       agreements as provided under the following authorities:        ``(A) Sections 11 and 12 of the Stevenson-Wydler Technology       Innovation Act of 1980.        ``(B) Section 1535 of title 31, United States Code.        ``(C) Sections 207 and 209 of title 35, United States Code.        ``(D) Section 103(b)(2) of this Act.        ``(E) Section 113(g) of this Act.        ``(F) The first undesignated section of Public Law 91-412.        ``(G) As authorized in any other Federal statute.        ``(4) Federal spectrum defined.--In this subsection, the       term `Federal spectrum' means frequencies assigned on a       primary basis to a Federal entity (as defined in section       113(l)).        ``(b) Emergency Communication and Tracking Technologies       Initiative.--        ``(1) Establishment.--The Assistant Secretary, acting       through the head of ITS, shall establish an initiative to       support the development of emergency communication and       tracking technologies for use in locating trapped individuals       in confined spaces, such as underground mines, and other       shielded environments, such as high-rise buildings or       collapsed structures, where conventional radio communication       is limited.        ``(2) Activities.--In order to carry out this subsection,       the Assistant Secretary, acting through the head of ITS,       shall work with private sector entities and the heads of       appropriate Federal agencies, to--        ``(A) perform a needs assessment to identify and evaluate       the measurement, technical specifications, and conformity       assessment needs required to improve the operation and       reliability of such emergency communication and tracking       technologies; and        ``(B) support the development of technical specifications       and conformance architecture to improve the operation and       reliability of such emergency communication and tracking       technologies.        ``(3) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of       the enactment of this section, the Assistant Secretary shall       submit to Congress, and make publicly available, a report on       the assessment performed under paragraph (2)(A).''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4990.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4990, the ITS  Codification Act.   The Institute for Telecommunication Sciences, or ITS, is the premier  engineering laboratory of the National Telecommunications and  Information Administration, or NTIA. Amongst its many responsibilities,  ITS manages various technology development programs for NTIA and the  Department of Commerce and oversees cutting-edge studies concerning the  use of our country's airwaves. ITS has played a significant role in  furthering telecommunication advancements for our country's benefit.   H.R. 4990 recognizes the numerous contributions of ITS by providing  it with additional statutory authority. Specifically, under this  legislation, ITS will serve as the primary laboratory for the executive  branch of the Federal Government. It will be charged with studying the  use of innovative sharing technologies for our airwaves and improving  the interference tolerance of Federal systems operating with, or using,  Federal spectrum. The legislation also will allow the Assistant  Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information, acting  through the head of ITS, to enter into agreements needed to carry out  the functions of ITS.   This bill also requires the Assistant Secretary to establish an  initiative to support the development of emergency communication and  tracking technologies. These technologies would then be used to locate  individuals  [[Page H7185]]  trapped in areas where mobile connectivity may not be available due to  natural disasters or other devastating events.   I commend Representatives O'Halleran and Carter for their bipartisan  work on this bill. This is a good bill as it ensures that one of our  Nation's key telecommunications facilities has the necessary tools and  resources to not only continue to do its work but also expand its  activities, including by enhancing rescue efforts for Americans trapped  in disaster areas.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I look  forward to its consideration in the Senate.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would do the same. This is a  significant bill. I urge everyone to support it on a bipartisan basis,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1254, I call  up the bill (H.R. 3771) to amend the Public Health Service Act to  provide for research and improvement of cardiovascular health among the  South Asian population of the United States, and for other purposes,  and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and add extraneous material on H.R. 3771.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3771, the South Asian  Heart Health Awareness and Research Act of 2022. I thank Representative  [[Page H7186]]  Jayapal and the bill's bipartisan sponsors for their work on this  important piece of legislation.   Heart disease, Madam Speaker, claims a life in the United States  every 34 seconds. In 2020 alone, heart disease resulted in the deaths  of 697,000 Americans. These statistics, which are troubling by  themselves, are further shaped by systemic health disparities. Black  men have a 70 percent higher risk of heart failure compared to White  men, and Black women have a 50 percent higher risk compared to White  women. Heart disease is the leading cause of death among Hispanic men,  and for Hispanic women, heart disease is second only to cancer.   The South Asian community is also disproportionately impacted by this  deadly disease. While South Asians comprise 23 percent of the world's  population as of 2020, they carry approximately 60 percent of the  world's global burden of heart disease. The increased risk and  disproportionate impact that heart disease has on the South Asian- American community in this country is often obscured by the lack of  data specificity, as South Asian Americans are often grouped with other  Asian Americans.   So H.R. 3771 takes a multipronged approach to address these trends.  The legislation allows States to direct culturally appropriate  resources to communities that are disproportionately impacted by heart  disease through grants, with the goal of increasing awareness and  promoting prevention. The legislation also supports research efforts on  cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and other heart-related  ailments among at-risk populations.   H.R. 3771 is a bipartisan, commonsense approach to an undeniable  heart health and research gap for the South Asian-American community.  These important investments will ensure a greater understanding with  respect to individuals disproportionately at risk for heart-related  disease and will help in our efforts to address disparities in heart  health currently experienced by many Americans.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation.   I just want to thank Representative Jayapal, again, because, as you  know, Madam Speaker, I have a very large Asian-American community, and  many of them, particularly the healthcare providers, have pointed to  the problems disproportionately with heart disease.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal), who is the bill's  sponsor.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may to consume  to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Chu).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Let me just thank, again, Ms. Jayapal and others on a bipartisan  basis. This is a very important bill for my district in many areas  where we have a large South Asian community.   And one of the things that Ms. Chu mentioned was the data.  Oftentimes, we don't have the data, and just getting the information,  in itself, is going to be significant as a result of this bill. I ask  for support on both sides, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk that was  made in order by the rule.    Yes, I will be the designee in lieu of Ms. Sherrill.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the underlying  bill, H.R. 3771, and to offer an amendment that focuses on the impact  of COVID-19 on rates of heart disease in at-risk communities.   The COVID-19 pandemic has taken an immeasurable toll on the American  people. Over one million people have lost their lives, and countless  more will suffer long-term health impacts as a result of the disease.   There is an undeniable link between COVID-19 infections and ongoing  heart complications. A study published in Nature Medicine in February  of this year concluded the risk of heart problems 1 year after COVID-19  infection is substantial.   COVID-19 can indirectly attack the heart through lack of oxygen,  causing the heart to overwork and contributing to cell death and tissue  damage in the heart and other organs. It can also infect the heart's  muscle tissue, leading to tissue damage and inflammation, stress  cardiomyopathy, and blood clots.   And as a result, COVID-19 has only widened heart health disparities  around the country. During the pandemic, Black, Hispanic, and Asian  populations in the U.S. experienced a disproportionate rise in deaths  caused by heart disease.   This amendment directs the Secretary of HHS to enter into an  agreement with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and  Medicine, or another appropriate entity, to conduct a study on the  relationship between COVID-19 and rates of morbidity and mortality as a  result of heart disease in at-risk communities.   We must take steps now to understand the scope of the relationship  between COVID-19 and heart disease in our most vulnerable populations.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal), the sponsor of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I would urge support for the amendment,  as well as the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1256, I call  up the bill (H.R. 4040) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act  to extend telehealth flexibilities under the Medicare program, and for  other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and add extraneous material on H.R. 4040.    Madam, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 4040, the Advancing Telehealth Beyond  COVID-19 Act, bipartisan legislation, introduced by Representatives  Cheney and Dingell.   Over the course of this pandemic, telehealth has served as an  important tool for staying connected to care without increasing the  risk of exposure to COVID-19. And in the Medicare program, millions  have utilized telehealth for the first time during the pandemic, thanks  to actions taken early on by Congress and the administration.   When the pandemic was beginning to take hold in America, Congress  moved quickly to significantly expand access to telehealth for Medicaid  beneficiaries. And this was critically important because Medicare  beneficiaries are some of the most vulnerable to COVID-19.   The waiver of Medicare's originating site and geographic restrictions  during the public health emergency has allowed millions of Medicare  beneficiaries nationwide to receive telehealth services, including  audio-only services, without ever having to leave their homes.   Now, the Energy and Commerce Committee has a long history of working  to expand access to telehealth services in the Medicare program. For  example, the SUPPORT Act expanded access to substance use disorder  services delivered via telehealth.   The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 permanently expanded  access to telemental health services and Medicare. And most recently,  the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 extended key telehealth  flexibilities for an additional 5 months after the end of the public  health emergency.   So H.R. 4040 builds on the bipartisan telehealth extension included  in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022. The bill extends the  same key telehealth flexibilities as the previous legislation, but now  would extend them until December 31, 2024, essentially 2 more years.  And this longer-term extension will provide beneficiaries and  stakeholders with more certainty.   It will also give policymakers time to assess the impact expanded  telehealth services have had on the Medicare program and on  beneficiaries' health and well-being, and the quality of care that they  are receiving.   So I thank the many Energy and Commerce Committee members who have  been leaders on this issue over the years, such as Representatives  Dingell, Eshoo, Matsui, Welch, Blunt-Rochester, Kelly, and many more.   And I also commend Representative Cheney and Dingell for their  bipartisan leadership on this legislation today.   I look forward to working with all Members on a permanent solution to  address telehealth coverage under Medicare but, in the meantime, this  multi-year extension is critical for preserving access to telehealth  services.   The language included in the bill is the same bipartisan language  previously negotiated by the House and Senate committees and the bill-- and I stress, Madam Speaker, that the bill is fully paid for.   So I hope we can, once again, extend these flexibilities with strong  bipartisan support.   I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. Cheney).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1  minute.    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers at this  time. We may have one more, but not at this time. I reserve the balance  of my time.     Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, but I think  Republicans may have additional speakers.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Since I heard every Republican who spoke say that they support the  bill, I was certainly reluctant to suggest that we would have any kind  of significant debate about the bill. I generally feel that if I have  both sides of the aisle saying it is a good bill, I should leave well  enough alone.   But I do want to say this in response to some of the comments that  were made by the Republican Members. We were reluctant in the committee  to move to have permanent authorization of the telehealth flexibility  expansion for several reasons.   First of all, it is expensive. In other words, the Congressional  Budget Office scored this bill. As I said, the bill for the 2 years is  paid for. If you wanted to go permanent, I think they would have said  that we needed another $20 billion. I feel very strongly that the bill  should be paid for. That is part of what we believe as Democrats. We  were able to get agreement with the Republicans on a pay-for for the 2  years, so that was a factor as to why it is for 2 years instead of  permanent.   Beyond that, and more importantly, really, is the fact that a  permanent expansion is a major change. I think it needs a lot of study,  a lot of oversight and investigation. One of the things that I  mentioned in Rules is that both HHS and the inspector general have been  tasked to report back to us this spring with a report on a lot of the  things that were mentioned here today, integrity issues, in terms of  fraud and abuse, that were mentioned by both sides of the aisle.   I think the feeling of the committee was that this was something that  needed more study before we went ahead and made this permanent. That is  what we do. In other words, right now, the concern is that because the  omnibus appropriations bill basically expanded the telehealth program  until 5 months after the public health emergency for COVID ends, that  would take us to the end of this year. But we don't have a lot of  legislative days left. We figured the best thing was to at least extend  it for another 2 years. We can pay for it, as was mentioned by Ms.  Cheney.   This, I think, is the best way to resolve this: Do a 2-year extend,  pay for it, and let's spend the time between now and next spring having  some more hearings and opportunities to talk about a further extension  or possibly making it permanent.   Again, I appreciate the fact that everyone on the Republican side  supports the bill, but I do want to address some of the things that you  mentioned.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
