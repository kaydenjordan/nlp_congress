 Mr. Speaker, I am glad we are talking about criminals, but  I  [[Page H2880]]  want to point out one that potentially has been in the White House. He  was a general. He spoke at the national convention of the Republican  Party. He said, ``Lock her up.''   But when he filled out his disclosure form to work in the White  House, he conveniently left out that he received money from two foreign  governments. A former general who defended this Nation did not fill out  that he received this money. He sat next to Vladimir Putin for dinner,  but did not fill this form out properly.   Mr. Speaker, we are very concerned about Mike Flynn. It is obvious  that we in the House of Representatives do something to point out when  we see something that is illegal going on.   Mr. Speaker, what comes around goes around. He said, ``Lock her up.''  Well, it looks like he might get locked up.   And that is the way it is gonna be.                            ____________________
