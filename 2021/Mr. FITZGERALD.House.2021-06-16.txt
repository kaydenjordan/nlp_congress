 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1187.  This legislation would impose unnecessary and expensive compliance  costs on publicly traded companies.   Publicly traded companies are already subject to extensive  disclosures regarding various risk factors under Federal law. These  existing disclosures must already reflect material climate change  information, such as compliance with greenhouse gas emissions and  carbon offsets.   I am concerned this bill would do little to provide information on  how climate change would affect a particular investment, but would  instead be used by activist shareholders with no real duty to a company  or its shareholders to impose progressive political views on that  company.   The burden of these costs would fall largely on smaller public  companies with fewer resources. The burden of these costs would, again,  I think, put this entire issue off in a different direction than where  it should be.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the bill. It would only benefit  large incumbent corporations while others may avoid going public  altogether, limiting their growth.                                time  1315
