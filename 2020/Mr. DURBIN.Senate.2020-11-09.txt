 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, before I make my remarks, I want to take  a moment on the floor of the Senate to formally and officially thank  the people of the State of Illinois for electing me to another term in  the U.S. Senate.   On election night, when the results were apparent, I went and stared  into an iPad to announce my victory speech. It was unlike anything I  had ever been through in a campaign, and I said so. It was an  extraordinary campaign experience, made even more difficult and  challenging because of the pandemic crisis. I want to thank the people  of the State for standing by me and giving me this chance to serve  again.   I am honored to serve my State in this body, especially during this  time of transition in America and transition around the world.  Together, with a trust in science with the Biden-Harris administration,  we will return to our national agenda. I am eager to continue working  to help the families, small businesses, schools, hospitals, and  constituents in my State and to help all of us in this country endure  this pandemic together.    I announce that the Senator from Washington (Ms.  Cantwell), the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Cardin), the Senator from  Nevada (Ms. Cortez Masto), the Senator from California (Ms. Harris),  the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Heinrich), the Senator from Washington  (Mrs. Murray), the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Schatz), the Senator from  Arizona (Ms. Sinema), and the Senator from Montana (Mr. Tester) are  necessarily absent.   The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 62, nays 23, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 225 Ex.]                                  YEAS--62       Barrasso      Blackburn      Blunt      Boozman      Braun      Brown      Burr      Capito      Carper      Cassidy      Collins      Coons      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Enzi      Ernst      Feinstein      Fischer      Gardner      Graham      Grassley      Hassan      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Jones      Kaine      Kennedy      Lankford      Leahy      Lee      Loeffler      Manchin      McConnell      McSally      Murkowski      Murphy      Paul      Perdue      Peters      Portman      Reed      Risch      Roberts      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shaheen      Shelby      Thune      Tillis      Toomey      Warner      Whitehouse      Wicker                                  NAYS--23       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Casey      Duckworth      Durbin      Gillibrand      Hirono      King      Klobuchar      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Rosen      Sanders      Schumer      Smith      Stabenow      Udall      Van Hollen      Warren      Wyden                               NOT VOTING--15       Alexander      Cantwell      Cardin      Cortez Masto      Daines      Harris      Hawley      Heinrich      Moran      Murray      Schatz      Sinema      Sullivan      Tester      Young
