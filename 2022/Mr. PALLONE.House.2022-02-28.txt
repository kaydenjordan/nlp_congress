 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 854) to designate methamphetamine as an emerging threat, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 854         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Methamphetamine Response Act       of 2021''.       SEC. 2. DECLARATION OF EMERGING THREAT.         (a) In General.--Congress declares methamphetamine an       emerging drug threat, as defined in section 702 of the Office       of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998       (21 U.S.C. 1701), in the United States.        (b) Required Emerging Threat Response Plan.--Not later than       90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Director       of the Office of National Drug Control Policy shall establish       and implement an Emerging Threat Response Plan that is       specific to methamphetamine in accordance with section 709(d)       of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization       Act of 1998 (21 U.S.C. 1708(d)).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 854.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  [[Page H1157]]    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 854, the Methamphetamine  Response Act of 2021.   Today, our Nation continues to face a devastating epidemic of  substance use and overdose deaths, an epidemic that has only been  exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, we have  surpassed the tragic milestone of 100,000 drug overdose deaths in a 1- year period.   Although opioids account for a significant number of overdose deaths,  methamphetamine overdoses have been rising at alarming rates in recent  years. Recent data from the National Institutes of Health found that  methamphetamine overdose deaths nearly tripled from 2015 to 2019.   Further, the Drug Enforcement Administration reports that  methamphetamine continues to be readily available throughout the United  States. In 2019, the DEA seized over 53,000 kilograms of  methamphetamine. That was a 55 percent increase over 2018. Recent data  also suggests that seizures of methamphetamine have increased during  the pandemic. The threat of this drug is compounded by the common  mixing, or cutting, of drugs, such as cocaine, with methamphetamine.   To address the widespread availability and the shocking increases in  methamphetamine-involved overdose deaths, this legislation would  designate methamphetamine as an emerging drug threat.   By making this designation, Mr. Speaker, S. 854 would require the  Office of National Drug Control Policy to implement a methamphetamine  response plan. As part of this plan, ONDCP and partner agencies would  develop a comprehensive assessment of the emerging drug threat,  establish quantifiable goals to combat the threat, implement  performance measures, and identify the funding levels needed to  implement the plan.   The House companion of this bill was considered and passed by the  Energy and Commerce Committee with bipartisan support in July of last  year. I commend the sponsors of the House companion, Representatives  Peters and Curtis, for their leadership.   This legislation is another step forward in our ongoing efforts to  end the substance use epidemic that is devastating our families and  communities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 854, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill, which is  bipartisan, so we can send it to the President. I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 1543) to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide best  practices on student suicide awareness and prevention training and  condition State educational agencies, local educational agencies, and  Tribal educational agencies receiving funds under section 520A of such  Act to establish and implement a school-based student suicide awareness  and prevention training policy.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1543         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Suicide Training and       Awareness Nationally Delivered for Universal Prevention Act       of 2021'' or the ``STANDUP Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. STUDENT SUICIDE AWARENESS AND PREVENTION TRAINING.         (a) In General.--Title V of the Public Health Service Act       is amended by inserting after section 520A of such Act (42       U.S.C. 290bb-32) the following:       ``SEC. 520B.

SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.         The amendment made by this Act shall apply only with       respect to applications for assistance under section 520A of       the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290bb-32) that are       submitted after the date of enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S. 1543.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1543, the Suicide Training  and Awareness Nationally Delivered for Universal Prevention Act, also  known as the STANDUP Act.   Americans are facing a growing mental health crisis, and that crisis  is hitting our Nation's youth particularly hard right now. While the  challenges of COVID-19 amplified this crisis, children and young people  in the U.S. have been experiencing rising rates of mental health  conditions and suicide for years, particularly among youth of color and  LGBTQI+ young people.   Between 2008 and 2018, the suicide rate among adolescents and young  people increased by nearly 60 percent. Today, Mr. Speaker, suicide is  the second leading cause of death among children and young people  between the ages of 10 and 24.   Black youth are nearly twice as likely as White youth to die by  suicide, and the rate of suicide amongst American Indian and Alaska  Native youth is 2\1/2\ times the overall national average. Meanwhile,  the suicide rate among young Hispanic women increased dramatically in  the decade leading up to the pandemic.   Additionally, LGBTQI+ youth are at greater risk for depression and  suicide. According to a 2020 survey, 50 percent of LGBTQ youth  considered attempting suicide in the prior year.   All of these trends are alarming, so much so that pediatric experts  have declared the state of children's mental health a national  emergency. Last December, Surgeon General Murthy issued an advisory on  the youth mental health crisis.   Today, the House is continuing its critical work of considering  legislation to address the crisis. The STANDUP Act would require State  and Tribal education agencies to establish and implement a suicide  awareness and prevention training policy for middle- and high-school  students. The policy would be required for any agency receiving funding  through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,  or SAMHSA's Project AWARE funds, and it would need to be evidence  based, as well as culturally and linguistically appropriate.                                time  1530    Last May, Mr. Speaker, we passed the House companion of this bill  with bipartisan support here on the House floor after it passed out of  the Energy and Commerce Committee last Congress. I commend the lead  House sponsors of the bill, Representatives Peters and Bilirakis, for  their leadership on this issue.   As chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I strongly support  legislation that will help bring awareness and promote best practices  on suicide prevention among our Nation's youth.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 1543, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill. It is  bipartisan, and again, we would be sending it to the President with our  action today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 1662) to increase funding for the Reagan-Udall Foundation for  the Food and Drug Administration and for the Foundation for the  National Institutes of Health.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1662         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Supporting the Foundation       for the National Institutes of Health and the Reagan-Udall       Foundation for the Food and Drug Administration Act''.       SEC. 2. REAGAN-UDALL FOUNDATION AND FOUNDATION FOR THE                     NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH.         (a) Reagan-Udall Foundation for the Food and Drug       Administration.--Section 770(n) of the Federal Food, Drug,       and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 379dd(n)) is amended by striking       ``$500,000 and not more than $1,250,000'' and inserting       ``$1,250,000 and not more than $5,000,000''.        (b) Foundation for the National Institutes of Health.--      Section 499(l) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C.       290b(l)) is amended by striking ``$500,000 and not more than       $1,250,000'' and inserting ``$1,250,000 and not more than       $5,000,000''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 1662.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of S. 1662, the Supporting the Foundation for  the National Institutes of Health and the Reagan-Udall Foundation for  the Food and Drug Administration Act.   In December, this Chamber considered and passed the House companion  [[Page H1160]]  of this legislation by a vote of 374-52. Earlier in the year, the  legislation advanced out of the Energy and Commerce Committee, where it  garnered bipartisan support.   I commend the House bill's sponsors, Health Subcommittee Chairwoman  Eshoo and Representative Hudson, for their strong leadership and  commitment to this bill.   The Foundation for the NIH is an independent nonprofit organization  established by Congress in 1990 to develop private-public partnerships  and advance American leadership in biomedical research.   Likewise, the Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA was established by  Congress in 2007 to advance the mission of the FDA and catalyze  innovation, modernize medical product development, and improve safety.   The NIH and FDA are authorized to transfer funding to their  respective foundations, but that limit has not been increased since  2007.   This bill, S. 1662, would increase the transfer authority for both  foundations, allowing the foundations to continue and expand upon the  important work they have been doing. For example, during the COVID-19  pandemic, they have done important work to enhance the FDA and NIH's  work on COVID-19 vaccines and diagnostics.   This bill will help build upon our ongoing efforts to advance  biomedical research and promote better public health outcomes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 1662, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, there is bipartisan support for this  bill, which I also believe would be going to the President, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
