 Mr. President, before the Senator from Arizona leaves the  floor, he and I are very much in syncopation on the question of what he  has just eloquently addressed about the Russian attempts to interfere  in other countries as well as in our country with regard to the  elections.   I just wanted to pose a question to the Senator. Is the Senator  aware, as he obviously is--but it is my rhetorical question--that the  Russians have already intervened in the elections of other countries  and indeed tried and it boomeranged against them against France and are  probably in the midst of trying to interfere with the German election?   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, every indication, I would say to my friend  from Florida, a most valued member of the Armed Services Committee,  they will continue to try to interfere in any election they possibly  can. They are spending large amounts of money. They have certainly, to  some degree, undermined confidence between countries in the NATO  alliance, and that, coupled with the degree of uncertainty here in  Washington, has probably put as great a strain on the NATO alliance as  you have seen since its very beginning. I thank my colleague from  Florida.

I thank my colleague from  Florida.    Mr. President, one further question. Has the Senator  been--well, he obviously is aware, and he has obviously been briefed-- but can he help convey the gravity of the situation of Russia's  interference in the upcoming elections in 2018 and 2020, where not only  is it a question of whether they would change the vote count by getting  in and hacking, but they could change the registration records so that  a voter could show up to vote on election day and suddenly the  registrar says: But you are not registered.   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would just say to my colleague from  Florida that when you look at their early attempts versus their latest  attempts, they learn with every experience. It is a lot easier--as my  colleague from Florida knows, it is a lot easier to play offense than  defense.   We are going to have a hearing on this whole Montenegrin thing, and I  know the Senator from Florida will play a very significant role. Every  time we turn around, we have a new revelation of some of the activities  that have been carried out, not just by Russian hackers but by Chinese,  by Iranian, even by single individuals. This is probably the national  security challenge that may not be the greatest, but I would say we are  the least prepared for.    Mr. President, this Senator certainly looks forward to  that hearing in the Senate Armed Services Committee. I thank the  chairman for his leadership in constantly bringing up and reminding the  American people of the threat that is coming through cyber attacks into  this Nation and others.
