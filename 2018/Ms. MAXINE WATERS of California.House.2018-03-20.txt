 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  to modify amendment No. 1 printed in House Report 115-613 with the  modification placed at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose H.R. 4566, the so-called Alleviating  Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors Act, which would make it harder  for regulators to identify and mitigate hidden systemic risks at  nonbank financial companies before they undermine our economy.   Last Wednesday marked 10 years since global investment bank Bear  Stearns imploded as a result of its failure to manage risk associated  with its highly leveraged balance sheet and exposure to the subprime  mortgage market. American taxpayers were forced to come to the rescue  to prevent the firm's collapse from spreading to other overleveraged  Wall Street institutions.   The demise of Bear Stearns was the canary in the coal mine for the  ensuing financial crisis, which ravaged the United States economy,  destroyed trillions of dollars of wealth, and put millions of Americans  out of their jobs and their homes.   Democrats responded to the 2008 financial crisis by passing the Dodd- Frank Act, which, among other reforms, required rigorous stress tests  of the Nation's largest financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act also  gave the Federal Reserve Board the discretion to quickly intervene and  stress-test firms that could pose financial stability risk.   If regular stress testing had been conducted on firms like Bear  Stearns from 2006 to 2008, it might have revealed major threats to the  economy sooner, giving both the companies and Federal financial  regulators a better chance to take remedial action to avoid a  catastrophic near collapse of the global financial system.   H.R. 4566 would eliminate the Federal Reserve's authority to stress- test nonbank financial companies, even in situations where the firm's  designation as systemically important is pending before the Financial  Stability Oversight Council, FSOC.   Additionally, the bill would weaken the Dodd-Frank mandate that large  financial companies under the SEC and CFTC's purview conduct internal  stress tests to determine the company's ability to withstand a  recession.   Combined, these rollbacks would allow the Bear Stearns of the world  to take on increasing amounts of risk while regulators are tied up in  lengthy administrative processes.   As former SEC Chair Mary Jo White stated in a December 2014 speech:  ``Stress testing is an important tool routinely used by banking  regulators. Implementing this new mandate in asset management, while  relatively novel, will help market participation and the Commission  better understand the potential impact of stress events.''   I agree with Chair White's comments about the importance of stress  testing and think that it simply does not make sound public policy to  eliminate this tool.   Members of the asset management industry have also recognized that  stress testing is critical to effectively managing risk. In a 2015  letter to the SEC, the Asset Management Group of the Securities  Industry and Financial Markets Association, that is SIFMA AMG, whose  members manage more than $30 trillion in assets, wrote: ``Stress  testing is one part of an effective and coherent risk management  process for asset managers, the objective of which is not to test for  solvency or capital adequacy, but to complement other approaches in  assessing investment risk.''   In fact, in a 2015 survey of SIFMA AMG members, nearly two-thirds of  the asset managers surveyed reported that they already stress-test  their funds. It seems imprudent that Congress would repeal a  requirement for large interconnected hedge funds that may have 15-to-1  leverage to periodically determine whether they could withstand a down  economy.   Moreover, given how rapidly failures at large nonbank financial  companies can spread across the highly interconnected financial system,  regulators must be able to quickly identify problems that could  undermine U.S. financial stability. The Federal Reserve should continue  to have the discretionary authority to step in to identify and mitigate  systemic risk at any financial company whose failure could pose a  threat to our economy.   H.R. 4566 appears to ignore that nonbank financial companies like  Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG played a central role in the  financial crisis. When these firms collapsed as a result of their  failure to mitigate their own internal risk, their losses sent  shockwaves throughout the banking system.   Stress testing these kinds of nonbank financial institutions provides  a valuable early warning system for our economy and gives both the  companies and regulators a chance to correct problems before they have  catastrophic effects on our financial stability. That is why I intend  to offer an amendment that, if adopted, would restore the Fed's  discretionary authority to stress test any nonbank, provided that the  test meet certain conditions, including approval by a majority of FSOC  members. It would also allow the Fed to use alternatives to capital, as  appropriate, when stress-testing systemically important nonbanks and  broaden the SEC's and CFTC's authority to require internal testing for  entities under their purview.   This amendment would ensure that large financial institutions, like  investment companies that manage trillions of dollars of hardworking  Americans' retirement savings, can be appropriately evaluated for their  ability to survive in a stressed economy.   While I oppose H.R. 4566 in its current form, I would support an  amended version of the bill that preserves the bill's ability to  identify and mitigate future systemic risk at nonbanks before they lead  to another crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank my colleagues on the opposite side  of the aisle and my chairman, Mr. Hensarling, for indicating their  acceptance of the amendment.   I think it is extremely important for both sides of the aisle to  appreciate the necessity and the importance of stress testing, and I  think we both do that. The discretion that we afford to the Feds in  this bill, I think, is very important. So this is one of those  instances when both sides can come together and recognize that there  were important indications of what is needed to understand what should  be done to avoid another meltdown in our financial services industries  and our banks.   Again, I don't think there is any need for us to continue to talk  about what we don't like about stress testing, but, rather, we are  coming together to talk about how it is done and why it is important. I  have a great appreciation for that, and I would like to thank my  colleagues for that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased about the work that staff has done on  this particular legislation.   I do believe that we all agree that stress tests are important; it is  a matter of who, how, and when.   Someone has likened stress tests to car testing, where, in the  manufacture of new cars, you take them out on the road and you test  them to see if they can withstand what they may be presented with in  the terrain and with the kind of things that you would experience  perhaps on the roughest roads that they test on. When they determine  that there are weaknesses that can be corrected, that is what they do  in order to make sure that this new vehicle that they are testing can  withstand whatever the difficulties are that may be presented to them  when they test a car.   That is what this stress testing is all about. It all about whether  or not, in the event of a downturn in our economy, you have the ability  to withstand the downturn, whether or not you have the ability to not  only withstand what you are presented with in a downturn of the  economy, but how you can fix what you have determined is wrong with  what you are doing.   So I am, again, very pleased that we all agree that stress testing is  extremely important and that we know what your concerns are about hedge  fund and asset managers and all of that. But the discretion that we  give to the Feds, I think, is very important. The fact that all of the  businesses that we are concerned with will be doing their internal  stress testing is extremely important.   So, again, I am very grateful for the acceptance of my amendment, and  I am hopeful that, with this amendment, it demonstrates that, when we  work very hard to reconcile our differences, we can do that.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask that, with this amendment, all of the  Members of the House vote for this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at  the desk made in order under the rule.    Mr. Speaker, in its current form,  H.R. 4566 eliminates the Fed's discretion to require stress testing on  nonbanks that have not yet been designated as systemically important  and weakens the Dodd-Frank Act's mandate that the SEC and CFTC require  nonbank financial companies under their authority to conduct annual  stress tests. Together, these repeals create a loophole that would  allow large brokerage firms and mega insurance companies to ignore  risks while regulators are tied up in lengthy rulemaking or the FSOC  designation process.   My amendment, if adopted, would restore the Fed's discretionary  authority to stress-test any nonbank financial firm, provided that the  test is requested by a majority vote of the FSOC, is conducted with  consideration of the company's business model, and is not already  required by the company's primary regulator.   My amendment would also allow the Fed to consider alternatives to the  existing capital adequacy test, where appropriate, when conducting  stress tests on nonbanks, including those designated as systemically  important.   One of the key safeguards created by Dodd-Frank is the Fed's ability  to identify and mitigate risks in the financial system before they  undermine the U.S. economy. By preserving the Fed's ability to stress- test nonbank financial companies on a discretionary basis, my amendment  will give regulators a better chance of preventing the next Bear  Stearns or Lehman Brothers from dragging down our financial system.   Finally, my amendment would broaden the SEC's and CFTC's authority  under the bill by striking the provision that would limit future  company-run stress testing requirements to entities with more than $10  billion in assets. This would ensure that the SEC and CFTC can require  any financial company under their purview to evaluate their own ability  to survive in a stressed economy.   While I oppose H.R. 4566 as currently drafted, with this amendment,  the bill would represent a truly bipartisan effort to strengthen Dodd- Frank. Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on my  amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for those kind words, and I yield back the balance of my time.
