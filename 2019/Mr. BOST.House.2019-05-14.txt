 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 299, the Blue  Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act.   I am a marine and a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Caring  for our Nation's men and women who have served is a top priority for me  and for my staff and, I know, for the members of this committee. They  should have peace of mind knowing that they will be cared for by this  grateful Nation.   I have had many veterans come into my office with health problems.  Sometimes they can't pinpoint the problem at all, but all too often  they can if they served in Vietnam: It is exposure to Agent Orange.   We now have 100,000 Navy veterans who served on ships during the  Vietnam war and later became ill from their service due to exposure to  Agent Orange. Unfortunately, without this legislation, they do not  qualify for the same benefits as their fellow veterans who served on  the ground.   We must do better. Today's legislation is a step forward in the right  direction. This critical legislation ensures they receive benefits for  any condition they may have developed as a result of exposure to Agent  Orange. It is a bipartisan bill, and it puts our veterans first.   As has been mentioned before, we passed this bill to the Senate last  Congress. Unfortunately, the Senate did not, and was not, able to take  it up. My hope and my prayer is that we pass this quickly, that it goes  to the Senate, that they quickly do their job, and that, with that, we  can get it to this President's desk, get it signed, and take care of  these veterans who deserve it and have waited so long.
