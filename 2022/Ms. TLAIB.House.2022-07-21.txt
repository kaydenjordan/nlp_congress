 Madam Speaker, today, I recognize the Liberian Association  of Michigan as they gather to celebrate the 175th anniversary of  Liberia's independence and the contributions of Liberian Americans to  Michigan's 13th District Strong.   Founded in 1971, the Liberian Association of Michigan remains  grounded in their mission to provide assistance to those in need and to  preserve Liberia's cultural heritage in our communities.   Beyond hosting numerous charitable events, the association is ``doing  the right thing for the right reason'' in its outreach as well as in  its support to our recent immigrants to our country. The association  and its members have created a welcoming space for new residents while  providing social and economic support.   I commend their incredibly valuable work, and I am so proud to  support them in their anniversary and their work.   Please join me in recognizing the Liberian Association of Michigan as  they celebrate 50 years of service, culture, and kinship across  Michigan's 13th Congressional District.                            ____________________
