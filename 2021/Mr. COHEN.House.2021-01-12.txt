 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Last Wednesday, I came to these hallowed Halls where I serve to watch  the electoral college ratify and certify the election of Joe Biden in  what was a fair, transparent election, which 61 courts had looked into,  and all said it was fine. I was sitting right up there in the gallery  when a Capitol Policeman came in and said: We are locking the doors. We  are locking the doors.   And within only minutes of that, I heard the rabble knocking on the  door, trying to knock it down. We were then told to put on our gas  masks and to evacuate, and we all did it.   This was an assault on the Constitution, an assault on Congress. It  was a felonious assault. It was an attempt to murder the Congress and  our processes to elect our President of the United States. It is the  political equivalent of shooting somebody on Fifth Avenue and getting  away with it.   Somebody needs to stand up to that, and the 25th Amendment is one way  to do it, whether Republicans can purge themselves of their own  creation who has damaged this country.    I ask us to pass this resolution, bring this country  together, and get rid of this cancer.
