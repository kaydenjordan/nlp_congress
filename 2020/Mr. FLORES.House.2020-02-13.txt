 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Stephen A.  Holditch of College Station, Texas, who passed away unexpectedly on  August 9, 2019.   Before I continue our discussion about Steve, I want to give some  context about the importance of his professional career.   Let me state, first, that Steve considered his roles as a husband, a  father, and a grandfather to be his most important. Because of the  exceptional way that he lived those roles, his legacy is readily  apparent in the lives of those he left behind--his wife, Ann; his  daughters, Katie and Abbie; and their five grandchildren.   The discussion of his professional accomplishments starts with a  description of current energy metrics.   Today, the United States of America is blessed to be the number one  producer of oil and gas in the world. As of this year, we are a net  exporter of oil and natural gas. Reserves of American oil and natural  gas rank us among the top 10 countries in the world. We also lead the  industrialized world in the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions over  the last two decades.                                time  1245    Ten years ago, no one would have ever predicted that we would be  where we are today.   This new world of American energy dominance is having dramatic  implications, both domestically and internationally. We have secure,  stable, environmentally responsible, and attractively-priced energy  sources for American families and businesses. We have become a reliable  source of energy for our allies, giving them flexibility to move away  from unstable Russian and Middle Eastern energy suppliers.   The oil and gas sector of our economy has created millions of good  jobs and great paychecks for hardworking Americans. Our balance of  trade payments has improved, and our geopolitical position has  strengthened.   This dramatic energy renaissance didn't happen by accident or because  of government. It is because of the result of American ingenuity,  research, and bold leadership. While no one person is solely  responsible for this seismic shift in American energy, there are a  number of bold leaders who took these challenges that looked impossible  to solve and then solved them; particularly in the area of stimulation  of low permeability, or ``tight'' reservoirs. Their developments,  studies, research, and field experiments using horizontal drilling and  very large hydraulic fracturing treatments revolutionized American oil  and natural gas and transformed our economy and our security.   One of those bold leaders was the late George P. Mitchell, Texas A&M  Class of 1940. Another is the person that we are honoring today, Dr.  Stephen A. Holditch, Texas A&M Class of 1969.   Stephen Holditch was born on October 20, 1946, in Corsicana, Texas,  to Damon and Margie Holditch. Growing up, Steve and his family moved  often while his father pursued a career in the oil and gas industry. He  spent most of his childhood in San Antonio before moving to Richardson,  Texas for his final year of high school, where he graduated in 1965.   Following graduation, Steve attended Texas A&M University, where he  joined the Corps of Cadets and began his journey as a Fighting Texas  Aggie. Steve quickly excelled, both in academics and in the Corps of  Cadets. While at A&M, he was a member of Company F-1, a member of the  prestigious Ross Volunteers Honor Guard, and a member of the Ross  Volunteers Firing Squad. During his senior year, he served as Second  Battalion Commander.  [[Page H1151]]    In 1969, Steve graduated from A&M with a bachelor of science degree  in petroleum engineering. He continued at A&M to earn a master's degree  in the same discipline.   Steve began his career with Shell Oil Company in Houston, Texas. Much  of his work over his 5 years at Shell was focused on designing and  pumping large hydraulic fracture treatments to stimulate production  from the deep, low permeability, geopressured gas reservoirs in South  Texas.   It was his work with hydraulic fracturing that inspired him to return  to Texas A&M and that set him apart from his peers as a true legend in  the oil and gas industry for the advancement of this critically  important technology.   One day in 1970, Steve was riding the elevator at work and met Ann  Friddle, who was also working at Shell. Steve and Ann were married 6  months later, on January 9, 1971, and they had been married for over 48  years when he passed away.   He and Ann returned to College Station, and he pursued a Ph.D. in  petroleum engineering, which he completed in 1975. In 1976, Steve  joined the Texas A&M petroleum engineering faculty and, as if he didn't  have enough to do as a young father and as a new professor, he started  his own consulting company, S.A. Holditch & Associates.   S.A. Holditch & Associates quickly became a worldwide powerhouse in  the petroleum engineering space. Over the years, Steve earned a  reputation for being able to solve the most difficult petroleum  engineering problems, especially those dealing with low permeability  reservoirs needing stimulation, typically through hydraulic fracturing.   He was distinctly proud of the work Holditch & Associates did  alongside the Gas Research Institute to advance understanding of low  permeability sandstones, shales, and coalbed methane.   After over 20 years of success, Steve chose to sell Holditch &  Associates to Schlumberger, where he stayed on as a fellow, the highest  technical designation in that organization. As a Schlumberger fellow  for 5 years, Steve traveled extensively to help solve some of the  world's most difficult petroleum engineering problems.   In 1995, at age 49, Steve was elected to the National Academy of  Engineering, the highest honor that can be given to an engineer. After  many years of service to the Society of Petroleum Engineers, or the  SPE, Steve was elected to the board of directors, then vice president  of finance, and finally president of this global organization with over  70,000 members.   He was awarded almost every recognition that SPE has to give,  including three of the society's top awards. He was elected as an SPE  honorary member in 2006, the highest award that SPE can bestow upon an  individual and was officially named a Legend of Hydraulic Fracturing by  SPE in 2014.   While Steve enjoyed many professional successes in the commercial  regime, many of his greatest accomplishments were at Texas A&M  University, where he served on the faculty for 37 years. During his  tenure, he taught 97 courses and served on over 150 graduate  committees.   From 2004-2012, Steve worked as head of the Harold Vance Department  of Petroleum Engineering. During this time, he revitalized the Crisman  Institute for Petroleum Research, and saw the number of students in the  petroleum engineering department more than double. Under his  leadership, the department quickly earned a reputation as the number  one ranked university petroleum engineering department in the world.   It was during his time at Texas A&M that he created his second legacy  for America's hydrocarbon industry; the thousands of Aggie petroleum  engineers who work around the world every day utilizing Steve's  teaching and mentoring to solve the world's greatest energy challenges.  Their work, alongside the work of other industry legends, like George  P. Mitchell and Michel T. Halbouty, along with Stephen Holditch, have  contributed significantly to America's energy dominance that is  changing the world today.    In 2013, Steve retired from the faculty after many years of dedicated  service to the Texas A&M community. Throughout his life, Steve often  credited Texas A&M University as the foundation from which his success  grew. He praised the values instilled in all Aggies and, in 2014, was  named a Texas A&M Distinguished Alumnus, an honor he richly deserved  for a life of service and devotion to his beloved university.   In thanking the Aggie community, Steve said: ``You will look back at  your years at Texas A&M as one of the best periods in your life. Always  remember the Aggie Code of Honor.''   In 2016, Steve was inducted into the Corps of Cadets Hall of Honor,  an award which made him prouder and happier than perhaps any award he  had received in his life.   While in retirement, Steve enjoyed spending time in Bryan-College  Station with his wife, Ann, their two daughters, and their five  grandchildren. As a season ticket holder to a variety of Texas A&M  sports, Steve continued to support the Aggies, but Fighting Texas Aggie  football remained closest to his heart.   Steve contributed a great deal to the Texas A&M community, and can be  described as a model Texas Aggie, who was true to his core values of  excellence, integrity, leadership, loyalty, respect, and selfless  service. One of my favorite phrases that Steve often used was: ``I  reserve the right to get smarter.'' That is what he did best, always  pushing to find solutions to the world's toughest oil and gas  challenges.   Madam Speaker, Steve's life was defined by his dedication to his  family and his friends, his world-changing accomplishments in energy,  and his true love of Texas A&M University. He will be forever  remembered as a true pioneer in his field, a devoted husband, a father,  a grandfather, a teacher, a mentor, and a friend.   My father has a saying: ``Go make a hand.''   Madam Speaker, Steve Holditch truly ``made a hand'' for his family,  his university, his community, our country, and our world.   My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest and heartfelt condolences to  the Holditch family. We also lift up the family and friends of Steve  Holditch in our prayers.   I have requested that the United States flag be flown over our  Nation's Capitol to honor the life and legacy of Dr. Stephen A.  Holditch.   As I close, I would ask all Americans to continue praying for our  country during these difficult times, for our military men and women  who protect us from threats abroad, and for our first responders who  keep us safe here at home.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
