 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I will also thank and say how grateful I am for the leadership of  Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Larsen on this comprehensive and  thoughtful bipartisan reauthorization.   Many of the priorities that I have authored made it into the bill,  including several provisions from my Safe Landings Act, like  identifying the need for airport surface surveillance and safety  systems and requiring data analysis of safety incidents.   I am also very appreciative that the amendment I spent a lot of time  on will be considered. I worked with pilots and other safety experts,  including a constituent and good friend, Captain ``Sully''  Sullenberger, the skilled pilot who safely navigated the landing on the  Hudson River and a long-time advocate and expert for aviation safety  who helped me with this amendment and strongly supports the proposal.  This amendment creates a Task Force on Human Factors in Aviation  Safety.   We know as technology changes--and the near miss that got me involved  in more of the aviation issues at SFO some years ago where we came  within 59 feet of having the largest aviation disaster in American  history--we are making sure that we are training the pilots in a way  that keeps them consistent with technology, and the great research on  neuroscience and human factors that is getting better all the time,  that we are using that to make sure that humans are integrated with the  latest technology.   The NTSB identified that human factors, specifically pilot fatigue,  have played roles in that 2017 incident and many near misses, so it is  important that this work gets done.   The aviation safety system will continue to be safe and amongst the  safest in the world if we continue to make sure that it is updated and  doesn't rest on its well-deserved laurels in the past.    Mr. Chair, these decisions in this reauthorization  will help provide that, and I thank the leadership for the extended  time.
