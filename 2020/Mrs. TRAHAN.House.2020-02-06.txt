 Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Virginia for  yielding and for his steady leadership on this issue.   Mr. Chairman, on Tuesday evening, the American people were treated to  a number of fairy-tale promises. But none was more preposterous than  the claim that the administration's agenda has been ``relentlessly  proworker.''   It has been relentless, all right. Relentlessly hostile to our  unions, particularly those seeking redress from the NLRB; relentless in  favoring corporate interests over working people, such as those  deliberately misclassified as contractors; and relentless in its  opposition to permitting employees the right to have their day in court  when their rights are violated.   The PRO Act is what a real proworker agenda looks like: It levels the  playing field for workers in organizing drives. It reorients the NLRB  to defend workers who are unfairly targeted. It blocks worker  misclassifications, and it demands real penalties for violations of  workers' rights.   I am pleased that the PRO Act includes my amendment to ban offensive  lockouts, a cruel technique designed to bring workers to their knees  rather than the negotiating table in good faith. The steelworkers in my  home State of Massachusetts know that cruel tactic all too well.   Mr. Chairman, as the daughter of a union ironworker and the  granddaughter of a union carpenter, I have experienced firsthand why  unions are the foundation of America's middle class. I have lived the  benefits that unions and organized labor bring to families across  Massachusetts and the United States.   I wouldn't be standing here today without them. And it is perfectly  clear why our unions must have their rights restored. Income inequality  has risen as union membership has declined. It is time to reverse that  trend.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from NETWORK Lobby for  Catholic Social Justice organization which endorses the PRO Act.                                          Network Lobby for Catholic                                                  Social Justice,                                   Washington, DC, February 6, 2020.        Dear Representative: NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social       Justice urges you to vote YES on the Protecting the Right to       Organize (PRO) Act (H.R. 2474). In the spirit of the Gospel,       we promote a just society which ensures that all people are       able to live dignified lives. According to Catholic Social       Justice, labor ``maintains the fabric of the world.'' We are       called to recognize the value of people's human labor,       thereby honoring  [[Page H887]]       the dignity of work as a path to growth, human development,       and personal fulfillment. The PRO Act does just that by       restoring workers' rights to collectively bargain, empowering       them to negotiate for fair wages, benefits, retirement       security, and protection from discrimination and harassment.       We urge a YES vote on the PRO Act to achieve fairness and       justice for disenfranchised working people.        Labor union participation has fallen precipitously over the       years: from a third of wage and salaried workers in the       United States to just 10.7 percent, as of 2017. Protecting       the right to freely associate and organize at the workplace       has been proven to help settle workplace disputes by       restoring the balance of bargaining power between employers       and employees. Workers and employers alike benefit from the       institution of labor protections through unions. Disputes can       be settled unfairly when the power differential between the       employer and employee goes unchecked. Without the power of       collective bargaining, workers' voices go unheard and       workers' concerns go unheeded. When Congress passed the       National Labor Relations Act in 1953, they knew this.       However, nearly every amendment to the law since has       undermined its spirit--making it harder for working people to       form unions, chipping away at workers's rights, and harming       the economy. The PRO Act would expand the full force of       protections once offered by the NRLA.        The PRO Act would: shield workers from retaliation when       they exercise their right to form a union, end mandatory       arbritration in contracting, and apply a clear, fair standard       of protection nationwide which ``right to work'' laws       currently sidestep.        The PRO Act would also: prevent further erosion of the law       by penalizing employers that don't comply, and apply simple       tests to end misclassification of employees.        The PRO Act is a historic proposal that faithfully restores       dignity to workers and rightly appraises their value as full       participants in the workplace and in the economy. We urge you       to vote YES to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act       (H.R. 2474).     Mr. Chair, it is time to pass the PRO Act.
