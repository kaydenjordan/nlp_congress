 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman of  the January 6 Select Committee for yielding.   I serve as the chair of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and  Homeland Security, which, collectively with the Judiciary Committee,  may ultimately be addressing the legislative aspect of what we are here  for.   In particular, Mr. Speaker, this is a very sad day. I served with our  former colleague, Mr. Meadows, a Member of the United States Congress.  I believe that it was a number of years that he rose and took an oath  to the Constitution of the United States of America.                                time  1230    In that oath he should have recognized the fact that the Article I  body which we stand in today indicates that all legislative powers  herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States,  which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.   All legislative powers. In order to have legislative powers, one must  have the facts. That is what is being asked for today.   I think the American people need to understand that although there  may be many concerns--I am from Texas as well; I know the border is not  in crisis. It should be addressed. We as Texans know how to address it,  and President Biden and Vice President Harris know how to address it,  as other Presidents have. People are fleeing for their lives.   But our Constitution says of the Congress ``to make all Laws which  shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing  powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the  Government of the United States, or in any department or officer  thereof.''   We are vested with a lot of powers. One of them is to be able to find  the truth, to determine how we preserve our democracy, and how we need  to legislate to do so. So I stand on the Constitution as I proceed with  why we should move forward.   Again, this is a very sad day, but Mark Randall Meadows, former White  House chief of staff, had a part in the perpetration of the big lie of  the election fraud, and we must investigate it. Mr. Meadows was one of  a relatively small group of people who witnessed the events of January  6 in the White House with the former President. He was there. Firsthand  knowledge.   Some of these that I will recite have already been recited, but they  are only a small measure with the huge bounty of documents that he and  his lawyer consented to give to this committee. Consented to give.  Consented to give. Voluntarily.   And so one must understand that when you do that, there is a question  of waiver of the so-called alleged privilege that you are alleging, the  executive privilege. But the courts have already indicated that the  privilege lies with the existing President, not the former President.   With that in mind, should we not recognize that the very allies, the  media allies of the President--the former President, Laura Ingraham  said to Mark, ``The President needs to tell people in the Capitol to go  home. This is hurting all of us.''    Brian Kilmeade, ``Please get him on TV. Destroying  everything you have accomplished.''   Sean Hannity, ``Can he make a statement?''   And Donald Trump Jr., in profanity, said, Please help us.   But I want to just say, the United States v. Bryan says, ``A subpoena  has never been treated as an invitation to a game of hare and hounds,  in which the witness must testify only if cornered at the end of the  chase. If that were the case, then, indeed, the great power of  testimonial compulsion, so necessary to the effective functioning of  courts and legislatures, would be a nullity. We have often iterated the  importance of this public duty, which every person within the  jurisdiction of the Government is bound to perform when properly  summoned.'' We must do this, sadly, in order for his remarks to save  the democracy to be heard.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary,  on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, I rise in support of the rule  governing debate for H. Res. 851, ``Recommending That The House of  Representatives Find Mark Randall Meadows In Contempt of Congress for  Refusal to Comply with a Subpoena Duly Issued by the Select Committee  to Investigate the January 6th Attack on The United States Capitol.''   It is with a heavy heart that I stand here today; this resolution  will find a former colleague in contempt of the very body he once  faithfully served.   However, protecting our democracy is the ultimate duty for each of us  in this body, so we will do what must be done.   It is my sincere hope that during the course of this day, Mr. Meadows  will reverse course and agree to comply with this lawful subpoena, in  order to protect the dignity and sanctity of Congress.   On January 6th, the domestic terrorists who beat law enforcement  officers and breached the Citadel of democracy of the United States  proudly wore symbols of White Supremacist groups, waved confederate  flags, hung a noose on the lawn, and they shouted racial epithets.   Mark Randall Meadows, former White House Chief of Staff, had a part  in the perpetuation of the Big Lie of election fraud, and we must  investigate and report upon the facts, circumstances, and causes  ``relating to the interference with the peaceful transfer of power''  that Mr. Meadows was involved in.   Mr. Meadows was one of a relatively small group of people who  witnessed the events of  [[Page H7649]]  January 6 in the White House and with the former president.   Mr. Meadows was with the former president on January 6 as he learned  about the attack on the U.S. Capitol and decided whether to issue a  statement that could stop the rioters.   In fact, according to documents already handed over to the Committee,  as the violence at the Capitol unfolded, Mr. Meadows received many  messages encouraging him to have the former president issue a statement  that could end the violence.   According to the records, multiple Fox News hosts, and the former  president's son knew that the former president needed to act  immediately.   They texted Mr. Meadows, and he turned over these texts to this  Committee.   These are some of those texts:   Laura Ingraham texted, ``Mark, the president needs to tell people in  the Capitol to go home. This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his  legacy.''   Brian Kilmeade texted, ``Please, get him on TV destroying everything  you have accomplished.''   Sean Hannity texted, ``Can he make a statement? Ask people to leave  the Capitol.''   Donald Trump Jr. texted, ``he's got to condemn this shit ASAP. The  Capitol Police tweet is not enough.''   To this last text, Meadows responded, ``I'm pushing it hard. I  agree.''   One former White House employee reportedly contacted Mr. Meadows  several times and told him, ``[you guys have to say something. Even if  the president's not willing to put out a statement, you should go to  the [cameras] and say, `We condemn this. Please stand down.' If you  don't, people are going to die.''   As time passed without the former president intervening, Donald Trump  Jr. again texted, ``we need an Oval Office address. He has to lead now.  It has gone too far and gotten out of hand.''   But still, hours passed without necessary action by the president.   Moreover, Mr. Meadows reportedly spoke with Kashyap Patel, who was  then the chief of staff to former Acting Secretary of Defense  Christopher Miller, ``nonstop'' throughout the day of January 6.   Mr. Meadows apparently knows if and when the former president was  engaged in discussions regarding the National Guard's response to the  Capitol riot, a point that is contested but about which Mr. Meadows  provided documents to the Select Committee and spoke publicly on  national television after the former president left office.   But Mr. Meadows knows much more than just what happened during the  attack.   Prior to the January 6 attack, Mr. Meadows received text messages and  emails regarding apparent efforts to encourage Republican legislators  in certain States to send alternate slates of electors to Congress, a  plan which one Member of Congress acknowledged was ``highly  controversial'' and to which Mr. Meadows responded, ``I love it.''   Mr. Meadows traveled to Georgia to observe an audit of the votes days  after then- the former president complained that the audit had been  moving too slowly and claimed that the signature-match system was rife  with fraud. That trip precipitated the former president's calls to  Georgia's deputy secretary of state and, later, secretary of state.   In the call with Georgia's secretary of state, which Mr. Meadows  joined, the former president pressed his unsupported claims of  widespread election fraud, including claims related to deceased people  voting, forged signatures, out-of-State voters, shredded ballots,  triple-counted ballots, Dominion voting machines, and suitcase ballots,  before telling the secretary of state that he wanted to find enough  votes to ensure his victory.   Mr. Meadows was chief of staff during the post-election period when  other White House staff, including the press secretary, advanced claims  of election fraud.   In one press conference, the press secretary claimed that there were  ``very real claims'' of fraud that the former president's re-election  campaign was pursuing and said that mail-in voting was one that ``we  have identified as being particularly prone to fraud.''   Mr. Meadows participated in a meeting that reportedly occurred on  December 18, 2020, with the former president, the White House counsel,  an attorney associated with the campaign, White House staff, and  private citizens, on proposals relating to challenging the 2020  election results.   Mr. Meadows reportedly sent an email--subject line: ``Constitutional  Analysis of the Vice President's Authority for January 6, 2021, Vote  Count''--to a member of then-Vice President Pence's senior staff  containing a memo written by an attorney affiliated with the former  president's re-election campaign.   The memo argued that the Vice President could declare electoral votes  in six States in dispute when they came up for a vote during the Joint  Session of Congress on January 6, 2021, which would require those  States' legislatures to send a response to Congress by 7 p.m. EST on  January 15 or, if they did not, then congressional delegations would  vote for the former president's re-election.   Mr. Meadows was in contact with at least some of the private  individuals who planned and organized a January 6 rally, one of whom  reportedly may have expressed safety concerns to Mr. Meadows about  January 6 events.   It is apparent that Mr. Meadows's testimony and document production  are of critical importance to the Select Committee's investigation, and  Congress, through the Select Committee, is entitled to discover facts  concerning what led to the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, as  well as White House officials' actions and communications during and  after the attack.   Mr. Meadows is uniquely situated to provide key information, having  straddled an official role in the White House and unofficial role  related to the former president's reelection campaign since at least  election day in 2020 through January 6.   Mr. Meadows was required under federal law to turn over documents to  investigators and appear for a deposition in accordance with a subpoena  the committee issued, but he did not comply by the dates set in the  subpoena.    An individual--whether a member of the public or an executive branch  official--has a legal (and patriotic) obligation to comply with a duly  issued and valid congressional subpoena, unless a valid and overriding  privilege or other legal justification permits noncompliance.   In United States v. Bryan, the Supreme Court stated:   A subpoena has never been treated as an invitation to a game of hare  and hounds, in which the witness must testify only if cornered at the  end of the chase. If that were the case, then, indeed, the great power  of testimonial compulsion, so necessary to the effective functioning of  courts and legislatures, would be a nullity. We have often iterated the  importance of this public duty, which every person within the  jurisdiction of the Government is bound to perform when properly  summoned.   The Select Committee seeks testimony from Mr. Meadows on information  for which there can be no conceivable privilege claim.   In fact, the non-privileged nature of some key information has been  recognized by Mr. Meadows's own documents which he has previously  handed over to the Committee.   Congress is entitled to Mr. Meadows's testimony on that information,  regardless of his claims of privilege over other categories of  information.   In United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 703-16 (1974), the Supreme  Court recognized an implied constitutional privilege protecting  presidential communications.   The Court held though that the privilege is qualified, not absolute,  and that it is limited to communications made ``in performance of [a  President's] responsibilities of his office and made in the process of  shaping policies and making decisions.''   Mr. Meadows has refused to testify in response to the subpoena  ostensibly based on broad and undifferentiated assertions of various  privileges, including claims of executive privilege purportedly  asserted by former-President Trump.   However, his claims of testimonial immunity and executive privilege  do not justify Mr. Meadows's conduct with respect to the Select  Committee's subpoena.   His legal position is untenable in light of Mr. Meadows's public  descriptions of events in the book that he is trying to sell and during  his numerous television appearances, and his own previously produced  documents.   Even if privileges were applicable to some aspects of Mr. Meadows's  testimony, he was required to appear before the Select Committee for  his deposition, answer any questions concerning non-privileged  information, and assert any such privilege on a question-by-question  basis.   After promising to appear, Mr. Meadows has now reversed course and  resumed his contemptuous behavior.   Mr. Meadows's conduct in response to the Select Committee's subpoena  constitutes a violation of the contempt of Congress statutory  provisions.   The contempt of Congress statute makes clear that a witness summoned  before Congress must appear or be ``deemed guilty of a misdemeanor''  punishable by a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to one  year.   Further, the Supreme Court has emphasized that the subpoena power is  a ``public duty, which every person within the jurisdiction of the  Government is bound to perform when properly summoned.''   The Supreme Court also recently reinforced this clear obligation by  stating that ``when Congress seeks information needed for intelligent  legislative action, it unquestionably remains the duty of all citizens  to cooperate.''   DOJ's legitimacy and effectiveness depends on the public's confidence  that its administration and enforcement of federal laws is done  [[Page H7650]]  impartially, free from actual or perceived partisan or political  influence.   Mr. Speaker, the January 6 insurrection caused tragic loss of life  and many injuries, while leaving behind widespread physical damage to  the Capitol Complex and emotional trauma for Members, congressional  employees, and the Capitol Police.   It bears repeating often that the Congress and the Nation owe undying  gratitude to the men and women who answered the call of constitutional  duty and heroically won the day on that bloody and deadly afternoon.   Mr. Speaker, the domestic terrorists and seditionists who attacked  the Capitol Building on January 6, 2021 were not, as some of their  ardent defenders and apologists across the aisle have stated falsely,  on a ``normal tour visit''; nor was their effort to lay siege to the  Capitol and disrupt the processes of government an act of persons who  love their country.   And it is absurd to suggest that it was a celebration of the United  States and what it stands for when the leading edge of terrorists  desecrated the Capitol by offensively parading the treasonous  Confederate flag through the building and when, because of their  insurrection, several members of law enforcement made the supreme  sacrifice and scores more were seriously injured.   Mr. Speaker, we owe it not just to those who lost their lives on  January 6th, but to all Americans to figure out what happened and how  that day came to be.   We must understand that day in order to prevent the intended purpose  of the January 6 insurrection--to disrupt the Joint Meeting of Congress  to tally the votes of Presidential electors and announce the results to  the Nation and the world--from every occurring again.   This attack on our Capitol Building was the greatest threat to the  American experiment since the Civil War when the pro-slavery forces  decided to wage war, rather than let the Nation survive, and the pro- freedom forces would accept war rather than let the Nation perish.   The Select Committee has diligently continued in their duty to  determine the causes and events that transpired during the  insurrectionist attack.   Specifically, the Select Committee's purposes include:   To investigate and report upon the facts, circumstances, and causes  ``relating to the January 6, 2021 domestic terrorist attack upon the  United States Capitol Complex.''   To investigate and report upon the facts, circumstances, and causes  ``relating to the interference with the peaceful transfer of power.''   To investigate and report upon the facts, circumstances, and causes  relating to ``the influencing factors that fomented such an attack on  American representative democracy while engaged in a constitutional  process.''   Understanding the full role that Mr. Meadows played in the events  that led up to the January 6th attack is crucial to preventing anything  like this from ever happening again.   Rather than comply with Congress' inherent powers, and help heal the  trauma this Nation witnessed on January 6th, Mr. Meadows has simply  refused to comply with the Select Committee's subpoena.   Mr. Speaker, this should not be a partisan issue; it is the very  power of Congress to investigate matters of issue that is at stake.   For this reason, I rise in total support of the rule governing debate  for H. Res. 851, ``Recommending That The House of Representatives Find  Jeffrey Bossert Clark In Contempt of Congress for Refusal to Comply  with a Subpoena Duly Issued by the Select Committee to Investigate the  January 6th Attack on The United States Capitol.''    Mr. Speaker, when the heinous acts of 9/11 came,  this Nation could have easily fell upon the splinters of divisiveness  and begin to point fingers in a massive way toward our fellow human  beings, Muslims around the world and in the United States.   Isn't it interesting that the President of the United States, a  Republican, George W. Bush, took to the microphone to denounce that  kind of divisive action--a Republican.   We came together, even though there were incidences that many  confronted, to hold this Nation together. Even with the small  percentage of Muslims in the United States, we recognize the 1.8  billion Muslims in the world, which makes up nearly one-forth of the  world's population. It is the world's second largest religion.   I am proud to be able to serve or have served with former Member  Keith Ellison, the first to be elected; Congressman Andre Carson,  Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar. I am proud to chair the Pakistan Caucus,  the Afghan Caucus, and to work with Muslims around the world; and I  have visited the Middle East often, and engaged with Muslims who  desired peace.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the rule and the underlying  bill, to create the position of special envoy for monitoring and  combatting Islamophobia that would be responsible for tracking and  coordinating efforts to combat Islamophobia abroad. It would require  the State Department to encourage reports on human rights practices and  an annual report on international religious freedom, and include, where  possible, the assessments on the nature and extent of Islamophobia and  Islamophobic incitement that occur abroad.                                time  1330    My colleagues on this floor might take heed to the importance of  recognizing the humanity of all people. The hijab is a thing of beauty.  Muslim women can choose to wear it, they wear it in front of men who  are not their family members. Our Member, Ilhan Omar, wears that. It is  not a sign of terrorism, and that kind of language should be denounced  whether it is on the floor of this House or in some kind of private  interaction.   We do not want the world to look at the United States as not caring  about the rights of Muslims. America stands against the committing of  acts of atrocities against the Uyghurs in China, or the Rohingya in  Burma, or the brutal crackdowns on Muslim populations in other  countries including Southeast Asia, scapegoating of Muslim refugees and  other Muslims in Hungary and Poland, the acts of white supremacist  violence against Muslims in New Zealand and Canada, or the targeting of  minority Muslim communities in Muslim majority countries like those in  Southeast Asia and Iran. I know that we are working hard to ensure that  does not happen.    This legislation is crucial and important. The  reason is because it speaks to who we are as Members of the most  powerful lawmaking body in the world.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad to sit on the Tom Lantos Human Rights  Commission with Chairman McGovern and that we can talk about human  rights for all people. And we need to get over it and recognize that it  is important to unify the world. Let the United States be the leader  for what is right and to be able to acknowledge the doctors, lawyers,  and other leaders in our Nation who happen to be Muslim.   So this legislation gives the United States the right hand, the upper  hand to be able to assess this around the world and be the leader  against anti-hate or anti-Muslim hate. Let's be the leader rather than  the provoker of it.   I end by saying this plea to my colleagues: Whether you are  Republican or Democrat, is this, in essence, the reputation you want to  give to this Congress, that we are attacking people for their religion  and who they are?   Let this bill pass but let it be a symbol that we will stop this kind  of Islamophobia, and it starts with each and every one of us.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote for the rule and the  underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Rule Governing Debate of H.R.  5665, the Combating International Islamophobia Act, which will address  the increasing number of incidents of Islamophobia around the world.   Specifically, this bill will:   Create the position of Special Envoy for Monitoring and Combating  Islamophobia, who will be responsible for tracking and coordinating  efforts to combat Islamophobia abroad.   Require that the State Department's annual country reports on human  rights practices and annual Report on International Religious Freedom  include, wherever possible, assessments of the nature and extent of  acts of Islamophobia and Islamophobic incitement that occur abroad.   As Islamophobia rises globally, it is vital that the State Department  have senior personnel in place charged with understanding, reporting  on, and combating this scourge worldwide.   In recent decades, we have seen a staggering rise in incidents of  violent Islamophobia worldwide.   Whether it is the atrocities being committed against the Uyghurs in  China and the Rohingya in Burma, the brutal crackdowns on Muslim  populations around the world. The scapegoating of Muslim refugees and  other Muslims in Hungary and Poland, the acts of white supremacist  violence targeting Muslims in New Zealand and Canada, or the targeting  of minority Muslim communities in Muslim-majority countries. It is time  for us as policymakers to understand these problems as interconnected  and genuinely global.   There are about 1.8 billion Muslims in the world, which makes up  nearly one-fourth of the world's population. Islam is the world's  second largest religion. Painfully, a staggering number of people have  experienced anti-Muslim hate in their lifetime; a number that has only  inflated since 9/11.   America is home to one of the most diverse Muslim populations in the  world, including people of almost every ethnicity, country and school  of thought.   Approximately one third of the community is African American, one  third is of South Asian descent, one quarter is of Arab descent, and  the rest are from all over the world, including a growing Latino Muslim  population.   While exact numbers are difficult to establish, there are between 3-6  million American Muslims. About one half of this population was born in  the U.S., a percentage that continues to grow as immigration slows and  younger individuals start having families.   American Muslims are present in all walks of life, as doctors and  taxi drivers; lawyers and newspaper vendors; accountants, homemakers,  academics, media personalities, athletes, and entertainers.   Although American Muslims make up approximately one percent of the  U.S. population, most Americans can name several famous American  Muslims. Names like Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, Mos Def, Fareed Zakaria,  Shaquille O'Neal, Lupe Fiasco, Dr. Oz and Rima Fakih are part of our  popular consciousness.   Important business figures like Farooq Kathwari (CEO of Ethan Allen),  Malik M. Hasan (a pioneer in the field of HMOs), and Safi Qureshey (a  leader in PC component manufacturing) are all American Muslims.   Many American Muslims are also civically engaged, working with their  neighbors to better their communities. Well-known American Muslim  leaders include Rep. Keith Ellison (DFL-Minn.), the first American  Muslim to be elected to the U.S. Congress; Rep. Andre Carson (D-Ind.);  Mohammed Hameeduddin (Mayor, Teaneck, N.J.); and Amer Ahmad  (Comptroller, Chicago).   Nevertheless, levels of Islamophobia are so high that the United  Nations Human rights Council has declared it an issue of ``epidemic  proportions.''   Atrocities have been occurring across the globe, from hate-messages  spray-painted on buildings in America to the violent genocide of the  Uyghurs in China.   The United States State Department estimated that up to 2 million  members of Muslim minorities have experienced a system on detention  centers in Xinjiang, known political indoctrination, forced labor,  torture, and sexual abuse.   The US, UK, and Canada have accused China of committing genocide and  crimes against humanity against Muslim populations at Xinjiang.   In 2018, UN investigators accused the Myanmar's military of carrying  out mass killings of Muslim populations with ``genocidal intent.''   There are reports of attacks on mosques in Southeast Asia and Iran, a  history of anti-Muslim sentiments and attacks in Sri Lanka, police  targeting against Shia Muslims in Southeast Asia again, massacres of  Muslim people in New Zealand, and Islamophobic hate-speech in Canada.  We have to demand justice for Muslims and better treatment for all  religions.   This global injustice must be addressed and rectified and the United  States must step up to spearhead the movement.  [[Page H7658]]    We need to establish a comprehensive plan for combating Islamophobia  not only to ensure the religious freedom and human rights of Muslims,  but to protect against a threat to international religious freedom and  democratic principles.   The Combating International Islamophobia Act will require the State  department to create a Special Envoy for monitoring and combating  Islamophobia answering the call of the American Muslim community for  the past two decades.   The envoy will work with domestic and international nongovernmental  organizations and institutions to carry out its directives.   The special envoy will give reports on acts of physical violence or  harassment against Muslim people as well as acts of vandalism of Muslim  community institutions like schools, mosques, and cemeteries.   Regarding anti-Muslim government actions, the envoy will monitor  instances of propaganda in media that attempt to justify or promote  racial hatred or incite acts of violence against Muslim people.   With the new wealth of information this envoy will bring,  policymakers will have a better understanding of the interconnected,  global problem of anti-Muslim bigotry.   As part of our commitment to international religious freedom and  human rights, we must recognize Islamophobia as a pattern that is  repeating in nearly every corner of the globe.   It is past time for the United States to stand firmly in favor of  religious freedom for all, and to give the global problem of  Islamophobia the attention and prioritization it deserves.   I urge all members to join me in voting for the rule and the  underlying legislation, H.R. 5665, the ``Combating International  Islamophobla Act.''    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5665, Combating  International Islamophobia Act.   I have listened to my friends on the other side of the aisle, and  they are my friends. I hope that we will have the opportunity to work  together for what the values of America stand for.   I have heard my colleagues recount the various efforts of inhumane  treatment of Muslims around the world. This is an important statement  made by America, to create the position of special envoy for monitoring  and combating Islamophobia that will be responsible for tracking and  coordinating efforts to combat Islamophobia. Also, it would require the  State Department's annual ``Country Reports on Human Rights Practices''  to include acts of Islamophobia.                                time  2015    With 1 billion Muslims, the reason why I support this legislation is  the statement it makes to the world about the values of this country,  and the values of this country should be grounded in the fact that the  religious freedom of all should be respected.   Then, finally, I am really overwhelmed by the constant battering of  our colleague, Ilhan Omar. To make her the center point of opposition  in this place is beneath the dignity of this House. So by passing this  legislation, let the world know that America's values are valuing  religious freedom and that we stand against the abuse of Muslims around  the world as well as here in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, this is an important piece of legislation. I thank the  chairman for his leadership, and I ask my colleagues, Republicans and  Democrats, to support H.R. 5665.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5665, the Combating  International Islamophobia Act,  [[Page H7801]]  which will address the increasing number of incidents of Islamophobia  around the world.

We need to establish a comprehensive plan for combating Islamophobia  not only to ensure the religious freedom and human rights of Muslims,  but to protect against a threat to international religious freedom and  democratic principles.   The Combating International Islamophobia Act will require the State  Department to create a Special Envoy for monitoring and combating  Islamophobia answering the call of the American Muslim community for  the past two decades.   The envoy will work with domestic and international nongovernmental  organizations and institutions to carry out its directives.   The special envoy will give reports on acts of physical violence or  harassment against Muslim people as well as acts of vandalism of Muslim  community institutions like schools, mosques, and cemeteries.   Regarding anti-Muslim government actions, the envoy will monitor  instances of propaganda in media that attempt to justify or promote  racial hatred or incite acts of violence against Muslim people.   With the new wealth of information this envoy will bring,  policymakers will have a better understanding of the interconnected,  global problem of anti-Muslim bigotry.   As part of our commitment to international religious freedom and  human rights, we must recognize Islamophobia as a pattern that is  repeating in nearly every corner of the globe.   It is past time for the United States to stand firmly in favor of  religious freedom for all, and to give the global problem of  Islamophobia the attention and prioritization it deserves.    Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees  on the Judiciary, on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, I rise in  support of S.J. Res. 33--Joint resolution relating to increasing the  debt limit, a measure raising the national debt limit by $2.5 trillion,  which is imperative to avoid a wasteful, irresponsible, reckless  threatening of the nation's singular indispensable asset: the full  faith and credit of the United States.   Madam Speaker, preserving the full faith and credit of the United  States by raising to the debt limit to ensure that America pays the  bills for past expenditures when they come due is not a partisan  exercise but an act of patriotism, a recognition and embrace of the  solemn obligation to preserve the unrivaled advantages that flow from  the ability provided in the Article I, Section 8, clause 2 of the  Constitution to ``borrow money on the credit of the United States.''   Long ago, in 1789, Alexander Hamilton, the nation's first and  greatest Treasury Secretary, understood that the path to American  prosperity and greatness lay in its creditworthiness which provided the  affordable access to capital needed to fund internal improvements and  economic growth.   It is because of the existence and wise use of the Borrowing Power  that the nation was able to expand its reaches, resources, and riches  by financing the Louisiana Purchase, the purchase of Alaska from  Russia, to fund the investments to end the Great Depression, to finance  the mobilization of resources needed in World War II to defeat fascism  and save freedom in the nation and the world, to revive the economy  after the catastrophic Great Recession of 2008, and most recently, to  protect the public health and safety and restore the economy during the  COVID-19 pandemic.   This is why the ability to borrow money on the credit of the United  States to finance its growth and protect its people and interests is  essential to the national security and led Hamilton to proclaim that  ``the proper funding of the present debt, will render it a national  blessing.''   But to maintain this blessing, or to ``render public credit  immortal,'' Hamilton understood that it was necessary that: ``the  creation of debt should always be accompanied with the means of  extinguishment.''   In other words, to retain and enjoy the prosperity that flows from  good credit, it is necessary for a nation to pay its bills.   The United States has never defaulted on the payment of any debt  incurred, and because of the size and strength of its economic and  unmatched creditworthiness, is able to borrow on the lowest and most  favorable terms of any nation or entity in the history of the world.   So secure and reliable is a bond issues by the Department of Treasury  that the United States is the preferred haven for investments of  foreign governments, corporations, and sovereign wealth funds.   The interest rate charged the federal government of the United States  is the base for which every rate, from the prime rate charged the  richest corporation to rates charged small business on purchases to the  mortgages rates and students loans taken out by consumers.   If you raise the cost of borrowing for the government of the United  States, you set off a chain reaction of increased interest rates for  every other borrower in the United States and around the world.   This is why leading public finance experts and agencies, like Moody's  Chief Economist Mark Zandi, have said it would be ``cataclysmic'' for  the United States to default on its loan obligations.   Republicans know the debt ceiling needs to be raised; in 2019 during  the Trump Administration, the Republican Senate Majority Leader  marshalled Senate Republicans to vote to raise the debt ceiling,  saying: ``We raised the debt ceiling because America can't default[,]  that would be a disaster.''   Madam Speaker, this debate over extending the debt limit is not about  restraining future spending, it is about paying the bills piled up  already under both Republican and Democratic administrations.   The question of raising the national debt limit does not depend on  how one feels about the Build Back Better agenda, as wildly popular as  it is among all Americans, Democrats, Independents, and Republicans  included.   It is instead about preserving the singular asset of the United  States, its enviable and unrivaled creditworthiness, to finance future  investments beneficial to the national interest, like the provision of  free college for two years, or $2 billion investment to reduce violence  in communities approved by the Committee on the Judiciary, or  investments to preserve and strengthen Medicaid expansion programs, or  extend broadband to underserved rural and urban areas, an action that  will be as life-changing as the rural electrification program was in  the 1930s.   Madam Speaker, if our friends across the aisle really want to shrink  the deficit, reduce the national debt, practice fiscal responsibility,  and bring about sustained economic growth and prosperity, there is a  much better, easier, and more certain way to achieve these goals than  by tampering with the U.S. Constitution.   The easier and better way is for the American people to keep a  Democrat in the White House and place Democratic majorities in the  House and Senate.   In the 1990s under the leadership of President Clinton the budget was  balanced for four consecutive years, the national debt was paid down,  the national debt, 23 million new jobs were created, and projected  surpluses exceeded $5 trillion.   Under President Obama the financial crisis and economic meltdown  inherited from his Republican predecessor was ended, the annual deficit  was reduced by 67 percent, the auto industry was saved from collapse,  and 15 million jobs were created.   In contrast, under every Republican administration since President  Reagan the size of the deficit bequeathed to his successor was  substantially larger than the deficit he inherited, a major economic  recession occurred, and economic growth was lower than it was at the  beginning of his administration.   To preserve the sanctity of the full faith and credit of the United  States, protect American jobs and businesses of all sizes, and ensure  the continued growth of the economy, I support and urge all Members to  join me in voting for S.J. Res. 33--Joint resolution relating to  increasing the debt limit.
