 Mr. Speaker, the vast majority of people in our country  oppose the Trump administration's cruel policy of jailing immigrant  children. This administration is rotten to the core.   Just yesterday, news broke that the Department of Health and Human  Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement is preparing for possibly  another surge of families to separate. They are planning for the  possible detention of thousands more children, even though the office  doesn't have enough money to take care of these children.   So what is the administration's plan for covering the cost of jailing  children? According to internal documents obtained by reporters, HHS  plans to pay for the child separation by robbing funds from the Ryan  White HIV/AIDS Program. In fact, HHS is already moving money out of the  Ryan White program.   Mr. Speaker, this administration is wicked. Stealing from the  underinsured and the uninsured people living with HIV in order to put  children in jail is outrageous. Congress needs to step up and protect  the Ryan White program and end child detention.                            ____________________
