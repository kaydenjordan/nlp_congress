 I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, there is widespread bipartisan support for  this amendment. I am going to vote for it, and a number of Republicans  have cosponsored it. Although we are going to have to call the roll,  perhaps this could be the moment when a 10-minute vote actually means  that.    I yield.                         Unanimous Consent Agreement     I yield the floor.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1065     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Does the distinguished chairman wish to speak on the  motion?    Mr. President, this represents another degree of  cooperation. This comes to us by unanimous consent. According to the  rules, we must have a vote of the yeas and nays, but we are approaching  the finish line, and out of consideration for those who have travel  plans later tonight, I hope we can stick to the 10-minute rule.   I urge the passage of this important managers' package.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1087     Mr. President, I now would like to congratulate my  colleagues in the Senate for passing a very important National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024.   I see that my distinguished chairman has come back to the floor, and  I want to thank him for his cooperation. I want to thank every member  of the committee and every Member of the Senate for their cooperation.  As the public has learned, we do much of this through unanimous  consent, and it is a tribute that we have gotten as far as we have and  it is July 27, with another full 2 months to go before the end of the  fiscal year. I think we are on the right track.   This year's National Defense Authorization Act will help meet the  dangerous national security moment we face. It will equip our military  with many of the tools necessary to implement the national defense  strategy.   Every year, as has been mentioned, we pass the NDAA. This is the 63rd  time we have done so, and it is a lasting, continual testament to  Congress's commitment to our servicemembers and our security.   To be sure, our threats are much greater than they were back in 1961  when the first NDAA passed. Today, the United States faces undoubtedly  the most complex and dangerous security situation since World War II.   This year's NDAA is an important step forward in our quest to build  our arsenal. Ideally, we would have an annual 3 to 5 percent boost  above inflation to our top line. We were not able to come to an  agreement on that, but even without that budget increase, our committee  has advanced a strong, bipartisan product that contains numerous  important provisions. Let me summarize just a few.   The bill authorizes a 5.2-percent pay raise for servicemembers and  includes a host of other quality-of-life improvements for our troops  and their families.   The bill also contains provisions that will help the military solve  its recruiting crisis.   We include a massive expansion of the Junior ROTC Program, a  citizenship builder in our high schools. We also included support for  our submarine programs. We need to do more in that regard.   The legislation addresses the ongoing maintenance delays by sending  funds to our shipyards. It expands our deterrent capabilities with a  sea-launched nuclear cruise missile and allows us to make good on our  commitments to the United Kingdom and Australia, commonly referred to  as the AUKUS agreement.   The bill makes six more munitions eligible for the all-important  multiyear procurement contracts. These multiyear commitments send a  clear signal to our industrial base. And we will produce these arms at  home, here in the United States, equipping American troops with  American-made weapons and ammunition.   Notably, we have fully authorized the construction of the next  amphibious ship, the LPD-33.   Our committee realizes military competition in the 21st century will  be decided by our willingness to harness emerging technology. This NDAA  accelerates the development of artificial intelligence, offensive  cyber, hypersonics, and unmanned platforms. Because we intend to lap  Beijing in the 100-year innovation marathon, we are authorizing a new  Pentagon authority with the Office of Strategic Capital.   As always, partnerships with our allies act as a force multiplier on  all the tools we are providing American soldiers. I am glad this bill  enhances security cooperation with allies in every part of the free  world, from the Baltics to the Pacific.   Starting in January, the Armed Services Committee held countless  hearings, briefings, and oversight hearings of the Department. This is  one of the most encompassing bills as a result of our work, which began  in January. The committee mark included 1,217 provisions. Of that, 504  were the result of member inputs. During the committee markups, an  additional 240 amendments were considered.   Throughout the process, my colleague and teammate, Senator Jack Reed  of Rhode Island, has been a gentleman in every way and a patriot, as  demonstrated by his service in the military and his service in the  House and Senate. I thank him for helping to make this process  exceedingly smooth.   To take a moment, let me thank the following staff members who were  so essential in getting this done smoothly and efficiently: Rick  Berger, Brendan Gavin, James Mazol, Greg Lilly, Brad Patout, Olivia  Trusty, Eric Trager, Adam Trull, Kevin Kim, Adam Barker, Sean O'Keefe,  Katie Magnus, Isaac Jalkanen, Eric Lofgren, Kristina Belcourt, Pat  Thompson, Katie Romaine, Travis Brundrett, Jack Beyrer, and Philip  Waller. And all of these people on my side of the dais were led  effectively by a veteran staff member from the House and Senate, my  staff director, John Keast. Thank you to all of these people.   Thank you once again to my colleague Senator Reed.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following member of my staff be granted floor privileges until July 28,  2023, Chloe Jackson.
