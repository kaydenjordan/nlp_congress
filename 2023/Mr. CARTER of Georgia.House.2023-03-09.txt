 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Tina  Tyus Shaw, who is going to be inducted into the Georgia Association of  Broadcasters Hall of Fame this month.   Those who watch WSAV-TV in Savannah know that Ms. Shaw has been a key  part of our local news coverage since 1992. Her 30 years of service  have brought reliable news coverage to homes in Georgia's First  District on a consistent basis.   Ms. Shaw is certainly not a stranger to winning awards for her work  in local news either. She has won dozens of awards for broadcasting,  including the National Murrow Award for Best Newscast.   In addition to her regular broadcasting duties, Ms. Shaw is a key  player in the fight against breast cancer. She created the ``Buddy  Check 3,'' a breast cancer detection program, which has saved many  lives thanks to early detection.   Ms. Shaw's commitment to her local community and her State are a  testament to her character.   I cannot think of anyone more deserving of being inducted into the  Georgia Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame.                    Celebrating the Life of Sandra Martin     Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  life of Sandra Martin, a loving mother, wife, and leader from the great  State of Georgia.   A native of Cuthbert, Georgia, Sandra was the class valedictorian at  Randolph Junior/Senior High School in 1971.   Sandra met and married the love of her life, John F. Martin, Sr., of  Flemington, more than 50 years ago.   She would go on to work at the Heritage Bank for 40 years and held  many titles, including vice president.   In addition to her career at Heritage Bank, she was a dedicated  public servant. Sandra was elected to the Flemington City Council in  1981 and later served as mayor of Flemington from 1997 to 2017.   Sandra loved traveling, spending time with her family, and was a  committed member of Flemington Presbyterian Church.   A lifelong servant to her community, Sandra's impact on the State of  Georgia will be felt for generations to come. She will be dearly  missed.                           Recognizing Trace Carter     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Trace  Carter, an accomplished student golfer at Ware County High School.   Barely 2 years into his high school career, Trace is the reigning  club champion at Okefenokee Country Club, highly ranked by the American  Junior Golf Association, and finished as the boys' 14 to 15 runner-up  at the Drive, Chip, and Putt National Finals at Augusta National Golf  Club.   Since competing in his first tournament in 2015, Trace has found  tremendous success, finishing second and third the past 2 years at the  Okefenokee invitational. He also helped lead Ware County High School to  a region title and a top-five finish at the State championship his  freshman year.   Golf has always been an important part of Trace's family, as his mom  and dad both played on State championship teams at Pierce County High  School. Chase's grandfather, Royce Carter, my dear friend, and one of  my earliest supporters, instilled in him the love of golf at a very  young age.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Trace on his accomplishments. I am  excited to see what he will achieve in the years to come.                     Celebrating the Life of Anne Hodnett     Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  life of Anne Hodnett, a loving mother, wife, and dedicated volunteer in  her community.   A native of Henry County, Virginia, Anne grew up during the Great  Depression, the youngest of eight children.   Anne later married Roy K. Hodnett, a veteran of World War II.   In 1968, the Hodnetts moved to St. Simons Island where Anne was an  active volunteer throughout her community. Anne used her many talents,  such as cooking and organizing, to cultivate a thriving community. She  volunteered at St. Simons United Methodist Church, The Gathering Place,  Manna House, MAP International, Amity House, and the Island Players,  where she was a ``life member.''   Another passion Anne had was for the stage. She acted in more than 30  plays and produced nearly 50 of her own. Anne operated her own dinner  theater for several years, entertaining tour groups with light comedies  and Lowcountry boils on their visits to the island.   Anne will be dearly missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with her and  her family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Savannah Regional Film Commission Director Erin Fraser.
