 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at  the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in  support of my amendment to H.R. 1865, the Allow States and Victims to  Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act.   I also want to thank my colleague, Ann Wagner, for her dedication to  this issue and her efforts to bring this bill to the floor.   The underlying bill will help crack down on online facilitators of  human sex trafficking to end this modern-day slavery. My amendment will  allow enforcement of criminal and civil sex trafficking laws against  websites that knowingly facilitate online sex trafficking activities.   Mr. Chairman, this issue is of significant local concern in the heart  of my district in Orange County. Last year, a major international sex  trafficking ring was uncovered in a quiet Irvine, California,  neighborhood. Young women from overseas were sold repeatedly through  the website Backpage.com.   Websites like Backpage, which are essentially storefronts for the  facilitation of sex trafficking, have been able to operate with  impunity. My amendment, in conjunction with the underlying bill, will  help prosecutors crack down on websites that knowingly facilitate or  promote sex trafficking, while keeping in place safeguards for those  who responsibly publish third-party content. This legislation will  empower sex trafficking survivors to come forward and seek justice.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill  and putting an end to the human sex trafficking industry in America,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent  to reclaim the time I yielded back.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner).    I yield to the gentlewoman from  Texas.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance  of my time.
