 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Scott  for putting this together. Indeed, it is something well deserved.   I rise today to recognize a great Georgian and a great Senator.   I have been blessed in my life. I am the grandson of a tobacco farmer  and the son of a paper mill worker, and here I am, walking the Halls of  Congress.   In the short period of time that I have had to serve here, I have  witnessed many great things. I got to listen to the Pope, something I  never thought I would have the opportunity to do, one of the great  religious leaders in the world, right here in this room.   But when I think of what I saw just a few minutes ago, when I saw not  only two great Georgians but two great Americans,   John Lewis and  Johnny Isakson, embrace, I pinch myself sometimes. How did this happen  to me? How did I get to witness all of these great things in my life?   Madam Speaker, I thank both of these gentlemen.   Madam Speaker, I thank especially Senator Isakson. I have been  fortunate to call him a friend and a mentor for many years. I have had  many political mentors in my life: Tom Triplett, Tom Coleman, just to  name a few, and Johnny Isakson.   I can remember hearing the story from the then-minority leader of the  house of representatives in the Georgia statehouse, when Senator  Isakson would tell the story of leading such a small group that General  Custer had had better odds than he had at that time.                                time  1615    I will never forget that. It taught me perseverance. It taught me to  always work hard and to continue on. I have always looked at that and  admired that in you, and I appreciate it very much.   Your dedication to our State and our Nation has truly been unmatched.  It is something that I have admired throughout all my time in public  service.   Senator Isakson, you are one of the greatest Georgians to ever serve  and one of the only Georgians--in fact, the only Georgian--to have ever  served in the Georgia State House, in the Georgia State Senate, in the  House of Representatives, and the United States Senate. I got three out  of four. I don't know if I will ever make it across over here, but if I  do, I am going to catch you because I have had the honor, as well.   At each of those levels that you have served, you have been  successful in advancing policies for the betterment of the State of  Georgia and for the United States of America. I think that is what is  so very important. Everywhere you have been, every step of the way, it  has always been for the people, always been for the betterment of our  State and of our Nation.   During a time in our political history in which Americans seem to be  increasingly divided, I have always looked to you. One of the most  important achievements I think that you have made is to build  bipartisanship, to reach across the aisle, to come together.   I hear my staff tell the story of you don't hear about Senator  Isakson being involved in a big fight over in the Senate, but, in the  background, he is in a knife fight and he is winning.   That is what we all aspire to do. We all want to be known as  statesmen. We all want to be successful and win our matches. But you  are, and we don't even know about it most of the time.   For example, you have always been a staunch supporter of our Nation's  veterans. I think that is extremely important for all of us to  remember. You were chair of the Veterans' Affairs Committee for so many  years.   I have heard the stories of problems at the VA and of Senator Isakson  picking up the phone and calling the family member and apologizing.  Now, this is the chair of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee  calling someone and apologizing for them having a problem at the VA  center. Can you imagine? But that is what we admire.   The overhaul to the VA Veterans Choice Program, modernizing VA  hospitals in the MISSION Act, all of these signed into law as a result  of your efforts.   Every year for over a decade, Senator Isakson has held a barbecue in  the Russell Building to feed his colleagues from both sides of the  aisle.   Now at retirement at the end of this year, the State of Georgia, the  United States of America, loses one of its great political assets. I  know you have made the point that you are going to sprint through the  finish line, and that is important.   I want to thank you, Senator, for your service to our State. I want  to thank you for your service to our Nation. I want to thank you for  the example that you have set for people like me. Thank you for always  being a step above the political infighting in order to do what you  truly felt was best for Georgians.   As you continue to do what is best for your health, you and Dianne  will always be in my thoughts and prayers. Thank you, Senator, for your  service to our country. God bless you.
