 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  innovative educational program in my south Florida community called the  Fairchild Challenge.   As a nonprofit founded in 2002, this no-cost, environment-focused  annual competition based at the world-renowned Fairchild Tropical  Botanic Garden, located in my district, invites students from around  the world to participate from a young age as active and thoughtful  members of society.   The Fairchild Challenge focuses attention on conservation of the  environment, while introducing students to the importance of STEM:  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.   In the 2014-2015 school year, over 153,000 participants were involved  in the program. High-performing schools are eligible for cash prizes,  while participating students may earn college scholarships.   Through innovative programs like the Fairchild Challenge, students  are sure to be conscious of the benefits of conserving our environment  and may more readily engage in the STEM fields that will better prepare  them for the future.   Congratulations to all the student participants of the Fairchild  Challenge. Hats off especially to the board members, staff, and the  many volunteers of the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden, and most  especially to Mr. and Mrs. Greer, the heart and soul of these beautiful  botanical gardens.                            ____________________
