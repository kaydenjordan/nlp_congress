 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, later today the CEO of Facebook will come  before the U.S. Senate to discuss Facebook's leak of the data of an  estimated 87 million users.   As someone who personally spent over a decade in the technology  business and cloud computing, I know how important tech jobs are. I  know how important internet connectivity is and how important social  media is to our growing economy.   But I am also the father of four children, and I know the importance  of ensuring that as technology continues to rapidly evolve, our  children's security and privacy must be protected. In fact, recently in  Montana we had a breach of our children's data at Kalispell Middle  School. That is why today I am reintroducing the SAFE KIDS Act.   This bill prohibits websites and programs that are designed for  students ranging from pre-K to the 12th grade from selling or  disclosing our children's personal information. It takes the control of  our students' data away from operators and places it back where it  should be, in the hands of parents and the students themselves. This is  a smart, timely, and important bill.   Our children's information shouldn't be used and abused, and I  encourage and ask my colleagues to join me in support of the SAFE KIDS  Act.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. Young, and Mr. Jones):   S. 2642. A bill to require the Secretary of Labor, in consultation  with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to establish a pilot  program for Jobs Plus Recovery programs, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
