 Mr. President, in a moment, I will specifically  address the comments the Senator from Washington made. First, I would  like to acknowledge that she and other Members of the Senate worked  with us to make sure this legislation could become law by August 1, and  I thank her for that.   Sometimes the House accepts a Senate bill, as it did with the Perkins  Career and Technical Education Act that the President signed today, and  sometimes the Senate accepts a House bill, as I will move that we do  today. One reason we are able to do that is because our committees work  closely with the House to try to take as many of their good ideas as we  can so we can pass each other's bill, if that became necessary. The  second reason that happens is because Senator Murray characteristically  works with me to solve problems like she is doing today, and I am  grateful to her for doing that. We don't agree on everything, but we  agree on a lot.   I noticed in our committee hearing the other day that the Committee  on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, of which I am chairman and  she is the ranking Democrat, has approved 50 bills this Congress.  Eighteen of them have been signed by the President. Some more will be  signed by the President.   We are working hard on opioids legislation, which is of great  interest to almost every Member of this body. Our committee has  unanimously reported that to the floor, and we are working with other  committees. We have been working with the House on that. We are working  on getting generic drugs to market more easily, something that has  needed to be done for 20 years. We have reported that out to the  Senate. Pandemic legislation--dealing with epidemics and being prepared  for them--is ready for the Senate to act on.   This is characteristic of the work Senator Murray and her staff do.  As she mentioned, this bill is the last of the so-called user fee  agreements. We passed four last August that dealt with about $9 billion  in industry user fees to fund the Food and Drug Administration. This is  another bill to do that. These bills are complicated and difficult and  involve lots of discussions. In the end, they often pass by agreement,  as this one will today, I believe, but that is because of the amount of  work our staff and Senator Murray's staff and the House of  Representatives have done. I thank them for that.   The FDA user fee bills provide about half the funding the Food and  Drug Administration uses every year to keep the drugs we buy at our  pharmacies and get at the doctor's office safe. We take it for granted,  but it is the gold standard, and we work very hard to try to make sure  we don't infringe on that gold standard of safety and efficacy.   The House of Representatives has passed, by unanimous consent, the  bill we referred to, the Animal Drug and Generic Animal Drug User Fee  Amendments, which reauthorizes user fee programs that allow the animal  drug industry and the Food and Drug Administration to continue to  expedite the review of safe and effective treatments for animals. These  updated agreements have been carefully worked out between the Food and  Drug Administration and the animal drug industry, with input from  farmers and ranchers, food and feed producers, veterinarians, and other  stakeholders.   If Congress doesn't do its job, as the Senator from Washington said,  to reauthorize these critical programs before August 1, the Food and  Drug Administration will be forced to send layoff notices to 115  employees. By our action today, we will be able to avoid that.   The review of over 2,000 animal drug applications and investigational  submissions currently pending before the Food and Drug Administration  will be significantly delayed if we don't act, and we intend to act.  This means it  [[Page S5474]]  will take longer for new animal drugs and treatments to be available to  farmers, ranchers, veterinarians, and families, but, fortunately,  because of the cooperation today, that will not happen.   The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, our committee,  approved the Senate version of this bill on February 28 of this year by  a bipartisan vote of 22 to 1. The bill passed the House in almost  identical form that was approved by the HELP Committee in February, but  the House bill, as Senator Murray said, expands conditional approval to  encourage innovation and competition.   Conditional approval allows a drug to go to market once it meets the  Food and Drug Administration safety standards, and then the drug  company has up to 5 years to prove the drug is effective. Based on  bipartisan feedback about conditional approval, the House of  Representatives agreed to make three changes in its bill: No. 1, a 10- year sunset for conditional approval; No. 2, clarify the conditional  approval does not require an additional fee to be paid to the Food and  Drug Administration; and, No. 3, a Government Accountability Office  report on conditional approval.   Senator Murray and I agree that we need to clarify what it means for  a drug to be ``difficult to study.'' I have talked to Dr. Scott  Gottlieb, the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration about  these concerns, and he agrees. Dr. Gottlieb has agreed to quickly issue  guidance and develop regulations that provide clarity on what  ``difficult to study'' means and that do not change the gold standard  of the Food and Drug Administration's drug approval process.   Also, conditional approval is not available for antimicrobial drugs.  The language in the bill is clear, and Dr. Gottlieb understands that  conditional approval is not available for antimicrobial drugs.   Congress will also conduct oversight to make sure conditional  approval is achieving the goal of helping more pets and keeping our  food supply safe. This bipartisan legislation will help keep animals  healthy, prevent disease outbreaks, and protect our food supply.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of H.R. 5554.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on Monday of last week, the Senate  passed H.R. 2353, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for  the 21st Century Act, with a Senate amendment. On Wednesday, the House  of Representatives followed suit. This measure reauthorizes the Carl D.  Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, which was last reauthorized  in 2006.   President Trump signed this important bill into law today at a  ceremony at the White House that I was fortunate enough to have been  invited to attend.   The bill modernizes our career and technical education programs in  our Nation's high schools, and community colleges, technical colleges,  and other institutions of higher education to provide the skills needed  to support State and local employer's workforce needs. The bill is also  designed to align with other Federal education and workforce laws.   While we are currently experiencing the best economy in 18 years,  there are still 6.6 million unfilled jobs, many of these jobs offer  high wages, but require workers to have specific or a high-level set of  skills. In order to have a productive workforce and sustain a strong  economy, we need to ensure today's workers and future workers have an  opportunity to learn these needed skills.   Our bill is an important step in helping States and local communities  do that.   First, as States are designing their State career and technical  education--CTE--plans, they will need to consult with a variety of  education and workforce stakeholders. This means, for the first time,  employers and business leaders will work with the State on designing  education programs that focus on preparing students for in-demand and  emerging jobs.   Second, local school districts are required to conduct an evaluation  of their current programs and how those programs align with in-demand  industry sectors or occupations. In order to accomplish this, school  districts will work with local community and business leaders to  determine what those sectors and occupations are, if they are not fully  aware of them already. The bill also makes a significant change to the  way funds flow to States. Current law sends funds to States based on  the population in the State but dictates States cannot receive less  than what they received in 1998. Our bill updates this formula as  populations have dramatically shifted with some States seeing  significant growth over the past 20 years.   Another area that was improved was better aligning with other  workforce initiatives. This bill would align CTE program plans with  State Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act plans so that States  that want to submit a combined plan may do so. The Workforce Innovation  and Opportunity Act is a Federal workforce development law that  provides training to adults already in or seeking employment.   In their CTE plans, States must determine levels of performance for  several indicators of performance, which are outlined in the bill. The  indicators at the secondary level include graduation rate, achievement  of academic standards as defined in the Every Student Succeeds Act,  ensuring academic rigor in programs, and accounting for students who  enter postsecondary education, the military, national service, or are  employed, to name a few. There are additional and similar indicators  for postsecondary education.   The State determined levels of performance for these indicators must  be expressed as a percentage of students and demonstrate that the State  is striving to improve year after year. States must determine the level  for each indicator for the group of all CTE concentrators, which are  the group of students at the secondary level taking  [[Page S5507]]  at least two courses in a single program or program of study, or at the  postsecondary level, students taking at least 12 credits in a single  program or program of study, and for each subgroup defined in the Every  Student Succeeds Act and for each special population defined in this  bill.   However, States are only held accountable for the group of all CTE  concentrators. One of the important changes in the law is that the  Secretary will no longer negotiate the levels of performance with the  States. Going forward, States will determine their levels and submit  them to the Secretary, who will approve them if they meet the  conditions highlighted earlier. This is a point worth saying again: The  bill heading to the President's desk eliminates any involvement by the  Secretary in determining levels of performance with the States.   However, a State is required to meet certain conditions in order to  have their plan approved by the Secretary. Specifically, the Secretary  must ensure that plan includes levels of performance and that those  levels of performance have been made public for comment. In the  submitted plan, the State must include the comments along with their  response to those comments. Further, the State must develop their plan  in consultation with various stakeholders and provide descriptions of  their goals and programs, how those meet employment and workforce  needs, and what they will do to close and eliminate performance gaps in  areas where gaps exist for subgroups and special populations.   If a State has met the requirements in developing their plan, then  the Secretary must approve the plan and may not alter or change the  elements of that plan.   The bill allows but does not require a State to revise the levels of  performance after 2 years. If a State elects to revise their levels,  the new level must not be below the average of the actual performance  of the previous 2 years. States may revise their levels downward when  taking advantage of this option, so long as it meets the requirements  of the law. Further, there has been some concerns raised that a State  would be required to go through an entire State plan process in order  to make revisions. The language in the bill is clear that a State  making revisions to their levels of performance need only seek public  comment on those targets and does not need to go through the more  extensive consultation process or an additional public comment period.  When submitting the revised levels to the Secretary, they must include  the public comments and the State response.   Heading into this reauthorization, a major concern of current law was  that there was too much burden on local schools that deterred many from  pursuing Federal funds. They cited the burdensome local plan, the  multitude of requirements and reporting burden. This bill addresses all  of those items and reduces burden for local governments.   First, this reauthorization focuses reporting and accountability on  just CTE concentrators, reducing the number of students States must  collect data on to only those truly enrolled in a CTE program. Second,  the number of requirements of what must be included in the local  application is reduced from 12 to 9. Third, the required use of funds  at the local level drops from nine to six.   One last item that I would like to address about the bill is its  accountability provisions. The bill maintains the current law structure  of accountability which requires that, if a State does not meet 90  percent of their State-determined level of performance for any of the  indicators, then the State must submit an improvement plan indicating  how it plans to improve.   If a State has not achieved 90 percent of their level of performance  after 2 years following the implementation of their improvement plan,  the Secretary is granted the discretion to withhold funds from that  State.   There are a number of education and business groups supporting this  bill, which include National Governor's Association, National School  Boards Association, Rebuilding America's Middle Class, U.S. Chamber of  Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, Jobs for the Future,  Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Contractors Association, Heating, Ventilation,  Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration Coalition, Education Trust, Boeing,  and IBM.   Chairwoman Foxx and Ranking Member Scott, along with Representative  Thompson and Representative Krishnamoorthi, deserve a good deal of  thanks for their work in the House on passing the Perkins CTE Act.   I also want to thank Senator Enzi and Senator Casey for their work in  the Senate on this bill. They have worked hard to reach a bipartisan  result and should receive the recognition they deserve for it.   I would also like to thank Ivanka Trump for her leadership in helping  create an environment where we could get a result. Her interest in  helping train the next generation of our country's workers and making  the reauthorization of this bill one of her priorities helped keep  Congress focused on passing this bill. I was pleased that she attended  our committee markup of the bill and thank her for her hard work.   I also want to thank the ranking member of the committee, Senator  Murray. This bill is another in a long list of accomplishments this  committee has achieved.   Finally, I would like to thank the following staff: from the  Congressional Research Service, Boris Granovskiy, Becky Skinner, and  Adam Stoll; from the Office of Legislative Counsel, Kristin Romero,  Margaret Bomba, and Amy Gaynor; from Senator Casey's office, Julia  Sferlazzo and Rachel McKinnon; from Senator Enzi's office, Tara Shaw,  Garnett Decosimo, and Steve Townsend; from Senator Murray's office,  Evan Schatz, Kara Marchione, Amanda Beaumont, and Katherine McClelland;  and my staff, David Cleary, Bob Moran, Jake Baker, Richard Pettey,  Bobby McMillin, and Lindsey Seidman.   I am pleased that President Trump signed this bill into law today to  help States and local communities meet the needs of the current and  future workforce.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed  in the Record the commitment letter  [[Page S5509]]  for the Animal Drug User Fee Agreements of 2018.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  Animal Drug User Fee Amendments of 2018    ADUFA Reauthorization Performance Goals and Procedures--FYs 2019 thru                                    2023         The goals and procedures of the FDA Center for Veterinary       Medicine (CVM) as agreed to under the ``Animal Drug User Fee       Amendments of 2018'' are summarized as follows:                                I. Definitions         1. For the application/submission goals below, the term       ``review and act on'' is understood to mean the issuance of a       complete action letter after the complete review of an animal       drug application, supplemental animal drug application, or       investigational animal drug submission which either (1)       approves an animal drug application or supplemental       application or notifies a sponsor that an investigational       animal drug submission is complete or (2) sets forth in       detail the specific deficiencies in such animal drug       application, supplemental animal drug application, or       investigational animal drug submission and, where       appropriate, the actions necessary to place such an       application, supplemental application, or submission in       condition for approval. Within 30 days 17 of submission, FDA       shall refuse to file an animal drug application, supplemental       animal drug application, or their reactivation, which is       determined to be insufficient on its face or otherwise of       unacceptable quality for review upon initial inspection as       per 21 CFR 514.110. Thus, the Agency will refuse to file an       application containing numbers or types of errors, or flaws       in the development plan, sufficient to cause the quality of       the entire submission to be questioned to the extent that it       cannot reasonably be reviewed. Within 60 days of submission,       FDA will refuse to review an investigational animal drug       submission which is determined to be insufficient on its face       or otherwise of unacceptable quality upon initial inspection       using criteria and procedures similar to those found in 21       CFR 514.110. A decision to refuse to file an application or       to refuse to review a submission as described above will       result in the application or submission not being entered       into the cohort upon which the relevant user fee goal is       based. The Agency will keep a record of the numbers and types       of such refusals and include them in its annual performance       report.        2. A minor amendment is understood to mean information       requested by FDA during the review of the application or       investigational submission. FDA may request minor amendments       to animal drug applications, supplemental animal drug       applications, and investigational animal drug submissions       during its review of the application or submission. At its       discretion, the Agency may extend an internal due date (but       not a user fee goal) to allow for the complete review of an       application or submission for which a minor amendment is       requested. If a pending application is amended with       significant changes, the amended application may be       considered resubmitted, thereby effectively resetting the       clock to the date FDA received the amendment. The same policy       applies for investigational animal drug submissions.        3. The term ``submission date'' means the date the FDA       Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) Electronic Submission       System (ESS) receives an application or submission. Upon       receipt of an application or submission, the CVM ESS creates       an electronic receipt that contains the date of receipt and       is sent to the submitter.        4. The term ``labeling supplement'' is understood to mean       certain applications as described in 21 CFR 514.8(c)(2)(i)(A)       and (D) that require approval of a supplemental application       prior to distribution of the drug made using the change.        5. The term ``presubmission conference'' (PSC) is       understood to mean one or more conferences between a       potential applicant and FDA as described in 21 CFR 514.5 to       reach a binding agreement establishing a submission or       investigational requirement.        6. The term ``dosage characterization'' is understood to       mean a justification of the dosage (dose or dose range,       dosing frequency, and the dosing duration) and a       characterization of the critical aspects of the dose response       relationship related to each intended use and associated       conditions of use.                       II. Application/Submission Goals         Beginning October 1, 2018, all applications and submissions       under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act)       section 512(b) and 571 must be created using the eSubmitter       tool and submitted to the Agency through CVM's ESS.      1. Original New Animal Drug Applications (NADAs)        Review and act on 90 percent of original NADAs within 180       days after the submission date.        An application is incomplete if it would require additional       data or information to enable the Agency to complete a       comprehensive review of the application and reach a decision       on the issue(s) presented in the application.        The Agency will review and act on 90 percent of reactivated       applications:        i Within 180 days after the reactivated NADA submission       date if the Agency determines and notifies the sponsor that       the deficiencies are substantial;        ii Within 135 days after the reactivated NADA submission       date if the Agency determines and notifies the sponsor that       the deficiencies are not substantial; and the NADA       reactivation must be submitted no more than 120 days after       the Agency's dated incomplete letter to qualify for the       shorter review time; and        iii Within 180 days alter the reactivated NADA submission       date if the NADA reactivation is submitted after 120 days of       the Agency's dated incomplete letter or new substantial       information is provided in the reactivated application.        The Agency will generally favor using the shorter       reactivation timeframe of 135 days, where possible. The       Agency will state in the incomplete letter the appropriate       timeframe for review of the reactivation. Sponsors wishing to       discuss the selected timeframe should contact the Agency       prior to reactivation of the application. The shorter review       time of 135 days for reactivated NADAs for which the       deficiencies are determined not to be substantial is not       intended to prevent the use of minor amendments during Agency       review of an application.      2. Administrative NADAs        Review and act on 90 percent of administrative NADAs (NADAs       filed after all scientific decisions already have been made       as part of the investigational new animal drug process)       within 60 days after the filing date.      3. Non-manufacturing Supplemental Animal Drug Applications        Review and act on 90 percent of non-manufacturing       supplemental animal drug applications (i.e. supplemental       animal drug applications for which safety or effectiveness       data are required) within 180 days after the submission date.        A supplemental application is incomplete if it would       require additional data or information to enable the Agency       to complete a comprehensive review of the supplement and       reach a decision on the issue (s) presented in the       supplement.        The Agency will review and act on 90 percent of reactivated       supplements:        i Within 180 days after the reactivated supplemental NADA       submission date if the Agency determines and notifies the       sponsor that the deficiencies are substantial;        ii Within 135 days after the reactivated supplemental NADA       submission date if the Agency determines and notifies the       sponsor that the deficiencies are not substantial; and the       reactivation to the supplemental application must be       submitted no more than 120 days after the Agency's dated       incomplete letter to qualify for the shorter review time; and        iii Within 180 days after the reactivated supplemental NADA       submission date if the reactivation to the supplemental       application is submitted after 120 days of the Agency's dated       incomplete letter or new substantial information is provided       in the reactivated supplement.        The Agency will generally favor using the shorter       reactivation timeframe of 135 days, where possible. The       Agency will state in the incomplete letter the appropriate       timeframe for review of the reactivation. Sponsors wishing to       discuss the selected timeframe should contact the Agency       prior to the reactivation of the supplement. The shorter       review time of 135 days for reactivated supplements for which       the deficiencies are determined not to be substantial is not       intended to prevent the use of minor amendments during Agency       review of a supplemental application.      4. Prior Approval Manufacturing Supplemental NADAs and           Reactivations        Review and act on 90 percent of Prior Approval       manufacturing supplemental NADAs within 120 days after the       submission date. A Prior Approval manufacturing supplemental       NADA includes: one or more major manufacturing changes as       described in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(ii) and in accordance with       Guidance for Industry 83 (Chemistry, Manufacturing, and       Controls Changes to an Approved NADA or ANADA); and, changes       submitted as ``Supplement-Changes Being Effected in 30 Days''       that require prior approval according to 21 CFR       514.8(b)(3)(v)(A). If a Prior Approval supplement does not       clearly identify any major manufacturing changes, the Prior       Approval supplement will be designated by the Agency as a       ``Supplement-Changes Being Effected'' with a 180 days review       goal (see ``Supplement-Changes Being Effected Manufacturing       Supplemental NADAs and Reactivations'' below).        A submission is incomplete if it requires additional data       or information to enable the Agency to complete a       comprehensive review of the submission and reach a decision       on the issue(s) presented in the submission. If the Agency       determines that the deficiencies are not substantial for       manufacturing supplements requiring prior approval, the       Agency will allow the manufacturing supplements to be       resubmitted as ``Supplement Changes Being Effected in 30       Days'' as described in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3) and the drug made       with the change can be distributed 30 days after the       resubmission according to 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3)(iv). The Agency       will review and act on 90 percent of these reactivated       manufacturing supplements within 180 days after the       resubmission date of a complete submission. If the Agency       determines that the deficiencies remain substantial or new       substantial information is provided, prior-approval is       required according to 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3)(v)(A). The Agency       will review and act on 90 percent of these reactivated       manufacturing supplements within 120 days after the       resubmission date of a complete submission.  [[Page S5510]]           5. Supplements--Changes Being Effected Manufacturing           Supplemental NADAs and Reactivations        Review and act on 90 percent of ``Supplement--Changes Being       Effected'' manufacturing supplemental NADAs and reactivations       submitted according to 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3)(vi) and in       accordance with Guidance for Industry 83 (Chemistry,       Manufacturing, and Controls Changes to an Approved NADA or       ANADA), including manufacturing changes not requiring prior       approval according to 21 CFR 514.8(b)(3) within 180 days       after the submission date.      6. Investigational New Animal Drug (INAD) Study Submissions        Review and act on 90 percent of INAD study submissions       within 180 days after the submission date.        An INAD study submission is incomplete if it would require       additional data or information to enable the Agency to       complete a comprehensive review of the submission and reach a       decision on the issue(s) presented in the submission.        The Agency will review and act on 90 percent of       resubmissions:        i Within 180 days after the resubmitted INAD study       submission date if the Agency determines and notifies the       sponsor that the deficiencies are substantial;        ii Within 60 days after the resubmitted INAD study       submission date if the Agency determines and notifies the       sponsor that the deficiencies are not substantial; and the       resubmission must be submitted no more than 120 days after       the Agency's dated incomplete letter to qualify for the       shorter review time; and        iii Within 180 days after the resubmitted INAD study       submission date if the resubmission is submitted after 120       days of the Agency's dated incomplete letter or new       substantial information is provided in the resubmission.        The Agency will generally favor using the shorter       resubmission timeframe of 60 days, where possible. The Agency       will state in the incomplete letter the appropriate timeframe       for review of the resubmission. Sponsors wishing to discuss       the selected timeframe should contact the Agency prior to       resubmitting the application. The shorter review time of 60       days for resubmissions for which the deficiencies are       determined not to be substantial is not intended to prevent       the use of minor amendments during Agency review of a       submission.        Review and act on 90 percent of microbial food safety       hazard characterization submissions within 100 days after the       submission date.      7. INAD Protocols without Data Submissions        Review and act on 90 percent of INAD submissions consisting       of protocols without data, that the Agency and the sponsor       consider to be an essential part of the basis for making the       decision to approve or not approve an NADA or supplemental       NADA, within 50 days after the submission date.        An INAD protocol without data submission is incomplete if       it would require additional information to enable the Agency       to complete a comprehensive review of the protocol and reach       a decision on the issue(s) presented in the protocol.        The Agency will review and act on 90 percent of resubmitted       INAD protocol without data submissions:        i Within 50 days after the resubmission date if the Agency       determines and notifies the sponsor that the deficiencies are       substantial;        ii Within 20 days after the resubmitted INAD protocol       without data submission if the Agency determines and notifies       the sponsor that the deficiencies are not substantial; and       the resubmission must be submitted no more than 120 days       after the Agency's dated nonconcurrence letter to qualify for       the shorter review time; and        iii Within 50 days after the resubmission date if the       resubmission is submitted after 120 days of the Agency's       dated non-concurrence letter or new substantial information       is provided in the resubmission.        The Agency will generally favor using the shorter       resubmission timeframe of 20 days, where possible. The Agency       will state in the non-concurrence letter the appropriate       timeframe for review of the resubmission. Sponsors wishing to       discuss the selected timeframe should contact the Agency       prior to resubmission of the protocol without data. The       shorter review time of 20 days for resubmitted INAD protocol       without data submissions for which the deficiencies are       determined not to be substantial is not intended to prevent       the use of minor amendments during Agency review of a       submission.        Sponsors are not required to submit study protocols for       review. However, for each protocol voluntarily submitted       prior to the commencement of the study that the Agency and       the sponsor consider to be an essential part of the basis for       making the decision to approve or not approve an animal drug       application or supplemental animal drug application, the       Agency will issue a complete action letter providing comments       resulting from a complete review of the protocol. The       complete action letter will be as detailed as possible       considering the quality and level of detail of the protocol       submission; will include a succinct assessment of the       protocol; and will state whether the Agency agrees,       disagrees, or lacks sufficient information to reach a       decision that the protocol design, execution plans, and data       analyses are adequate to achieve the objectives of the study.        If the Agency determines that a protocol is acceptable,       this represents an agreement that the data generated by the       protocol can be used to support a safety or effectiveness       decision regarding the subject animal drug. The fundamental       agreement is that having agreed to the design, execution,       or analyses proposed in protocols reviewed under this       process, the Agency will not later alter its perspectives       on the issues of design, execution, or analyses unless the       Agency by written order determines that a substantiated       scientific requirement essential to the assessment of the       study appeared after the Agency's protocol assessment, or       public or animal health concerns unrecognized at the time       of protocol assessment under this process are evident.        The Agency will permit comparability protocols as described       in 21 CFR 514.8(b)(2)(v) to be submitted as protocols without       substantial data in an INAD file. The Agency will review and       act on 90 percent of INAD submissions consisting of protocols       without substantial data within 50 days after the submission       date of the protocol. For potentially more complex       comparability protocols, for example sterile process       validation protocols, the sponsor should discuss and have       Agency concurrence regarding the appropriate filing strategy.      8. Labeling Supplements        Review and act on 90 percent of qualifying labeling       supplements as described in 21 CFR 514.8(c)(2)(i)(A) and (D)       within 60 days after the submission date. Qualifying labeling       supplements are defined as those for which the sponsor       provides and certifies a complete list of label changes made       in the application and that CVM can determine upon initial       review do not decrease the safety of drug use.        The Agency will review and act on 90 percent of non-      qualifying labeling supplements within 180 days after the       submission date.        Additional Performance Goals      Work Queue Review Procedures        The Agency will review all submissions in accordance with       procedures for working within a queue. An application/      submission that is not reviewed within the applicable       Application/Submission Goal time frame (noted above) will be       reviewed with the highest possible priority among those       pending.                    iii. pre-approval foreign inspections         The Agency and regulated industry are committed to       improving the review and business processes that will       facilitate the timely scheduling and conducting of pre-      approval inspections (PAIs). To improve the timeliness and       predictability of foreign PAIs, sponsors may voluntarily       submit 1) at the beginning of the calendar year, a list of       foreign manufacturing facilities that are specified in an       animal drug application, supplemental animal drug       application, or investigational animal drug submission and       may be subject to foreign PAIs for the following fiscal year;       and 2) a notification 30 days prior to submitting an NADA, a       supplemental NADA, or INAD submission that informs the Agency       that the application/submission includes a foreign       manufacturing facility. Should any changes to the annual list       occur after its submission to the Agency, the sponsor may       provide the updated information to the Agency.        The Agency will keep a record of the number of foreign PAIs       conducted for new animal drug applications, along with the       average time for completing the PAIs, and include this       information in its annual performance report. The time for       completing the PAI is understood to mean the time from the       inspection scheduling request through notification to the       Center of inspectional findings.                         iv. foreign gmp inspections         The Agency commits to working to implement the US-EU GMP       Inspection Mutual Recognition Agreement starting in FY 2019       for establishments manufacturing animal/veterinary drugs. The       Agency will provide annual progress updates to the industry.      1. Supporting Information for Presubmission Conferences and           INAD Protocols without Data Submissions        The Agency and the regulated industry agree that data and/      or information which uniquely describes the general       attributes of the new animal drug (e.g. the known       characteristics of the drug that can impact safety,       effectiveness and/or quality) needs to be submitted early in       the new animal drug development process in order to enable       the parties to reach agreement at a presubmission conference       or to begin review of a protocol. The intent of this       provision is to avoid the submission of data or information       between the presubmission conference and the submission of a       protocol. Eligibility both for short justifications in       protocols and for concurrent supporting data and protocol       review described below is predicated on the sponsor       submitting information early in the new animal drug       development process.        The Agency will allow for the inclusion of this data and/or       information in presubmission conferences; however it would       not preclude holding a presubmission conference without such       data.        The Agency will allow short justifications within INAD       protocols without data submissions that are limited in scope       (e.g., no more than ten pages or no more than two (peer-      reviewed) journal articles).        The Agency will allow for the concurrent submission of       supporting data (INAD H submissions) and protocols (INAD E       submissions) provided that the protocol is not submitted       until the supporting data has been in the Agency's queue for       at least 50 days.  [[Page S5511]]           2. Dosage Characterization        The Agency and the regulated industry agree that dosage       characterization is part of the effectiveness technical       section of an investigational new animal drug file. In       instances where data and/or information about the dosage is       integral to the review of a protocol, the Agency and the       regulated industry agree that this data and/or information       should be submitted as supporting data (INAD H submission)       well in advance of the protocol submission. Such information       may be needed to ensure selection of optimal study time       points and would be particularly important for novel drugs       and drugs with modified-release characteristics.      3. Animal Drug Availability Act (ADAA) Combination Medicated           Feeds Applications        Review and act on 90 percent of qualifying ADAA Combination       Medicated Feeds Applications within 60 days after the       submission date. An ADAA combination application will qualify       for the 60 day review timeframe only if the following       criteria are met:        i. The regulatory requirements for an ADAA combination       application have been met as outlined in 21 CFR       514.4(c)(2)(ii)        ii. A presubmission conference has been conducted and       either        a. No data are needed (i.e., no tissue residue non-      interference study is required) and this is documented in the       memorandum of conference for the presubmission conference; or        b. A justification for not conducting a tissue residue       noninterference study has been submitted, reviewed and found       acceptable under an INAD, prior to the submission of the ADAA       combination application; or        c. A tissue residue non-interference study has been       submitted, reviewed and found acceptable under an INAD, prior       to the submission of the ADAA combination application.        iii. No effectiveness or target animal safety data are       required.        iv. No manufacturing data requirements- sponsor can address       in meeting assay non-interference, but data submission is not       required.        v. All other information is referenced to previous drug       experience reports.        vi. Sponsor makes submission and it includes: Bluebird       labeling, Veterinary Feed Directive (if applicable).        vii. Includes a request for categorical exclusion from the       need to prepare an environmental assessment (EA); i.e., no EA       required.        viii. Reference to presubmission conference.        ix. Right of reference (if applicable) to NADA(s) not owned       by the filing sponsor of the ADAA combination application has       been received by the Agency.        Review and act on 90 percent of ADAA combination       applications within 100 days for those applications initially       accepted for the 60-day timeframe but subsequently determined       to need minor amendments.        If any of the above conditions cannot be met, the ADAA       combination application will be given a 180-day review       timeframe and placed in the original NADA application cohort.      4. Categorical Exclusions        Review and act on 90 percent of resubmissions of a       previously completed Environmental Impact technical section       within 60 days after the resubmission date where:        i. A Categorical Exclusion was issued; and        ii. All other technical sections have been submitted; and        iii. Information contained in the other technical sections       reveals a change in the conditions of use of the drug that       may affect the previous determination of categorical       exclusion.      5. Presubmission Conferences        Conduct 90% of qualifying presubmission conferences within       a 60-day timeframe when all of the following conditions are       met:        i. All background materials, including presentations, have       been submitted, and        ii. A complete agenda has been agreed upon by the Agency       and the sponsor        A sponsor and the Agency can mutually agree to exclude a       particular presubmission conference from this performance       goal. If a sponsor accepts a date beyond the 60-day timeframe       for their scheduling purposes or is unable to meet with the       Agency on Agency available dates, the submission will be       excluded from the presubmission conference cohort.      6. Tissue Residue Method        Commence 90% of tissue residue method demonstrations within       120 days of completion of the ``3-hour meeting'' process or       equivalent process milestone where there is a single       laboratory validation tissue residue method demonstration.                            V. Workload Adjustment         The workload adjustment will continue to be calculated per       CVM Program Policy and Procedures Manual 1243.3022, except       that, for purposes of calculating the workload adjustment, it       has been agreed to reset the base years to FY 2014-FY 2018.       There will be no workload adjustment for FY 2019. Workload       adjustments are one-time adjustments, and are calculated       annually.                            ____________________
