 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1865,  the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of  2017, and urge my colleagues to do the same.   This legislation will finally make a meaningful difference in  combating online sex trafficking. For too long, bad actor websites have  operated with impunity in selling young women and girls forced into the  commercial sale of sex. They have, beyond any shadow of a doubt,  profited off the misery of others. They have convinced courts to  misapply the Communications Decency Act, a Federal law that was  originally intended to encourage websites to police content and rid  platforms of illegal content. They have misused the Communications  Decency Act as a shield to avoid criminal liability in State courts.   Given the number of local websites that are deliberately selling  women and children for sex, we must now take steps to allow Federal,  State, and local prosecutors to hold these websites accountable and  dismantle these illicit, heinous online markets.    H.R. 1865 will ensure vigorous criminal enforcement against bad actor  websites by creating a new Federal law to prosecute these sites and  explicitly permitting States the ability to enforce comparable laws.   While the Federal code does not criminalize the knowing advertisement  of sex trafficking, this statute is, unfortunately, of limited utility.  Nearly all websites responsible for rampant sex trafficking  advertisements host ads that rarely, if ever, state that the victim  being sold is either underage or subject to force, fraud, or coercion.   Therefore, this bill takes measures to target websites that are  deliberately promoting and facilitating prostitution.   Additionally, H.R. 1865 provides for an aggravated violation that  applies to websites that promote prostitution in reckless disregard of  the fact that sex trafficking is occurring on their platform.   I want to highlight, Mr. Chairman, an amendment that will be offered  to this legislation. Though I applaud my colleague's dedication to this  issue and fully appreciate the suffering of victims, I have concerns  about this amendment which states that the provisions of the bill apply  regardless of whether the conduct alleged occurred or is alleged to  have occurred before, on, or after such date of enactment.   Had regular order been followed, Mr. Chairman, the Judiciary  Committee would certainly have fixed this issue, which I believe could  subject this legislation to a constitutional challenge under the ex  post facto clause, a concern shared by the Justice Department.   I hope we have an opportunity to fix this problem as we move forward  with the bill, and I include in the Record a  [[Page H1297]]  letter from the Department of Justice highlighting these constitutional  concerns.                                      Office of Legislative Affairs,                                      U.S. Department of Justice,                                  Washington, DC, February 27, 2018.      Hon. Robert W. Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter presents the views of the       Department of Justice (Department) on H.R. 1865, the ``Allow       States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of       2017.'' The Department supports H.R. 1865. We applaud House       and Senate legislative efforts to address the use of websites       to facilitate sex trafficking and to protect and restore       victims who were sold for sex online. The Department       appreciates this opportunity to provide technical assistance       to ensure that these goals are fully met through narrowly       tailored legislation. The Department also notes that a       provision in the bill raises a serious constitutional       concern.        Every day, trafficking victims in America appear in online       advertisements that are used to sell them for sex. The       Department works diligently to hold the traffickers       accountable for their crimes but faces serious challenges.       This is due in part to the high evidentiary standard needed       to bring federal criminal charges for advertising sex       trafficking, but also because the Communications Decency Act       (CDA), codified at 47 U.S.C. Sec. 230, bars our state and       local partners from bringing any criminal action that is       inconsistent with that section. H.R. 1865 addresses both       issues and would take meaningful steps to end the industry of       advertising trafficking victims for commercial sex.                             TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE         Section 3(a) of the bill creates 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2421A, a       new federal offense that prohibits the use or operation of       websites (and other means or facilities of interstate       commerce) with the intent to promote or facilitate       prostitution. The bill also provides for an aggravated felony       if the defendant recklessly disregards that the crime       contributed to sex trafficking as prohibited by 18 U.S.C.       Sec. 1591(a). Section 2421A would stand as a strong       complement to existing federal laws.        However, the Department notes that Section 2421A as       originally drafted is broader than necessary because it would       extend to situations where there is a minimal federal       interest, such as to instances in which an individual person       uses a cell phone to manage local commercial sex transactions       involving consenting adults. Therefore, the Department would       support amending the language of Section 2421A so that       Congress can clarify its intent to target traffickers using       or operating interactive computer services, as follows (with       a corresponding change to 2421A(b)): ``Whoever, using a       facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce or in or       affecting interstate or foreign commerce, owns, manages, or       operates an interactive computer service, as defined in       Section 230(f) of Title 47, United States Code, or conspires       or attempts to do so, with the intent to promote or       facilitate prostitution shall be fined under this title,       imprisoned for not more than 15 years, or both.''        The Department believes that any revision to 18 U.S.C.       Sec. 1591 to define ``participation in a venture'' is       unnecessary. Section 1591 already sets an appropriately high       burden of proof, particularly in cases involving advertising.       Under current law, prosecutors must prove that the defendant       knowingly benefitted from participation in a sex trafficking       venture, knew that the advertisement related to commercial       sex, and knew that the advertisement involved a minor or the       use of force, fraud, or coercion. See Backpage.com, LLC v.       Lynch, D.D.C., Civil Action No. 15-2155, Docket 16 (Oct. 24,       2016). While well intentioned, this new language would impact       prosecutions by effectively creating additional elements that       prosecutors must prove at trial. In the context of the bill,       which also permits States to bring actions for conduct       equivalent to Section 1591, we are also mindful that this       language could have unintended consequences as applied by the       States.        Section 4 of H.R. 1865 also sets forth critical revisions       to the CDA to permit state prosecutors to bring criminal       actions related to sex trafficking and the use of the       internet with the intent to promote or facilitate       prostitution. The Department believes that the existence of       this exception to the CDA will alter the landscape of the       industry involved in advertising prostitution.                            CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERN         We note that Section 4 of H.R. 1865 states that the changes       to the CDA ``shall apply regardless of whether the conduct       alleged occurred [sic], or is alleged to have occurred,       before, on, or after such date of enactment.'' This raises a       serious constitutional concern. Insofar as this bill would       ``impose[] a punishment for an act which was not punishable       at the time it was committed'' or ``impose[] additional       punishment to that then prescribed'' it would violate the       Constitution's Ex Post Facto Clause. Cummings v. Missouri, 4       Wall. 277, 325-326 (1867); see Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U.S. 167,       169-170 (1925); U.S. Const. art I, Sec. 9, cl. 3. The       Department objects to this provision because it is       unconstitutional. We would welcome the opportunity to work       with Congress to address this serious constitutional concern.        Thank you for the opportunity to present our views in       support of this legislation. We hope this information is       helpful, and we look forward to continuing to work with       Congress on this important legislation. Please do not       hesitate to contact this office if we may provide additional       assistance regarding this or any other matter. The Office of       Management and Budget has advised us that from the       perspective of the Administration's program, there is no       objection to submission of this letter.            Sincerely,                                                   Stephen E. Boyd,                                        Assistant Attorney General.     Nevertheless, Mr. Chairman, I will support this bill  since its strong reforms will allow State and local prosecutors to  vigorously enforce the law against some of the worst criminals in  society today.   This bill will allow law enforcement to effectively dismantle this  lucrative, expansive, immoral, reprehensible market. Our children and  vulnerable women are not commodities to be sold. This legislation  emphatically affirms that fact. It will truly make a difference.   I would like to commend my colleague Mrs. Wagner from Missouri and  her dedicated staff for their work on this legislation and for their  continued dedication to combatting sex trafficking and supporting  victims.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this important  legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   This amendment makes small but important changes to the bill.   Most significantly, the bill narrows the class of defendants covered  in the new section 2421A, which criminalizes the deliberate promotion  or facilitation of prostitution. As the creation of this law is  designed to target bad actor websites, this amendment narrows  defendants covered to those who own, manage, or operate an interactive  computer service with the intent to promote or facilitate prostitution.  This amendment avoids creating a broad Federal law that covers conduct  that is not necessarily Federal in nature.   Second, the manager's amendment strikes language from the underlying  bill's civil recovery provision that was intended to encourage victims  to successfully plead their cases. However, the language could have  created a risk of confusion by the courts, and so it has been removed.   Further, the manager's amendment clarifies that mandatory restitution  provision is only applicable to victims of sex trafficking, not to  those who voluntarily have engaged in prostitution.   Finally, the manager's amendment adds language inadvertently omitted  from the original bill, which permits defendants who face an aggravated  charge for promoting or facilitating more than five people to assert  the statute's affirmative defense if a defendant can prove that  advertisements were targeted to a locality where promotion or  facilitation is legal.  [[Page H1302]]    Mr. Chairman, this manager's amendment is the product of the  Judiciary Committee's repeated and thoughtful effort to produce a  workable and technically sound piece of legislation. This bill will do  a great deal to protect victims of sex trafficking. I am proud of the  hard work by my colleagues and staff to ensure that the criminal law is  appropriately tailored to achieve that goal.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
