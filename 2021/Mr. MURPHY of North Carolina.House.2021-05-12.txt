 Madam Speaker, at a time when the  economy should be roaring back, we just witnessed one of the worst  monthly job reports in history because of the Biden administration's  socialist policies.   Despite States loosening restrictions on businesses, the unemployment  rate has actually gone up. Why? Because the Democrats want to pay  people to sit at home rather than actually go to work. Republicans in  Congress warned about this, and, lo and behold, we were right.   While campaigning, candidate Biden promised to shut down the virus,  not the economy. Well, the virus has been shut down because of  Operation Warp Speed, yet now President Biden has shut down businesses  because he pays people to stay at home.   My eastern North Carolina district is set to have a huge tourist  season, but they can't find anybody to come to work, the same with  boatbuilders, hotels, and other businesses. They cannot open up  normally. They cannot open their doors because the administration's  socialist policies want to pay people to stay at home.   America, despite your government, you need to get back to work.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today, we celebrate  National Police Week. After the year our police officers have endured,  where radical activists sought to defund them, even with asinine  proposals to abolish them, it has never been more important to show our  appreciation to them.   For months, we have heard anti-American activists, and even some of  our colleagues, tell us that the act of policing is inherently evil and  unfixable. But, Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth.   Last year alone, 264 police officers from across this country gave  their lives while protecting their communities. Throughout it all, the  overwhelming majority of police officers are good men and women who  have stepped up for their communities and built mutual trust that is  vital to them doing their jobs.   Sure, there are bad apples out there. I am a physician. We have bad  apples in medicine, but we don't seek to abolish doctors or the  practice of medicine.   Nobody dislikes bad officers more than good officers because they  give the good officers a bad reputation. Ninety-nine percent of police  officers do their jobs with fairness, integrity,  [[Page H2259]]  and honor and should not be lumped in with the few officers that  disgrace their profession.   On the whole, police officers have done the best they can to defend  their communities over this past year. For their thanks, 23 American  cities have cut their budgets. Unsurprisingly, this has contributed to  the biggest crime wave of the 21st century, making their jobs even  harder and destroying decades of progress.   For instance, New York defunded their police by $1 billion. The  result is a 97 percent increase in shootings and a 45 percent increase  in homicides, especially crime in minority communities.   Make no mistake, these horrifying statistics can be traced directly  back to defunding the police. If it can happen to this legendary police  department in the country, the NYPD, it can happen anywhere, in your  neighborhood also.   In reality, we should be investing more in our police. The job of a  police officer is an incredibly difficult one. They are often asked to  make split-second decisions, which have enormous consequences. This is  why we should be providing them with more resources and training rather  than demonizing them.    I, along with my fellow Republican colleagues, will continue to stand  by the men and women in blue who faithfully and sacrificially serve  their communities and keep our families safe.
