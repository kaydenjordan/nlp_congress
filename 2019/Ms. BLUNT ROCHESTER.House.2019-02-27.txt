 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my  colleagues, Senator Tom Carper and Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, to  honor and congratulate Major General Carol Timmons for a lifetime of  dedicated service to our country.   After graduating from William Penn High School in 1977, Timmons  enrolled in college and enlisted in the Delaware National Guard. With a  childhood dream of becoming an airline pilot, her career in flight  would begin that very summer on a C-130 airplane in Savannah, Georgia.   Despite her love of airplanes, Air Force rules prevented women from  flying combat mission planes like the C-130. Due to these unfair  regulations, she joined the Army National Guard in 1980 and would learn  to fly noncombat Army helicopters like the UH-1 Huey.   Undeterred and committed to her dream, Timmons joined the Air Force  Reserves, where she flew noncombat support missions. She soon realized  her dream as Federal laws ended the discriminatory prohibition on women  flying in combat missions, and during Operation Desert Storm, then- Captain Timmons would become one of the first women to fly in combat.   Following that operation, her career would come full circle as she  rejoined the Delaware National Guard, flying the same C-130s she  learned to fly on and to operate in the beginning.   On January 8, 2012, then-Brigadier General Timmons would make history  by becoming the Delaware Air National Guard's first female commander,  and again on February 1, 2017, when she was promoted to the rank of  major general and made Adjutant General of the Delaware National Guard,  the Governor's chief military adviser, commanding 1,500 soldiers and  1,100 airmen.   During her storied 42-year career, she earned a Bronze Star for her  service in Afghanistan and has flown over 5,200 hours in the cockpit,  including 400 combat hours during contingencies spanning from  Operations Desert Shield to Inherent Resolve. She served on the  National Guard's Joint Diversity Executive Council and the Air Force  Reserve Policy Committee. She has received numerous honors, including  induction into the Delaware Aviation Hall of Fame and the Delaware  Women's Hall of Fame.   By refusing to compromise on her dream, Timmons broke down barriers,  blazed trails, and inspired women to let nothing stand in their way in  service to our Nation.   I join Senator Carper and Senator Coons in thanking Major General  Carol Timmons for her over four decades of service to our State and our  country, and we wish her the very best.                            ____________________
