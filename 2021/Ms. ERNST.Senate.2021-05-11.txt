 Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of Iowans  across our State to recognize the distinguished career, dedication, and  lifelong hard work of Mr. Ryan G. Tucker as he concludes his time as  president of the Iowa Funeral Directors Association, IFDA.   As many who know him will tell you, Ryan grew up with a spirited  commitment to his community, his family, and to others. A native of  Sumner, it did not take long for Ryan to begin working in the trade. As  a student at North Iowa Area Community College,  [[Page S2444]]  Ryan started as an employee at Fullerton Family Funeral Home in Mason  City. He would go on to study at Worsham College of Mortuary Science,  earning an internship in Fort Dodge under a former IFDA president,  Scott Graham.   His experiences early on in his career have led him to where he is  today, as co-owner of Kaiser-Corson Funeral Home in Waverly, Readlyn,  Shell Rock, and Denver, serving Iowa families with his critical work.   Ryan assumed his role as president of the IFDA at a time unlike any  other, as the COVID-19 pandemic tragically took hold early last year,  but, in the face of enormous challenges and uncertainty, Ryan displayed  steadfast leadership for his colleagues that surely allowed for  countless families to find comfort in such difficult times.   Ryan guided the IFDA through the pandemic, being especially focused  on ensuring the hard work of our State's funeral directors could  continue with safety top of mind. At the pandemic's start, Ryan issued  daily briefings to IFDA members that became vital. He provided  information about best practices, updates on policies and proclamations  by the Governor and State government, and materials to make sure that  Iowa funeral directors could continue to serve families while adhering  to public health limitations.   Ryan's lifetime of work, his dedication to his craft, and his  leadership in a uniquely challenging time have all undoubtedly made a  positive impact on the lives of countless Iowans. As he takes the next  step in his distinguished career and steps down as president of the  Iowa Funeral Directors Association, we wish him, his wife Kayla, and  his two sons, Colby and Griffin, all the best, and we thank Ryan for  everything that he has done for our State and our communities.                            ____________________
