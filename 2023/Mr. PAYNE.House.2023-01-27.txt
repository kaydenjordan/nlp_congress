 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to criticize the Strategic  Production Response Act.   This bill is a direct attack on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and  threatens our country's economic and national security.   The reserve was created in 1975 to protect Americans from another oil  embargo and create stability in our economy, and it was created by a  Republican President, Gerald Ford.   Now, Republicans want to connect oil releases from the reserve to  dangerous oil drilling on Federal lands.   The release of oil from the reserve helped lower gas prices by almost  $2 after the Russians invaded Ukraine. It helped working Americans put  food on the table and pay their rent during that time. But Republicans  want to punish middle-class Americans with higher gas prices and ruin  the environment in the process.   Mr. Speaker, it is a disgraceful bill, and they should be ashamed to  even introduce it.                            ____________________
