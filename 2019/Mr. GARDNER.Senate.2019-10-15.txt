 Madam President, today I wish to honor and  celebrate Dr. Michael Cherington of Castle Rock, CO. This fall, Dr.  Cherington is reaching the age of 85. He has lived a full life and  helped many others to do the same.   Born in Pittsburgh, PA in 1934, Michael, who often went by the  nickname ``Mickey'' showed initial greatness at age 10 when his father  arranged for him to play against the American chess champion, Arnold  Denker. Arnold defeated all the adult opponents in the room. Mickey's  game ended in a draw.  [[Page S5787]]    After graduating from the University of Pittsburgh, Mickey attended  Pitt Medical School, then moved to Colorado Springs for a year of  residency. During that year, he received an important letter  ``Greetings, You're being drafted into the U.S. Army.'' His extended  stay in Colorado with the Army would become the hook that kept him  happily in the State to this day, some 60 years later.   Dr. Cherington set up a private practice in neurology in Denver and  was made professor at the University of Colorado Medical School. He  served the community very well in both of these capacities, helping  thousands of patients in Colorado. As an author of dozens of articles  and other research, he became known internationally and traveled around  the world to meet with neurologists as new medical discoveries were  allowing people to be cured of ailments that were once a fatal  diagnosis.   His time in Colorado led him into an unusual field of neurology,  studying survivors of lightning strikes. His work in this field led to  a new nickname, ``Lightning Doctor'', and he would go on to publish  many articles about lightning injuries and how to avoid them. His work  led to the creation of the Lightning Data Center, which brought  together experts across several areas of expertise and disciplines.  Soon the Lightning Doctor was on local TV and beyond, including ABC's  ``20/20,'' ``National Geographic,'' and even ``Unsolved Mysteries.''  Through Mickey's work, he was able to help people avoid the doctor's  office, or worse, by educating them about lightning storms and  lightning safety.   Today, Dr. Cherington lives happily with his wife Nancy Cherington  and spends time with family and close friends. That chess player from  Pittsburgh can still be seen around a chess board--most likely on his  iPad--or spending time with his children or their nine grandchildren.   Thank you, Dr. Cherington, for your contributions in your work and  for those around you.                            ____________________
