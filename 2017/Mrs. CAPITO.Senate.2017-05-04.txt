 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate voted to pass  the Omnibus appropriations bill for 2017.   This bill is a product of bipartisan negotiations and hard work on  the part of our Appropriations Committee, of which I am proud to be a  member, and the leadership of both of our parties.   I am encouraged by the overwhelming support for this important  legislation that reflects our Nation's priorities and funds the  government in a responsible way. I am very pleased--and I can't  emphasize this enough; very pleased--that the bill includes a  bipartisan provision that keeps the promise of lifetime healthcare  benefits for 22,000 coal miners and their families, including 8,500  West Virginians--my home State.   Bankruptcies in the coal industry meant that these miners would have  lost their critical health insurance coverage at the end of last year.  We passed that little, short-term extension for 4 months, and it was  set to expire this coming week.   This appropriations bill provides certainty to these coal mining  families. Because of this bill, they will keep the healthcare they  earned through their years of hard work.   I worked closely with my West Virginia colleague, Senator Joe  Manchin, as well as our Representatives--Representatives David  McKinley, Evan Jenkins, and Alex Mooney--to get this permanent miners'  healthcare fix included in the bill.   I also want to particularly thank our majority leader, Senator Mitch  McConnell, for his leadership on behalf of the miners in West Virginia  and in his home State of Kentucky, and the rest of Appalachia. I would  also like to thank my fellow Republican from the State of Ohio, Senator  Rob Portman, who was a champion for those miners as well.   But, most importantly, I would like to thank the miners from across  coal country who came to Washington to advocate for their healthcare  benefits. I met with dozens--probably hundreds, over the course of the  years--of West Virginia miners in my office over the last several  years.   Last September, miners came by the thousands to the west front of the  Capitol and stood for hours in just excruciatingly hot conditions.  These miners and their families put a human face on the issue. They are  the reason--they are the reason--that we have a successful result  today.   Many of these miners have shared their stories with me through  letters and emails and personal stories and visits, and I want to share  just a few of their thoughts.   Brenda, a coal miner's widow from West Virginia, wrote that continued  healthcare coverage presented a life or death situation for her. She  wrote:         I have medical problems, which require monthly doctor       visits and prescriptions and I will no longer be able to see       my doctors--nor afford the prescriptions should our health       insurance be taken away.    Alfred, a retired West Virginia coal miner wrote:         We were not given our health benefits as a gift. We worked       hard in the mines every day for a long time, and it was       backbreaking, year-to-year.    Howard, another retiree, wrote that he worked in the West Virginia  coal mines for 41 years to earn this promise of healthcare benefits.   William, also a retired West Virginia miner, wrote that he has had  several surgeries, including one on New Year's Day, 2017. The possible  expiration of health benefits and the thought of temporary benefit  extensions left him worried about whether he would be able to access  necessary followup medical care for his surgery.   After learning that permanent healthcare would be included in this  bill, Gisele wrote:         Tonight I will rest soundly knowing that we will be able to       afford our medicines.   [[Page S2766]]     For Brenda, Alfred, William, Howard, Gisele, and thousands of other  miners and widows across West Virginia, this bill keeps the promise of  lifetime healthcare.   There is more work to be done to protect the pension benefits of our  retired miners and to bring jobs back to coal country, to areas that  have been hit hard by the previous administration's policies. But the  permanent healthcare in this bill is a critical victory for our coal  mining families and the communities where they live.   I would also like to quote a young man who sent me an email. I met  him at a Chick-fil-A on a Saturday--not a Sunday, of course, on a  Saturday. We struck up a little friendship, and the day he learned that  this was in the bill, he texted me and said:         Senator, I met you in the Chick-fil-A. Thank you, you have       now secured the benefits for my Paw Paw.    I thought it was such a heartfelt message that he sent to me--a new  friend of mine who had been struggling along trying to figure out a way  to help his grandfather.   There are a number of other important priorities in this bill as  well. Mining communities will also be helped by tens of millions of  dollars across different agencies to help us retrain our miners who  have lost their jobs.   This bill also includes a significant investment in new fossil energy  research, including carbon capture and sequestration. These funds will  help spur the development of new markets for coal to keep coal mining  jobs for years to come.   The appropriations bill also includes funding increases for rural  broadband deployment, something I have been very concerned about, as  well as continued funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission.  Access to broadband is absolutely critical for economic development and  improved access to health and education opportunities in our rural  communities, and we are sadly underserved. There is much work to be  done to bring access to high-speed internet to many communities, but  this bill is a positive step.   As chairman of the Financial Services and General Government  Appropriations Subcommittee, I am glad that we included increased  funding for the Drug-Free Communities Support Program and the High  Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Program, or the HITDA Program.  Unfortunately, cascading across this country is the devastating problem  of prescription drug abuse, opioid abuse, and heroin addiction. The  Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education portion of the bill  includes an $800 million increase to combat opioid addiction. This  includes the $500 million authorized for the 21st Century Cures Act to  help States with their response to the crisis. It also includes an  increase for medication-assisted treatment programs and for other  programs outlined by the CARA bill that we passed last summer.   In addition to these important treatment resources, we have also  funded important enforcement and prevention aspects of the problem as  well, including $50 million for the Department of Veterans Affairs for  opioid and substance abuse for the treatment of our veterans. This is a  real problem for our returning veterans who have addiction issues.  There are funds to implement the Jason Simcakoski act that Senator  Baldwin and I introduced.   Unfortunately, West Virginia is the epicenter of the opioid crisis  that has struck communities across the country. Passage of this  appropriations bill will make a difference--a big difference--for  people who are struggling to overcome addiction and to help our States  that are financially strapped and our local communities combat this  terrible problem.   Another area of significance to a lot of people in my State and  across the country is the increase in the funding for the National  Institutes of Health. There is a $400 million increase for Alzheimer's  research--something important to me, as I lost both of my parents who  suffered from Alzheimer's, this terrible disease. We need to find not  just treatments, but we need to find a cure, and I think NIH is where  we are going to find it.   There are many other reasons to support this bill. It has additional  flood relief for our devastated flood areas. I know the Presiding  Officer has major floods in Louisiana, and we had them in West  Virginia, and we have had them across the country.   Just to mention a few other things, this bill includes a pay increase  for our troops, which is so important. They are on the frontlines.   The bill also works on scientific research for our educational  institutions, something important to our universities in West Virginia.   But, most of all, I just want to voice my appreciation for the  bipartisan work by the members of the appropriations committees, who  worked hard to get this bill where we are. It is a responsible bill. It  is a commonsense bill. It sets our priorities. Today, because of the  fact that we passed it with support from both parties, I believe it  will achieve a positive result for our country.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
