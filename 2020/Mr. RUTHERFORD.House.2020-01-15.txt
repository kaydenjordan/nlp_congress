 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Richard  N. Reilly on a well-deserved retirement after many years of service to  the United States of America.   Richard has been a U.S. State Department Pearson Fellow in my  Washington, D.C., office over this past year and has provided  invaluable guidance and assistance to both my staff and my  constituents.   A native of Minnesota, Rich began his service to our Nation as an  Army infantryman and then he continued on later with a 20-year career  as a naval officer. Following his time in the military, Rich joined the  State Department as a Foreign Service officer advocating for America's  interests abroad.   On behalf of the Fourth District of Florida and a grateful Nation, I  offer my heartfelt thanks to Rich for his many contributions to our  country and wish him a relaxing and fulfilling retirement enjoyed with  wife, Susan; his children; and their new granddaughter, Peyton.   Congratulations, Rich.                            ____________________
