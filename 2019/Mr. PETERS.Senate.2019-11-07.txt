 Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that I  hear from families all across Michigan, the rising cost of prescription  drugs. Recently, I held roundtables in several communities across  Michigan to hear directly from families, local health providers, and  medical professionals about the increasing cost of prescription drugs.  I want to share a few of those stories.   I heard from Diane in Grand Rapids, whose son, Jared, suffered a  severe asthma attack that tragically resulted in his death. He was just  25 years old. Diane said her son had insurance, but it was not enough  and he tried stretching out usage of his asthma medication to deal with  ever-rising costs. Diane shared just how unimaginable her pain was to  lose her child to a condition  [[Page S6468]]  that should have been manageable, with affordable life-sustaining  medications.   I heard from Rachael from Greenville who has three children with Type  1 diabetes, but insurance denied coverage for her children's insulin,  making it simply unaffordable. So Rachael's family drove across the  border into Canada where she said they were able to purchase insulin  for $71 per box, compared to about $600 for the exact same insulin in  Michigan. Rachael is rightfully angry that she needed to travel to  another country simply to get her children the insulin they need to  stay alive.   Sheron from Detroit told me about the financial challenges of  treating sarcoidosis, a rare disease, while also fighting triple- negative breast cancer. Sheron said that insurance was going to charge  her $5,000 for medication she could easily take at home, but it would  completely cover it only if she went to the hospital. The last thing  Sheron wanted to do was trek to the hospital as she coped with the side  effects of chemotherapy.   And I heard from Jeanette from Burton, who had a nearly $500 co-pay  for a prescription while undergoing treatment for thyroid cancer, but  without the help of a charitable patient group, she could not afford  the medication. While working to get assistance, she went without her  medication and could have suffered serious complications.   Unfortunately, these are not isolated stories, and these are not  isolated individuals. Too many Michiganders are struggling with rising  prescription drug costs, and the consequences can be literally life- threatening. Between 2012 and 2018, prices for brand-name drugs in the  United States have increased 68 percent, making critical medications  out of reach for most families.   The list price in 2017 for a 1-year supply of Humira--the No. 1  selling brand-name drug that treats arthritis, psoriasis, and Crohn's  disease--was over $58,000. That is more than the annual median income  for people in the State of Michigan.   The price of insulin has spiked in recent years, growing by 55  percent since 2014. That is simply outrageous, and it is simply  unacceptable. Guided by the stories from Michigan families and medical  professionals, I am working to examine and tackle the rising cost of  prescription drugs.   Earlier this week, through my work as ranking member of the Senate  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I announced I am  conducting an investigation into the skyrocketing costs of prescription  drugs. I am also investigating the growing shortages of critical  medications affecting hospitals and patients throughout the country.   Unaffordable prescription and hospital-administered drugs--and the  increasing number and length of drug shortages--have become an  economic, national security, and public health crisis for Michigan, as  well as for the rest of the country.   Through my investigation, I am working to: 1, identify solutions to  address increasing drug costs; 2, evaluate the effect of drug shortages  on patient care; 3, examine the national security implications of our  growing reliance on drugs manufactured overseas, primarily in China and  India.   This investigation builds on some of my previous efforts, including  my call for the Food and Drug Administration to share information on  the Administration's efforts to counter drug shortages--and my bill  advancing in the Senate to lower healthcare costs for seniors through  Medicare Part B. For many people in Michigan and across the country,  being able to afford your medicine is a matter of life and death, and  we must take action.   We must allow certainly for safe drug importation from Canada, but  let me be clear: Going to Canada is not a solution. You need to be able  to purchase affordable, quality, safe prescription drugs in the United  States.   We must improve competition, end price gouging, increase price  transparency, and hold drug companies accountable.   We must enable Medicare to negotiate drug prices for seniors. We must  eliminate drug shortages to ensure that all patients can get the  medication they need when they need it, and we must work to bring more  affordable generic medications to the market.   Families in Michigan and across the country are counting on us.  Families should never be forced to choose between paying their bills or  getting the medication they need. But sadly, that is the choice that  too many families are facing today.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to remember John James  Conyers, Jr., of Detroit, MI, the longest serving Black Congressman in  history and a champion for civil rights and social justice. Sadly, Mr.  Conyers passed away last week at the age of 90. Mr. Conyers was  passionate about serving his country and his constituents, always  fighting for those without a voice.   Mr. Conyers was born in Detroit, MI on May 16, 1929, to John and  Lucille Conyers. After graduating from Northwestern High School, Mr.  Conyers worked as a welder for Lincoln automotive while attending Wayne  State University. He served in the Michigan National Guard before  enlisting in the U.S. Army during the Korean war, where he served as a  second lieutenant. After 4 years of service, he was honorably  discharged and returned to Wayne State University to obtain his  bachelor's degree in 1957 and his law degree in 1958.   In 1958, Mr. Conyers continued his life of service as a legal aide to  Representative John Dingell, Jr., of Detroit. He then ran for Congress  in 1964 and for the next 53 years, represented metro Detroit in a  career full of many historic firsts for civil rights and the Black  community.   Mr. Conyers was on the frontlines of the civil rights movement. He  was a cosponsor of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and worked with Martin  Luther King, Jr., in Selma, AL to advocate for equal rights. In 1967,  during the civil unrest in Detroit, Mr. Conyers was in the streets,  encouraging peace and an end to the rioting. After the tragic  assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., in 1968, Mr. Conyers  introduced legislation to forever remember Dr. King's legacy with a  Federal holiday. He reintroduced his bill every session until it was  signed into law in 1983. He also hired civil rights legend Rosa Parks  to work in his Detroit office, where she stayed for over 20 years.   In Congress, Mr. Conyers was a founding member of the Congressional  Black Caucus. He also served on and was chairman of the House Oversight  Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. By the end of his service,  he was the longest serving African-American Congressman in history, as  well as the dean of the House of Representatives.   As an activist, trailblazer, and leader, Mr. Conyers will be greatly  missed across Michigan, as he touched the lives of many people  throughout Michigan. Mr. Conyers is survived by his wife of 29 years,  Monica, and his two sons, John and Carl.   Mr. President, I cannot express enough the impact Mr. John Conyers,  Jr., had on the city of Detroit and the State of Michigan. He was a  pillar of our community and a model of humble leadership. His passion  and tenacity will be missed. However, I am confident his legacy will  continue to inspire others to serve and fight for justice and equality  for all.                            ____________________
