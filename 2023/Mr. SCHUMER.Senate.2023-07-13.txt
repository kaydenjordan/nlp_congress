 I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, I moved to proceed to the  National Defense Authorization Act. We will have our first vote on  Tuesday.   This bill was reported out of the Armed Services Committee on a huge,  25-to-1 bipartisan vote. We are encouraging filing amendments for the  managers' package before the close of business today.   Senator McConnell, the committees, and I will have our teams working  over the weekend to see what we can include in the package of  amendments. Undoubtedly, hundreds of amendments will be filed to this  important piece of legislation. I am hopeful that all committee chairs  and committee members will work together in good faith.   Obviously, both sides will want to have amendment votes. Just like we  have in recent efforts, I am willing to ensure we consider and vote a  reasonable number of amendments. No Senator wants a dilatory process. I  know Senators Reed and Wicker, who have done such a fine job putting  together a bipartisan bill, will work with Senator McConnell and me,  and we will develop a list of amendment votes and hopefully can proceed  from there.   There are important issues that I believe we must address while we  are on the floor. We must consider a Chinese Government competition  package. We must consider the Australia, United Kingdom, and United  States submarine deal. I know there will be more to do here next week,  and I look forward to the debate on the floor.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 119, S.  2226.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  for the cloture motion filed today, July 13, be waived.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
