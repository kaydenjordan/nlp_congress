 Madam President.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, it is  clear to the five or six of us Senators who are in the room right now  that there is passion, that it is an important issue, and that there  may even be unanimous consent in the hearts and minds, certainly, of  the Senators with regard to both the spirit of the resolution and  perhaps the letter of the bill, of which I am a cosponsor, that has  been introduced by UC by the Senator from Maryland.   I think it is clear that we all have the same objective here, but I  also know there is just a handful of us in the room talking about a  very important issue that may seem simple but we know is very  complicated.   We know that the administration has provided both technical and  policy views on the bill, and I think with such an important issue that  so many of us care deeply about, it deserves a little more discussion  and debate than just to come to the floor with a UC.   I am committed, as a member of the Banking Committee and as a  cosponsor, to working with both committees and with the chairs of both  committees of jurisdiction over the resolution and the bill to make  sure we get it right as opposed to this UC.   I want to work hard. I know you all do. I think we should work at  looking at the comments from the administration, working together as  Republicans and Democrats who care about this country, care about the  people of Hong Kong, and who are concerned about the behavior of China.  So I object to adoption of this bill before we have a chance to do  exactly that.
