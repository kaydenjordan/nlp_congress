 Mr. Speaker, the talk of everyone back home is over  inflation. I want to give the press corps something to do. We are told  the current inflation rate is 8.2 percent, the highest it has been in  40 years. I believe the number is higher than that.   They claim that the cost of rent or the cost to buy a house has gone  up 5.2 percent. I have talked to builders in which the cost of  identical homes has gone up 30 percent.   Interest rates have gone up from 2.5 to 4.5 percent. I know somebody  who is looking to perhaps flip a house that has gone up 20 percent.   I would like the press corps in this country to look for examples of  housing that has only gone up 5.2 percent.   The other thing I would like them to look up is used cars have gone  up 16 percent. I have talked to car dealers, and they tell me the price  of used cars has gone up 25 to 35 percent.   So I beg the somewhat slumbering press corps to look into this and  see whether our leg is being pulled by the claim that the CPI is only  up 8.2 percent.                            ____________________
