 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Ruth Henrichs, a  dedicated public servant from my own district in Omaha, Nebraska. Ms.  Henrich's dedication to serving all people and treating them with  justice and kindness is a model for all.   It was early in her career as the CEO at Lutheran Family Services  when Ruth was profoundly moved by their mission statement, which is  ``To Express God's Love for All People.'' For Ruth, the most important  word in that sentence is ``all,'' and for the next 41 years of service,  33 of those years as the president and CEO, this mission was Ruth's  rock.   Ruth received her bachelor in social welfare in 1972 and her master  of social work in 1976, both from the University of Nebraska at Omaha.   When she first started at Lutheran Family Services, Ruth walked into  one of the treatment facilities and saw a man with a big tattoo on his  arm that read ``Born to Lose.'' Ruth wondered, how many people come  here every day with ``Born to Lose'' tattoed on their heart? At that  moment, Ruth realized she was born to help others.   Ruth's list of accolades and awards include: Outstanding Young Women  of America, Who's Who of American Women, Social Worker of the Year,  Champion for Kids and Families' Lifetime Service Award, Women of  Distinction Award, and the Milagro Award. Lutheran Family Services of  Nebraska recognized her 25 years of service by establishing the Ruth A.  Henrichs Leadership Development Fund.   With a passion for helping all, Ruth has served many boards and  organizations at all levels, from being a member to chairperson. She  has spent a lifetime dedicated to social service and her personal modus  operandi: ``To spend your life in service, to express God's love for  people.'' That is what Ruth believes and that is what she has done for  so long.   Ruth has made a positive impact in our local community of Omaha, in  our State of Nebraska and, indeed, our country. She has made an impact  where it matters most, the lives of others.                            ____________________
