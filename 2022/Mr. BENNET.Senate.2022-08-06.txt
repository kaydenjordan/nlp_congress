 Madam President, last year, we demonstrated to the  American people that we don't have to accept this outrageous, shameful  level of childhood poverty in our Nation.   We have 38 out of 41 industrialized countries in the world in terms  of childhood poverty. The poorest people in our country are our  children. And because we passed this bill last year, we demonstrated  that doesn't have to be a permanent feature of our economy or our  democracy.   We have to fight to make this enhanced child tax credit permanent,  and that is what I will do with people on both sides of the aisle. But  this does not advance that cause because we  [[Page S4190]]  could lose the underlying bill. Therefore, we should vote against the  amendment.    Madam President, I rise today to recognize Mile  High Early Learning for 50 years of service in support of children and  families in Colorado.   Mile High Early Learning is Denver's largest and oldest provider of  subsidized high quality early care and education and is celebrating its  50th anniversary in 2022. Since the organization's founding, Mile High  Early Learning has provided high quality early care and education to  more than 50,000 children.   Mile High Early Learning had its beginnings when community child care  providers created a consortium, incorporated on January 19, 1972, to  provide affordable, accessible quality early childhood education and  care for children from working families with limited resources. Today,  Mile High Early Learning serves more than 1,500 young children every  year.   As a Head Start and Early Head Start provider, Mile High Early  Learning leverages these Federal resources to partner with numerous  local early childhood providers to offer comprehensive health and  family support services to families and expand access to high quality  early education and care across Colorado.   Mile High Early Learning incorporates cutting-edge knowledge in early  childhood, using a Montessori inspired approach that supports a love of  learning, social-emotional development, and critical skills that lead  to lifelong success.   As a leader in the field of early childhood, Mile High Early Learning  has developed continuing education and professional learning programs  designed  [[Page S4214]]  to grow, strengthen, and sustain our early childhood workforce  including family, friend, and neighbor caregivers who care for the  majority of children under age 3 years. Mile High Early Learning has  created a workforce pipeline with on-ramps through its professional  learning center that includes a child development associate training  program for teachers who are beginning their profession in early  childhood.   Mile High Early Learning's quality programming informs state and  national leaders and continues to be at the forefront in advocating for  children and families across Colorado and promoting systems-level  impacts that support and improve the field of early childhood  education.   Mile High Early Learning is guided by a mission to enable all  children to succeed in school by providing resources and education to  inspire a lifetime of learning and a vision that all are joyfully  welcomed into a learning community that prioritizes equity.   I congratulate Mile High Early Learning on reaching this important  milestone of 50 years of caring for our children and ensuring high- quality early care and education.                            ____________________
