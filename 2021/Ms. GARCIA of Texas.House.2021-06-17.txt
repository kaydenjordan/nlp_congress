 Madam Speaker, I rise today in celebration of  100 years of the Mexican Consulate's presence in Houston. This is huge  for the diplomatic relationship between two neighbors. The consulate  was first established in 1920, and today it is the largest diplomatic  mission in the city, providing services to tens of thousands of people  a year. It is proof of the need to strengthen, now more than ever, our  diplomatic ties and tackle our shared opportunities and challenges.   Congratulations, Consul General Alicia Kerber, the first woman to  head the consulate's office in Houston. A good neighbor, we have worked  together on food drives, COVID testing and vaccines, trade, and  immigration rights.   Tomorrow, June 18, the consulate will be opening its new  headquarters. Congratulations to the Mexican diplomatic mission in  Houston. May we continue to work together the next 100 years.   Congratulations. Felicidades.                            ____________________
