 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Madam President, here is the scorecard on 557  Presidential nominations during the first 100 days of the Trump  administration, through April 29. According to the Partnership for  Public Service, in collaboration with the Washington Post, on Cabinet  appointments, President Trump did his job, but Senate Democrats did not  do their job. The President announced all of his Cabinet nominations  before he was inaugurated on January 20, but Democrats delayed  confirmation of Cabinet nominations more than those of any other recent  President. On sub-Cabinet appointments, President Trump did not do his  job. He was slower than any other recent President to send his  nominations to the Senate.   So here is what could happen. If Democrats continue their delaying  tactics, when President Trump does send sub-Cabinet nominees to the  Senate, the President would have every excuse to stop nominating and  simply appoint acting officials to about 350 of the remaining key  positions.   An administration managed by acting Presidential appointees who have  not been confirmed by the Senate would be a first in American history.  Delaying the inevitable approval of nominations of a President you  oppose might sound to your political base like good politics, but it  would be supremely bad governing. Senate Democrats would actually  diminish their influence and shoot themselves in both feet. They would  be turning over to a President they don't like an excuse to staff the  government with about 350 key appointees who are unconfirmed and  unaccountable to the Senate. Now, this 350 number does not even include  the Ambassadors in embassies all around the world, where there may be  acting heads of the embassy.   Now, what difference would it make to have an administration mostly  unexamined and unconfirmed by the Senate? Well, it would mean that the  Senate would be giving the Executive more power at the expense of the  legislative branch.   This undermines the checks and balances created by our Nation's  Founders. Democrats complained that Republicans delayed some of  President Obama's nominees, and that is true. In fact, that has always  been true. My own nomination for U.S. Education Secretary in 1991 was  delayed for 2 months by a Democratic Senator who put a hold on my  nomination for unexplained reasons.   President Ford's nomination of Warren Rudman to the Interstate  Commerce Commission in 1976 was blocked by Democratic New Hampshire  Senator John Durkin.   The rest of the story is that Rudman eventually asked President Ford  to withdraw the nomination, ran against Durkin, and defeated him in the  next election. That is how Warren Rudman got to be a U.S. Senator.  There is a better way to resolve differences between Senators and the  President.   In December of 2015, President Obama seemed content to allow John  King of New York to serve as his Acting Secretary of Education for the  last year of President Obama's term. I told the President I thought it  was inappropriate for a President to have an acting Cabinet member for  so long and that, while I disagreed with Mr. King on many points, I  urged him to nominate King and, if he did, I promised that I would hold  a prompt hearing and see to it that he was confirmed.   President Obama nominated John King on February 11, 2016. John King  was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on March 14, 2016. I disagreed with  Secretary King often, but the Secretary was confirmed. He was confirmed  by and accountable to the U.S. Senate, as he should have been and as  our Constitution envisions.   All of President Trump's Cabinet nominees are now confirmed, but this  is how long it took compared with his three immediate predecessors: All  of President Trump's nominations were announced before his  inauguration, but the Senate confirmed only two of those nominations on  day one because Senate Democrats would not agree to any more than that.  A third Cabinet nominee was confirmed on January 31st. To compare, by  January 31st in prior administrations, President Obama had 10 nominees  confirmed, and George W. Bush and Bill Clinton each had 13 confirmed.   Please keep in mind that it is impossible for Democratic Senators by  themselves to defeat a Trump nominee. Confirmation requires only a  majority voting to be present; that is usually 51 Senators. There are  52 Republican Senators and, in addition, Vice President Pence can vote  in the case of a tie. There is no 60-vote filibuster available to block  nominees because Democrats, when they were in the majority in 2013,  changed Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster on nominations. So by  their obstruction, Democrats are only delaying the inevitable, using  various tactics to require the Senate to use nearly a week of floor  time to approve even noncontroversial nominees.   We don't know how Democrats will treat President Trump's more than  350 remaining key nominees because the President has made so few of  those. For example, I am chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee. Aside from the Cabinet secretaries who come to our  committee, of the 557 key positions identified by the Washington Post,  35 of them within the Cabinet agencies require recommendations to the  full Senate by the HELP committee. In the Department of Health and  Human Services, we have eight. In the Department of Education, we have  14. In the Department of Labor, we have 13.   At the end of the first 100 days, April 29th, our committee had  received just one sub-Cabinet nomination from the Trump  administration--that of Dr. Scott Gottlieb for FDA commissioner. He was  promptly confirmed on May 9th.  [[Page S3111]]    Compared with President Trump's one sub-Cabinet nomination sent to  our committee in his first 100 days, President Obama made 13 sub- Cabinet nominations in his first 100 days, President George W. Bush  made 10, and President Clinton made 14 to our committee.   There are actually nearly 700 more Presidential nominees requiring  Senate confirmation who aren't considered key by the Washington Post  analysis, so you can see this adds up to be a pretty big number of  Presidential nominees whom we have a responsibility to consider and to  confirm if we approve them.   Unfortunately, there are ominous signs about how Democrats will treat  non-Cabinet nominees. As the Presiding Officer is especially aware,  Democrats required the Senate to take nearly a week of floor time to  consider the nomination of Iowa Governor Terry Branstad to serve as  Ambassador to China. There was absolutely no excuse for this other than  obstructionism.   Governor Branstad is the longest serving Governor in American  history. He has a well-documented relationship with the Chinese  President. He was one of the first appointees that the President  announced. He was approved by a voice vote by the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, and ultimately approved by the full Senate earlier  this week 82 to 13.   Yet, as a delaying tactic, Senate Democrats forced us to use nearly a  week of our floor time to consider Governor Branstad. If Democrats  treat other noncontroversial Ambassadors and sub-Cabinet members the  same way they treated Governor Branstad, requiring nearly a week of  Senate floor time to consider a nominee, then I think President Trump  would almost certainly bypass the Senate and name hundreds of acting  heads of sub-Cabinet departments. Under our Constitution, he may do  that whenever he chooses. There are flexible limits on the time one may  serve in an acting position, but if that time expires, the President  can simply appoint someone else.   Hopefully, President Trump will speed up his nomination of sub- Cabinet members, and hopefully Democrats will return to the common  practice of routine floor approval of Presidential nominations when the  confirmation process has determined that the nominee deserves to be  approved.   Our Founders created a system of government based on checks and  balances of the three coequal branches of government. There has been  much complaining recently about the rise of the executive branch at the  expense of the legislative branch. Having an executive branch and  embassies mostly staffed by acting personnel not confirmed by or  accountable to the U.S. Senate undermines the principle of three  coequal branches of government.   The President should want his team in place and should speed up  recommending key nominees to the U.S. Senate. And Senators, especially  those in the minority, should want to have a say in the vetting and  accountability that come with the Senate confirmation process.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of H.R. 375, which was received from the House.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.   The bill clerk read as follows:         A bill (H.R. 375) to designate the Federal building and       United States courthouse located at 719 Church Street in       Nashville, Tennessee, as the ``Fred D. Thompson Federal       Building and United States Courthouse.''    There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill  be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The bill (H.R. 375) was ordered to a third reading, was read the  third time, and passed.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill  be considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The bill (H.R. 375) was ordered to a third reading, was read the  third time, and passed.    Mr. President, I am grateful that the Senate has  approved that measure naming the Fred D. Thompson Federal Building and  United States Courthouse in Nashville.   I stand at the desk of former Senator Thompson. This was a desk that  Senator Howard Baker also had. I have the desk myself because Senator  Thompson and I were inspired by Senator Baker to be involved in  politics and government in our State and the House of Representatives-- our delegation.   I think Senator Carper and his committee all seem to think that it is  very appropriate that the new Nashville courthouse be named for Senator  Thompson. It gives me a great deal of pride and personal privilege to  be able to ask for that to be done. I thank Congresswoman Blackburn in  the House for her leadership and all the Members of the delegation and  the Members of the Senate for their cooperation in this.   I thank the Presiding Officer.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
