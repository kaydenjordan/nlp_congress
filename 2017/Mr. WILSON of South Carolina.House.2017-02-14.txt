 Mr. Speaker, earlier this month,  President Donald Trump released a Presidential memorandum on the  fiduciary duty rule, and I am grateful that President Trump has  directed the Labor Secretary to thoroughly study this destructive rule.   Under the Obama administration, the Department of Labor released an  incomprehensible fiduciary rule that increased the cost of financial  planning, reducing retirement advice for American families and  destroying jobs.   Families all over America are struggling to save for their  retirement, and I applaud the President's swift action to study the  harmful effects of this rule. I am confident the study will result in a  delay or revision of this ridiculous regulation of 1,023 pages to  define a profession.   I will continue to advance legislation calling for a delay of 2 years  to give Congress and the administration time to reassess the  regulation. I appreciate the positive insight of the National  Association of Insurance and Financial Advisers who promoted reforms  for  [[Page H1137]]  hardworking American families saving for retirement, and creating jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may we never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
