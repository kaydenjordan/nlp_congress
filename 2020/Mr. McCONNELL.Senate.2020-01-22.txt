 Mr. Chief Justice, for the information of all of our  colleagues, no motions--no motions--were filed this morning, so we will  proceed to the House managers' presentation. We will go for  approximately 2 hours and take a short recess when there is an  appropriate break time between presenters.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 483, the  managers for the House of Representatives have 24 hours to make the  presentation of their case.   The Senate will now hear you.                              Opening Statement    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, counsel for the  President, and my fellow House managers: I want to begin by thanking  you, Chief Justice, for a very long day, for the way you have presided  over these proceedings. I want to thank the Senators also. We went well  into the morning, as you know, until I believe around 2 in the morning.  You paid attention to every word and argument you heard from both sides  in this impeachment trial, and I know we are both deeply grateful for  that.   It was an exhausting day for us, certainly, but we have adrenaline  going through our veins. For those who are required to sit and listen,  it is a much more difficult task. Of course, we know our positions. You  have the added difficulty of having to weigh the facts and the law. So  I want to begin today by thanking you for the conduct of the  proceedings yesterday and inviting your patience as we go forward. We  have some very long days yet to come.   So let us begin.   ``When a man unprincipled in private life, desperate in his fortune,  bold in his temper, possessed of considerable talents, having the  advantage of military habits, despotic in his ordinary demeanor, known  to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty--when such a  man is seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity, to join in the cry  of danger to liberty, to take every opportunity of embarrassing the  general government and bringing it under suspicion, to flatter and fall  in with all the nonsense of the zealots of  [[Page S444]]  the day, it may justly be suspected that his object is to throw things  into confusion that he may ride the storm and direct the whirlwind.''   Those words were written by Alexander Hamilton in a letter to  President George Washington at the height of the panic of 1792, a  financial credit crisis that shook our young Nation. Hamilton was  responding to sentiments relayed to Washington as he traveled the  country that America, in the face of that crisis, might descend from a  republican form of government, plunging instead into that of monarchy.   The Framers of the Constitution worried then, as we worry today, that  a leader might come to power not to carry out the will of the people he  was elected to represent but to pursue his own interests. They feared  that a President would subvert our democracy by abusing the awesome  power of his office for his own personal or political gain. And so they  devised a remedy as powerful as the evil it was meant to combat:  impeachment.   As centuries have passed, our Founders achieved an almost mythical  character. We are aware of their flaws, certainly some very painful and  pronounced indeed. Yet, when it came to the drafting of the new system  of government never seen before and with no guarantee it would succeed,  we cannot help but be in awe of their genius, their prescience even,  vindicated time and again.   Still, maybe because of their brilliance and the brilliance of their  words, we find year after year it more difficult to imagine them as  human beings. This is no less true of Alexander Hamilton,  notwithstanding his recent return to celebrity. But they were human  beings. They understood human frailties, even as they exhibited them.  They could appreciate, just as we can, how power can corrupt. Even as  we struggle to understand how the Framers might have responded to  Presidential misconduct of the kind and character that we are here to  try, we should not imagine for one moment that they lacked basic common  sense or refuse to apply it ourselves.   They knew what it was like to live under a despot, and they risked  their lives to be free of it. They knew they were creating an  enormously powerful executive, and they knew they needed to constrain  it. They did not intend for the power of impeachment to be used  frequently or over mere matters of policy, but they put it in the  Constitution for a reason: for a man who would subvert the interests of  the Nation to pursue his own interests; for a man who would seek to  perpetuate himself in office by inviting foreign interference and  cheating in an election; for a man who would be disdainful of  constitutional limit, ignoring or defeating the other branches of  government and their coequal powers; for a man who believed that the  Constitution gave him the right to do anything he wanted and practiced  in the art of deception; for a man who believed that he was above the  law and beholden to no one; for a man, in short, who would be a King.   We are here today in this hallowed Chamber undertaking this solemn  action for only the third time in history because Donald J. Trump, the  45th President of the United States, has acted precisely as Hamilton  and his contemporaries feared. President Trump solicited foreign  interference in our democratic elections, abusing the power of his  office, to seek help from abroad to improve his reelection prospects at  home. When he was caught, he used the powers of that office to obstruct  the investigation into his own misconduct.   To implement this corrupt scheme, President Trump pressured the  President of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into two  discredited allegations that would benefit President Trump's 2020  Presidential campaign. When the Ukrainian President did not immediately  assent, President Trump withheld two official acts to induce the  Ukrainian leader to comply: a head-of-state meeting in the Oval Office  and military funding. Both were of bright consequence to Ukraine and to  our national interests in security, but one looms largest. President  Trump withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to a  strategic partner at war with Russia to secure foreign help with his  reelection--in other words, to cheat.    In this way, the President used official state powers available only  to him and unavailable to any political opponent to advantage himself  in a democratic election. His scheme was undertaken for a simple but  corrupt reason--to help him win reelection in 2020. But the effect of  the scheme was to undermine our free and fair elections and to put our  national security at risk.   It was not even necessary that Ukraine undertake the political  investigations the President was seeking. They merely had to announce  them. This is significant, for President Trump had no interest in  fighting corruption, as he would claim after he was caught. Rather, his  interest was in furthering corruption by the announcement of  investigations that were completely without merit.   The first sham investigation that President Trump desired was into  former Vice President Joe Biden, who had sought the removal of a  corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor during the previous U.S. administration.   The Vice President acted in accordance with U.S. official policy at  the time and was supported unanimously by our European allies and key  global financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund,  which shared the concern over corruption.   Despite this fact, in the course of this scheme, President Trump and  his agents pressed the Ukrainian President to announce an investigation  into the false claim that Vice President Biden wanted the corrupt  prosecutor removed from power in order to stop an investigation into  Burisma Holdings, a company on whose board Biden's son Hunter sat.   This allegation is simply untrue. It has been widely debunked by  Ukrainian and American experts alike. That reality mattered not to  President Trump. To him, the value in promoting a negative tale about  former Vice President Biden--true or false--was its usefulness to his  reelection campaign. It was a smear tactic against a political opponent  that President Trump apparently feared.   Remarkably but predictably, Russia, too, has sought to support this  effort to smear Mr. Biden, reportedly hacking into the Ukraine energy  company at the center of the President's disinformation campaign only  last week.   Russia almost certainly was looking for information related to the  former Vice President's son so that the Kremlin could also weaponize it  against Mr. Biden, just like it did against Hillary Clinton in 2016,  when Russia hacked and released emails from her Presidential campaign.   President Trump has made it abundantly clear that he would like  nothing more than to make use of such dirt against Mr. Biden, just as  he made use of Secretary Clinton's hacked and released emails in his  previous Presidential campaign.   That brings us to the other sham investigation that President Trump  demanded the Ukrainian leader announce. This investigation was related  to a debunked conspiracy theory, alleging that Ukraine, not Russia,  interfered in the 2016 Presidential election. This narrative,  propagated by the Russian intelligence services, contends that Ukraine  sought to help Hillary Clinton and harm then-Candidate Trump and that a  computer server providing this fiction is hidden somewhere in Ukraine.   That is the so-called CrowdStrike conspiracy theory. This tale is  also patently false, and, remarkably, it is precisely the inverse of  what the U.S. intelligence communities' unanimous assessment was that  Russia interfered in the 2016 election in sweeping in systemic fashion  in order to hurt Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump.   Nevertheless, the President evidently believed that a public  announcement lending credence to these allegations by the Ukrainian  President could assist his reelection by putting to rest any doubts  Americans may have had over the legitimacy of his first election, even  as he invited foreign interference in the next.   To the degree that most Americans have followed the President's  efforts to involve another foreign power in our election, they may be  most familiar with his entreaty to the Ukrainian President on the now  infamous July 25 call to ``do us a favor, though'' and investigate  Biden and the 2016 conspiracy theory.  [[Page S445]]    That call was not the beginning of the story of the President's  corrupt scheme, nor was it the end. Rather, it was merely part-- although, a significant part--of a months' long effort by President  Trump and his allies and associates who applied significant and  increasing pressure on Ukraine to announce these two politically  motivated investigations.   Key figures in the Trump administration were aware or directly  involved or participated in the scheme. As we saw yesterday, one  witness--a million-dollar donor to the President's inaugural committee  put it this way: Everyone was in the loop.   After twice inviting Ukraine's new President to the White House  without providing a specific date for the proposed visit, President  Trump conditioned this coveted Head-of-State meeting on the  announcement of these sham investigations. For Ukraine's new and  untested leader, an official meeting with the President of the United  States in the Oval Office was critical. It would help bestow on him  important, domestic, and international legitimacy, as he sought to  implement an ambitious anti-corruption platform.   Actual and apparent support from the President of the United States  would also strengthen his position as he sought to negotiate a peace  agreement with Russia's President Vladimir Putin, seeking an end to  Russia's illegal annexation and continued military occupation of parts  of Ukraine.   But most pernicious, President Trump petitioned hundreds of millions  of dollars in congressionally appropriated taxpayer-funded military  assistance for the same purpose to apply more pressure on Ukraine's  leader to announce the investigations. This military aid, which has  long enjoyed bipartisan support, was designed to help Ukraine defend  itself from the Kremlin's aggression.    More than 15,000 Ukrainians have died fighting Russian forces and  their proxies--15,000. The military aid was for such essentials as  sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, radar night-vision  goggles, and other vital support for the war effort.   Most critically, the military aid we provide Ukraine helps to protect  and advance American national security interests in the region and  beyond. America has an abiding interest in stemming Russian  expansionism and resisting any nations' efforts to remake the map of  Europe by dint of military force, even as we have tens of thousands of  troops stationed there.   Moreover, as one witness put it during our impeachment inquiry, the  United States aids Ukraine and her people so that we can fight Russia  over there and we don't have to fight Russia here.   When the President's scheme was exposed and the House of  Representatives properly performed its constitutional responsibility to  investigate the matter, President Trump used the same unrivaled  authority at his disposal as Commander in Chief to cover up his  wrongdoing.   In unprecedented fashion, the President ordered the entire executive  branch of the United States of America to categorically refuse and  completely obstruct the House's impeachment investigation. Such a  wholesale obstruction of congressional impeachment has never before  occurred in our democracy. It represents one of the most blatant  efforts of a coverup in history.   If not remedied by his conviction in the Senate and removal from  office, President Trump's abuse of his office and obstruction of  Congress will permanently alter the balance of power among the branches  of government, inviting future Presidents to operate as if they are  also beyond the reach of accountability, congressional oversight, and  the law.   On the basis of this egregious misconduct, the House of  Representatives returned two Articles of Impeachment against the  President: first, charging that President Trump corruptly abused the  powers of the Presidency to solicit foreign interference in the  upcoming Presidential election for his personal political benefit; and,  second, that President Trump obstructed an impeachment inquiry into  that abuse of power in order to cover up his misconduct.   The House did not take this extraordinary step lightly. As we will  discuss, impeachment exists for cases in which the conduct of the  President rises beyond mere policy disputes to be decided otherwise and  without urgency at the ballot box.   Instead, we are here today to consider a much more grave matter, and  that is an attempt to use the powers of the Presidency to cheat in an  election. For precisely this reason, the President's misconduct cannot  be decided at the ballot box, for we cannot be assured that the vote  will be fairly won.   In corruptly using his office to gain a political advantage, in  abusing the powers of that office in such a way to jeopardize our  national security and the integrity of our elections, in obstructing  the investigation into his own wrongdoing, the President has shown that  he believes that he is above the law and scornful of constraint.   As we saw yesterday on the screen, under article II he can do  anything he wants. Moreover, given the seriousness of the conduct at  issue and its persistence, this matter cannot and must not be decided  by the courts, which apart from the presence of the Chief Justice here  today, are given no role in impeachments in either the House or the  Senate.   Being drawn into litigation, taking many months or years to complete,  would provide the President with an opportunity to continue his  misconduct. He would remain secure in the knowledge that he may tie up  the Congress and the courts indefinitely, as he has with Don McGahn,  rendering the impeachment power effectively meaningless.   We also took the step with the knowledge that this was not the first  time the President solicited foreign interference in our elections. In  2016, then-candidate Trump implored Russia to hack his opponent's email  account, something that the Russian military agency did only hours  later--only hours later.   When the President said, ``hey, Russia, if you're listening,'' they  were listening. Only hours later they hacked his opponent's campaign.   The President has made it clear this would also not be the last time,  asking China only recently to join Ukraine in investigating his  political opponent.   Over the coming days, we will present to you and to the American  people the extensive evidence collected during the House's impeachment  inquiry into the President's abuse of power--overwhelming evidence,  notwithstanding his unprecedented and wholesale obstruction of the  investigation into that misconduct.   You will hear and read testimony from courageous public servants who  upheld their oath to the Constitution and their legal obligations to  comply with congressional action, despite a categorical order by  President Trump not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.   These are courageous Americans who were told by the President of the  United States not to cooperate, not to appear, not to testify, but who  had the sense of duty to do so. But more than that, you will hear from  witnesses who have not yet testified, such as John Bolton and Mick  Mulvaney, Mr. Blair and Mr. Duffey. And if you can believe the  President's words last month, you will also hear from Secretary Pompeo.  You will hear their testimony at the same time as the American people;  that is, if you allow it, if we have a fair trial.   During our presentation, you will see documentary records, those the  President was unable to suppress, that exposed the President's scheme  in detail. You will learn of further evidence that has been revealed in  the days since the House voted to impeach President Trump, even as the  President and his agents have persisted in their efforts to cover up  their wrongdoing from Congress and the public.   You will see dozens of new documents providing new and critical  evidence of the President's guilt that remain at this time in the  President's hands and in the hands of the Department of Defense and the  Department of State and the Office of Management and Budget, even the  White House. You will see them and so will the American people if you  allow it--if, in the name of a fair trial, you will demand it.   These are politically charged times. Tempers can run high,  particularly where this President is concerned, but these are not  unique times. Deep divisions and disagreements were hardly  [[Page S446]]  alien concepts to the Framers so they designed impeachment power in  such a way as to insulate it as best they could from the crush of  partisan politics. The Framers placed the question of removal before  the Senate, a body able to rise above the fray, to soberly judge the  President's conduct or misconduct for what it was, nothing more and  nothing less.   In Federalist No. 65, Hamilton wrote:         Where else than in the Senate could have been found a       tribunal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent?       What other body would be likely to feel confidence enough in       its own situation, to preserve, unawed and uninfluenced, the       necessary impartiality between an individual accused, and the       representatives of the people, his accusers?    It is up to you to be the tribunal that Hamilton envisioned. It is up  to you to show the American people and yourselves that his confidence  and that of the other Founders was rightly placed. The Constitution  entrusts you to the responsibility of acting as impartial jurors, to  hold a fair and thorough trial, and to weigh the evidence before you no  matter what your party affiliation or your vote in the previous  election or the next. Our duty is to the Constitution and to the rule  of law.   I recognize there will be times during the trial that you may long to  return to the business of the Senate. The American people look forward  to the same but not before you decide what kind of democracy that you  believe we ought to be and what the American people have a right to  expect in the conduct of their President.   The House believes that an impartial juror, upon hearing the evidence  that the managers will lay out in the coming days, will find that the  Constitution demands the removal of Donald J. Trump from his office as  President of the United States. But that will be for you to decide.  With the weight of history upon you, and as President Kennedy once  said: ``With a good conscience our only sure reward. . . . ''   In drafting our Constitution, the Framers designed a new and untested  form of government. It would be based on free and fair elections to  ensure that our political leaders would be chosen democratically and by  citizens of our country alone. Having broken free from a King with  unbridled authority who often placed his own interests above that of  the people, the Framers established a structure that would guarantee  that the Chief Executive's power flowed only from his obligation to the  people rather than from a sovereign whose power was confirmed on him by  divine right.   In this new architecture, no branch of government or individual would  predominate over another. In this way, the Founders ensured that their  elected leaders and their President would use the powers of office only  to undertake that which the people desired and not for their personal  aggrandizement or enrichment.   What did those who rebelled and fought a revolution desire? Nothing  different than what we, the generations that have followed, desire:  that no person, including and especially the President, would be above  the law. Nothing could be more dangerous to a democracy than a  Commander in Chief who believed that he could operate with impunity,  free from accountability--nothing, that is, except a Congress that is  willing to let it be so.   To ensure that no such threat can take root and subvert our fledgling  democracy, the Framers divided power among three coequal branches of  government--the executive, the legislative, and the judicial branches-- so that ambition may be made to counter ambition. They provided for  Presidential elections every 4 years, and the Framers required that the  President swear an oath to faithfully execute the law and to preserve,  protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.   Even with these guardrails in place, the Framers understood an  individual could come to power who defied that solemn oath, who pursued  his own interests rather than those of the country he led. For that  reason, the Framers adopted a tool used by the British Parliament to  restrain its officials: the power of impeachment. Rather than a  mechanism to overturn an election, impeachment would be a remedy of  last resort, and, unlike in England, the Framers applied this ultimate  check to the highest office in the land, to the President of the United  States. Impeachment removal of a duly elected President was not  intended for policy disputes or poor administration of the State.  Instead, the Framers had in mind the most serious of offenses: those  against the public itself.   Hamilton explained that impeachment was not designed to cover only  statutory common law crimes but instead crimes against the body  politic. Hamilton wrote:         The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which       proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other       words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They       are of a nature which may, with peculiar propriety, be       denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries       done immediately to the society itself.    In other words, impeachment would be confined to abuses of people's  trust and to the society itself. This is precisely the abuse that has  been undertaken by our current President when he withheld money in  support for an ally at war to secure a political benefit. The  punishment for those crimes would fit the political nature of the  offense. As James Wilson--a delegate of the Constitutional Convention  and a future Associate Justice of the Supreme Court--reasoned that  impeachment ``was confined to political characters, to political crimes  and misdemeanors, and to political punishments.'' The Framers  determined that punishment would be neither prison nor fines but,  instead, limited to removal from office and disqualification from  holding future office.   The Framers chose to undertake impeachment for treason, bribery, or  other high crimes and misdemeanors to underscore the requirement of an  offense against society. In this phrase, ``high'' modifies both the  crimes and the misdemeanors in that both relate to a high injustice, a  transgression committed against the people and to the public trust. The  Framers had two broad categories in mind: those actions that are  facially permissible under the President's authority but are based on  corrupt motives, such as seeking to obtain a personal benefit through  public office, and those that far exceed the President's constitutional  authority or violate the legal limits on that authority.   In article I, we deal with the first evil which the Framers wished to  guard against; that is, cases in which a President corruptly misused  the power otherwise bestowed on him to secure a personal reward.  Guarding against a President who undertakes official acts with a  corrupt motive of helping himself is at the heart of the impeachment  power. As one scholar explained, the President's duty to faithfully  execute the law requires that he undertakes actions only when motivated  in the public interest rather than in their private self-interest.  Efforts to withhold official acts for personal gain countermand the  President's sacred oath and, therefore, constitute impeachable behavior  as it was conceived by the Framers.   In article II, we also deal with the second evil contemplated by the  Founders, who made it clear that the President ought not operate beyond  the limits placed on him by legislative and judicial branches.  Impeachment was warranted for a President who usurped the power of the  Constitution that was not granted to him, such as to defy Congress the  right to determine the propriety, the scope, and the nature of an  impeachment inquiry into his own misconduct.   The Framers fashioned a powerful Chief Executive but not one beyond  accountability of law. When a President wields power in ways that are  inappropriate and seek to extinguish the rights of Congress, he exceeds  the power of constitutional authority and violates the limits placed on  his conduct. Obstruction of a separate and coequal branch of government  for the purposes of covering up an abuse of power not only implies a  corrupt intent but also demonstrates a remarkable antipathy toward the  balance of power contemplated and enshrined in our Constitution. It is  a betrayal of the President's sacred oath of office and of his duty to  put the country before himself.   On September 24, 2019, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced  that the House of Representatives would move forward with an official  impeachment inquiry into President Donald J. Trump. The announcement  followed public reporting in the United States  [[Page S447]]  and Ukraine that the President and his agents sought Ukraine's help in  his reelection effort and revelations that the White House was blocking  from Congress an intelligence community whistleblower complaint  possibly related to this grave offense.   The next day, on September 25, under extraordinary pressure, the  White House released publicly the record of the July 25 call between  President Trump and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky. The call  record revealed that President Trump explicitly requested that the new  leader undertake investigations beneficial to President Trump's  reelection campaign. Upon release of the record of the call, President  Trump claimed that the call was ``perfect.'' Far from perfect, the call  record revealed a President who used his high office to personally and  directly press the leader of a foreign country to do his political  dirty work. Asking for a favor, President Trump insisted that President  Zelensky investigate a formidable potential political opponent, former  Vice President Joe Biden, as well as the baseless conspiracy theory  that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 election to assist  then-Candidate Trump's opponent.   Witnesses who listened to the call as it transpired testified that  they immediately recognized these requests did not represent official  U.S. policy and, instead, were politically charged appeals, not  appropriate for a President to make. Key witnesses emphasized it was  not necessary that Ukraine actually undertake the investigations, only  that the Ukrainian President denounce them.   President Trump's objective was not to encourage a foreign government  to investigate legitimate allegations of misconduct or wrongdoing  abroad, made clear, as well, by the fact that the investigations he  wanted announced have been discredited entirely. Rather, the President  simply wanted to reap a political benefit by tarnishing a political  rival and in attempting to erase from history his previous election  misconduct. To compel the Ukrainian President to do his political dirty  work, President Trump withheld from President Zelensky two official  acts of great importance: that coveted White House meeting to which  President Zelensky had already been invited and $391 million in  military assistance for the Ukrainians to fight the Russians.   For a strategic partner of the United States in a hot war with  Russian-backed forces inside its own borders, this symbolic support  conferred on it by an Oval Office visit with the President of the  United States and the lifesaving support of our military aid was  essential. As the House's presentation will make clear, in directly  soliciting foreign interference and withholding those official acts in  exchange for the announcement of political investigations beneficial to  his election, the President put his own interest above the national  interest.   President Trump undermined the integrity of our free and fair  elections by pressing a foreign power to influence our most sacred  right as citizens, our right to freely choose our leaders, and he  threatened our national security by withholding critical aid from a  partner on the frontlines of war with Russia, an aggressor that has  threatened peace and stability on an entire continent. In so doing, the  President sacrificed not only the security of our European allies but  also our Nation's core national security interests. President Trump  undertook this pressure campaign through handpicked agents inside and  outside of government who circumvented traditional policy channels.  President Trump intentionally bypassed many U.S. Government career  officials with responsibility over Ukraine and advanced his scheme  primarily through the effort of his personal attorney Rudy  Giuliani. President Trump carried out this scheme with the knowledge of  senior administration officials, including the President's Acting Chief  of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Vice President  Mike Pence, National Security Council Legal Advisor John Eisenberg, and  White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.    When the President became aware that the scheme would be uncovered,  he undertook an unprecedented effort to obstruct the House of  Representatives' impeachment inquiry to hide it from the public and  from Congress, including all evidence related to his misconduct. That  coverup continues today as the administration has not provided a single  document pursuant to lawful subpoenas by the House.   The administration also continues to prevent witnesses from  cooperating, further obstructing the House's efforts--efforts the  President is, no doubt, proud of but which threaten the integrity of  this institution and this Congress as a coequal branch of power--and  our ability not only to do oversight but to hold a President who is  unindictable accountable.   Despite these efforts to obstruct our inquiry, the House of  Representatives uncovered overwhelming evidence related to the  President's misconduct through interviews with 17 witnesses who  appeared before the Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, and Foreign  Affairs Committees. Many of these witnesses bravely defied White House  orders not to comply with duly authorized congressional subpoenas. Were  it not for them--were it not for Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who was  the first through the breach--we may never have known of the  President's scheme.   I want you to imagine, just for a minute, what kind of courage that  took for Ambassador Yovanovitch--the subject of that vicious smear  campaign--to risk her reputation and her career to stand up to the  President of the United States, who was instructing her through his  agents: You will not cooperate. You will not testify. You will tell  them nothing.   Then, there is Bill Taylor, a West Point graduate and a Vietnam  veteran with a Bronze Star and something he was even more proud of--the  Combat Infantryman Badge. He knows what courage is. He showed a  different kind of courage in Vietnam, but he also showed courage, as  did others, in coming forward and defying the President's order that he  obstruct to tell the American people what he knew.   But for the courage of people like them and Lieutenant Colonel  Vindman, a Purple Heart recipient, we would know nothing of the  President's misconduct--nothing. When the President directs his ire  toward these people, this is why--because they showed the courage to  come forward.   Now, in the Intelligence Committee, we held 7 open hearings with 12  fact witnesses. Separately, the Judiciary Committee held public  hearings with constitutional law experts and counsel from the House  Intelligence Committee as it sought to determine whether to draft and  consider Articles of Impeachment. The House also collected text  messages related to the President's scheme from a witness who provided  limited personal communications.   Since the conclusion of our inquiry, new evidence has continued to  come to light, through court-ordered releases of administration  documents and public reporting, underscoring that there is  significantly more evidence of the President's guilt which he continues  to block from Congress, including the Senate. Nevertheless, the  documents and testimony that we were able to collect paint an  overwhelming and damning picture of the President's efforts to use the  powers of his office to corruptly solicit foreign help in his  reelection campaign and withhold official acts and military aid to  compel that support.   Over the coming days, you will hear remarkably consistent evidence of  President Trump's corrupt scheme and coverup. When you focus on the  evidence uncovered during the investigation, you will appreciate there  is no serious dispute about the facts underlying the President's  conduct, and this is why you will hear the President's lawyers make the  astounding claim: You can't impeach a President for abusing the powers  of his office. It is because they can't seriously contest that that is  exactly--exactly--what he did, and so they must go find a lawyer  somewhere.   Apparently, they could not go to their own Attorney General. It was  just reported in a memo he wrote, as part of the audition for Attorney  General, that the President can be impeached for abusing the public  trust. He couldn't go to Bill Barr for that opinion. He couldn't even  go to Jonathan Turley, their expert in the House, for an opinion. No,  they had to go outside of these  [[Page S448]]  experts, outside of constitutional law, to a criminal defense lawyer  and professor. And why? Because they can't contest the facts. The  President was the key player in the scheme. Everyone was in the loop.  He directed the actions of his team. He personally asked a foreign  government to investigate his opponent. These facts are not in dispute.   Ultimately, the question for you is whether the President's  undisputed actions require the removal of the 45th President of the  United States from office because he abused his office and the public  trust by using his power for personal gain by seeking illicit foreign  assistance in his reelection and covering it up.   Other than voting on whether to send our men and women to war, there  is, I think, no greater responsibility than the one before you now. The  oath that you have taken to impartially weigh the facts and evidence  requires serious and objective consideration--decisions that are about  country, not party; about the Constitution, not politics; about what is  right and what is wrong.   After you consider the evidence and weigh your oath to render a fair  and impartial verdict, I suggest to you today that the only conclusion  consistent with the facts and law--not just the law but the  Constitution--is clear as described by constitutional law experts'  testimony before the House: If this conduct is not impeachable, then  nothing is.   Let me take a moment to describe to you how we intend to present the  case over the coming days.   You will hear today the details of the President's corrupt scheme in  narrative form, illustrating the timeline of the effort through the  testimony of the numerous witnesses who came before the House as well  as through documents and materials we collected as evidence during the  investigation. After you hear the factual chronology, we will then  discuss the constitutional framework of impeachment as it was  envisioned by the Founders.   Before we analyze how the facts of the President's misconduct and  coverup lead to the conclusion that the President undertook the sort of  corrupt course of conduct that impeachment was intended to remedy, let  me start with a preview of the President's scheme, the details of which  you will hear during the course of this day.   President Trump's months-long scheme to extract help with his 2020  reelection campaign from the new Ukrainian President involved an effort  to solicit and then compel the new leader to announce political  investigations. The announcement would reference two specific  investigations. One was intended to undermine the unanimous consensus  of our intelligence agencies, Congress, and Special Counsel Robert  Mueller that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to help then- Candidate Trump and another to hurt the Presidency of former Vice  President Joe Biden.   The Kremlin itself has been responsible for first propagating one of  the two false narratives that the President desired. In February 2017,  less than a month after the U.S. intelligence community released its  assessment that Russia alone was responsible for a covert influence  campaign designed to help President Trump win the 2016 election,  President Putin said:         As we all know, during the Presidential campaign in the       United States, the Ukrainian government adopted a unilateral       position in favor of one candidate. More than that, certain       oligarchs--certainly with the approval of political       leadership--funded this candidate--or a female candidate to       be more precise.    Those were Putin's words on February 2, 2017.   Of course, this is false, and it is part of a Russian  counternarrative that President Trump and some of his allies have  adopted.   Fiona Hill, the Senior Director for Europe and Russia at the National  Security Council, described Russia's effort to promote this baseless  theory.   (Text of videotape presentation:)         Dr. HILL. Based on questions and statements I have heard,       some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia       and its Security Services did not conduct a campaign against       our country and that, perhaps, somehow, for some reason,       Ukraine did. This is a fictional narrative that has been       perpetrated and propagated by the Russian Security Services       themselves. The unfortunate truth is that Russia was that       foreign power that systematically attacked our democratic       institutions in 2016. This is the public conclusion of our       intelligence agencies, confirmed by bipartisan congressional       reports. It is beyond dispute even if some of the underlying       details must remain classified.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. This, of course, was not the first time that  President Trump embraced Russian activity and disinformation.   On July 24 of last year, Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified  before Congress that Russia interfered in the 2016 election in a  ``sweeping and systemic fashion'' to benefit Donald Trump's political  campaign. Mueller and his team found ``the Russian Government perceived  that it would benefit from a Trump Presidency and worked to secure that  outcome.'' They also found that the Trump campaign expected it would  benefit electorally from information stolen and released through  Russian efforts.   Just as he solicited help from Ukraine in 2019, in 2016 then- Candidate Trump also solicited help from Russia in his election effort.  As you will recall, at a rally in Florida, he said the following:   (Text of videotape presentation:)          Chief Justice, colleagues, I suggest we have a recess  until 10 minutes to 4, at which moment we will reconvene, subject to  the call of the Chair.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.   There being no objection, at 3:28 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, recessed until 3:56 p.m.; whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The House managers may resume if they are ready.   Mr. Manager NADLER. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, before  I begin, I would like to thank the Chief Justice and the Senators for  their temperate listening and their patience last night as we went into  the long hours.   I truly thank you.   The House managers will now undertake to tell you the story of the  President's Ukraine scheme. As we tell the story, it is important to  note that the facts before us are not in dispute. There are no close  calls. The evidence shows that President Trump unlawfully withheld  military assistance, appropriated by Congress to aid our ally, in order  to extort that government into helping him win his reelection, then  tried to cover it up when he got caught.   This is the story of a corrupt, governmentwide effort that drew in  Ambassadors, Cabinet officials, executive branch agencies, and the  Office of the President. This effort threatened the security of Ukraine  in its military struggle with Russia and compromised our own national  security interests because the President cared only about his personal  political interests.   In the spring of 2019, the people of Ukraine elected a new leader,  Volodymyr Zelensky, who campaigned on a platform of rooting out  corruption in his country. This pledge was welcomed by the United  States and its allies, but the new government also threatened the work  of President Trump's chief agent in Ukraine, Rudy Giuliani.   As President Zelensky was taking power, Mr. Giuliani was already  engaged in an effort to convince Ukrainian officials to announce two  sham investigations. The first was an effort to smear former Vice  President Joe Biden. The second was designed to undermine the  intelligence community's unanimous assessment that Russia interfered in  the 2016 election.   One obstacle to Mr. Giuliani's work was Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch.  A 33-year veteran of the Foreign Service, Ambassador Yovanovitch had  partnered with Ukraine to root out the kind of corruption that would  have allowed Mr. Giuliani's lies to flourish.   In order to complete his mission, Mr. Giuliani first needed  Ambassador Yovanovitch out of the way. So in early 2019, Mr. Giuliani  launched a public smear campaign against the Ambassador, an effort that  involved Mr. Giuliani's allies in Ukraine, the President's allies in  the United States, and, eventually, President Trump himself.   Please remember that the object of the President's Ukraine scheme was  to obtain a corrupt advantage for his reelection campaign. As we will  show, the President went to extraordinary lengths to cheat in the next  election. That scheme begins with the attempt to get Ambassador  Yovanovitch ``out of the way.''   By all accounts, Ambassador Yovanovitch was a highly respected and  effective Ambassador. Witnesses uniformly praised her 33-year career as  a nonpartisan public servant and told us that she particularly excelled  in fighting corruption abroad. President  [[Page S458]]  George Bush named her as an Ambassador twice, and President Obama  nominated her as Ambassador to Ukraine, where she represented the  United States from 2016 to 2019.   Eradicating corruption in Ukraine has been a key policy priority of  the U.S. Government for years. During the House inquiry, the Ambassador  explained why implementing this anticorruption policy was so important.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Mr. Chief Justice, if I may, what I was going to  suggest was that at 6:30 we take a 30-minute break for dinner, if that  would work.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. So break at 6:30?    Yes. What I was going to suggest is a break for dinner  at 6:30 for about 30 minutes, if that works.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. That is a good idea.   Mr. Manager CROW. So we know there was a hold, but there was no  lawful way to implement that hold. So the OMB had to use creative  methods. There is a process for making sure that U.S. aid money makes  it to the right place, to the right people--a process that had been  followed every year since the Congress approved security assistance to  Ukraine. The administration needed to find a creative way of getting  around that process. Later in the evening of July 25, the OMB found  that way, even though DOD had already notified Congress that the funds  would be released.   Here is how it worked. First, OMB issued guidance asserting that  there was an ongoing review of assistance, even though none of the  witnesses who testified were aware of any review of assistance. Second,  OMB also attempted to hide the hold in a series of technical footnotes  in funding documents. And third, OMB's leadership also transferred  responsibility for approving funding obligations from career civil  servant Mark Sandy to a political appointee, Mark Duffey, someone with  no relevant experience in this funding.   Based on recent public reporting and documents DOD released under the  Freedom of Information Act, we learned that on July 25, approximately  90 minutes after President Trump's phone call with President Zelensky,  Mr. Duffey put this three-pronged plan into motion when he sent an  email to senior DOD officials, copying Sandy. The email is in front of  you. In this email, Duffey stated: Based on guidance I have received  and in light of the administration's plan to review assistance to  Ukraine, please hold off on any additional DOD obligations of these  funds, pending direction from that process. Duffey also underscored:  ``Given the sensitive nature of the request, I appreciate your keeping  that information closely held to those who need to know to execute the  direction.'' In other words, don't tell anybody about it.   Later that day, Sandy approved and signed the first July 25 funding  document, which delayed funding until August 5. Sandy testified that  the purpose of this and subsequent footnotes ``was to preclude  obligation for a limited period of time but enable planning and  casework to continue.'' Sandy also testified that his use of footnotes  was unusual and that, in his 12 years of OMB experience he could ``not  recall another event like it.''   On July 29, Duffey told Sandy he would no longer be responsible for  approving the release of DOD Ukraine funding. This was only weeks after  Sandy had raised questions about the legality of the President's hold.  Duffey also revoked the authority for approving the release of the  State Department funding from Sandy's colleague at OMB. In short,  Duffey assumed approval authority for all $391 million of the  assistance.   Over the next several weeks, with Duffey in charge, OMB continued to  issue funding documents that kept kicking the can down the road,  supposedly to allow for an interagency process--and, remember, an  interagency process that had already wrapped up back in July--while  inserting the whole time footnotes throughout the apportionment  documents stating that the delay wouldn't affect the program. Yet  concerns continued to be relayed within DOD that it had.   In total, OMB issued nine of these documents between July 25 and  September 10. Even as OMB was implementing the President's hold,  officials inside OMB advocated for the release of the funds. On August  7, OMB staff sent a memo to Director Vought recommending removing the  hold because the assistance was consistent with the national security  strategy in terms of, one, supporting a stable, peaceful Europe; two,  the fact that the aid countered Russian aggression; and, three, that  there was bipartisan support for the program. This meant that experts  at every single relevant agency involved opposed the hold.    By mid-August, DOD raised concerns that it might not be able to fully  spend the DOD funds before the end of the fiscal year. Laura Cooper  testified that DOD estimated that $100 million of aid was at risk of  not getting to Ukraine. DOD concluded that it could no longer support  OMB's claim, in the footnotes, that ``this brief pause in obligations  will not preclude DOD's timely execution of the final policy  direction.'' Sandy testified that this sentence in the footnotes was  ``at the heart of that issue about ensuring that we don't run afoul of  the Impoundment Control Act.''   Records produced in response to a FOIA lawsuit show that Mr. Duffey  and Ms. McCusker exchanged emails on August 20, and on that date, OMB  modified the footnote. These emails are almost entirely redacted;  however, all the subsequent footnotes issued by OMB during the pendency  of the hold removed this sentence regarding DOD's ability to fully  obligate the funds by the end of the fiscal year. Nevertheless, OMB  continued to implement the hold at the President's direction. We know  from emails released last night that as of September 5, OMB was  continuing to instruct DOD to hold the aid. OMB gave these emails to a  private organization just because of a FOIA lawsuit.   On September 5, Duffey emailed McCusker the following:         No movement on Ukraine. Footnote forthcoming to continue       hold through Friday.    We know that McCusker responded to OMB with a lengthy email detailing  [[Page S465]]  DOD's serious concerns, but OMB redacted almost the whole thing.   As I explained last night, OMB has key documents that President Trump  has refused to turn over to Congress--key documents that go to the  heart of one of the ways in which the President abused his power.   Concerns about whether the administration was bending, if not  breaking, the law contributed to at least two OMB officials resigning,  including an attorney in OMB. According to Sandy, one colleague  specifically disagreed with OMB General Counsel about the application  of the Impoundment Control Act. As I mentioned earlier, the independent  and nonpartisan Government Accountability Office has already said that  the hold was illegal. But you remember the OMB correspondence  referencing the ``Interagency Process.'' As we now know, there was no  interagency process. It had ended months before. They made it up. They  had to make it up because they couldn't say the real reason for the  hold.   Sometime prior to August 6, Ambassador Bolton had a one-on-one  meeting with President Trump. According to Tim Morrison, at that  meeting, the President ``was not yet ready to approve the release of  the assistance.'' Ambassador Bolton instructed Morrison to look for  other opportunities to get the President's Cabinet together ``to have  the direct, in-person conversation with the President about this  topic.'' Everyone was worried, including the President's National  Security Advisor.   In mid-August, Lieutenant Colonel Vindman drafted a Presidential  decision memorandum for Ambassador Bolton to present to President Trump  for a decision on Ukraine security assistance. The memorandum  recommended that the hold be lifted. Morrison testified that the  memorandum was never provided to the President because of other  competing issues. Morrison testified that a meeting with the President  was never arranged in August, reportedly because of scheduling  problems.   According to recent press reports, on August 30, Secretary of Defense  Esper and Secretary of State Pompeo met with President Trump and  implored him to release the security assistance because doing so was in  the interest of the United States. However, President Trump continued  to ignore everybody. Later that day, Duffey emailed Under Secretary of  Defense Elaine McCusker and wrote: ``Clear direction from POTUS to  hold.''   The Ukrainian Government knew of President Trump's hold on security  assistance well before it was publicly reported on August 28. This was  not surprising. U.S. diplomat Catherine Croft testified it was  ``inevitable that it was eventually going to come out.''   She said that two individuals from the Ukrainian Embassy here in  Washington approached her approximately a week apart ``quietly and in  confidence to ask me about an OMB hold on Ukraine security  assistance.'' She could not precisely recall the dates of these  conversations but testified that she was ``very surprised at the  effectiveness of my Ukrainian counterparts.'' Everyone was worried. Why  would these diplomats quietly make this inquiry? It is because if it  had gone public, it would show that weakness against Russia which was  so concerning to everybody involved. She said: ``I think that if this  were public in Ukraine, it would be seen as a reversal of our policy .  . . it would be a really big deal in Ukraine, and an expression of  declining U.S. support for Ukraine.   Meanwhile, Laura Cooper testified that DOD heard from the Ukrainian  Embassy on July 25--the same day as President Trump's call to President  Zelensky.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         LAURA COOPER. On July 25th, a member of my staff got a       question from a Ukraine Embassy contact asking what was going       on with Ukraine security assistance, because at that time, we       did not know what the guidance was on USAI. The OMB notice of       apportionment arrived that day, but this staff member did not       find out about it until later. I was informed that the staff       member told the Ukrainian official that we were moving       forward on USAI, but recommended that the Ukraine Embassy       check in with State regarding the FMF.''    Mr. Manager CROW. ``USAI'' referred to the $250 million that OMB  blocked DOD from sending to Ukraine. ``FMF'' referred to the $141  million they blocked from the State Department.   On July 25, Cooper's staff also received two emails from the State  Department revealing that the Ukrainian Embassy was ``asking about  security assistance'' and that ``the Hill knows about the FMF . . .  situation to an extent, and so does the Ukrainian embassy.'' One of  Cooper's staff members reported additional contacts with Ukrainian  officials about the hold in August.   Finally, we know the Ukrainians knew about the hold because the New  York Times published an interview with the former Deputy Foreign  Minister of Ukraine, Olena Zerkal. She stated that she and President  Zelensky's office received a cable in late July informing them of the  hold.   In short, by the time of POLITICO's report on August 28, the  Ukrainians were well aware that the aid was not the only important  official act the White House was withholding from them. The long-sought  White House visit for President Zelensky was also in limbo.   As all of this transpired, Ukrainian troops were still on the  frontlines in eastern Ukraine, facing off against Russian-backed  forces, dying in defense of their country.   Ambassador Bill Taylor visited those Ukrainian troops on July 26. He  recalled seeing ``the armed and hostile Russian-led force on the other  side of the damaged bridge across the line of the contact.'' When asked  to reflect on that visit, here is what Ambassador Taylor had to say:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Mr. Chief Justice, colleagues, we will now take a 30- minute break for dinner and reconvene at 5 minutes after 7:00.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess until that  time.   There being no objection, at 6:35 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, recessed until 7:20 p.m.; whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate will come to order.   Mr. Schiff.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Justice, just so Senators have an idea  of the evening, we expect to go about 2 to 2\1/2\ hours. I will make a  presentation. Representative Lofgren from California will make a  presentation. I will make a final presentation, and then we will be  done for the evening. As an encouraging voice told me: Keep it up, but  don't keep it up too long. So we will do our best not to keep it up too  long.   I am going to turn now to the part of the chronology that picks up  right after that July 25 call and walk through the increasingly  explicit pressure campaign waged on Ukraine in order to get President  Trump's deliverable--the investigations meant to tarnish his opponent  and help his reelection.   Now remember, by the end of July, Ukraine was aware of President  Trump's requests for investigation to help his political efforts and  had come to know that President Trump put a freeze on security  assistance. So this is by the end of July. They also clearly understood  that President Trump was withholding an Oval Office meeting until those  investigations were announced. Both were very critical to Ukraine as a  sign of U.S. support and as a matter of their national security, and  their national security, of course, implicates our national security.   In the weeks after the July 25 call, President Trump's handpicked  representatives escalated their efforts to get the public announcement  of the investigations from Ukraine.   So let's go through this step by step, because the 3 weeks following  the July 25 call tell so much about this pressure scheme.   Let's start with July 26. On July 26--so this is the day after the  call--Ambassador Volker sends a text message to Giuliani, and that text  message says:         Hi, Mr. Mayor. You may have heard, the President had a       great call with the Ukrainian President yesterday. Exactly       the right messages as we discussed. Please send dates when       you will be in Madrid. I am seeing Yermak tomorrow morning.       He will come to you in Madrid. Thanks for your help. Kurt.    So here we are the day after that call, as my colleague  demonstrates--this same day, so July 26, and the date of that second  infamous call between President Trump this time and Gordon Sondland  that you heard the diplomat, David Holmes, describe. So that is the  same day, July 26, that we are talking about right now, where there is  this text message.   Now, of course, in that July 25 call, the President wants to connect  Rudy Giuliani with the President of Ukraine and his people. So this is  a followup where Ambassador Volker is saying to Giuliani:         [It was] a great call with the Ukraine President. Exactly       the right messages as we discussed.    And we know, of course, those messages were the need to do this  political investigation.         Please send dates when you will be in Madrid. I am seeing       Yermak tomorrow morning. He will come to you in Madrid.    So here is Ambassador Volker, one of the three amigos, following up,  arranging this meeting between Giuliani and the Ukrainians. Giuliani  replied, setting a meeting in Europe with President Zelensky's top aide  for the very next week:   ``I will arrive on August 1 and until 5,'' he wrote. Now remember, on  July 22--so a few days before this and before the call--Ambassador  Volker had connected Giuliani originally with Yermak, and they agreed  to meet. So this is a followup. You have that arrangement being made by  Volker and Giuliani before the call. Then, you have the call, and now  you have the followup to arrange the meeting in Madrid.   So they do meet in Madrid. This is August 2. Andriy Yermak,  Zelensky's top aide, flew to Madrid. He meets with Rudy Giuliani, who  they know represented the President's interests. Both Giuliani and  Yermak walk away from this meeting in Madrid clearly understanding that  a White House meeting is linked to Zelensky's announcement of the  investigations.   In separate conversations with Giuliani and Yermak after this Madrid  meeting, Volker said he learned that Giuliani wanted the Ukrainians to  issue a statement including specific mentions of the two investigations  that the President wanted. According to Ambassador Volker's testimony,  Yermak told him that his meeting with Giuliani was very good and  immediately added that the Ukrainians asked for a White House meeting  during the week of December 16.   Yermak presses Volker on the White House meeting date, saying that he  was waiting for confirmation: ``Maybe you know the date.'' This is a  recurrent theme that we have seen through the text messages and other  documents, and that is the recurrent requests for  [[Page S472]]  this meeting, the pressing for this meeting by the Ukrainians because  it was so important to them. Giuliani's objective was clear to  Ambassadors Volker and Sondland, who took over the communications with  Yermak.   Here is Ambassador Sondland.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Mr. Chief Justice, colleagues, we are almost through  for the evening. We will convene again at 1 o'clock tomorrow. Before we  adjourn, I would like to acknowledge that tomorrow is the official last  day for this term's Senate pages.   (Applause, Senators rising.)   In addition to witnessing this unusual event that we are all  experiencing, they are studying for their final exams as well, and we  wish them well, as they head off back to boring, normal high school.    Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that on  Tuesday, January 28, from 10 a.m. until 11 a.m., while the Senate is  sitting in the Court of Impeachment and that notwithstanding the  Senate's adjournment, the Senate can receive House messages and  executive matters, committees be authorized to report legislative and  executive matters, and Senators be allowed to submit statements for the  Record, bills and resolutions and cosponsor requests and, where  applicable, the Secretary of the Senate on behalf of the Presiding  Officer be permitted to refer such matters.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. Chief Justice, finally, I ask unanimous consent  that the trial adjourn until 1 p.m. Thursday, January 23, and this also  constitute the adjournment of the Senate.   There being no objection, at 9:42 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, adjourned until Thursday, January 23, 2020, at 1  p.m.
