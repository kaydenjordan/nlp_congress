 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Chairman Nadler, for yielding,  and I thank him for the extraordinary job that he has done as chairman  of the Judiciary Committee throughout these difficult proceedings.   Madam Speaker, my colleagues, my fellow Americans, I rise to support  the impeachment of President Donald J. Trump.   ``When a man unprincipled in private life desperate in his fortune,  bold in his temper, possessed of considerable talents, having the  advantage of military habits--despotic in his ordinary demeanor--known  to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty--when such a  man is seen to mount the hobbyhorse of popularity--to join in the cry  of danger to liberty--to take every opportunity of embarrassing the  general government and bringing it under suspicion--to flatter and fall  in with all the nonsense of the zealots of the day--it may justly be  suspected that his object is to throw things into confusion that he may  ride the storm and direct the whirlwind.'' These are the words of  Alexander Hamilton written in 1792. Could we find a more perfect  description of the present danger emanating from 1600 Pennsylvania  Avenue?   The Framers crafted a Constitution that contemplated free and fair  elections for the highest office in the land, but also afforded the  Congress with a power to remove a President who abused the powers of  his office for personal gain, who compromised the public trust by  betraying our Nation's security or who sought to undermine our  democratic system by seeking foreign intervention in the conduct of our  elections.   I would say that the Founders could have little imagined that a  single President might have done all of these things, except that the  evidence has sadly proved this is exactly what this President has done.  Hamilton, among others, seems to have predicted the rise of Donald  Trump with a staggering prescience.   Having won freedom from a king, the drafters of our Constitution  designed a government in which ambition was made to check ambition, in  which no branch of government would predominate over another, and no  man would be allowed to be above the law, including the President,  especially the President, since with whom would the danger be greater  than with the officer charged with being our Commander in Chief?   Over the course of the last 3 months, we have found incontrovertible  evidence that President Trump abused his power by pressuring the newly  elected President of Ukraine to announce an investigation into  President Trump's political rival, Joe Biden, with the hopes  of defeating Mr. Biden in the 2020 Presidential election and enhancing  his own prospects for reelection. He didn't even need the investigation  to be undertaken, just simply announced to the public; the smear of his  opponent would be enough.    To effectuate this scheme, President Trump withheld two official acts  of vital importance to a nation at war with our adversary, Vladimir  Putin's Russia. The President withheld a White House meeting that  Ukraine desperately sought to bolster its standing on the world stage.  And even more perniciously, President Trump suspended hundreds of  millions of dollars of military aid approved by this Congress to coerce  Ukraine into doing his electoral dirty work.   The President of the United States was willing to sacrifice our  national security by withholding support for a critical strategic  partner at war in order to improve his reelection prospects.   But for the courage of someone willing to blow the whistle, he would  have gotten away with it. Instead, he got caught. He tried to cheat,  and he got caught.   Now, this wasn't the first time. As a candidate in 2016, Donald Trump  invited Russian interference in his presidential campaign, saying at a  campaign rally, ``Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to  find the 30,000 emails that are missing,'' a clear invitation to hack  Hillary Clinton's emails. Just 5 hours later Russian Government hackers  tried to do exactly that.   What followed was an immense Russian hacking and dumping operation  and a social media disinformation campaign designed to help elect  Donald Trump. Not only did candidate Trump welcome that effort, but he  made full use of it, building it into his campaign plan and his  messaging strategy. And then he sought to cover it up.   This Russian effort to interfere in our elections didn't deter Donald  Trump. It empowered him. The day after Special Counsel Bob Mueller  testified before Congress about Russia's sweeping and systematic effort  to influence the outcome of our last election, the day after President  Trump believed that the investigation into his first electoral  misconduct had come to an end, the President was back on the phone  urging yet another country, this time Ukraine, to help him cheat in  another election.   Three consecutive days in July tell so much of the story, three  consecutive days in July of 2019:   July 24, the day that Special Counsel Mueller testified before  Congress and President Trump thought he was finally in the clear.   July 25, the day that President Trump got on the phone with the  Ukrainian President and, in the context of a discussion about military  support for that embattled nation that the President had recently  frozen, said, ``I  [[Page H12164]]  would like you to do us a favor, though,'' and asked Ukraine to do two  investigations to help his reelection efforts in 2020. That was July  25.   And then we come to July 26, the day Gordon Sondland called President  Trump on his cell phone from a restaurant in Ukraine. Gordon Sondland,  not some anonymous ``never Trumper,'' but a million-dollar donor to the  President's inauguration, and his hand-picked ambassador to the  European Union.                                time  1600    What does President Trump ask Sondland? The day after this call, what  does President Trump ask? What does the President want to know?   Did he ask about Ukraine's efforts to battle corruption? Of course  not. Did he ask how the war with Russia was going? Not a chance.   On the phone, his voice loud enough for others to hear, President  Trump asked Sondland, ``So he is going to do the investigation?'' And  the answer was clear. Sondland assured Trump that the Ukrainian  president was ``going to do it'' and that ``he would do anything you  ask him to.''   Madam Speaker, I say to my colleagues, if that wasn't telling enough,  in a conversation that followed, an American diplomat dining with  Sondland asked if it was true that President Trump didn't give a blank  about Ukraine.   Sondland agreed, saying, the President cared only about ``big  stuff.''   The diplomat noted that there was big stuff in Ukraine, like a war  with Russia.   And Sondland replied that the President cared only about big stuff  that benefits him personally, like the ``Biden investigation that Mr.  Giuliani was pushing.''   In that short conversation, we learned everything we need to know  about the 45th President of the United States. He doesn't care about  Ukraine or the impact on our national security caused by withholding  military aid to that country fighting for its democratic life. All that  matters to this President is what affects him personally: an  investigation into his political rival and a chance to cheat in the  next election.   As Professor Gerhardt testified before the Judiciary Committee 2  weeks ago: ``If what we are talking about is not impeachable, then  nothing is impeachable.''   Even as this body uncovered the facts of this Ukraine scheme, even as  we opened an impeachment inquiry, even as we gathered evidence,  President Trump continued his efforts to seek foreign help in the next  election. ``Well, I would think,'' he said from the White House lawn on  October 3, ``that, if they are being honest about it, they would start  a major investigation into the Bidens. It is a very simple answer,'' he  said.   And he made it clear it is an open invitation to other nations as  well, saying, ``China should start an investigation into the Bidens,''  too.   President Trump sent his chief of staff to the White House podium,  and he told the world that, of course, they had linked aid to  investigations, and that we should just ``get over it.''   And even as these articles have made their way to this House floor,  the President's personal attorney has continued pursuing these sham  investigations on behalf of his client, the President.   The President and his men plot on. The danger persists. The risk is  real. Our democracy is at peril.   But we are not without a remedy prescribed by the Founders for just  these circumstances: impeachment.   The only question is this: Will we use it? Or have we fallen prey to  another evil that the Founders forewarned? The excess of factionalism,  the elevation of party over country.   Many of my colleagues appear to have made their choice: to protect  the President, to enable him to be above the law, to empower this  President to cheat again as long as it is in the service of their party  and their power.   They have made their choice, despite this President and the White  House stonewalling every subpoena, every request for witnesses and  testimony from this co-equal branch of government.   They have made their choice, knowing that to allow this President to  obstruct Congress will empower him and any other President that follows  to be as corrupt, as negligent, or as abusive of the power of the  Presidency as they choose.   They have made their choice, and I believe they will rue the day that  they did.   When Donald J. Trump was sworn in on January 20, 2017, he repeated  these words: ``I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the  Office of the President of the United States, and will, to the best of  my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the  United States.''   Has he lived up to that sacred obligation? Has he honored his oath of  office? Has he preserved, protected, and defended the Constitution of  the United States?   The uncontested evidence provides the simple yet tragic answer: He  has not.   In America, no one is above the law.   Donald J. Trump sacrificed our national security in an effort to  cheat in the next election, and for that and his continued efforts to  seek foreign interference in our elections, he must be impeached.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Swalwell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, my colleagues have referred to patriotic Americans who  testified before the Intelligence Committee as career bureaucrats. I  want to remind people just who those career bureaucrats are.   They are people like Ambassador Bill Taylor, who has served this  country for decades. He graduated top in his class at West Point,  served during Vietnam in combat, and earned a Bronze Star.   They are people like Colonel Vindman, who served in Iraq and earned a  Purple Heart.   They are people like Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, who served in  dangerous places all over the world, one of the most respected of all  of our Foreign Service officers.   These are the people who my colleagues would pejoratively label as  ``career bureaucrats.'' Why? Because they have the courage to do their  lawful duty, to answer a subpoena and to come and testify. For this,  they are called career bureaucrats. Well, we should have more career  bureaucrats of that caliber.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am more than delighted to refer to the testimony of  Ambassador Volker and Mr. Morrison--Ambassador Volker, who acknowledged  that, in retrospect, he should have recognized that when they were  calling for investigations of Burisma, it really meant the Bidens, and  that to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival was  wrong.   I am happy to refer to his testimony as well as Mr. Morrison, who  went to the National Security Council lawyer immediately after he  listened to that telephone call and who also testified that he was  informed by Ambassador Sondland that the President wanted Zelensky ``in  a public box,'' that he wanted him to be forced to go to the mike and  announce these sham investigations.   I am happy to refer to their testimony as well.   Madam Speaker, I am now happy to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Speier).    Madam Speaker, I would just remind my colleagues that  Ambassador Volker said that the attacks on Joe Biden were meritless,  and he tried to persuade Mr. Giuliani that there was no factual support  for them.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Lewis).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Quigley).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Castro).    Madam Speaker, very quickly, my colleagues have made  repeated reference to some secret proceedings in some secret star  chamber. This is apparently what they call depositions.   I remind my colleagues that, when they were in the majority, they  conducted depositions, but they were different in this respect:   In the depositions we conducted in the Intelligence Committee, over  100 Members were able to participate. That is how secret they were. We  revealed all of the transcripts of those depositions.   The repetition of this falsehood does not make it true; it only makes  the falsehood that much more deliberate.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Amash).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cisneros).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Madam Speaker, I am happy to remind my colleagues of  Ambassador Sondland's testimony.   He posed the question: Was there a quid pro quo?   The answer is yes.   When he was asked about a quid pro quo involving the military aid, he  said it was as clear as two plus two equals four.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Ruppersberger).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Engel).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia  (Mr. Scott) for a unanimous consent request.   (Mr. SCOTT of Virginia asked and was given permission to revise and  extend his remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Carson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Malinowski).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Gomez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Just a quick fact-check before I yield to the gentleman from  Massachusetts.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim that no Republican  witnesses were allowed to testify. That is, of course, not correct.   In the Intelligence Committee, three of the Republican-requested  witnesses testified; that is, one out of every four of the witnesses  were Republican-requested witnesses. That they incriminated the  President did not make them any less requested by the minority.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Keating).    Madam Speaker, I didn't think I would have to do another  fact-check so quickly, but, of course, there was no preapproved witness  list.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Meeks).    Madam Speaker, my colleagues continue to make the  argument that the Ukrainians got the money. Yes, the President got  caught, but they got the money. No harm, no foul.   It is the equivalent of saying that if you are pulled over by a cop  and you attempt to bribe the cop, and the cop doesn't take the money  but arrests you, well, where is the crime in that? They didn't get the  money.   This is what my colleagues would have you accept. This is what my  colleagues would have you accept, that because the President got caught  in the act, we must look the other way. Of course, that is not the way  the law works. That is not the way the Constitution works. That is not  the way our oath of office works.   Our oath of office requires us to impeach a President who abuses his  power, whether he gets away with it or he gets caught. In this case, he  got caught.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Norcross).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Crow).  [[Page H12176]]         Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Luria).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, my colleagues would have the country believe that the  President held up the aid to Ukraine because he was concerned about  corruption. Of course, there is not a shred of evidence for that.   All of the national security experts across all the departments  testified that Ukraine met the criteria to receive the aid.   So what was the real motivation here? Well, one thing is telling. In  2017, the President had no problem with aid to Ukraine, raised no issue  of corruption. In 2018, he had no problem with the military aid for  Ukraine.   So what changed in 2019? Joe Biden announced he was running for  President, and all of a sudden, Donald Trump held up the aid for  Ukraine.   As Ambassador Sondland testified, the President didn't care about  Ukraine. All he cared about was the big stuff that affected him  personally, the investigation of the Bidens that Giuliani was pushing.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms.  Spanberger).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Waters).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Nevada  (Ms. Titus) for a unanimous consent request.   (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend her  remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Himes).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.  [[Page H12180]]         Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Brown).                                time  1815     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I have heard several of my colleagues in a row now,  and it is interesting to see how very few of them want to address any  of the facts of the President's misconduct.   Apparently, Madam Speaker, I have struck a nerve. Nor do they wish to  defend a President who would extort an ally, withhold military aid to  help him cheat in an election.   They don't want to defend that conduct, so, instead, they say: Oh,  Democrats really want to impeach the President, or Democrats don't like  the President.   But what they can't say is that this President's conduct was ethical.   What they can't say was that this President's conduct was legal.   What they can't say was this President's conduct was constitutional.   What they can't say is this President has upheld his oath of office.   No, they can't say that. All they can say is: We don't like the  process, or, Our colleagues are just too happy to impeach, or, It is  overturning the will of the public when it is a Republican President.   Interestingly, my colleagues who supported the impeachment of Bill  Clinton did not think it was overturning the will of the people.  Apparently, this impeachment provision only overturns the will of the  people if it is a Republican President.   I would like to give them more credit than that.   What is the distinction here is the seriousness of the conduct. This  remedy was put in the Constitution for a reason. It is not an  unconstitutional remedy. It is part of the Constitution.   The only way you can conceive of this remedy as being  unconstitutional is if you believe, as the President does, that he is  the state, that anything that opposes him opposes the state and is, by  definition, anticonstitutional.   But that, of course, is nonsense. But it is more than nonsense; it is  dangerous nonsense.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Ms. Schrier).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman).    Madam Speaker, I think, when the history of this time is  written, it will record that, when my colleagues found that they lacked  the courage to stand up to this unethical President, they consoled  themselves by attacking those who did.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano)  for a unanimous consent request.   (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York  (Ms. Clarke) for a unanimous consent request.   (Ms. CLARKE of New York asked and was given permission to revise and  extend her remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Mrs. Napolitano) for a unanimous consent request.   (Mrs. NAPOLITANO asked and was given permission to revise and extend  her remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs.  Beatty) for a unanimous consent request.   (Mrs. BEATTY asked and was given permission to revise and extend her  remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Virginia  (Ms. Wexton) for a unanimous consent request.   (Ms. WEXTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend her  remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    I thank the gentleman for his remarks.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Neal), chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Heck).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Washington.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Demings).

Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New  Hampshire (Ms. Kuster) for a unanimous consent request.   (Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire asked and was given permission to revise  and extend her remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader of the House of  Representatives.  [[Page H12190]]         Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, after 8 hours, let us return to where we began, with  the articles themselves.   Article I charges the President of the United States with abusing the  power of his office by coercing an ally into cheating in a U.S.  election on his behalf. It charges the President of the United States  with abusing his power by withholding official acts; by withholding a  White House meeting that the President of Ukraine desperately sought to  establish the support of his most important benefactor, the United  States; by withholding hundreds of millions of dollars of military aid  to a nation at war in order to get that nation to intervene in our  election by smearing his opponent. That is the gravamen of the charge  in Article I.   And what is the defense from my colleagues?   And I have listened carefully to my colleagues for the last 8 hours,  and I have to say, it has been hard for me to follow. But I think, when  you cut through it all, when you cut through all of the sound and the  fury signifying nothing, what it really amounts to is this: Why should  we care? Why should we care about what the President did to Ukraine?   Well, first of all, we should care about our allies. We should care  about Ukraine. We should care about a country struggling to be free in  a democracy.   We used to care about democracy. We used to care about our allies. We  used to stand up to Putin and Russia.   We used to. I know the party of Ronald Reagan used to.   Why should we care about Ukraine? But, of course, it is about more  than Ukraine. It is about us. It is about our national security.   Their fight is our fight. Their defense is our defense.   When Russia remakes the map of Europe for the first time since World  War II by dint of military force and Ukraine fights back, it is our  fight, too.   And when the President sacrifices our interests, our national  security for his election, he is sacrificing our country for his  personal gain.   That is the gravamen of Article I.   Article II charges the President of the United States with  obstructing the Congress, with denying the Congress any witness, any  document, by telling all of his administration people: You will not  appear. You will ignore a coequal branch of government.   And what is the defense to this from my colleagues again? It is: Why  should we care? He is the President of our party. Why should we care if  he ignores this Congress?   Well, I remind my friends that he will not be the last President.  There will be another President, and you may be, one day--although you  do not act like it--you may one day be in the majority, and you will  want to hold a President accountable.   What will you say when that President says: ``You are a paper tiger.  You have no oversight. I can ignore your subpoenas''? What will you  say? What will you argue?   ``Well, no, no, that was different. Then we were in the minority.  Then it was a Republican President.''   Will that be your argument? Is that how little faith you have in our  democracy and our Constitution? Is that how poorly you defend and  uphold our Constitution?   But, finally, let me ask this question that overrides it all: Why  should we care about any of this?   I will bring you to one conversation that came to light, because it  is not the most important conversation, but, in many ways, it is the  most revealing.   It took place on September 14 in Ukraine, when Ambassador Volker sat  down with Andriy Yermak, the top adviser to Zelensky, and he did what  he should do. He supported the rule of law, and he said: You, Andriy  Yermak, should not investigate the last President, President  Poroshenko, for political reasons. You should not engage in political  investigations.   And do you know what Yermak said: Oh, you mean like what you want us  to do with the Bidens and the Clintons?   And in that abrupt, brutal retort, we see why we should care, because  what he was saying is: You, America, have forgotten what it means to  uphold the rule of law. You have forgotten what it means to say that no  one is above the law. We are a struggling democracy, but even we know  better than that.   What is at risk here is the very idea of America. That idea holds  that we are a nation of laws, not of men. We are a nation that believes  in the rule of law.   When we say we uphold the Constitution, we are not talking about a  piece of parchment; we are talking about a beautiful architecture in  which ambition is set against ambition, in which no branch of  government can dominate another. That is what it means to uphold the  Constitution.   If you ignore it, if you say the President may refuse to comply, may  refuse lawful process, may coerce an ally, may cheat in an election  because he is the President of our party, you do not uphold our  Constitution. You do not uphold your oath of office.   Well, I will tell you this: I will uphold mine. I will vote to  impeach Donald Trump.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
