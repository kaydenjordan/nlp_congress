 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I  rise to give notice of my intent to raise a question of the privileges  of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   H. Res. 845 censuring Representative Rashida Tlaib for promoting  false narratives regarding the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel  and calling for the destruction of the State of Israel.   Whereas, Israel has existed on its lands for millennia, and the  United States played a critical role in returning Israel to those lands  in 1948 immediately following the Holocaust and in recognition of its  rights to exist as an indelible signal of our solidarity with the  Jewish people;   Whereas, Israel is a critical ally to the American people and to our  strategic national security interests in the Middle East;   Whereas, the people of Israel, including American citizens, were  brutally attacked on October 7, 2023, by Hamas;   Whereas, Representative Rashida Tlaib, within 24 hours of the October  7 barbaric attack on Jewish citizens in the State of Israel,  representing the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust, defended  the brutal rapes, murders, beheadings, and kidnappings, including of  Americans, by Hamas as justified resistance to the apartheid state;  [[Page H5409]]    Whereas, Representative Tlaib's October 8 statement claimed that  Hamas' October 7 attack on the Jewish people was partly attributable to  the United States security aid provided to Israel which ignores the  fact that the Iron Dome, a codeveloped air defense system, saved lives  that day by intercepting rockets launched from the Gaza Strip against  Israeli civilian targets;   Whereas, on October 18, 2023, Representative Tlaib continued to  knowingly spread the false narrative that Israel intentionally bombed  the Al Ahli Arab hospital on October 17 after United States  intelligence, Israeli intelligence, and President Biden assessed with  high confidence that Israel did not cause the explosion;   Whereas, on November 3, 2023, Representative Tlaib published on  social media a video containing the phrase ``from the river to the  sea'' which is widely recognized as a genocidal call to violence to  destroy the State of Israel and its people to replace it with a  Palestinian state extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean  Sea;   Whereas, Representative Tlaib doubled down on this call to violence  by falsely describing ``from the river to the sea'' as ``an  aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful coexistence''  despite it clearly entailing Israel's destruction and the denial of its  fundamental right to exist; and   Whereas, Representative Tlaib has repeatedly displayed conduct  entirely unbecoming of a Member of the House of Representatives by  calling for the destruction of the State of Israel and dangerously  promoting false narratives regarding a brutal, large-scale terrorist  attack against civilian targets inside the sovereign territory of a  major, nonNATO ally while hundreds of Israeli and American hostages  remain in terrorist captivity: Now, therefore, be it resolved that  Representative Rashida Tlaib be censured.
