 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 609, I call  up the bill (H.R. 2201) to amend the Securities Act of 1933 to exempt  certain micro-offerings from the registration requirements of such Act,  and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the  House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, we know that, unfortunately, after 8 years of bad  economic policies from the Obama administration, working people did not  receive a pay increase. We know that we had one of the lowest labor  participation rates in modern history. We know that the economy was  limping along at 1\1/2\ to 2 percent economic growth.   But, fortunately, Mr. Speaker, a new day has dawned and now, all of a  sudden, we see that, with the policies of Republicans in Congress, with  the policies of the Trump administration, we are seeing promising  signs. What we are seeing all of a sudden now is 2 quarters, Mr.  Speaker, of 3-plus percent economic growth. This means a difference to  working families. They are finally seeing increases in their paychecks,  increases in their take-home pay.   That is why one of the most exciting policies that are being worked  upon today that we hope to see soon is fundamental, pro-growth tax  reform for the entire American economy; one that would grow our economy  and that makes a Tax Code fairer, flatter, simpler, more competitive;  one that would lower rates for families and allow 90 percent of  Americans to fill out their forms on something akin to a postcard;  something that would help our small businesses and entrepreneurs.   I look forward, Mr. Speaker, to having that legislation on the floor  soon. But we have legislation today that is also important to our small  businesses and our entrepreneurs, H.R. 2201, by the gentleman from  Minnesota.   What is so important about this legislation, Mr. Speaker, is that it  would allow our entrepreneurs and our small businesses to more  effectively be able to reach out to family and friends to get the  needed capital to start their businesses.   A 2014 survey by the Kauffman Foundation found out that over 28  percent of startups raise their funding from their personal network.  Mr. Speaker, we have a challenge, and that is the Securities Act does  not clearly define what is a public offering or, conversely, a  nonpublic offering. So this makes it very difficult for our early-stage  entrepreneurial growth companies to go out and do any kind of private  placement to raise funds from friends and family.   Now, we know that a private placement is already something that is  established in law. But what isn't established is a bright line, safe  harbor for these business enterprises to go out and raise these funds.   So what we also know, unfortunately, from our Securities and Exchange  Commission is that a registered offering is simply not economically  [[Page H8668]]  feasible for a small business, an entrepreneur, an issuer who is  seeking to raise less than $1 million.   So too often, Mr. Speaker, we have a number of these enterprises  that, frankly, just never get jump-started because they don't have the  opportunity for a private offering. That is why it is so important.   I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer) for his  leadership in bringing this legislation to the House floor today.   So it is a simple piece of legislation. Again, it simply allows a  bright line, safe harbor for very small offerings. It requires that  each purchaser has a substantive preexisting relationship with an  officer, director, or shareholder of the issuer.   The issuer must reasonably believe that there are no more than 35  purchasers of the securities, and the aggregate amount of all  securities sold by the issuer cannot exceed $500,000 in a 12-month  period.   So, Mr. Speaker, we are talking about a very small portion of  startups, but a very vitally important section of our startups that  need capital.   Mr. Speaker, a few decades ago there was a company where a gentleman  borrowed money from his father to import Japanese sports shoes, and he  purchased 200 pairs of these Japanese sports shoes. He started a  business called Blue Ribbon Sports, and today we know it as Nike.   A few decades ago there was an investor out in Omaha, Nebraska, who  borrowed money from seven friends and family members, including his  sister Doris and Aunt Alice. Over the next 9 years, this initial  investment grew, and this gentleman purchased something called  Berkshire Hathaway, the textile company that has now led to the  Berkshire Hathaway empire.   In 1994, there was a gentleman who took a loan from his parents,  moved to a two-bedroom, small apartment, and launched a company called  Amazon.   We want to make sure that the next Berkshire Hathaway, the next  Amazon get launched, and that is why it is so critical we enact H.R.  2201.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), the sponsor of the legislation and an  outstanding member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds, just to say,  as I listen to the gentleman from Rhode Island and the ranking member,  their comments are very interesting, but everything they described is  already illegal. Their remarks acknowledge that the SEC can and does  bring actions to enforce the securities laws and shut down fraud when  they discover the fraud.    Nothing in H.R. 2201 eliminates the DOJ's ability to pursue criminal  prosecutions or fraud. Nothing in it impacts the SEC's ability to  pursue civil actions against issuers who engage in fraud under section  17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. It is just a red herring. It is  one of the reasons we have had such poor economic growth under the  Democratic regime.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Luetkemeyer), chairman of the Financial Institutions and Consumer  Credit Subcommittee of our committee.    Mr. Speaker, number one, I was very pleased to hear  one of the most compelling indictments of 8 years of the Obama  administration I have ever heard on the House floor, and I thank the  ranking member for it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Rothfus), who is the vice chairman of the Financial Institutions  and Consumer Credit Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton), who is the vice chairman of the Oversight and  Investigations Subcommittee.                                time  1000     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say I  heard the word ``protection'' often used by my friend, the ranking  member, but she and her friends on the other side of the aisle had 10  years to protect paychecks, protect savings, and protect economic  opportunity and the American Dream, and they failed miserably.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Davidson), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth), another member of the Financial Services  Committee.  [[Page H8676]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Norman), he is not a member of the Financial  Services Committee, but we would be proud if he were.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the chairman of the Housing and Insurance  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Wisconsin.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as always, I listen very carefully to my friend, the  ranking member. I know that she started off her closing remarks by  saying: We don't need this bill, H.R. 2201, because the big banks can  loan to the small businesses.   Well, that is fascinating to me, Mr. Speaker, because of the Dodd- Frank Act, which she so jealously supports, all of a sudden, the risk- based capital standards say that the banks have to reserve more for  small business loans than they do for sovereign debt and municipal  debt.   So all of a sudden, it is because of Dodd-Frank. In addition, we know  that the ranking member supports the Federal Reserve policy of paying  interest on excess reserves where the Federal Reserve takes taxpayer  money to pay the big banks not to loan money. So if the ranking member  was curious why the big banks aren't loaning to the small businesses,  which they aren't--and prior to the Trump administration, we know that  small business lending by banks was at a 25-year low--it is the very  reason, Mr. Speaker, that we need the bill, the legislation of the  gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer) so that we can unlock this.   Again, there is no surprise why, after 8 years of Obamanomics and the  thinking from my friends on the other side of the aisle, small  businesses have languished and why the economy has dropped down to a  1\1/2\ to 2 percent GDP growth. In fact, I think President Obama is one  of the few Presidents in American history never to enjoy a year of 3  percent economic growth.   Now, he may personally have enjoyed it, but the American people  didn't, Mr. Speaker. But the good news is that there is a change in  administration and a change of attitude. That is why it is so important  that we be able to get capital to our entrepreneurs, to our small  businesses. Let them thrive again on Main Street.   We hear so often the ranking member decry Wall Street. We are talking  about offerings of a half a million dollars. No on in Wall Street would  touch that with a 10-foot pole. This is about Main Street, not Wall  Street, Mr. Speaker.   It is interesting, as I listen to my friend, the ranking member,  decry the fact that someone might be able to raise capital under this  particular set of circumstances. Well, I have a news flash for all my  colleagues. Already the SEC can grant a private offering for exactly  the set of circumstances that my friend, the gentleman from Minnesota,  puts into his bill. All the gentleman is doing is creating a bright  line, safe harbor, so that the next Nike or the next Amazon isn't  stopped from launching their enterprise by having to spend a million  dollars on lawyers and accountants trying to navigate this uncertain  murky labyrinth of SEC waters trying to determine what is a private  offering and what is a public offering. That is all he is doing.   Again, this is already legal. It simply is discretionary to decide  what is a private offering and what is a public offering by the  Securities and Exchange Commission.   We now, Mr. Speaker, have had two quarters of 3-plus percent economic  growth. We are seeing working Americans. We are seeing their paychecks  increase yet again. We are seeing hope and resilience in the American  Dream yet again, but we have so much more work to do, and that is why  H.R. 2201 is so critical.   It takes small businesses today to be the big businesses of tomorrow.  They are the creators. They are the job engine of America. They are the  drivers of increased paychecks, greater economic opportunity, and a  bigger, bolder American Dream. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota for  this great legislation. I encourage all of my colleagues to adopt it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
