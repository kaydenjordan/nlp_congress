 Madam Speaker, in our increasingly competitive  world, the importance of education beyond our K-12 system has only  grown. As we address this reality, it is vital that we recognize the  importance of career and technical education, in addition to colleges  and universities.   That is why I am proud to be the lead Democrat on the bipartisan  Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act.  This bill, which passed the Education and the Workforce Committee last  week unanimously, will increase funding for career and technical  education by 9 percent over the next 6 years to modernize these  initiatives and to ensure students have the skills employers are  looking for.   Through investing in our citizens and our economy, this bill will  help hardworking families across the country join and stay in the  middle class. I am proud to work with my colleagues from both parties,  including Congressman Thompson from Pennsylvania, to build a more  promising future for millions of Americans, and I hope this bill will  soon receive consideration on the House floor.                            ____________________
