 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend,  Congressman Lamborn, for hosting this wonderful Special Order this  evening.   It is fitting that we commemorate the Bible's central role in moral,  educated, and free societies and that we get to celebrate the freedom  that we have in this country to own, to share, and to speak about the  Bible.   Bible reading has been a great encouragement and comfort to people  throughout history and has contributed to the spiritual, moral, and  social fiber of our Nation.   Millions of Americans have been impacted by the Bible. It is  especially important to my constituents back in the 15th Congressional  District of Illinois.   It is a priority of our home. We have daily Bible reading and  scripture memory, and we raised our children that way.   John Quincy Adams said, ``So great is my veneration for the Bible  that the earlier my children begin to read it, the more confident will  be my hope that they will prove useful citizens of their country and  respectable members of society.''   I do have to agree with Congressman Babin when he said we live in  perilous times. I would like to suggest that maybe we shouldn't have  neglected in recent times the Scriptures and maybe we need to give more  earnest heed to the Bible and what it says.   The Bible is the book above all others, to be read at all ages and in  all conditions of human life. The Psalms say, ``Your word is a lamp to  my feet and a light to my path.''   It answers all the great questions of life: Where did we come from?  Why am I here? How shall I live? What is good and evil? What is the  remedy for my sin? And where is our destiny?   May those of us who read and reverence the Holy Scriptures be doers  of the Word and not hearers only.
