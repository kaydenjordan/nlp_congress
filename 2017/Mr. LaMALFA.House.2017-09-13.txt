 Mr. Speaker, healthcare in rural America faces many  challenges and many difficulties.   This month, there are a couple of issues we will be facing. On  September 30, we have the expiration of a program for community health  centers and teaching health centers, which both aid greatly in rural  healthcare, where it is difficult to get doctors and others to locate  to those areas.   On September 30, if Congress doesn't act, we will have to at least  get an extension in place to keep those programs alive. Community  health centers are often a lifeline to rural residents in areas lacking  major hospitals. Teaching health centers, in particular, help train  physicians in underserved areas and have been a great tool to address  doctor shortages in rural America.   Mr. Speaker, we have much to do. We need to reauthorize these  programs before the end of the month or, at the very least, have an  extension so that we don't put an even greater burden on rural America  and its health challenges.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
