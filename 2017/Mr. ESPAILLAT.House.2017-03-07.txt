 Mr. Speaker, I stand today in strong opposition to the  Republican proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   This is a rushed bill, Mr. Speaker, that was written behind closed  doors in total secrecy with no daylight and with no access to the  important content of this bill that all of us should have ample time to  be able to digest the details of it and be able to make a good decision  that is consistent with the will of our constituents. This is a  [[Page H1549]]  rushed bill that was written behind closed doors, again, in total  secrecy.   Mr. Speaker, procedurally, we have not seen a CBO score of this bill.  There have been no hearings on this bill. There has been no expert  testimony on the impact of this bill, and the effect to healthcare  costs for families or the quality of coverage all of those families  will receive is completely unknown.   Substantively, this bill is an absolute nightmare. It guts Federal  requirements for essential health benefits like maternity care. It  shatters working Americans' access to insurance covering abortions. It  creates age-based subsidies, repeals all the ACA taxes, and completely  destroys the Medicaid expansion program which so much helped many of  our States.                                time  1730    In our country, at least 11 million people will lose their healthcare  insurance coverage as a result of this reckless dismantlement of  Medicaid. In my district alone, over 156,000 individuals are going to  lose their coverage with the repeal of the Medicaid expansion. Over  156,000 people, Mr. Speaker, will lose their coverage.   This bill kicks the elderly, the poor, and the sick to the curb and  benefits only the young, healthy, and incredibly wealthy.   I urge my colleagues to stand with me in opposition. This bill is a  serious heart attack to the American people. It is a blatantly partisan  action to dismantle President Obama's successful signature project:  ObamaCare. Again, the 1 percent get their way.   Mr. Speaker, as we move forward, decades to come, we will be able to  go back and think of health care within the context of three major  programs: Medicaid, Medicare, and ObamaCare.
