 Mr. President, it is an honor to recognize the  legacy of Steve Antoline as fearless leader in business, a dedicated  philanthropist, and a proud West Virginian who has made substantial  contributions to our home State.   One of the greatest milestones we achieved when I was West Virginia's  Governor was when the Boy Scouts of America committed to bringing a  world-class scouting facility to the Mountain State, and Steve was a  vital part of that process. Today, the Summit Bechtel Reserve is  homebase every 4 years for tens of thousands of Boy Scouts from across  the country. I assembled government officials, business leaders, and  private volunteers into what I called the West Virginia Project Arrow  Task Force in order to convince the National Executive Board of the Boy  Scouts of America of what we already knew--that the ideal place for  this facility was in the adventurous terrains and magnificent mountains  of West Virginia. The Boy Scouts and West Virginia truly are a perfect  match--an organization that builds character, inspires reverences, and  promotes the values of hard work and compassion, and a State whose  people live and breathe those values every day.   Steve was able to create and manage so many wonderful programs  through the camp. He worked on the Reaching the Summit Boy Scout  Community Service Initiative, organizing and garnering support for more  than 34 projects that utilized countless hours of community service for  Nicholas County. Also in Nicholas County, he serves as the chairman of  the Young Life Wild Ridge Camp Executive Committee and also as a  sponsor of the Young Life organization for the county. With Steve's  input, Young Life is currently in the early stages of building the Wild  Ridge Camp, which will host more than 22,000 children per year,  providing educational opportunities to develop leadership skills, civic  responsibility, and moral values.   As one of the founding fathers of the Summit Bechtel Reserve Scout  Camp, I cannot think of a more fitting tribute to his legacy than the  Steve Antoline Family Conservation Center and Trail. The coal from that  property helped build the Panama Canal. The timber that from that  property helped build the boats that helped win WWII. It has so much  historical value, and now it builds the tallest timber--our future  leaders. And as Scouts walk by the newly dedicated bronze tribute in  honor of Steve's legacy, it is my hope they are inspired by the man who  has surrounded them with opportunities here in West Virginia.   The Conservation Center will offer hands-on exhibits, projects, and a  laboratory for Scouts and youth to further understand and promote  conservation efforts. This project is being designed and built by  Steve, along with collaborative efforts from the Boy Scouts of America  and West Virginia University.   Beyond the camp, Steve has contributed greatly to the surrounding  region. He has founded and operated various companies that include  operations in natural gas, production, excavation, contracting,  property development and biosciences research companies. Among his many  accomplishments for West Virginia is Superior Highwall Miners, Inc., a  business based in Beckley that grew into the world's largest  manufacturer of highwall mining equipment. His efforts brought in  countless jobs and showcased West Virginia's vast potential across the  globe.   Steve serves as cochairman of the new WVU Children's Hospital  Building Campaign and also serves on the hospital's advisory board. He  is the owner of New River Labs, LLC and KEM Research Group, LLC, a  cancer research company performing state-of-the-art diagnostic services  for esophageal, cervical, melanoma, pancreatic, prostate, and many  other forms of cancer. At Summit Resources, Inc., Steve serves as owner  and president, specializing on excavation, land management, and  investment. Other organizations he has been involved with include the  Remember the Miners Organization, the Norma Mae Huggins Cancer Research  Foundation, Summersville Youth Athletics, Raleigh County, YMCA, Beckley  Chamber of Commerce, and the Fayette and Nicholas County chapter of the  American Red Cross.   Put simply, Steve is a West Virginian, through and through. He knows  our communities inside and out and has strived throughout his endeavors  to give back to the people of West Virginia, particularly to our future  leaders. He has a passion for providing our State's youth with every  opportunity possible to achieve success. With thanks to his efforts at  Summit Bechtel and beyond, countless opportunities have been created  and will continue to come to fruition in the days and years ahead.   I wish the very best for Steve and his family: his wife, Jamie; his  children, Emily, Madison, and Kristopher; and his grandchildren Nina  and Hunter. I am honored to join them and all West Virginians in  celebrating Steve's lifelong commitment to excellence in the Mountain  State.                            ____________________
