 Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I think it is  incredibly important that we read bills before we vote on them, that we  have adequate debate, and that we really understand what we are doing.   The Magnitsky Act was originally an act that sought to sanction  people in Russia--still does--but was expanded beyond Russia, and now,  this bill would expand it further.   When you are going to sanction people, there has to be an argument  about whom you are going to sanction, so the original Magnitsky Act has  in law that you would sanction people who have gross violations of  internationally recognized human rights. Well, that sounds good, but  the Magnitsky Act goes a step further and defines what these are. Gross  violations of human rights include torture; cruel, inhumane, or  degrading treatment; punishment or long detention without charges and  trial; causing the disappearance of persons by the abduction and  clandestine detention of those persons--a lot of this applies to,  really, what happened to Magnitsky; this was named after him because of  what happened to him--other flagrant denials of the right to life,  liberty, and the security of the person.   What we are having happen right now is sort of--they are trying to  pull a fast one, basically. We are going to get rid of all definitions  of gross human rights, and we are going to replace them with not a list  of things like torture and murder, indefinite detention; we are going  to replace it with the words ``serious human rights abuse.''   Well, it still sounds pretty good, but it is like, what does that  mean? The problem is that many different people have different  definitions of rights. The left, including the U.N., believes you have  a right to an abortion, to a house, to the internet, to healthcare. So  you can see how, if you have wide-open, vague, vastly ambiguous  language, someone could be President and say: The leader of that  country is denying the human right to abortion, so therefore, we must  sanction them. Without any sort of tribunal, without any sort of due  process, they would just simply sanction them. Or what if they are not  providing the internet?   So the thing is, words are important. You can't have vacuous sort of  definitions. Where did this definition--it came from the Trump  administration. So basically, what they are trying to do is mirror the  Trump administration, which gave unlimited authority to the President.  It is kind of surprising, for all the superficial rhetoric and  opposition to President Trump, that they are trying to adopt his  language now. But this language also comes from the Biden  administration because the one thing Presidents have in common is they  like unlimited power without checks and balances.   If this language goes through, it will remove any checks and balances  or any definitions as to what human rights abuses are. It is a terrible  mistake. It is rash, and we shouldn't do it.   I have offered an amendment, and I will offer it here in a moment. My  amendment simply includes the definition that I just read. Gross  violation of human rights--torture, cruel and inhumane treatment,  indefinite detention. That is what we would put in the bill, is the  actual definition. These aren't my words; these are the words of the  mostly Democrats who wrote the bill, the Magnitsky Act.   What they are trying to do is take the Magnitsky Act and drive an  enormous hole in it that you can push anything through and do sanctions  on anybody, anywhere in the world, based on a vague, ambiguous, and  vast definition that is not specific.   All I am asking is that you keep the Magnitsky Act. The irony here is  the very authors of the Magnitsky Act are on the floor saying: We don't  want the Magnitsky Act anymore. We want a big, enormous hole, that the  President can sanction anybody in the world anytime.   It is a terrible idea. It is ripe for abuse from a President.   Many on the other side had arguments with the previous President, and  they worried about him having unlimited power. So they want to give  unlimited power to their President because they like him better. Well,  guess what? I am an equal opportunity, ecumenical kind of guy who says:  No President should have vast powers. All Presidents' powers should be  circumspect. All Presidents' powers should be controlled.   All I am asking for is that we pass the original Magnitsky Act. So  this is going to be forever. This isn't a year or 2. When we first  started into the Magnitsky Act, we were going to do it for just a year  or 2 and see how it is going. This is forever. It will never come back  up again. And we are doing it with 5 minutes' worth of debate, not  going through a committee, and we are just simply going to say: Do  whatever you want. Sanction anybody in the entire world.   It is a huge mistake, it is a huge expansion of government power, of  Presidential power, and it will lead to abuse. And I promise you, the  moment there is a Republican President back in the White House, the  other side will be squawking, saying: Why is he doing this? Why is he  doing this?   So I would say take a step back. We could talk about this over the  next several days. We could come to an agreement. I have even said we  could expand the definition. The definition of ``gross violation of  human rights'' from Magnitsky should not be thrown away. And we could  add to it. If there are other things, such as corruption, that you  don't think are included, give us some words, and we will talk about it  and see if we can come to a compromise. That is what was offered, and  what we get back is that, oh, everybody else agrees on the other side,  so I should be quiet. I am talking about something that is arcane. This  is your  [[Page S1764]]  language. This is the Magnitsky Act from the last 5 years, and you are  calling it arcane?    This is a very reasonable request. It is a very unreasonable request  to ram this down the throats of Americans, to expand Presidential power  with no checks and balances, and I absolutely object to it.   I will offer as a counter, though, a unanimous consent request that  is at the desk to have my amendment pass immediately, and if my  amendment is passed immediately, that the remaining request from  Senator Schumer be passed as well.    Mr. President, I object.    Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize the  small business, Our Best Restaurant of Smithfield, KY, as the Senate  Small Business of the Week.   In 1990, the late Kenneth Way and his wife Kay embarked on a new  adventure in the autumn of their lives. After retiring from a career in  the retail industry, Kenneth bought an old wheat mill in Smithfield,  KY, population 100. Joined by his wife Kay who had just retired from  her career serving the Kentucky State government, the two opened Our  Best Restaurant. Kenneth's son Kenny Way will tell you himself that his  father was not in the restaurant business; he was in the ``people  business.'' Kenneth's motto was that if you treat people well, your  business will succeed no matter what you do. Clearly, Kenneth was on to  something as his restaurant and legacy continue to thrive for the past  32 years.   Kenneth's son Kenny Way now owns and operates the business, carrying  on his father's mission of providing top quality service to everyone  who walks in the door. Though Our Best Restaurant consistently serves  delicious country cooking, it is the warm and friendly atmosphere that  keeps people coming back time and time again. With a population as  small as Smithfield's, the restaurant cannot depend on the typical  walk-in customer that other Main Street businesses often see; their  bread and butter are the locals--and even visitors, who keep coming  back. A change in ownership never stopped their ``regulars'' from  choosing Our Best Restaurant because Kenny learned from his late father  that a loyal customer will only come back if you treat them right. That  is why the staff of Our Best Restaurant put in such an effort to get to  know their customers, to meet their families and their children, to ask  them about their day, and to show that they care about the customer's  experience beyond just the meal.   Such high-quality customer service and food have allowed Our Best  Restaurant to grow and expand. Since 1990, they have expanded their  dining space and have branched out to offer catering services asides  from their dine-in operations. The catering business became a crucial  stream of revenue for the restaurant as the COVID-19 pandemic put a  temporary end to in-person dining. Local energy and utility companies  turned to Our Best Restaurant to safely serve meals to their employees  during the height of the pandemic. Our Best Restaurant has consistently  proved to be a steadfast member of the small community of Smithfield.  The restaurant maintains great relationships with the local high  school, looking out for the local students and always feeding them a  hearty meal of Kentucky country cooking.   The reputation of the feel-good-food and friendly atmosphere of Our  Best Restaurant has allowed them to be a destination in themselves.  They often have folks drive in from Jefferson County and Franklin  County to enjoy their famous cooking. And of course, any and all  visitors receive the same smalltown welcome as any Smithfield local  would. Our Best Restaurant is the entrepreneurial embodiment of the  late Kenneth and Kay's dream come true and a wonderful example of a  father's mission carried on by his son. All across the country are  little towns like Smithfield, areas that contain little more than a  post office and a church, and it is businesses like Our Best Restaurant  that keep those small communities thriving. Congratulations to Kenny,  his son Aric, and the entire Our Best Restaurant team. I wish them the  best of luck and look forward to watching their continued growth and  success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
