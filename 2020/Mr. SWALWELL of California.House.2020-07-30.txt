 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my  amendment, number 187 and part of en bloc package number four, which  would direct the Department of Energy (DOE) to continue spending $10  million on the Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response  (HAZWOPER) worker training program in fiscal year 2021.   HAZWOPER is implemented by the National Institute of Environmental  Health Sciences (NIEHS). Through grants to outside organizations and  labor groups, NIEHS is able to provide training for both communities  near DOE sites and workers at such locations in hazardous waste and  material clean up as well as emergency response in the event of a  hazardous material release.   Many different categories of worker receive this preparation; some  examples include carpenters, firefighters, machinists, and truck  drivers. Their training can involve dealing with site-specific issues,  such as superfund locations, job-specific challenges, and dangerous  substances, including radiological materials, lead, and asbestos.   Since the program started in 1993, over 622,000 workers have received  a total of more than eight million hours of training at dozens of sites  around the country. One of those sites is in my congressional district,  at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.   HAZWOPER thus helps protect staff, work sites, and communities from  hazardous materials and emergency situations involving DOE operations.  It is a vital program that should be continued.   I urge all Members to support my amendment.           amendment no. 151 offered by ms. barragan of california         Pg 369, line 16, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $25,000,000)''.
