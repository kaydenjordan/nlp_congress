 Mr. Speaker, I rise in memory of the 500,000 lives lost  from COVID.   I rise for the 24 million Americans going hungry, 40 million  Americans struggling to stay in their homes, and more than 8 million  families who have been pushed into poverty.   I rise to support survival checks that put money in the pockets of  tens of millions of poor and working people so that they can withstand  this devastating crisis.   I rise to support childcare providers and housing assistance, small  business relief, unemployment assistance, and tax credits for children  so families can have hope again.   I rise to support a pay raise to $15 an hour for 27 million workers  across this country who so desperately need our help, lifting 1 million  people out of poverty and strengthening all of our communities.    Tonight I vote ``yes'' on this American rescue package. America, know  that help is on the way. We are with you, and we will get through this  together.
