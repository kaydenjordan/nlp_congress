 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   (The remarks of Mr. Cornyn pertaining to the submission of S. Res.  361 are printed in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')    Mr. President, on a separate and happier note, today is a  great day for our Nation's Federal judiciary. Yesterday afternoon, we  confirmed Justice Don Willett, who currently serves on the Texas  Supreme Court, who has been nominated by President Trump to the United  States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Soon we will be voting  on Jim Ho, the former solicitor general of the State of Texas, who has  also been nominated to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.   These are two outstanding nominees, and they reflect the best of  Texas. They are each fathers, lawyers, scholars, public servants, and  active participants in their communities. I wish to take just a few  minutes to discuss each of their unique stories, as well as their  sterling records of professional accomplishment.   Don Willett was raised in Talty, a small town outside of Dallas, TX.  He was adopted at a young age and raised by a single mom for most of  his life. She must have been one heck of a lady because her son went on  to achieve great things from those humble beginnings.   He attended Baylor for undergraduate and Duke Law School. He clerked  on the same court to which he has been nominated and now confirmed, the  Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. He worked in private practice and  served Governor, and then President, George W. Bush.   That is not all, though. He went on to work at the Department of  Justice's Office of Legal Policy and later served as deputy attorney  general of Texas before his appointment to the Texas Supreme Court. He  was elected to his first full term in 2006 and reelected in 2012.   While serving on my State's highest court, Justice Willett was  recognized for his excellence by the Texas Review of Law and Politics,  which named him as its ``Distinguished Jurist of the Year'' in 2014.   Justice Willett's confirmation now is good news, and, perhaps, the  best news for him personally is that he will no longer have to run for  election, as he has had to do as a member of the Texas Supreme Court,  because, of course, his appointment now is for life tenure.   Jim Ho's story is no less remarkable. Jim was born in Taiwan, and his  parents immigrated to New York when he was a toddler. Jim learned  English by watching Sesame Street.   When he was young, his parents moved to California, where Jim later  attended Stanford before moving on to law school at the University of  Chicago. As an adult, in his professional life, Jim clerked for Judge  Jerry Smith on the Fifth Circuit, the court to which he has now been  nominated and will be confirmed, and he later clerked for Justice  Clarence Thomas on the U.S. Supreme Court.   Jim has worked in a variety of legal capacities in the private  sector. He has also served at the Civil Rights Division and the Office  of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice.   It is when he was at the Civil Rights Division that I first met Jim  and I offered him a job on my Judiciary Committee staff, where he  served as my chief counsel. Later, serving as solicitor general, he had  the highest win rate before the U.S. Supreme Court of any person who  has served in that role. When I was attorney general of Texas, we  created this position of solicitor general because we had line lawyers  who would, literally, handle cases for State agencies and who would  handle those cases all the way to the Supreme Court, but really they  didn't have the experience or training as an appellate advocate that we  needed to speak with a single voice for the entire State before the  Federal courts. Jim held that role and performed with distinction. As I  said, he was enormously successful in his appellate advocacy.   Jim also bears the distinction as the first Asian-American solicitor  general of Texas, and he has taught as an adjunct professor at the  University of Texas and is published in numerous scholarly journals.   Simply put, Jim Ho and Don Willett are two stars in the Texas legal  firmament. They were extensively vetted by the bipartisan Texas Federal  Judicial Evaluation Committee, appointed by Senator Cruz and myself, as  well as the Office of White House Counsel and the Department of  Justice. I am glad we are now elevating them to the Federal bench.   I wish to commend the President on these excellent nominations, and I  thank my colleagues for their votes to support these two exceptionally  qualified men.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Mississippi (Mr. Cochran) and the Senator from Arizona  (Mr. McCain).    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2230         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

The purpose  of this resolution is to expressly declare that Congress is unified in  its condemnation of the increasingly hostile and perpetually  intransigent behavior of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.   North Korea, as the world knows, has been dangerously pursuing its  nuclear weapons capabilities for a long time. Since dictator Kim Jong  Un took power 6 years ago, he has ordered at least four nuclear tests,  including the September detonation of what his regime and outside  experts generally agree was a hydrogen bomb.   Despite great efforts made by the United States, including a recent  Executive order by our President, North Korea's history as a bad-faith  negotiator continues unabated on the world's stage. It obstinately  violates diplomatic norms and human rights at will and was recently  redesignated as a state sponsor of terrorism.   We simply can't afford to wander naively down a path of appeasement  when lessons learned over more than half a century have laid bear North  Korea's behavioral patterns. They have exposed the regime's militant  refusal to cooperate with the world community and simply denuclearize.    Our resolution asserts that the United States, as well as the United  Nations Security Council and our regional allies, should continue to  implement the strictest of sanctions regime possible required to change  the bad behavior of North Korea.   Further, we have to continue to exhaust every reasonable diplomatic  option to achieve the complete, verifiable, and irreversible  dismantlement of North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic programs.  Our resolution recognizes that the President has constitutional  responsibilities to protect the United States, but it emphasizes that a  congressional authorization is necessary prior to committing U.S.  forces to sustain military operations on the Korean Peninsula.   Of course, we hope that the worst outcome--open military conflict-- will never come to pass, but, as it continues to increase its nuclear  yield and ballistic missile capabilities, North Korea has become one  of, if not the single, greatest threat to peace in the world.   As the resolution makes clear, the United States must continue to  take all necessary precautions through a mix of diplomacy, economic  sanctions, and contingency planning. Our focus should be on exerting as  much pressure as we can on North Korea to end its nuclear weapons and  ballistic missiles programs.   I hope our colleagues will join us in adopting this resolution in  short order to send a very important and clear message about the  gravity of the threat and the severity with which we are confronting  it.
