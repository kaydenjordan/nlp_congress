 Mr. President, today I rise to discuss the dangerous  practice we have in this country that forces people with disabilities  to wait for benefits and healthcare coverage. I would first, however,  like to congratulate my colleague, the senior Senator from Rhode  Island, for his diligence and persistence in working to eliminate the  5-month waiting period for those who have amyotrophic lateral  sclerosis, known as ALS. His perseverance is admirable, and I  congratulate him for eliminating this misguided policy for people with  ALS.   My hope is we can expand this victory to eliminate the waiting  periods  [[Page S7324]]  for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits and Medicare coverage  to all eligible Americans.   Forcing Americans to wait 5 months to begin cash benefits and then  another 24 months for Medicare coverage is a dangerous policy. In many  cases, applicants have little or no income while they are waiting for  government benefits to begin. We should not be forcing someone with  stage-4 breast cancer or Huntington's Disease or any of the  disabilities or diseases that qualify a person for Social Security  Disability Insurance to wait to receive benefits. Those who have been  determined eligible are American workers who have paid into the Social  Security system throughout their lives. We have an obligation to assist  Americans in their time of need in a timely manner. When a person  receives a diagnosis, bills do not wait 5 months to be paid, healthcare  costs are not put on hold for 2 years. Their rent, their utilities,  their healthcare copayments come due immediately. Therefore, the  benefits these American workers have paid for through their Social  Security contributions should be made available to them when they are  found eligible.   I would again like to congratulate the senior Senator from Rhode  Island. His bill is an important step forward for people with ALS and  for all people eligible for SSDI benefits. Let's use this moment to  move forward and make comprehensive change to the way we administer  SSDI benefits to all eligible Americans with disabilities. Every  eligible applicant continues to have essential expenses and needs the  cash benefits and healthcare coverage provided by Medicare.   My bill, S. 2496, the Stop the Wait Act, would eliminate the waiting  periods for those eligible for SSDI benefits, regardless of diagnosis.  It would eliminate the 5-month waiting period for SSDI benefits, and it  would eliminate the 24-month waiting period for Medicare coverage. It  would help keep people from slipping in to poverty and would ensure  they have healthcare coverage.   Today, let's celebrate the policy victory and the great work Senator  Whitehouse has accomplished to improve the lives of Americans with ALS.  Tomorrow and for the days to come, let's work to secure that victory  for all Americans who are eligible for SSDI. They cannot wait.                            ____________________
