 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the gentleman, my friend from Colorado, for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes for debate, and I rise to debate the rule  providing for consideration of the three bills related to the  Department of Veterans Affairs--interestingly, all under one rule. We  have been doing two bills under one rule. We are now headed to three. I  recommend we just put all of our bills under a rule and save us a lot  of time.   The first bill under today's rule, to improve the authority of the  Secretary of Veterans Affairs to hire and retain physicians and other  employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the bipartisanship  reflected in this bill is certainly a rarity in this body and, frankly,  could have easily come before us under the suspension of the rules.   There are nearly 47,000 job vacancies for doctors, nurses, and other  medical professionals throughout the Veterans Administration's  healthcare system. The VA is consistently rated as one of the worst  Federal agencies in terms of pay and leadership, and since 2009, the  number of VA employees resigning or retiring has risen every year.                                time  1245    As of the new year, 547,000 patients were waiting more than 30 days  for care at a VA hospital. It is clear that we must act to improve the  VA on a holistic level, and this bill is a good start.   This legislation establishes staffing, recruitment, and retention  programs to enable the VA to build a stronger workforce.   However, I am disappointed that the Rules Committee majority did not  make in order an amendment that I offered to this measure, which would  have allowed the Secretary of the VA to fill any existing vacant  positions within the Veterans Administration, regardless of whether the  position was vacated before or after the reckless hiring freeze imposed  by Donald John Trump.   I would also note that Representatives Schrader and Moulton offered  an amendment that would fully lift the hiring freeze, but the Rules  Committee blocked this amendment as well from receiving a vote on the  House floor. I remain disheartened at the way the majority continues to  operate the business of the House of Representatives.   The bipartisanship this bill enjoys dissipates when we move to  another bill wrapped in today's three-rule measure, and that is H.R.  1181, the Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act. Before I launch into  all of my remarks regarding this, I want to make it very clear that I  and most Members of the House of Representatives will do everything we  can to protect the Second Amendment rights of U.S. citizens and  veterans especially.   This legislation, however, if enacted, would immediately enable  approximately 174,000 veterans currently deemed mentally unfit by the  VA to purchase firearms. At its core, this bill assumes that all  veterans with mental illness should have unfettered access to guns,  regardless of whether they will turn the weapon on themselves or their  loved ones, and that any determination otherwise is simply wrong. The  broadly reaching bill arbitrarily removes every veteran flagged by the  National Instant Criminal Background Check System from its rolls,  literally putting tens of thousands of lives at risk.   Let's look at the facts. Under procedures currently in place by the  VA and the Department of Justice, an individual who lacks the mental  capacity to contract or to manage his or her own affairs can be  prevented from purchasing a gun. This term applies to veterans with  severe mental illnesses who require a fiduciary to help manage their VA  benefits. If the veteran thinks there was an error or that he or she  was unfairly disqualified, the veteran can utilize the same due process  and appeals procedures that are available for other VA decisions.   Under the current process, which was codified in the 21st Century  Cures Act just a few months ago, the veteran is allowed a hearing  before the Board of Veterans Appeals and given several opportunities  for judicial review and appeal in Federal court.   Mr. Speaker, this bill turns this sensible and humane approach on its  head. It is time that we acknowledge where we are as a country. It is  time that we deal with the fact that we are in the midst of a veterans'  suicide epidemic. Twenty veterans kill themselves every day. That is  7,300 of our finest and bravest persons in our society. Two-thirds of  these suicides are carried out using firearms.   A Department of Veterans Affairs report, provided to Congress in  2015, revealed that nearly 20,000 veterans diagnosed with  schizophrenia, 15,000 diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder,  and thousands more diagnosed with dementia, Alzheimer's, and serious  depression were on the NICS rolls. Under this bill, these individuals  and many more would be given immediate  [[Page H2096]]  access to guns, putting themselves and others in danger.   Even as our Nation suffers shooting after shooting, Congress has not  acted. Democrats held a sit-in in this very room in that well in this  last Congress to protest the callousness of the House Republican  leadership in preventing us from even considering legislation to  protect our citizens with reference to guns. Rather than act to address  gun violence, we instead considered legislation like this, which will  actually lead to more gun violence, Mr. Speaker. The logic and lack of  compassion in such an approach absolutely escapes me.   Our country has witnessed horrific shootings in the past few years.  Dozens of children were murdered at Sandy Hook. Nearly 50 people were  killed at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. One of our very own from this  Congress was nearly assassinated while holding a townhall event in  2011. We continue to ignore the ramifications of shootings at Oak  Creek, Aurora, Virginia Tech--I could go on and on--Charleston. The  list just continues. 32,000 Americans lose their lives every year from  gun violence.   We have grieved together. And I, along with several of my colleagues,  have stopped standing down here in the well for a moment of silence and  then going back to our regular business after hundreds of our people  are killed throughout this society. We have demanded change together,  and we have been shocked by the paralysis that has gripped this  institution when it comes to taking commonsense steps to end our  country's gun violence epidemic.   Today, we see in this bill another measure coming out of Republican  leadership that sprints toward the goal set by this country's powerful  gun lobby. Listen up, NRA, there are people like me that aspire to have  a zero rating by you every year. And it is not just the gun lobbyists,  it is gun manufacturers as well. It may be great for the gun  manufacturers' bottom line and the NRA's bottom line, but it is  terrible for those brave men and women who have served this country so  fully, those brave men and women who suffer wounds that may not be  visible to the naked eye, but are no less real and worthy of our  attention.   With each new tragedy that occurs, whether it be a mass shooting or  the 20 servicemembers we lose every day to suicide, those who stand in  the way of legislation to address our country's gun violence epidemic  are increasingly culpable for its continuation. I am disgusted with  this morally bankrupt obfuscation, and I think the American people are,  too.    Let me lay down a marker. Of the 435, plus six Members of the House  of Representatives and the 100 U.S. Senators, I want to see the first  person when this measure goes into effect, if it does, and 174,000  veterans are taken off of the NICS rolls and can access guns, the first  one that dies--and I hope we track it--I want everybody to stand up and  remember that we had a chance to stop it here. Don't tell me, if 20  veterans are killing themselves every day and if 7,000-plus of them are  killing themselves every year--and we won't even mention domestic  violence and the horror that comes from those guns--if we continue this  effort, we will allow more deaths along those lines.   Before concluding, Mr. Speaker, I want to say a few words about the  final bill encompassed in this rule, H.R. 1259, the VA Accountability  First Act of 2017, and the Republicans' continued assault on the  working people of this country.   At its core, this bill is an attack on workers' rights, plain and  simple, and will do more harm than good in our efforts to improve care  at the Veterans Administration. This legislation would strip the  collective bargaining rights of VA workers. It weakens an employee's  right to appeal. It weakens protections for VA workers who speak up  against mismanagement and patient harm.   Republicans claim they want to help fix our VA system, yet, with this  bill, they do that by insulting, undermining, and attacking the very  employees who serve and care for our veterans, including the over  120,000 veterans who work for the VA. Yesterday, one of our colleagues  presented at the Rules Committee a statistic that I didn't know. Of the  2 million Federal employees in this great Nation of ours, 640,000 of  them are veterans. So when we get ready to pare back this government  that somehow or another people have targeted for all sorts of cuts, if  you read today's budget proposal by Donald John Trump, you will see  that lots of these veterans will be losing their jobs, in addition to  all of the things that we have already discussed.   We need to make improvements at the VA. Everybody knows that. That is  clear. But singling out VA employees and their protections is  counterproductive, to say the least, and only compounds manpower  shortages plaguing the agency.   This legislation will exacerbate recruitment problems and impair  retention at the agency. It threatens the agency's ability to build a  robust clinical workforce by threatening the quality of care that the  VA will be able to provide.   I don't know what the pique is by my Republican colleagues with  reference to workers in this country. They talk a very good game about  protecting workers and we are going to bring back jobs and we are going  to do all of these things that are going to protect the middle class.   I will get a chance to talk about this a little bit more, but I am  very proud of the unions in this Nation. They are the unions that  people like my father and countless of us who served in the House of  Representatives worked in and helped build this Nation. They are the  people that our veterans from the Second World War, the Korean  conflict, and Vietnam who became union members and went on to do things  for collective bargaining that made workers' rights be better for  people in America. And I don't see tearing them down--let alone in the  VA administration--is something that we need to do.   Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side of the aisle know exactly  where their priorities lie with this bill, and it is certainly not with  improving the quality of care of our veterans, but rather in exploiting  yet another opportunity to attack the rights of working men and women  across our country.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I have great respect for my colleague whose district abuts a portion  of my district in Florida. I want to make it very clear that it is  important to listen to what a person says. My colleague just commented  that I did not offer the specifics with reference to persons who  suffered some form of mental illness; and he said that, in my  passionate remarks, I failed to provide those specifics.   Let me go back and read you my remarks again. A Department of  Veterans Affairs report provided to Congress in 2015 revealed that  nearly 20,000 veterans diagnosed with schizophrenia, 15,000 diagnosed  with post-traumatic stress disorder, and thousands more diagnosed with  dementia, Alzheimer's, and serious depression.   Is that specific enough for you, or do I need to add additional  reasons?   Evidently my colleague didn't hear that.    I yield to the gentleman from Florida.    Reclaiming my time, is schizophrenia one of those  things that isn't specific enough for you?    Reclaiming my time, that is what you should have said  rather than say that I didn't offer specifics, and I just want to make  that very clear to you.   I don't think that people with diagnosis of schizophrenia, that have  been allowed--that their fiduciaries have determined that their mental  illness allows that they should not get a gun, I suggest to you and to  anybody that those persons that have a gun--and I made the distinction.  You evidently didn't hear that part either. I made the distinction  about the Second Amendment and how much I support it and I support  veterans, and I support veterans' rights to defend themselves. But I  don't support crazy people having guns, whether they are veterans or  not, and it is just that simple.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Takano), the vice chair of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I would urge my friend from Colorado to  know that I have no additional speakers and I am prepared to close if  he is prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my friend that sits on the Rules Committee, my colleague  from Georgia, correctly speaks to this issue and its need to go to the  Judiciary Committee or other committees to ensure that veterans have  the appropriate adjudication.   I don't know where he or my colleague from Florida would place  schizophrenia. I am not a mental health expert, but I have spent a good  portion of my career here in Congress dealing with issues and trying to  address issues of mental health, be it veterans or not.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer  an amendment to the rule to bring up H.R. 696, Representative  Schrader's bill to exempt the Department of Veterans Affairs from  Donald John Trump's hiring freeze. As we have already discussed, my  amendment to allow the VA Secretary to fill vacant positions,  regardless of whether they were vacated before or after the hiring  freeze, was blocked last night in the Rules Committee.   There are nearly 47,000 vacant positions within the VA, and we should  not be limiting the VA's authority to fill these positions, especially  as we continue to work towards reducing patient wait times.   On a bipartisan basis, Members of both the House and Senate have  requested that the VA be exempt from the hiring freeze. Mr. Speaker,  this is commonsense legislation to ensure that the VA can recruit and  hire qualified staff to meet the needs of our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day, we are gathered  here, once again, to debate the same old, tired, irresponsible, and  morally bankrupt policies championed by my friends across the aisle,  policies that will, while we face a suicide epidemic among those  servicemembers who have so bravely served this country, make it easier  for them to take their own lives by increasing their access to guns.  That may be good policy for the powerful gun lobby and gun  manufacturers, but it is horrendous policy for the American people.   We have before us legislation that will gut workers' rights for VA  employees while also making it easier to reprimand those who are brave  enough to speak out against the ills they see occurring at the VA--ills  that have and will continue to undermine the quality of service our  veterans are able to receive.   All of this moral ineptitude is set against the backdrop of a  healthcare plan recently put forth by Republicans that will raise the  number of uninsured in this country to 24 million in under 10 years.  This includes 14 million folks being unceremoniously kicked off of  Medicaid and 7 million Americans kicked off of the health insurance  plans they receive through their employers.   This is a plan that will increase premiums for individual  policyholders by up to 29 percent. This is a plan that will increase,  particularly for older Americans, out-of-pocket healthcare expenses.   Mr. Speaker, in the final analysis, this is no plan at all but rather  a shameful and cynical massive giveaway to the ultrawealthy at the  expense of the middle class that will result in hardworking Americans  paying far more for far, far less.   Mr. Speaker, I have been in this institution 25 years, and I have  been on this Earth 80 years. I have seen an awful lot of trauma during  that period of time. I served as a State court judge and had the  responsibility of Baker Acting--it is called in Florida--people to  mental institutions. I have established fiduciaries for people who were  unable to take care of themselves. I worked actively when we had mental  health hospitals to keep those mental health hospitals open.   I would say to you, Mr. Speaker, so that you can say to the gentleman  who asked that I apologize, that I apologize for nothing having to do  with any remarks that I made within the confines of what is allowed in  this institution. The simple fact of the matter is I used the term  ``crazy,'' and I had reference to schizophrenia. Now, it may very well  be that these are not broken people, it is that they are brave people  who came home with problems. But crazy is crazy, and I would say that  until the day I die.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
