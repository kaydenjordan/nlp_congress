 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Financial  CHOICE Act, a bill that will provide the much-needed relief from the  harmful, complex, and excessive regulatory environment created by the  Dodd-Frank Act.    In the 7 years since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, our Nation  has suffered from anemic economic growth, increasingly limited  financial choices for consumers, and an unprecedented level of job- killing regulations. All the while, big banks have grown larger, and  small banks and credit unions have suffered. In fact, community banks  are closing at the rate of one per day.   Many of my constituents in small and rural towns in the Tampa Bay  area rely heavily on their community banks for financial services. When  those banks are forced to close their doors or raise their fees due to  excessive regulation, my constituents lose access to essential services  and opportunities.   Simply put, Dodd-Frank has failed.   The Financial CHOICE Act represents an alternative and effective  approach to financial regulation, which will protect taxpayers and bank  bailouts, empower investors, and hold government bureaucracies  accountable.   This legislation makes it easier for hardworking Americans to save  and invest for retirement, college, and their future. It will also  increase access to and reduce the cost of credit for families that want  to purchase a home or start a business.  [[Page H4723]]    I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of this bill  and helping Washington get off the backs of hardworking taxpayers.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano), a senior member of the Financial  Services Committee.
