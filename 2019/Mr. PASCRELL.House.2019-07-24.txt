 Mr. Speaker, for years, multiemployer pension plans  offered working-class Americans something almost priceless: a nest egg  for their retirement. This security was provided through collective  bargaining benefit plans. Workers put in their own hard-earned  dollars--they did not fall down on their obligations--for the promise  of a safe and secure retirement.   Workers entered into a contract. You know what a contract is?   Industry deregulation, the decrease in the unionized workforce after  decades of concerted political attacks, and the devastating--the other  side had the House of Representatives for so many years in the last 20  years; they never even introduced a labor bill. What are they talking  about--bipartisan?   This means almost 200 multiemployer plans are projected to fail. Some  of them are going to be in your district, in your district. Plans are  projected to fail, many within the next 10 years. Mr. Speaker, 1.3  million are at risk.    At the Joint Select Committee on Solvency of  Multiemployer Pension Plans hearing last year, my constituent Carol  Podesta-Smallen said that her monthly benefits were on the verge of  being cut by 61 percent--read that--from $2,600 to $1,022. Imagine that  loss.   ``My biggest fear,'' she told the committee, ``is losing my home''  and ``ending up in a shelter.''   Thanks to the Butch Lewis Act, which creates a unique public-private  partnership, 1.3 million working Americans might not have to fear any  longer.
