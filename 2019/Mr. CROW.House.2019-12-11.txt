 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3, the Elijah  E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act.   For too long, we have seen the influence of Big Pharma on this  Chamber. For every Member of Congress, there are three industry  lobbyists looking to buy their vote.   Meanwhile, back home in Colorado, one in three of my constituents  can't afford to pay for their medication. It needs to stop.   I am proud to have helped introduce a provision to H.R. 3 that would  prevent Big Pharma from raising the cost of prescription drugs past the  rate of inflation.   I stand here today for the 300,000 Coloradans with diabetes who will  save 75 percent on their insulin. I stand here today for the 400,000  Coloradans with asthma, who will save 80 percent on their  prescriptions.   And tomorrow I will cast my vote for my constituents, people like Sue  Way of Aurora, who, after seeing her insulin increase by 500 percent,  was forced to ration her medicine, resulting in an ulcer.   Her story is the story of so many Coloradans. The time is now to  deliver on our promise to reduce the cost of prescription drugs.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I am proud to stand here with my colleagues to support the Farm  Workforce Modernization Act on behalf of farmers and farmworkers in  Colorado. Colorado farms are doing all they can to move forward,  despite the administration's trade war, which has led to a 15 percent  reduction in Colorado agricultural exports in 2019. It has also stifled  the migrant seasonal farmworker program when farmers need it the most.   Throughout this year, I have met with farmers in my district,  including Robert Sakata of Sakata Farms in Brighton, Colorado, which  was started in 1945 by his father. To Robert and other Western growers,  modernizing the guest worker program is crucial to their success as a  family farm and their contribution to our local economy.  [[Page H10075]]    This important piece of bipartisan legislation will do just that. The  bill will establish a program for Colorado farmworkers to earn legal  status, improve the H-2A program by ensuring critical protections for  workers, and establish a mandatory nationwide E-Verify system for all  farmworkers.   I thank my colleague Representative Lofgren and all those who have  worked across the aisle to get this very important bill done.
