 Mr. Speaker, I rise to call attention to the outright  assault on working people in America by the Trump administration.   When candidate Trump ran and carried States like Ohio, Michigan, and  Wisconsin, he promised to renegotiate NAFTA to secure U.S. jobs and  stop outsourcing. He said he would fight to raise people's paychecks.   Well, wages aren't keeping up with the cost of living as workers  backslide on hourly wages, while healthcare and prescription drug costs  rise and retirement benefits are being cut.   This week, Harley Davidson just announced it will outsource hundreds  of jobs because of the Trump trade war. Meanwhile, the NAFTA trade  deficit remains far too high under the Trump administration. That means  more lost U.S. jobs and a diminished middle class.   Now, why has President Trump delayed NAFTA renegotiations so critical  to creating a level playing field both in our country and across our  continent?   Instead of renegotiating NAFTA to heal these gaping deficits and to  prevent pitting one group of workers against another on this continent,  he is targeting the lowest wage workers in the Americas and tearing  them apart from their children, their families, and their communities.  Most are agricultural workers who work in grueling jobs, for which U.S.  citizens rarely apply.                                time  1045    Let me bring you to Ohio. Just in the past 3 weeks, Ohio communities  have faced six massive worker raids at two Corso Lawn and Garden  centers and at four Fresh Mark animal slaughter facilities.   America has a choice: We can either grow and process our food and  floriculture inside this country; or, if we fail to tend it, we will  outsource more and more of our production and be forced to import more  food and cede more jobs that relate to agriculture.   These worker raids create a climate of fear where workers are too  afraid to stand up for their rights, to report wage theft, or to  redress dangerous work conditions facing them.   Working in a meat slaughterhouse is among the most dangerous jobs in  the United States of America. NAFTA forces workers who work in these  jobs to exist in a shadow economy and be treated as, yes, less than  human.   The raw truth is NAFTA was purposefully designed to create an exodus  of millions of displaced small farmers in the Mexican countryside who  have become an exploitable underclass of vast dimension across this  continent. Millions and millions of small farmers were turned off their  land, forming an endless pool of cheap, exploitable labor in the  Americas. I call it the most significant continental sacrilege in my  lifetime.   Voila. There it is, the cold, hard truth of NAFTA's underbelly, still  left unaddressed after a quarter century.   Their lives are viewed as cheap, those human lives given no value in  this continent's enormous economy. Yet we wouldn't eat without them. We  wouldn't recreate without them.   Where is President Trump? Instead of fixing this NAFTA problem, he  has sidelined NAFTA renegotiation. Instead of fixing this problem,  congressional Republicans passed a GOP tax scam that gives away  trillions to the ultrawealthy--the top 1 percent got 83 percent of the  benefits--while adding trillions to our deficit. Meanwhile, workers are  facing increased health costs, cutbacks in retirement benefits,  unaffordable medicine and healthcare, and rising education costs for  their children.   How about that? Instead of carefully targeted trade relief and going  after closed global markets, the Trump administration starts a trade  war with most of our allies.   It isn't productive that this President of the United States is  offending the President of Mexico and the Prime Minister of Canada.  Really? Our closest neighbors.   Young people are expressing workplace frustration as well with the  jobs in the so-called gig economy with Uber or elsewhere, where a 20- year-old, sure, can work, but with far fewer benefits and much less  security and stability.   Mr. Speaker, it is time for a better deal for workers across this  continent, starting with an enforceable NAFTA trade pact that has  strong labor provisions and a labor secretariat on both the agriculture  and industrial side.   I am one of the Democrats willing to work with Republicans and roll  up my sleeves to reach that compromise, as difficult as I know it will  be.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the 2016 election and its fallout  highlighted what many Americans already knew, that special interests  bankroll candidates in exchange for expected favors down the road and  loopholes allow foreign governments to influence our elections. Look no  further than the pervasive impact of Russian-sponsored political ads on  Facebook in 2016.   My bill, the REFUSE Act, Repelling Encroachment by Foreigners into  U.S. Elections, tightens campaign finance laws and lobbyist disclosure  rules to protect our democracy from foreign influence.   First, to stem the bleed of special interest money into our  elections, our bill sets a reasonable limit on foreign ownership within  corporate PACs and 501(c)(4) nonprofits that spend on our elections.  Second, the bill tightens reporting requirements for foreign agents and  gives the Justice Department real enforcement authority to go after the  bad guys.   Until we repeal Citizens United, which threw open the floodgates for  billionaires and special interests to spend unlimited secret money on  our elections, we need commonsense legislation like the REFUSE Act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in fortifying our  democratic Republic against foreign influence.                            ____________________
