 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the passage of the  Voting Rights Advancement Act, H.R. 4.   This crucial legislation would give more power to the historic Voting  Rights Act of 1965. That law protected the right to vote for all  Americans, particularly Americans of color. It gave a strong voice to  the voiceless. And when those Americans spoke, they created a more  diverse Congress. Clearly, we are all better for it.   But, slowly, certain State governments have tried to hinder the  voting rights of minorities. They call it something else, but that is  what they want to do. That is why we need this bill to become law.   We need the government to provide oversight if States are guilty of  too many voting rights violations. We need to protect the right to vote  for all Americans because, for too many of us, the power of the vote is  the only power we have.                            ____________________
