 Madam Speaker, here we go again. The majority Democratic  party wants to kill our children through abortion.   I rise today to discuss the importance of H.R. 18, the No Taxpayer  Funding For Abortion Act. For over two decades, lawmakers have passed  the Hyde amendment in a bipartisan fashion to ensure Americans aren't  forced to fund abortion on demand with their hard-earned tax dollars.   We have had a strong majority of Americans--Democrats and Republicans  alike in the past have agreed to this. Folks, it is a sad day in  America, as a father and a grandfather, to have this embarrassing  example of the killing of our children. Unborn children are no less  alive than I am. All life is a gift that begins at conception, and  develops rapidly before birth. To expect Americans to subsidize these  inhumane killings is a complete disgrace. That is why I have always  fought for the sanctity of life, and I will continue to fight.   I ask for the passage of H.R. 18 so the ban on Federal funding for  abortions is not only permanent, but Government-wide.                            ____________________
