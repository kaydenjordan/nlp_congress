 Mr. Speaker, the President's executive order of Friday  violates the law, it violates the Constitution, and it violates good  sense.   How does it violate the law? Section 202(a)(1) of the Immigration and  Nationality Act specifically prohibits nationality-based discrimination  in the issuance of immigrant visas and other visas. That is what this  order did.   Now, the law is clear that individuals who pose a threat to the  United States can--and I should add, should be--barred from the United  States; but you can't just legally make a blanket objection based on  nationality and, I would add, based on religion. That is what the  President's order does. It suspends refugee admission completely for  months.   Who are these refugees? Most of the refugees admitted last year were  from Burma and the Congo, not from Syria. They are people who have been  vetted for years, many of whom are fleeing for their lives and will  continue to live in fear.   It does something else. It suspends admission even of legal permanent  residents from seven countries, violating their rights to equal  protection and to due process.   People want to keep the country safe--we all do; of course, I do--but  how does this order keep us safe? Let me just give an example.   General Talib al-Kenani from Iraq commands the elite American-trained  counterterrorism forces that have been leading the fight against ISIS  for 2 years. His family relocated to the U.S. for safety. He can't  visit them anymore. He said this:         I have been fighting terrorism for 13 years and winning.       Now my kids are asking: Am I a terrorist? I am a four-star       general, and I am banned from entering the United States.    I ask you: How does this advance our safety by barring our allies who  are fighting ISIS? It doesn't.   I have got to correct something else. People have said that President  Obama had an order in 2011 barring immigrants from Iraq. That is false.  We did additional vetting in 2011 because we wanted to make sure that  anyone coming in was thoroughly examined. That slowed things down a  little bit because there were new procedures, but there was never a  halt to admission from those who are our allies in Iraq, those fighting  ISIS with us.   I would just like to say that, in addition to violating the law,  causing hardship for families trying to visit people in the hospital,  permanent residents who are engineers trying to come back to run their  companies in Silicon Valley, this order is a gift to ISIS. They are  already using it to recruit enemies of our country by saying: America  is fighting Islam. As George Bush said when he was President, our  argument, our fight is not with Islam. Our fight is with terrorism.   To issue this order with the President's rhetoric saying that we are  going to make a distinction on who is admitted to the United States  based on their religion is not only illegal, it is contrary to American  values and it is contrary to our safety.   So I hope that, instead of doing this antienvironment bill today, we  will instead take up H.R. 724. This is a bill that would defund and  rescind President Trump's ill-advised order from Friday.   Let me just say this. I would like to issue a formal invitation to  every Republican Member of this House to join  [[Page H765]]  me as a cosponsor of this bill. I will be sending out a formal note to  each one later today, but you are on notice to please join us.   We as American legislators need to make sure that the rule of law is  upheld. Many of our constituents are very uncertain about whether the  rule of law is going to survive this Presidency. Help give them faith  and hope by cosponsoring this bill.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I would plead for unanimous consent to  bring up H.R. 724 to overturn President Trump's refugee ban so that  individuals like Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who helped the U.S. military  in Iraq and who has a special immigrant visa, won't be detained at JFK  Airport for 19 hours.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from Washington yield for  the purpose of this unanimous consent request?    Mr. Speaker, I was detained at a classified briefing  with the Secretary of Homeland Security causing me to miss these two  votes. Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No.  68 and ``nay'' on rollcall No. 69.                            ____________________
