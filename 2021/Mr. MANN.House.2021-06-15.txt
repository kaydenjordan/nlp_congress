 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in fierce opposition to President  Biden's proposed budget.   When he released his budget just a few weeks ago, nearly 3 months  later than any President in a transition year, by the way, President  Biden reminded Americans of advice his father gave him years ago.  ``Don't tell me what you value,'' Biden's father told him. ``Show me  your budget, and I'll tell you what you value.''   If that is true, then Biden's $6 trillion budget reveals to us  exactly what President Biden values: destroying America's oil and gas  industry, prioritizing the rights of illegal immigrants over law- abiding Americans, funneling foreign aid away from our longtime ally  Israel, turning a blind eye to protecting the unborn.   Under the Biden budget, President Biden suggests we spend our hard- earned dollars fixing problems he created.   He wants us spending $174 billion on electric cars, carports, car  charging stations, and other subsidies to the electric vehicle market  in a full-on attempt to replace the oil and gas industry; $40 billion  to retain employees who lost their jobs after he blocked the Keystone  pipeline and destroyed thousands of energy jobs; and a total of $36  billion to combat climate change, bringing back the waters of the U.S.  rule and mandating 30 percent of our privately owned land be locked in  conservation practices. President Biden's budget is the progressive's  Green New Deal in disguise, and America doesn't want anything to do  with it.   President Biden wants $2 billion to provide care for unaccompanied  migrant children at our southern border after he put millions of  innocent children in harm's way and encouraged immigrants to cross  illegally. He wants no extension of funding to complete the already  nearly finished wall system or money to enforce our immigration laws at  the border and instead instated an executive order stopping  construction on the very wall that keeps our country safe.   President Biden wants $63.5 billion for international affairs  spending, a 12 percent increase from 2022 that lacks specific defense  funding for Israel, America's only democratic ally in the Middle East.  His omission is clear and comes at a time when the terrorist  organization Hamas launched hundreds of rockets at Israel in the last  month alone and when Democrats are on the record for their anti-Semitic  language and slurs.   And President Biden refuses to protect our dollars from being spent  on abortions or abortion services. Instead, for the first time in four  decades, no such protection exists, a protection that 77 percent of  Americans support and a protection even Biden supported for years  before his Presidential campaign.   On top of all this, President Biden claims his budget is partly in  response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but like the American Rescue  Plan, it, too, fails to investigate the origins of COVID-19. Even more,  the Biden administration won't commit that none of the budget requests  would include funding for the research at the Wuhan lab.   The economic disaster to follow from his reckless spending will  cripple American families' purchasing power and leave future  generations with the crushing burden of the national debt. It is time  we hold President Biden accountable for a budget that would cause our  Federal debt to reach 117 percent of gross domestic product by 2031,  the highest level since World War II, and continue the record rates of  inflation we are already seeing under President Biden.   I ran for Congress with the intention of creating a better world for  my children, our children, one where they don't have to pay President  Biden's debts and suffer the consequences of irresponsible and  egregious spending. America deserves better.                            ____________________
