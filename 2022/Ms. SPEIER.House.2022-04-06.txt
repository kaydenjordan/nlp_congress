 Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to condemn Vladimir Putin for  what he is doing to the children of Ukraine.   Listen to these stories.   Ukrainian mothers are putting the contact details of their relatives  on the bodies of their children because they want to make sure that if  the children survive and they don't, there will be some place for their  children to go.   Emergency service workers are teaching children how to identify  Russian explosives made to look like toys.   Thousands of children have been abducted in Ukraine and taken to  Russia.   And Ukrainian children have witnessed the murder and torture of their  parents, including severed limbs, slashed throats, rapes, and burning  bodies.   I am proud to colead an appropriations request with Representatives  Schiff, Kaptur, and Quigley to ensure at least $100 million for Eastern  Europe's demining budget in FY23.                            ____________________
