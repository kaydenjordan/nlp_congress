 Mr. Speaker, I am  Greg Casar. I am a brand new Member of  Congress representing Texas, and I am standing over here on the  Republican side of the aisle; not because I am a Republican, I am a  Democrat. I want the American people to see that there aren't any  Republicans in the seats here behind me on the eve of our default.   Where are the Republicans?   This is not a simple political disagreement. This is a dire crisis  being imposed on the working people of America.   The American people could lose millions of jobs. You could lose your  house. Your kids could lose their jobs. People could lose their  savings. They aren't even here.   They want to burn the House down and blame the firefighters for the  flames. They are listening to Donald Trump who is saying: Do a default.  That is shameful. It is dangerous. There is no patriotism in this.  There is no morality in this.   We just need five Republicans to sign the discharge petition with us  to save the American people. We need the American people to speak up  about why the Republicans are not in these empty chairs.   The American people can save us. The Democrats are aligned and ready  to avoid a default and make sure that billionaires pay their fair share  and folks aren't kicked off their healthcare or deprived of food.                            ____________________
