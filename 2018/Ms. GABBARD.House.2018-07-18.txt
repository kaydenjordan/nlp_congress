 Mr. Speaker, Article I, section 8 of the Constitution  gives Congress the exclusive authority to declare war, but the last  time Congress officially declared war was December 8, 1941, the day the  U.S. entered World War II. Ever since, Congress has failed to uphold  their constitutional responsibility and has instead ceded power to the  President.   So we remain in a state of perpetual war, led by Presidents in both  parties, at great cost to the American people, with no declaration of  war by Congress and no input from the American people.   The direct and indirect costs of these Presidential wars are  astounding. They take a toll on our troops, our veterans, and on the  American people.   Since 9/11 alone, we have spent trillions of dollars on regime-change  wars and nation building, while people in our community suffer and  struggle because of a lack of resources here at home--not to mention  the cost borne by our troops, those who pay the ultimate price as well  as those who come home with wounds that are both visible and invisible.   The American people deserve accountability. Mr. Walter Jones and I  have introduced bipartisan H. Res. 922 to make sure that Congress  fulfills its constitutional role, ends Presidential wars, and has  robust debate before making a decision to send our troops into battle.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend the rule  to make in order the Quigley amendment to restore funds to help our  States secure their vulnerable election systems.    Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for introducing this  amendment of which I am a proud cosponsor.   This amendment provides additional funding for the Native American  CDFI Assistance Program, also known as NACA, which supports critical  economic development in Native communities like mine in Hawaii, those  in Alaska, and communities all across the country which already face  significant barriers to accessing financial mainstream services and  capital.   NACA accounts for a small portion of the CDFIs, but it provides  significant support to Native CDFIs, including Native Hawaii  organizations in my home State of Hawaii.   Of the $22.7 million in CDFI awards made to Hawaii since the fund was  launched, 41 percent of total dollars awarded came from this NACA  Program. It has funded organizations like the Council for Native  Hawaiian Advancement, which supports Native Hawaiian communities with  homeownership counseling and mortgage loans, small business access to  capital, and loans to farmers and ranchers.   While the NACA Program is unable to meet the demand by qualified  Native CDFIs at its current funding level, a cut to NACA in FY 2019  would be especially devastating to our Nation's impoverished and  underserved Native communities.   I urge my colleagues to join my colleague from Hawaii, Representative  Colleen Hanabusa, and me to support this noncontroversial, bipartisan  amendment to restore funding to NACA.   The amendment, when considered with Representative Palazzo's CDFI  amendment, would restore NACA to the current enacted level of $16  million so that Native CDFIs may continue growing small businesses,  creating jobs, and promoting vital economic opportunity and development  in Native communities.
