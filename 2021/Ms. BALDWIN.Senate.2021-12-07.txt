 Mr. President, December 7 marks the 80th anniversary of  the attack on Pearl Harbor, which thrust the United States of America  into World War II. I rise today to pay tribute to those who served and  sacrificed at Pearl Harbor and throughout World War II to defend our  liberty and freedom.   The attack on Pearl Harbor killed 2,403 servicemembers and civilians  and injured a further 1,178 people. Today, as we commemorate this  anniversary, I want to share the story of the Barber brothers of New  London, WI: Navy Fireman 1st Class Malcom J. Barber, 22; Navy Fireman  1st Class Leroy K. Barber, 21; and Navy Fireman 2nd Class Randolph H.  Barber, 19.   The three Barber brothers all enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1940, and  together joined the crew of the USS Oklahoma as firemen, which was  anchored at Ford Island, Pearl Harbor. When Pearl Harbor was attacked,  the USS Oklahoma sustained multiple direct hits and capsized. Malcom,  Leroy, and Randolph all died, as did 426 other crewmembers who were on  board. Eventually, their remains were recovered, but could not be  identified and were buried as unknown remains at the National Memorial  Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, HI.   Six years ago, the remains of 388 individuals were exhumed from the  cemetery as part of a program launched by the Defense POW/MIA  Accounting Agency--DPAA--which eventually was able to identify 355  individuals and allow their remains to be returned home. This past  June, nearly 80 years after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the remains of  the brothers were finally identified and returned home to New London.  On September 11, 2021, the Barber brothers were buried with full  military honors in their hometown of New London.   I am pleased that the brothers are finally home, and I am grateful  for the work of those at the DPAA who worked to ensure that as many  families as possible could receive closure and bring their family  members home to rest. As we commemorate this solemn anniversary, I  reflect on the service and sacrifice of 320,000 Wisconsinites who  served in World War II and honor their contributions in defense of our  Nation today and always.                            ____________________
