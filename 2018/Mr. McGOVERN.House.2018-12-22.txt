 Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object--and I will  not object--I had hoped to have been recognized earlier to offer a  unanimous consent request to call up H.R. 7397, Democratic whip Steny  Hoyer's bill to end the Trump government shutdown and fund the  government through February 8. I was told that I would be blocked from  doing that.   For the life of me, I don't understand why President Trump and  congressional Republicans have shut the government down three days  before Christmas. I think it is embarrassing and it is wrong. 800,000  Federal employees will not get paid during this holiday season because  of the shutdown.   The Senate passed a continuing resolution unanimously. We were set to  do the same thing in the House, until the President had a temper  tantrum.   It is frustrating that Republicans won't allow us to proceed to end  this shutdown. I would hope that maybe the Speaker would be open to a  unanimous consent request so I could bring this legislation up so we  can fund the government and end the shutdown.    Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
