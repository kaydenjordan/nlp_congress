 Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to  recognize the extraordinary work of Vermont's Meals on Wheels Programs.   Each March, we celebrate March for Meals to draw attention to the  incredible work of Meals on Wheel throughout the country, including in  my home State of Vermont. All across our State, hundreds of volunteers  regularly deliver freshly cooked, nutritious meals to thousands of  older people in their homes, many of whom otherwise might not have  enough to eat. These volunteers play a critically important role in  helping ensure that older Vermonters have access to adequate nutrition.  In and of itself, that is no small matter.   In a typical year, Meals on Wheels volunteers do so much more than  delivering meals. These volunteers provide critical social interaction  for the people they visit, which goes a long way to combat the effects  of isolation that many Vermonters face, especially in rural areas.  Without this social interaction, seniors are more likely to have  feelings of loneliness and depression, which puts them at higher risk  for dementia, chronic disease, falls, and hospitalization. Their  regular visits serve another purpose as well. The volunteers know each  person they visit and recognize immediately if something does not seem  right. It is no exaggeration to say that volunteers have literally  saved Vermonters' lives by following up when no one answers the door,  taking the time to discover that someone had fallen and been injured.   During the COVID-19 pandemic, volunteers--both new and existing-- stepped up to deliver over 1 million meals to over 7,500 Vermonters.  This represents a 30-percent increase in the number of meals and almost  a 20-percent increase in the number of people receiving meals through  this vital Federal program. At a time when so many Vermonters struggled  with the dual hardship of loneliness and hunger cause by the COVID-19  pandemic, Meals on Wheels served as a critical lifeline.   In addition to the many Meals on Wheels volunteers throughout  Vermont, I also want to recognize and thank the caring and dedicated  professionals who run Vermont's Meals on Wheel Programs. From the chefs  who prepare the nutritious meals with skill and care, to the program  staff who ensure that everything runs smoothly, these Vermonters are  the backbone of what makes Meals on Wheels the success that it is. In  March, when so much of our State shut down due to the pandemic, these  dedicated people immediately pivoted to expand Meals on Wheels and  ensure that any older Vermonter who wanted a meal could get one. This  was particularly important for all those who had previously relied on  congregate meal programs, which were unsafe during the pandemic.   Together, every single Meals on Wheels volunteer and staff person  forms an indispensable link in our social safety net and has my sincere  appreciation for their remarkable work. As more and more Vermonters are  now vaccinated and the State begins a careful reopening, following the  science and ensuring the safety of all our people, I look forward to a  day when I and  [[Page S1812]]  my Vermont staff can once again visit the Meals on Wheels Program and  meet the volunteers and recipients in person.                            ____________________
