 Madam Speaker, I have heard numerous colleagues  say they didn't run for Congress to impeach the President. Well, maybe  not originally, but, unfortunately, from the moment proceedings began,  after the fourth vote to launch an impeachment inquiry, today's vote  was inevitable. Many of them campaigned on it.   I love this country with a soldier's passion. I came here to defend  freedom, not to deny due process to anyone. I came here to solve  problems and change the broken status quo, not to distract or disrupt  those, like President Donald Trump, who deliver on promises to put  America back on the path of peace and prosperity that has made and kept  our country free.   For months now, Americans have heard speculation about the  President's motives in Ukraine. Despite months of effort, dozens of  hearings, and countless documents, Americans have not seen proof that  the President committed a high crime or a misdemeanor.   We have a republic, if we can keep it. This is a disgraceful and  dishonest process. It is a discredit to this body and to our Nation.   Madam Speaker, I urge the House to drop these divisive Articles of  Impeachment and get to work for the American people.
