 Mr. Speaker, for far too long, the pharmaceutical industry  has dictated who in America has access to the medicines they need for  their health and well-being and who doesn't, leaving millions of  Americans in districts like mine to make impossible choices about their  healthcare.   Already this year, drug companies have hiked the prices of 1,100  prescription drugs, more than 90 percent of which were above the rate  of inflation. The largest single price hike for a prescription drug  this month was nearly 16 percent, while inflation has risen slightly  more than 2 percent.   Big Pharma's bottom line should never be more important than the  health of my constituents in the Seventh District of Pennsylvania or  the American people at large.   That is why I recently organized a letter signed by 14 of my  colleagues, asking our leaders to allow Medicare to negotiate lower  drug prices and include that language in the budget reconciliation bill  currently being negotiated.   Here is the truth: Giving Medicare the power to negotiate would lower  the cost of prescription drugs for hardworking families so that  everyone has access to the medicines they need. It would also result in  nearly half a trillion dollars in savings for taxpayers, money that we  can invest in making healthcare more affordable for even more people.                            ____________________
