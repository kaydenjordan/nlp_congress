 Mr. Chairman, I stand here to  talk a little bit about the Republican budget first. It is a poor  reflection of the values and priorities that we hold dear in America.   Once again, Americans insist on dooming the American people to the  failed trickle-down economics of the Reagan era. The Republican budget  shifts the tax burden away from the wealthiest Americans and larger  corporations and places it squarely on the backs of hardworking middle-  and low-income Americans. This has never helped, and it won't help now.    Not only would the Republican budget increase the national deficit by  $2.4 trillion over 10 years, but it also foots the bill over to the  most vulnerable segments of our community while cutting other important  social safety network programs.   For example, the budget proposes to slash Medicaid by $1.1 trillion  and Medicare for seniors by $487 billion. Nondefense discretionary  spending across the government would also be cut by $1.3 trillion at  the expense of education, infrastructure, clean energy programs,  medical research, and job training.   These are only some of the reasons why I stand tonight with my  colleagues to support the Congressional Black Caucus budget to propose  an alternative to this budget we are facing.   The CBC's alternative budget asks those who have done well in our  country to finally pay their fair share.   Our budget seeks to invest $665 billion to modernize our crumbling  infrastructure.    Mr. Chairman, our budget looks to  invest $80 billion in our children by modernizing our schools and  better preparing our future generations to compete in a global economy.

These are only some of the reasons why I stand with my colleagues of  the Congressional Black Caucus to propose an alternative budget  amendment that serves the interests of the greater good, and not just a  select few.   The CBC's alternative budget asks those who have done well in our  country to finally pay their fair share.   Our budget seeks to invest $665 billion to modernize our crumbling  infrastructure.   Our budget looks to invest $80 billion in our children by modernizing  our schools and better preparing our future generations to compete in a  global economy.   Our budget looks to bring $20 billion in new investment to extend  broadband internet to rural areas, so that everyone--not just the  wealthy few--can have access to high-speed internet and access to  information.   Our budget delivers $300 billion over the next decade for social  programs that help provide millions of Americans a basic standard of  living.   This is a reflection of the values and priorities of the American  people, not what is embodied in the Republican budget.   I, for one, do not believe that our nation does well by cutting taxes  for the wealthiest Americans while increasing taxes for the poor.   I do not believe that our nation does well by making massive cuts to  social programs while allowing corporations to hide trillions of  dollars overseas.   I do not believe that our nation does well by destroying Medicare and  Medicaid for our elderly and poor while pushing tax cuts for the top  one percent.   This is not the future that I envision for our country and neither do  the American people--at least not 99 percent of them.   Mr. Chair, the Republican Budget is not a true; reflection of the  priorities of the American people.   This budget serves the interest of a select few at the heavy cost of  exploiting millions of others.   We need to oppose the Republican budget in favor of a viable  alternative such as the CBC Budget Alternative, which is more  reflective of the values that we treasure in our society.                                time  1915
