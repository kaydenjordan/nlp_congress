 Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory  limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to  those limits. In addition, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to  establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels  consistent with those adjustments.   The Senate will soon consider S. Amdt. 901 to H.R. 3401, the  Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Humanitarian Assistance and  Security at the Southern Border Act, 2019. This measure provides  supplemental appropriations to address humanitarian assistance and  security at the border. The measure contains spending that qualifies  for cap adjustments under current statute.   This measure includes $4,586 million in budget authority that is  designated as being for emergency purposes pursuant to section  251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA. Of that amount, $145 million is for spending  in the security category and $4,441 million is for nonsecurity  spending. CBO estimates that this budget authority will result in  $1,048 million in outlays in Fiscal Year 2019.   As a result of the aforementioned designations, I am revising the  budget authority and outlay allocations to the Committee on  Appropriations by increasing revised security budget authority by $145  million, revised nonsecurity budget authority by $4,441 million, and  outlays by $1,048 million  [[Page S4558]]  in Fiscal Year 2019. Further, I am increasing the budgetary aggregate  for Fiscal Year 2019 by $4,586 million in budget authority and $1,048  million in outlays.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      REVISION TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES  (Pursuant to Sections 311 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                  $ in Millions                             2019 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority...........................                3,658,445     Outlays....................................                3,555,373 Adjustments:     Budget Authority...........................                    4,586     Outlays....................................                    1,048 Revised Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority...........................                3,663,031     Outlays....................................                3,556,421 ------------------------------------------------------------------------    REVISION TO SPENDING ALLOCATION TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR                             FISCAL YEAR 2019  (Pursuant to Sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                                   1974) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                  $ in Millions                             2019 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Allocation:     Revised Security Discretionary Budget                        718,693      Authority.................................

The report compares current-law  levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to  in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 BBAl8. This information is  necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine whether  budgetary points of order lie against pending legislation. The  Republican staff of the Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget  Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of the  Congressional Budget Act, CBA.   This is my fifth scorekeeping report this year. My last filing can be  found in the Congressional Record for May 22, 2019. The information  included in this report is current through June 24, 2019.   Since my last filing, Congress has cleared three pieces of  legislation with significant budgetary effects. The first, the  Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, 2019,  P.L. 116-20, provided $19.1 billion in emergency discretionary  appropriations to address recent natural disasters. The second, the  Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019, H.R. 299, increased  compensation for certain veterans and modified veteran home loan  programs. The final bill, the Taxpayer First Act, H.R. 3151, modified  several rules that govern the organization of and operations at the  Internal Revenue Service.   Budget Committee Republican staff prepared Tables A-C.   Table A gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee  exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays  under the Fiscal Year 2019 enforceable levels filing required by BBA18.  This information is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant  to section 302 of the CBA. For this reporting period, 9 of the 16  authorizing committees are not in compliance with their allocations.  Over the current 10-year enforceable window, authorizing committees  have increased outlays by a combined $3.6 billion. Of the bills  clearing Congress this reporting period, H.R. 299 added to the  Veterans' Affairs Committee's existing violations, including an  increase in spending of $394 million over the 10-year window, while  H.R. 3151 reduced spending scoreable to the Finance Committee by $201  million over the same time period.   Table B provides the amount by which the Senate Committee on  Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This  information is used to determine points of order related to the  spending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the CBA. Appropriations  for Fiscal Year 2019, displayed in this table, show that the  Appropriations Committee is compliant with spending limits for the  current fiscal year. Those limits for regular discretionary spending  are $647 billion for accounts in the defense category and $597 billion  for accounts in the nondefense category of spending.   The Fiscal Year 2018 budget resolution contained points of order  limiting the use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations  bills, CHIMP. Table C, which tracks the CHIMP limit of $15 billion for  Fiscal Year 2019, shows the Appropriations Committee has enacted $15  billion worth of full-year CHIMPs for this Fiscal Year.   In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican  staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget  totals approved by Congress.   For Fiscal Year 2019, CBO estimates that current-law levels are $2.9  billion above and $3.3 billion below enforceable levels for budget  authority and outlays, respectively. Revenues are $426 million below  the level assumed in the budget resolution. These figures remain  unchanged since the May Scorekeeping Report, as the appropriation  provided in P.L. 116-20 was accompanied by a concurrent and equivalent  increase in aggregate spending levels pursuant to section 314 of the  CBA. This adjustment can be found in the Congressional Record for May  23, 2019. Further, Social Security revenues are at the levels assumed  for Fiscal  [[Page S4559]]  Year 2019, while Social Security outlays are $4 million above assumed  levels for the budget year.   CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate  pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The PAYGO scorecard shows deficit increases  in Fiscal Year 2019 of $1,957 million, $427 million revenue loss,  $1,530 million outlay increase; over the Fiscal Year 2018-2023 period  of $3,412 million, $907 million revenue loss, $2,505 million outlay  increase; and over the Fiscal Year 2018-2028 period of $800 million,  $798 million revenue loss, $2 million outlay increase. During this  reporting period, H.R. 3151 had the effect of reducing deficits by $37  million over both the Fiscal Year 2018-2023 and Fiscal Year 2018-2028  periods, while H.R. 299 increased deficits by $76 million and $394  million over the same periods, respectively.   This submission also includes a table tracking the Senate's budget  enforcement activity on the floor since the enforcement filing on May  7, 2018. Since my last report, no new budgetary points of order were  raised. On May 23, 2019, however, a Senator made a preemptive motion to  waive all applicable points of order against the supplemental  appropriations bill that would become P.L. 116-20.   All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:     TABLE A.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE (+) OR BELOW (-) BUDGET RESOLUTIONS                                             [In millions of dollars] ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                      2019          2019-2023        2019-2028 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry     Budget Authority.........................................            2,414            4,249            3,123     Outlays..................................................            1,401            1,797               70 Armed Services     Budget Authority.........................................                0                0                0     Outlays..................................................                0                0                0 Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs     Budget Authority.........................................               21              285              382     Outlays..................................................               20              285              382 Commerce, Science, and Transportation     Budget Authority.........................................               41               77               91     Outlays..................................................               11               74               90 Energy and Natural Resources     Budget Authority.........................................                0              -10              -24     Outlays..................................................                0              -10              -24 Environment and Public Works     Budget Authority.........................................                2                4             -333     Outlays..................................................                2                4             -333 Finance     Budget Authority.........................................              378            1,078           -1,090     Outlays..................................................              159            1,070           -1,093 Foreign Relations     Budget Authority.........................................                0               -5              -20     Outlays..................................................                0               -5              -20 Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs     Budget Authority.........................................                0                2                4     Outlays..................................................               43               48               49 Judiciary     Budget Authority.........................................               13              209              497     Outlays..................................................               13              205              492 Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions     Budget Authority.........................................                0              -36              -84     Outlays..................................................                0              -36              -84 Rules and Administration     Budget Authority.........................................                0                0                1     Outlays..................................................                0                0                1 Intelligence     Budget Authority.........................................                0                0                0     Outlays..................................................                0                0                0 Veterans' Affairs     Budget Authority.........................................                4               79             -335     Outlays..................................................            4,402            4,476            4,062 Indian Affairs     Budget Authority.........................................                0                0                0     Outlays..................................................                0                0                0 Small Business     Budget Authority.........................................                0                0                0     Outlays..................................................                0                0                0                                                               --------------------------------------------------     Total....................................................

Hon. Mike Enzi,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of       Congressional action on the fiscal year 2019 budget and is       current through June 24, 2019. This report is submitted under       section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional       Budget Act, as amended.        The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues       are consistent with the allocations, aggregates, and other       budgetary levels printed in the Congressional Record on May       7, 2018, pursuant to section 30103 of the Bipartisan Budget       Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-123).        Since our last letter dated May 22, 2019, the Congress has       cleared and the President has signed the Additional       Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, 2019       (Public Law 116-20). That act has significant effects on       budget authority and outlays in fiscal year 2019.            Sincerely,                                                     Mark P.

Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include   $771 million in budget authority and $767 million in estimated outlays. c For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as   approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a   result, current level does not include those items.  [[Page S4561]]    d The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-5), as amended, extended several immigration programs   through February 15, 2019, that would otherwise have expired at the end of fiscal year 2018. The estimated   budgetary effects of those previously enacted extensions are charged to the Committee on Appropriations, and   are included in the budgetary effects of P.L. 116-6 shown in the ``Appropriation Legislation'' portion of this   report. In addition, division H of P.L. 116-6 further extended those same programs through the end of fiscal   year 2019. Consistent with the language in title III of division H of P.L. 116-6, and at the direction of the   Senate Committee on the Budget, the budgetary effects of extending those immigration programs for the   remainder of the fiscal year are charged to the relevant authorizing committees, and are shown in the   ``Authorizing Legislation'' portion of this report. e Section 30103 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 requires the Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget to   publish the aggregate spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2019; those aggregate levels were first   published in the Congressional Record on May 7, 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also allows the Chair   of the Senate Committee on the Budget to revise the budgetary aggregates:   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                     Budget                                                                   Authority         Outlays          Revenues Original Aggregates Printed on May 7, 2018:..................        3,547,094        3,508,052        2,590,496 Revisions:     Pursuant to sections 311 and 314(a) of the Congressional               921                0                0      Budget Act of 1974......................................
