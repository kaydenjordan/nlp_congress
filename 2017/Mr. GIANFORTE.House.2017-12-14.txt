 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill (H.R. 2815) to designate the facility of the United States  Postal Service located at 30 East Somerset Street in Raritan, New  Jersey, as the ``Sergeant John Basilone Post Office'', as proposed to  be passed under suspension of the rules, be modified by the amendment I  have placed at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, America lost a hero this week, and I lost  a friend.   Tim Frable trained at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana and flew  missions in a P-51 over Japan during World War II. During one mission,  he had to ditch into the Pacific. He and a wing mate floated for days  before being rescued.   Tim was my science teacher in junior high school. He told his ocean  rescue story in 5-minute installments at the end of class each day.  Because of his storytelling, no one missed class.   Tim loved Montana. In 1976, he brought me and 17 other classmates  from Pennsylvania to Red Lodge to  [[Page H9926]]  hike into the back country. We hiked to Black Canyon Lake, Grasshopper  Glacier, Froze-to-Death Plateau, and onto the Absaroka Lake Plateau.   Tim had a tremendous impact on many lives in his 93 years, including  my own. I will always be grateful for his service to our country and  for his dedication as a teacher. I will miss my friend Tim Frable.                            ____________________
