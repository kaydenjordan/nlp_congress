 Madam Speaker, we have never, ever, in the history of this  country, seen a Presidency like this one.   Once the President was sworn in, 19 minutes later, The Washington  Post said impeachment begins today. A million women marched the next  day in Washington. Bank of America and Starbucks, both who supported  Hillary Clinton, had their windows broken out here in Washington  because people were so upset that this man was elected President of the  United States.   He has had his head held under water for almost 3 years now, never  coming up for a breath of air, just keep pushing him down.   Lowest Black unemployment ever, lowest Hispanic unemployment ever,  highest stock market ever, and the very lowest unemployment in years.
