 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a great community  leader and a good friend, Manny Ontiveros.   As an Anaheim native and friend, Manny has devoted over 30 years of  his life to serving the community, first as a trustee of the North  Orange County Community College District and then as a Federal  probation officer for almost 30 years. He was also a member of the  Anaheim Parks and Recreation Commission and the Anaheim Independencia  board of directors.   Today, Manny is looking to retire from his Federal job as a Federal  probation officer. I congratulate him and his family. Job great done.  Career great done.   Madam Speaker, I am honored that he calls me his friend, and  everybody in the community is honored to have Manny Ontiveros serving  us well.                            ____________________
