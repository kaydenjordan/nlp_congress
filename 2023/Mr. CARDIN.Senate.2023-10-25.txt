 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                Defense Security                                             Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

(viii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: October 24, 2023.        * As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export Control       Act.                             policy justification             Latvia-M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems         The Government of the Republic of Latvia has requested to       buy six (6) M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems       (HIMARS); twelve (12) M30A2 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket       System (GMLRS) Alternative Warhead (AW) Pods with Insensitive       Munitions Propulsion System (IMPS); twelve (12) M31A2 GMLRS       Unitary (GMLRS-U) High Explosive Pods with IMPS; and ten (10)       M57 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) Pods. Also included       are Reduced Range Practice Rocket (RRPR) Pods; intercom       systems to support the HIMARS Launcher; ruggedized laptops;       training; training equipment; publications for HIMARS,       munitions, and spares; services; other support equipment; and       other related elements of program and logistic support. The       estimated total program cost is $220 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals       and national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a NATO Ally that is an important       force for political stability and economic progress in       Europe.        The proposed sale will improve Latvia's capability to meet       current and future threats, and will enhance its       interoperability with U.S. and other allied forces. Latvia       will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its       armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin, Grand       Prairie, TX. There are no known offset agreements in       connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require the       assignment of two (2) U.S. Government and five (5) contractor       representatives to Latvia for a period of one year.       Additional U.S. Government or contractor representative       travel to Latvia will be required for program management       reviews. This travel is expected to occur approximately twice       a year or as needed to support equipment fielding and       training.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            transmittal no. 23-70       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)       is a C-130 transportable wheeled launcher mounted on a 5-ton       Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles truck chassis. HIMARS is       the modern Army-fielded version of the Multiple Launch Rocket       System (MLRS) M270 launcher and can fire all of the MLRS       Family of Munitions (FOM), including Guided Multiple Launch       Rocket System (GMLRS) variants and the Army Tactical Missile       System (ATACMS). Utilizing the MLRS FOM, the HIMARS can       engage targets between 15 and 300 kilometers with GPS-aided       precision accuracy.        2. The Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) M31A2       Unitary is the Army's primary munition for units fielding the       M142 HIMARS and M270A1 Multiple Launcher Rocket System (MLRS)       Launchers. The M31 Unitary is a solid propellant artillery       rocket that uses Global Positioning System/Precise       Positioning Service (GPS/PPS)-aided inertial guidance enabled       by SAASM or M-Code to deliver a single high-explosive blast       fragmentation warhead accurately and quickly to targets at       ranges from 15-70 kilometers. The rockets are fired from a       launch pod container that also serves as the storage and       transportation container for the rockets. Each rocket pod       holds six (6) total rockets.        3. The M30A2 GMLRS Alternative Warhead shares a greater       than 90% commonality with the M31A1 Unitary. The primary       difference between the GMLRS-U and GMLRS-AW is the       replacement of the Unitary's high explosive warhead with a       200-pound fragmentation warhead of pre-formed tungsten       penetrators which is optimized for effectiveness against       large-area and imprecisely located targets. The munitions       otherwise share a common motor, OPS/PPS-aided inertial       guidance enabled by SAASM or M-Code, control system, fusing       mechanism, multi-option height of burst capability, and       effective range of 15-70km.        4. The M57 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS)--Unitary       is a conventional, semi-ballistic missile that utilizes a       500-pound high explosive warhead. It has an effective range       of between 70 and 300 kilometers, and has increased lethality       and accuracy over previous versions of the ATACMS due to a       GPS/Precise Position System (PPS) aided navigation system.        5. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        6. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        7. A determination has been made that Latvia can provide       the same degree of protection for the sensitive technology       being released as the U.S. Government. This sale is necessary       in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and national       security objectives outlined in the Policy Justification.        8. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to Latvia.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
