 Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, this week is Public Service Recognition  Week--a week we have set aside each year since 1985 to recognize and  honor public servants. I would like to take this opportunity to express  my deep, heartfelt gratitude to America's 20 million Federal, State,  county, and local public servants. From astronauts to astrophysicists,  caseworkers to court clerks, detectives to doctors, soldiers to  superintendents, teachers to transit workers, America's public servants  comprise one of our Nation's most critical and often maligned assets.   Men and women serve in harm's way to defend our Nation. Other public  servants support them. Public servants teach our children, deliver the  mail, administer our elections, keep our streets and communities safe  and clean, guide air traffic, protect our natural resources and food  and drug supplies, respond to natural disasters and other emergencies,  conduct pioneering basic research, provide healthcare, interpret and  enforce our laws, ensure that seniors and veterans receive the benefits  they have earned, and represent our Nation's interests in foreign  posts. I could go on and on. The work that public servants perform  affects each and every one of us on a daily basis, making our lives so  much better.    The public sector workforce--particularly at the Federal level--tends  to be older, better educated, and more experienced than the private  sector workforce. So many public servants could earn higher salaries in  private sector jobs, but their motivation is more than pecuniary gain;  it is a sense of duty and a love of their community and country that  compel them.   President Biden issued a proclamation this week that says:         At a time when public servants are facing threats and       hostility simply for doing their jobs, their continued       willingness to serve is even more meaningful and important.       We have an obligation to support them and to recognize and       value their commitment and sacrifice. Our Nation's future       depends on ensuring our public servants have good jobs with       competitive pay and benefits, along with the resources they       need to accomplish their work. It also depends on the next       generation of smart, dedicated people answering the call of       public service and joining their ranks, helping deliver the       promise of America to more of our citizens.    I couldn't agree with the President more.   Just 7 percent of America's Federal workers are under the age of 30.  I join President Biden in urging young Americans to consider careers in  public service. We need your talents, your energy, your ideas, and your  idealism to ensure that America remains prosperous, secure, and a  beacon of liberty for all humanity.   Each year, in conjunction with Public Service Recognition Week, the  nonprofit Partnership for Public Service announces the finalists for  the prestigious Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medals. The awards  are named after the partnership's founder and benefactor and highlight  excellence in our Federal workforce.   I am proud that Maryland is home to 12 finalists.   They are, in the field of science, technology, and environment, Dr.  Adam Phillippy, Dr. Sergey Koren, and Dr. Arang Rhie, Investigator,  Associate Investigator, and Staff Scientist respectively at the  National Institutes of Health, National Human Genome Research  Institute, and the Telomere to Telomere Consortium, which Dr. Phillippy  cofounded in 2018, having cracked the last 8 percent of humans' genetic  code.   Their research into understanding the most difficult parts of our DNA  has  [[Page S1618]]  enabled scientists to discover more than 2 new million variants in our  genetic makeup, many of which can cause serious health problems. We  will make leaps and bounds in understanding Down syndrome, autism, and  cancer, and devising effective gene therapies for a host of diseases.   Dr. Phillippy put it this way:         It is really easy to get up and go to work in the morning       because our work is making such a difference.    What a dedicated public servant.   In management excellence, Megan Meacham, Allison Hutchings, and Sarah  O'Donnell, Director, Deputy Director, and Team Lead respectively at the  Department of Health and Human Services' Rural Strategic Initiatives  Division under the Health Resources and Services Administration,  created the Rural Communities Opioid Response Program to provide grant  funding for a wide array of innovative and effective opioid use  prevention, treatment, and recovery services.   The program, which they established 5 years ago, has served more than  2 million people each year in more than 1,800 rural counties across 47  States and 2 territories. As Megan Meacham has stated, ``We are here to  help and passionate to serve. Even when we hit a roadblock, we find a  way around it.''   We know the challenges of opioid addiction. Our public servants are  answering the challenge.   In management excellence, Gloria Morgan Shepherd, Executive Director,  Federal Highway Administration, Department of Transportation, is one of  three DOT senior managers being honored for helping to craft and  implement the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.   We were proud to pass that bill. It wasn't so easy to implement it.  Dedicated public servants at the Department of Transportation are  making sure our legislation carries out its intended purpose. Thanks to  their work, DOT initiated 1,887 transportation projects last year that  were awarded nearly $10 billion in discretionary funds on top of $82.3  billion in formula funding that will help modernize the Nation's  highways, bridges, shipping ports, railroads, and airports.   Gloria Morgan Shepherd and her colleagues implemented 76 new or  expanded grant programs and initiated bridge repair programs, a  national electric vehicle charging network, and a host of safety  initiatives. That is what we intended. Our public servants at DOT are  carrying that out.   In management excellence, Rear Admiral Nancy Hann, Director of the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Commissioned Corps  and Director of NOAA's Office of Marine and Aviation Operations, has  implemented policies to curb sexual harassment, assault, and bullying  among employees aboard NOAA's marine fleet and aircraft, creating a  safer workplace and changing the organization's culture.   Admiral Hann, who has been with NOAA for 26 years, said:         It is really important for everyone to have a voice and to       feel comfortable physically, emotionally, and mentally in the       workplace. I have the responsibility to be the voice of the       people who don't feel like they have a voice or are too       scared. I take that responsibility very seriously.    We are all better off because of Admiral Hann's work.   The Paul A. Volcker Career Achievement Award: Dr. Eric J. ``Rocky''  Feuer, Chief, Statistical Research and Applications Branch,  Surveillance Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and  Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of  Health, has developed new methods to estimate the chances of  individuals being diagnosed with cancer at different times during their  lives.   Over the past four decades, he has designed a sophisticated system  using statistical analysis to understand national cancer trends better,  leading to significant prevention, screening, and treatment options  that have benefited millions of Americans.   In 2000, he created the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling  Network, allowing statisticians and scientists to address critical  cancer-related questions collaboratively. He has stated that the  statistical analysis he has engaged in over the course of his career is  ``backbencher type of work,'' but added it has helped ``move people to  action'' and improve healthcare.    Yes, we are dealing with cancer challenges in our communities, and  people like Dr. Feuer are making a huge difference.   Safety, security, and international affairs: Lisa Hsiao, Assistant  Director, Consumer Protection Branch, Department of Justice, has  protected the public from harmful or misleading trade practices by  businesses across a wide range of industries, including Altria, R.J.  Reynolds, Facebook, and Dish Network, securing some of the largest  fines in U.S. history and requiring the disclosure of important safety  and privacy information.   As Dr. Lisa Hsiao has said, ``I'm proud that through these cases we  have created law that can be built upon. As a lawyer, it's pretty rare  to be able to make precedent that both protects the public and effects  good public policy.''   Protecting consumers, protecting the public, that is what public  servants do.   Management excellence: Robert Gorman, Senior Trial Attorney,  Department of Transportation, is one of three DOT officials in the  Office of Aviation Consumer Protection who has led an aggressive  campaign to require airlines to compensate air travelers for airfare  and other related costs for canceled or significantly delayed flights  due to circumstances within the airlines' control. The campaign has  produced a record $8.4 million in fines and more than $1 billion in  passenger refunds.   Robert Gorman and his colleagues looked for patterns to determine if  an airline were repeatedly being unresponsive or noncompliant with  respect to consumer complaints, leading the Aviation Consumer  Protection Office to issue two regulatory notices, launch  investigations, bring enforcement actions, and in some instances, reach  settlements for travelers to be reimbursed.   Thanks to Robert Gorman and his colleagues, the skies are finally  friendlier for fliers.   Science, Technology, and the Environment: Dr. Sarah Nelson, Director  of Defense Programs Office of Experimental Sciences, National Nuclear  Security Administration, Department of Energy, played a leading role in  overseeing scientists who, for the first time in history, produced a  fusion reaction that produced more energy than it required, a  breakthrough with enormous implications for abundant clean energy and  national defense. When harnessed and expanded to utility scale, fusion  energy will produce reliable electricity without releasing greenhouse  gases or producing radioactive waste.   Dr. Nelson started as an intern at the NNSA's Lawrence Livermore  research laboratory.   She said:         It was a tremendously influential experience for me, but I       had no idea that I'd be sitting in this chair 20 years later       when such a scientific breakthrough would be accomplished. If       we are able to use this technology someday to enable clean       energy, [it would be a game-changer].    She is right on that.   So we can debate the proper role and size of our government, but I  hope we can all agree that we want the best and brightest to serve.  These individuals and their fellow honorees represent the best our  Federal workforce has to offer. But we should be grateful for all  public servants who go to work each day determined to make a positive  difference for their fellow Americans, and we should be grateful all  year long.
