 Madam Chair, I thank Chairman Grijalva and  everybody who has worked to bring this bill to the floor today.   A historic drought has forced ranchers in our parched Eastern Plains  to sell their cattle early.   We don't collect and share data about our precious water resources  with the ranchers, Tribes, and farmers who need it most.   Four brave firefighters lost their lives battling wildfires across my  beautiful State. Five more people died in the fires and the floods from  the burn scars. Today, I honor each of those nine souls and their  grieving friends and family.   The Wildfire Response and Drought Resiliency Act is like a gentle  monsoon rain falling on our thirsty landscape. It brings real solutions  to these problems.   It includes my Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon fire bill to compensate those  who lost their ancestral homes, businesses, and ranches when the Forest  Service started not one but two fires that became an inferno of  destruction. These fires scorched 534 square miles of land in Mora, San  Miguel, and Taos Counties.   When I visited the burn scar, Brandon Bustos, a third grader  evacuated from his beloved village, said: ``Mora will be back. I  guarantee it.'' He has not given up on his future. Neither have I, and  neither have any of us who will vote for this bill because this bill  will help Mora rebuild.   It will pay firefighters a minimum wage that is necessary because  they risk their lives for us. It will invest in burn centers of  excellence and the science, technology, and data sharing we need to  build resiliency and make every precious drop of water count because  agua es vida.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote for the bill today.
