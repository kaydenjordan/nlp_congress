 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for hosting this  tonight for us to talk about the importance of these dogs. They are  more than dogs; they are buddies to our men and women in uniform who  have been fighting for America.   Mr. Speaker, in the year 2000, I had the honor and the pleasure of  meeting John Burnam, retired United States Army combat infantryman and  dog handler during the Vietnam war. He approached me with the idea of a  War Dog Memorial to honor our great K-9 veterans.   John shared with me the impact that these animals had on him and his  fellow handlers in the sixties. They are forever emotionally grateful  for their K-9 buddies.   Through this relationship, as we began to work on a War Dog Memorial  in 2007, which took several years, a marine named Dustin Lee was killed  in the Iraq war. John had written a story. He wanted me to read the  story and then speak out and reach out to General Regner, United States  Marine Corps, and ask him to please retire this wonderful animal named  Lex, a German shepherd, who had also been wounded with his master, and  ask General Regner to reach out to the Air Force to retire Lex.   I want to read briefly the story that John had written and given to  me. I will read five paragraphs from the article, ``My Partner  Dustin.''   ``I'm a U.S. Marine and the primary element of a two-member team  trained to hunt and locate explosives. My partner and I trained as a  team for many months honing our expertise to save American lives in the  war on terrorism in Iraq.   ``It's March 21, 2007, and I'm on the job in Fallujah, Iraq, when an  enemy-fired rocket propelled grenade explodes in our midst. I'm blasted  to the ground and stunned. My head is ringing and my body feels numb.  My eyes can't quite focus on anything.   ``My partner is lying next to me severely wounded and bleeding. I  move to him and touch him, but he's not responding. I feel sharp pains  in my side and back. I'm bleeding but deal with it and concentrate on  comforting my partner and protecting him from further harm.   ``Everything's happening so fast that I'm disorientated and confused.  My senses pick up the lingering smell of burnt powder and smoke from  the explosion. I hear lots of American voices and heavy boot steps  hurrying all around us. They reach our location and immediately attend  to my partner, then carry him away. I'm separated from my partner for  the first time. I'm not clear of thought, and then I, too, am carried  way but to a different hospital.   ``I'm in a building lying on a table with lights above and people  talking. Still dazed and confused, I hear a strange voice saying my  name, `Lex.' I gesture a slight reflex of acknowledgment. `Lex, you are  going to be okay buddy. Just lay still. We are going to take care of  your wounds, so stay calm okay, Lex?' My eyes dart around the room  searching for my partner, but he's not there and no one can interpret  my thoughts.''   The partner died.   I was called by John Burnam to read this story. I sent this story to  General Mike Regner. I said: Mike, we need to retire this dog for the  family.   Mr. Speaker, the family lived in Mississippi. I didn't know them.   This story, which I include in the Record, touched my heart.                           ``My Partner Dustin''                   (By John C. Burnam, December 21, 2007)         I'm a U.S. Marine and the primary element of a two-member       team trained to hunt and locate explosives. My partner and I       trained as a team for many months honing our expertise to       save American lives in the War on Terrorism in Iraq.        It's March 21, 2007 and I'm on the job in Fallujah, Iraq       when an enemy fired Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) explodes       in our midst. I'm blasted to the ground and stunned. My head       is ringing and my body feels numb. My eyes can't quite focus       on anything.        My partner is lying next to me severely wounded and       bleeding. I move to him and touch him but he's not       responding. I feel sharp pains in my side and back. I'm       bleeding but deal with it and concentrate on comforting my       partner and protecting him from further harm.        Everything's happening so fast that I'm disorientated and       confused. My senses pick up the lingering smell of burnt       powder and smoke from the explosion. I hear lots of American       voices and heavy boot-steps hurrying all around us. They       reach our location and immediately attend to my partner, then       carry him away. I'm separated from my partner for the first       time. I'm not clear of thought and then I too am carried way       but to a different hospital.        I'm in a building lying on a table with lights above and       people talking. Still dazed and confused I hear a strange       voice say my name, ``Lex!'' I gesture a slight reflex of       acknowledgement. ``Lex! You are going to be okay buddy! Just       lay still. We are going to take care of your wounds, so stay       calm okay, Lex?'' My eyes dart around the room searching for       my partner, but he's not there and no one can interpret my       thoughts.        Later, I'm released from the hospital and well enough to       travel so they transfer me from Iraq to a U.S. Marine Corp       base in Albany, Georgia. I really miss my partner, Dusty. I       know something has happened to him because he would never       have left me alone for so long.        Yes, my name is Lex. I'm a seven year old German shepherd       Military Working Dog, service number E132. My master and       loyal partner is Corporal Dustin Jerome Lee, 20 year old U.S.       Marine Corps canine handler from Quitman, Mississippi. I'm       well disciplined to my master's commands and expertly trained       to sniff out bombs and explosives. Where's my master, Dusty,       my partner? No one can understand me but Dusty. Where's       Dusty?        Iraq was to be my last combat tour before retirement. Dusty       talked to me all the time about going home and adopting me. I       sure do miss him. He is the best friend I've ever had. I love       that crazy Marine from Mississippi!        No one can measure the love and unconditional loyalty I       have for Dusty. I'd sacrifice my own life for him and he       knows it. I just wish I could have stopped that RPG or pushed       Dusty away from that powerful blast. It all happened in a       blink of an eye and I didn't see it coming until it was too       late. Now I sit alone in my kennel-run waiting for the day       Dusty shows up.        The U.S. Marines are treating me very well. I get enough       food and water and exercise each day. And the veterinarian       comes by to examine my wounds on a regular basis. I just       can't sleep well at night. I wake up to every little noise       and I think about Dusty. Where can that Marine be?        The nights are long. The days turn into weeks. Still no       Dusty! My wounds are healing and my hair is growing back. The       pain is still in my back but I can walk okay. I have a piece       of shrapnel near my spine that the veterinarians avoid       removing for fear of worse complications. I have spent twelve       weeks in rehabilitation after my surgery and declared       physically unable to perform in a combat zone.        One of the dog handlers gave me a real good bath and       grooming. I felt so refreshed because I was on my way to meet       Dusty's family. Maybe Dusty will be there waiting for me.       When I arrived I sensed something was not quite right. Dusty       wasn't there and everyone was sad, but very happy to greet       me. I then realized that I was attending Dusty's funeral.       Everyone showed up to pay their respects.        Dusty is a real American hero and he was buried with full       military honors. I was so proud to have been his last best       friend and  [[Page H1534]]       partner. At one particular moment of total silence during the       ceremony, I sniffed a slight scent in the air that was very       familiar. It smelled like Dusty. I figured he sent me a       signal that he knew I was there! I wagged my tail and moaned       a sigh of grief that he would only hear and understand. I       just about lost my tail in that horrible explosion and the       veterinarian fixed it so it still wags okay.        I was greeted by the Lee family with joy in their hearts.       The picture is of Dustin's mom, Rachel, and me in church. It       felt so warm and comfortable to be with my partner's loving       family. I wanted to stay but I was escorted away after the       funeral and back to Albany, Georgia. What is going to happen       to me now?        Wait a minute! I was due for retirement, right? Why did the       military take me to see Dusty's family and not leave me       there? I belong with them in Mississippi not here in Georgia.        The Lee family adopting me would not be too much to ask       considering they will never again see their son, grandson,       brother, nephew and friend. Adopting me will keep a big part       of Dusty's life alive for them and for me. I will enable       Dusty's family to experience what he already knew about me. I       loved and protected him everywhere we went and even on the       battlefield in Iraq. It's time the U.S. Marine Corps allowed       Dustin's family to adopt me. I'm not a young pup anymore, you       know! I'm a senior of retirement age. I want to spend last       years of my life with the Lee family. It's where I now       belong!        It's been eight long months since we buried my partner,       Dustin, and all attempts by the Lee family to adopt me have       failed. The Marines have placed me back on duty training new       recruits. My back bothers me some but I'm an expert on the       job. It's the recruits that have a lot to learn about keeping       their eyes on me and understanding my body language. Dustin       and I bonded as a team and our minds were always in sync.        There has been a turn of events in my adoption. U.S.       Congressman Walter B. Jones of North Carolina heard my story       and immediately contacted the U.S. Marine Corps Commandant at       the Pentagon in Washington D.C. requesting my urgent release.        The Marines really showed off their compassion for the Lee       family and me too! They even dispatched a veterinarian to       give me a complete final medical examination. I feel a sense       of excitement I haven't felt in a very long time. I even have       a prance in my step!        That's a Christmas picture of me and Dusty in Iraq,       December 2006. That's me smiling with the Lee family and some       of Dusty's Marine pals at the funeral in Quitman,       Mississippi, April 2007.        The top Marine brass and the veterinarian signed the       official papers saying I'm A-OK to be adopted. I got an       honorable discharge from the U.S. Marine Corps on December       21, 2007, the anniversary day of Dustin's death. I will be       home with the Lee family for Christmas.        That's a picture of me greeting the Lee family at my       retirement ceremony at the U.S. Marine Corps base, Albany,       Georgia, December 21, 2007. The news media was everywhere! My       adoption even made the nightly news on national television.       I'm the first Marine Corps combat veteran working dog to ever       be retired to the family of a fallen Marine.        Dusty? I'm sure you had a lot to do with all this from       heaven. And I can hardly wait to visit your room and lie down       on your bed and sniff your boots and clothes. Living with       your family will be like having you around again, Dusty!            Always Faithful,      Lex (E132),        German Shepherd, Military Working Dog, U.S. Marine Corps       Veteran (Retired).     Mr. Speaker, I called him and I said: Mike, this family  has lost everything, their son. They want Lex to retire and live out  the rest of his life.   He had shrapnel in his back.   So, the Air Force agreed with General Regner and retired the dog.  That dog spent 8 years with the family of the marine who was killed.   I went over to Walter Reed on a regular basis during the Iraq war,  and I never will forget a young Army guy who had lost his leg. He told  me the story. He was a dog handler of a platoon and waiting for the dog  to go out and sniff an IED. The dog goes out, finds the IED, and turns  around and looks at the platoon. Then the IED exploded.   There are so many of these stories that it is hard to even get a  record of them.                                time  1945    In closing, I wanted to thank former President George W. Bush. He  signed the bill to erect a War Dog Memorial at Lackland Air Force Base.  John Burnam deserves so much credit. He got the private sector to pay  for the memorial at Lackland Air Force Base. So the dogs that Mr. Yoho  and others have spoken about tonight will never be forgotten. There is  a memorial for them and the work they have done for this country.   I want to say that, to me, of all the things--I have been in Congress  20 years--but when you touch a dog, you touch a child. These dogs have  done so much to save the children who are now soldiers, marines,  airmen, and sailors, to save those people from being killed by IEDs and  the enemy.   So, again, I thank Mr. Yoho very much for putting this together, and  I thank God that we can always remember that an animal is a gift from  God as much as we are as human beings.    Amen.
