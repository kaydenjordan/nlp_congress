 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my  friend, Colonel Charles Powell, who passed away peacefully on July 2,  2020, in his home in San Angelo, Texas, at the age of 89.   Charles was a true American hero who devoted his life to serving  others, and his passing is a loss that will understandably reverberate  throughout the community. His genuine love for God and others,  dedication to his family, and service to his country and community set  the gold standard of excellence that we should all strive for. Although  he is leaving this Earth, his legacy will live on through countless  lives he has impacted during his lifetime.   Charlie was born in Nashville, Arkansas, on May 7, 1931, where he  grew up and met his future wife, JoAnne. The two graduated together  from Nashville High School in 1949.   Charles went on to attend the United States Naval Academy in  Annapolis, Maryland, and graduated, in 1954, with a bachelor's degree  in general engineering. He was then commissioned into the United States  Air Force and launched his 30-year career in military service.   After graduating from pilot training, Charles took to the skies,  supporting transatlantic and transpacific deployments of tactical  forces; refueling missions supporting reconnaissance activities in the  Cuban Missile Crisis; and, finally, volunteering to serve in Vietnam as  a rescue crew commander and airborne mission commander. He also  participated in the planning and execution of the Son Tay POW camp  raid.   Over the course of his career as a pilot, Colonel Powell logged over  67,000 flying hours, flew 168 combat missions, is credited with 14  combat saves, and was awarded a multitude of military honors.   In addition to flying missions, Colonel Powell served in a variety of  leadership capacities in the Air Force, from flight instructor of the  Air Command and Staff College, chief of staff of Air University, and,  finally, the wing commander of the technical training wing at  Goodfellow Air Force Base in San Angelo, Texas.   At the center of Charlie's world was JoAnne, and their love story is  one for the ages. From meeting in grade school to graduating high  school together and raising their daughter, Terri, as Charles' missions  took him around the globe, their commitment to each other never  wavered.    San Angelo was forever changed when these two spitfires flew into  town in 1980. Charles was appointed as the wing commander at Goodfellow  Air Force Base, which was slated for closure at the time. Charles and  JoAnne immediately leapt into action, developing the relationship  between Goodfellow and the community of San Angelo and completely  transforming the mission of the base. After Charles' 4 years as wing  commander, Goodfellow was removed from the closure list. Today, the  connection between the base and San Angelo stands as the premier  example of effective military-civilian partnership.   Thankfully, after Charlie retired from the service, the Powells never  left San Angelo. Instead, they immediately set to work planting deep  roots in the community and making San Angelo a better place to live.  These two have been some of the most dedicated public servants our  community has ever seen.  [[Page H3621]]  Through their innumerable service initiatives, they have been  Goodfellow's most dedicated champions who served as the bridge between  San Angelo and Goodfellow.   Through it all, Charles and JoAnne stood together, side by side and  hand in hand. They transformed countless lives, not the least of which  was my own. I had the pleasure of meeting the Powells when I ran for  Congress in 2004, and in 2005, I hired JoAnne on as the first member of  my staff. At that point, I could never have imagined the depth of the  impact that Charlie and JoAnne would have on me, my family, and every  member of my team over the years to come.   JoAnne is the most longstanding member of my staff, and she and  Charlie have seen me through the ups and downs, all while tirelessly  serving the constituents of the Concho Valley.   Within my office, JoAnne took on the responsibility of shepherding  young men and women through the congressional nomination process for  applying to the United States military academies, while Charles chaired  the board responsible for vetting and recommending them to me for  nomination.                                time  0945    Their teamwork resulted in many young men and women from my district  receiving appointments to these prestigious institutions of higher  learning, further extending the tradition of service to our country to  future generations.   I cannot put into words the immense honor that it has been to have  Charles and JoAnne as a part my family. My wife, Suzanne, and I feel  tremendously lucky to have the opportunity to learn from them and to  count them among our closest friends.   Colonel Powell will be greatly missed, and I take comfort knowing his  legacy will continue through the people he loved and the community he  was so proud to call home.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).           Public Apology to the Honorable Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
