 Mr. Speaker, we only had four Democrats  shooting. Somewhere along the way, we have to do better recruitment.  You and I both know we are term limited as co-chairs, and my  replacement next year will be another Texan.   Where is my Texan?   Okay. Congressman Mark Veasey, and I know he shot better than I did,  so maybe he will improve our lot next time. It is a lot of fun, the  camaraderie is great, and I just am honored to have that time to be the  vice chair, now the co-chair of it, and so thank you.
