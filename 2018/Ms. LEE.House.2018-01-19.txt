 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the remarkable  accomplishment of the McClymonds High School football team located in  my congressional district.   McClymonds High School capped off a 14-0 season on December 10, 2017,  with its second consecutive 5AA championship, after defeating Visalia's  Golden West 42-12.   By winning two State championships in consecutive years, McClymonds  became the first team in the Oakland Athletic League to achieve this  impressive feat.   Now, McClymonds High School is a historic public high school in the  West Oakland community of my district, with a strong history of  athletic excellence. NBA legend Bill Russell and Major League Baseball  Hall of Famer Frank Robinson have graced the halls of McClymonds High  School.   Coach Michael Peters has carried forth the same tradition of  excellence since 1992 and has continuously worked to ensure that his  athletes succeed on the field but, most importantly, succeed in the  classroom.   These young athletes represent the spirit, the resilience, and the  passion of Oakland. Please join me in congratulating their historic  championship win.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding and  for his tremendous leadership on so many issues.   Madam Speaker, I stand in strong opposition to this bill, which is  really just another attempt to criminalize abortion and limit access to  the full range of reproductive healthcare for women.   This so-called Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is  another cynical attack on a woman's right to make her own healthcare  decisions. It is unnecessary and it simply pitches a false narrative to  the American people in order to intimidate women and providers.   Madam Speaker, in 2002, Congress passed a bill with broad bipartisan  support that acknowledges the rights of any child born alive in this  country, and affirms that any infant should receive appropriate medical  care. That is a given, and everyone believes that.   Republicans are distorting the truth about current law. This  legislation before us is a step too far. It interferes with medical  practice by enforcing extreme new standards of care through criminal  and civil penalties on providers.    In conclusion, I would just like to say that no woman should  have a politician interfering in her personal health decisions. They  should be made between her and her medical provider, period.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this very cynical and  sinister bill and to get out of the business of interfering in women's  health.
