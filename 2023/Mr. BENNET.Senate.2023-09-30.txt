 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to  speak without objection.    Madam President, I am sorry that you are having to stay  here so late tonight, but I am glad you are in the chair.   I wanted to come down to the floor, now that the vote is done, just  to explain the objection that I made earlier today. I am not going to  do it at an elaborate length, but I think it is important to say that I  was deeply disappointed--as were many people--that the deal to keep the  government open did not actually have as part of it continuing funding  for Ukraine, which I think is critically important. I think most people  in the Senate believe it is critically important.   I objected to proceeding tonight because I thought it was important  for us to find a way to send a bipartisan message from this Chamber  that that is how we felt.   As I mentioned to the Presiding Officer earlier today, to my caucus  earlier today, one of the reasons--or maybe the reason--why this is  something that is so important to me is that my mom, who is still  alive, was born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1938. She was a Polish Jew.   I couldn't imagine a worse place in the world to be born at that time  than where my mom was born. She and her parents and an aunt survived.  Everybody else was killed.   As everybody in this Chamber knows--certainly, the Presiding Officer  knows--16 million people were killed in Ukraine and in Poland by the  Nazis and by Stalin.   My mom cannot believe that she has lived long enough to see another  land war break out in Europe. That is what she says to me: I can't  believe I lived long enough to see this. I almost can't believe it  either because we had gotten used to reliance on our international  organizations, the rule of law, the idea that democracy had spread, the  idea that capitalism had spread.   There were some people, when the Berlin Wall fell down in the late  1980s, who were writing books about how this was kind of the end of  history because the liberal--small ``L'' liberal, not big ``L''  liberal--the small liberal order had prevailed. Of course, we know now  that wasn't true.   And we know now that there is a contest in the world of at least two  very different visions of how a human should organize themselves. We  believe in democracy. We believe in the rule of law. We believe in  freedom of speech and freedom of the press. Vladimir Putin believes in  none of those things. And Xi Jinping believes in none of those things  either.   It was an amazing experience for me to sit as a member of the  Intelligence Committee and watch Putin make one mistake after another  as he contemplated invading Ukraine--something a lot of people believed  he wouldn't actually do. I think a lot of Ukrainians thought that he  might. I think a lot of Pols thought he might. I think a lot of others  living in Eastern Europe were worried that he might actually do it.   I said that he made some fundamental mistakes, and he did make some  fundamental mistakes. One was he believed that his army was a lot  stronger than it has been. That doesn't mean they don't have serious  military capabilities. That doesn't mean that he wouldn't unleash a  battlefield of nuclear weapons at the drop of a hat or chemical weapons  at the drop of a hat if he felt like he was losing in a way that  threatened his regime or threatened him. I certainly am clear-eyed  about that. I know the Presiding Officer is and everybody else is.   But his army is a lot more hollowed out than he thought it was. That  is what happens when you are a totalitarian living on top of a  totalitarian society. No one actually tells you the truth. No one says:  Vladimir Putin, your army has been hollowed out. We have wasted all  that money that you asked us to spend on the army through corruption  and other kinds of things.    So that was one fundamental mistake. A second fundamental mistake was  his failure to understand what the Ukrainian people's reaction would  be. We didn't get it all right. Some of our intelligence wasn't right.  There were people who were saying that Putin was going to be in Kyiv in  72 hours. There was the feeling that Zelenskyy's government would  collapse and that the Russians would have a puppet government in Kyiv.   Instead, what has happened is the Ukrainian people have exhibited  more bravery than anybody could have ever asked for. It is astonishing  what they have done. And, to me, it is astonishing what they have  accomplished.   You hear people in the press these days talking about the stalemate  on the frontier or on the battle, on the frontline, as if that is  somehow a failure on the part of the Ukrainian people. I see that as  exactly the opposite. I see that as an unbelievable achievement by the  Ukrainian Armed Forces, by the Ukrainian people, by President  Zelenskyy, and by the American taxpayers who have supported this work.   That is the third thing Vladimir Putin didn't count on, was that  people all over the free world and democracies all over planet Earth  would be so inspired by the courage of the Ukrainian people, would be  so inspired by the bravery of the Ukrainian people that they would  demand of their elected officials that we do more, do more, do more.  That is what people have said in countries all over the world. That, he  didn't count on either.   That has been an amazing thing over the last 2 years, after we had a  President here who cast a lot of doubt on whether NATO was even  something important or whether the rule of law was something important  or whether the United States following through on our commitments was  even something important. And we have shown that none of that is true,  and NATO is stronger today than it has ever been. The transatlantic  alliance is stronger today than it has ever been.   We have allies from Europe to Asia who understand what the importance  of this fight is. They know that this is not just a fight for Ukraine.  They know the Ukrainians aren't just fighting for Ukraine--although,  that is an important fight; that is an important battle. They know this  is a fight for democracy. This is a fight for the free world.   There is no way that this fight would have been as successful as it  has been without U.S. assistance, without U.S. intelligence.   This is one where the good guys have come together in a way that is  really  [[Page S4898]]  meaningful and in a way that the tyrants in this world, I think, were  not expecting.   Our intelligence community certainly thinks that Xi Jinping is now  having to think twice and three times and four times about whether or  not he is going to invade Taiwan as a result of the success of the  Ukrainian people.   President Zelenskyy was here 2 weeks ago, and he told us that,  without our support, they would lose. I told my colleagues today that I  was standing there with--it was probably--I wasn't as close as you  were, Madam President, but I was close. I was just several desks away  from where he was standing. And I was thinking to myself--it was in the  old Senate Chamber where you didn't need a microphone in the old days  and humans were talking to humans. People showed up to have these  debates, to have these conversations. And here we were, 100 humans who  were in the Senate, who happen to be in the Senate today, and here is  this guy, President Zelenskyy, who, until 3 years ago or so--or 4 years  ago, maybe--was an actor in his home country in Ukraine and who ran for  office almost as a lark because there was so much corruption that he  felt like he had an obligation as a citizen to run, to run for  President, to try to overcome that corruption.   Then something happened that he probably didn't think was going to  happen, which is Putin invaded Ukraine, and the entire weight of the  world dropped on President Zelenskyy's head--just a human being, one  human being. Not the tallest guy I have ever seen, not the strongest  guy I have ever seen--a pretty regular person standing there in his  fatigues and the entire weight of the world is on his shoulders.   Our support of the Ukrainian people, because of what they have been  willing to do not just for Ukraine but for democracy, has made a huge  difference to them and to what President Zelenskyy is trying to  accomplish.   Tonight, I did object earlier because I was worried that--I thought  it was important for us to make sure we send a clear message that we  are not leaving Washington without figuring out how to fund Ukraine;  that we are going to spend the next 45 days or so making sure that the  United States continues to lead in this effort. No one else in this  world can lead here. That is a lesson I have learned from my mom. That  is a lesson I have learned from her experience in Warsaw and around  Warsaw. Nobody but the United States can lead. We are the only folks  who can lead.    President Zelenskyy said we are the only folks who can lead. And we  cannot allow our political differences here, our political disputes  here, to keep us from delivering the aid that Ukraine needs. We can't  do it. And I think there are probably some people who thought, when we  left today, that is what we were doing.   I thought it was important for the leadership of the Senate to put  out a statement tonight--Senator Schumer and Senator McConnell and  several others on each side of the aisle--underscoring that we are  going to spend the next 45 days working together to pass a robust  Ukraine aid package. And I think that is vitally important. And I hope,  in a small way, hopefully, we all had the chance today to think again  about how important this is, how important our leadership is, how  important our presence here as human beings is.   We are not going to get another chance at this, I suspect. I suspect  that we are going to have one chance, and that chance is going to be 45  days from now. And this Chamber, just like President Zelenskyy has  done, just like the Ukrainian people have done--he said, in fact: We  are giving our lives. All we are asking for is your money.   He is right about that. They are giving their lives. And I think that  if we had entered this war or watched this war happen, starting 2 years  ago, and we had not supported the Ukrainian people in the way that we  have, the world wouldn't have supported them, and they wouldn't have  made the extraordinary progress that they have made. And who knows how  this could end. We don't know.   It is important for us to stay in this fight and continue to lead. It  is important for us to learn the lessons of 16 million people who lost  their lives in Eastern Europe, in Poland, in Ukraine, believing that  they were dying invisible to the rest of the world. And we can't let  that happen again.   Madam President, I would ask unanimous consent that the statement  that Senator Schumer and Senator McConnell signed tonight be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   Schumer, McConnell, Murray, Collins, Coons, Graham Joint Statement on               the Senate's Commitment to Supporting Ukraine         ``We welcome today's agreement to avoid a harmful and       unnecessary shutdown of the federal government.        ``Nevertheless, this agreement leaves a number of urgent       priorities outstanding. In the coming weeks, we expect the       Senate will work to ensure the U.S. government continues to       provide critical and sustained security and economic support       for Ukraine.        ``We support Ukraine's efforts to defend its sovereignty       against Putin's brazen aggression, and we join a strong       bipartisan majority of our colleagues in this essential work.       With the eyes of our partners, allies, and adversaries upon       us, we keenly understand the importance of American       leadership and are committed to strengthening it from Europe       to the Indo-Pacific.''     I thank the Presiding Officer for all of your relentless  support for the Ukrainian people and President Zelenskyy, and thank you  for being there tonight.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
