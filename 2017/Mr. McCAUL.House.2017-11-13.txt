 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution,  expressing the urgent need for a political solution in Yemen.   As the civil war in Yemen continues well into its third year, the  situation on the ground becomes more dire by the day. Despite multiple  international attempts to broker a political agreement to end the human  suffering, peace remains elusive.  [[Page H9153]]                                     time  1730    Meanwhile, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, also known as AQAP, has  taken advantage of this power vacuum created by the conflict. This has  allowed them to expand into the southern and eastern ports of Yemen,  where they continue to plot external operations against the United  States.   Simultaneously--much like in Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq--Iran continues  its campaign of influence in Yemen, where its actions have prolonged  the conflict and exacerbated the political and humanitarian nightmare.   As highlighted by Secretary Mattis, ``everywhere you look, if there  is trouble in the region, you find Iran.'' This is not by coincidence.  As Prime Minister Netanyahu emphasized to our congressional delegation  on a recent trip to Israel, Iran has been working around the clock to  solidify its presence across the region through the establishment of a  land bridge from Iraq to Lebanon, commonly referred to as the ``Shiite  Crescent.''   Despite a United Nations authorized arms embargo against the Houthi  forces, Iran, on multiple occasions, has been caught attempting to  smuggle weapons and munitions into the region. They have also provided  technical assistance to the Houthis--and Saudi Arabia is often their  main target.   In order to protect the security interests of the Saudi people, the  government in Riyadh has taken defense actions to both limit Iranian  support to the Houthis, such as blockades, as well as offensive  measures to stem attacks on the kingdom, such as the unsuccessful  ballistic missile attack on the capital earlier this month. However,  while Saudi Arabia has the right to prioritize its security, we cannot  dismiss the effects of its actions on the grave humanitarian suffering  on the ground, where more than 27 million face an unprecedented  humanitarian crisis.   As such, this resolution rightly highlights the need for a political  solution to this conflict and condemns Iranian activities that  undermine peace efforts. Furthermore, it calls on all parties of the  conflict to take additional measures to prevent civilian casualties and  increase much-needed humanitarian access.   Lastly, this resolution encourages the international community to  join in providing the resources necessary to address this crisis.   I commend all those involved. It is a real threat that I see as  chairman of Homeland Security every day. I thank the chairman, and the  gentleman on the other side of the aisle for bringing this important  legislation to the floor.
