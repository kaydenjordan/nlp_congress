 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  3440, the DREAM Act, to protect DACA recipients like Gerardo, a  computer programmer in Santa Barbara, who has grown up, gone to school,  and worked in the United States for the past 13 years.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, the unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Thompson ) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 1201, line 14, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $1,000,000) (increased by $1,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from California (Mr. Carbajal) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, I am offering an amendment to ensure we  are taking the appropriate steps to improve pipeline safety to mitigate  some of the devastating impacts of oil spills throughout our Nation.  This is a particularly important issue for my constituents on the  central coast where we have seen the damage oil spills wreak on our  communities and local economies.   During the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, over 100,000 barrels of  crude oil spilled into the Santa Barbara Channel. This was the largest  oil spill in California's history that significantly harmed Santa  Barbara's unique marine ecosystems and wildlife, recreational  interests, and commercial fishing.   Paired with the 2015 Refugio oil spill, also in Santa Barbara County,  where clean-up costs hit $92 million, these incidents show us that we  cannot continue to drag our feet. We need to implement pipeline safety  and spill mitigation rules that Congress already passed 6 years ago.   In 2011, the House worked in a bipartisan way to pass the Pipeline  Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act. This law, which  passed the House unanimously, directed the Pipeline and Hazardous  Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, to update and strengthen key  pipeline safety standards. The law called on PHMSA to issue a rule  requiring automatic shutoff valves on new pipelines and to strengthen  requirements for the inclusion of leak detection technologies on  pipelines.   My amendment is straightforward. It sets $1 million of PHMSA's own  budget for the finalization and implementation of sections 4 and 8 of  the bipartisan 2011 pipeline safety law so that our Federal guidelines  are up to date. Section 4 requires new pipelines to install automatic  shutoff valves.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Will the gentleman yield?    I yield to the gentleman from Florida.   Mr. DIAZ-BALART. I want to thank the gentleman for bringing this  issue up and just let him know that we are ready to accept his  amendment. So if he would just yield back, I will accept this  amendment. I want to thank the gentleman for bringing it up.    Mr. Chairman, if the amendment is in order to be  accepted, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Carbajal).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 38 Offered by Ms. Rosen    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 38  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.  [[Page H7051]]
