 Mr. President, I come before the Senate today  to honor the life of Marca Bristo: a trailblazer, an activist, a mother  and--to me and so many others--a hero. She passed away this month at  the age of 66, after spending the last four decades on the frontlines  of the disability rights movement.   With every day that passed and every fight she took on, Marca  redefined the word resilience. It was thanks in large part to her  decision to get out of her wheelchair and crawl up the steps of the  Capitol Building to help pass the Americans with Disabilities Act that  I can roll through its corridors to cast my vote in its Chamber three  decades later.   She climbed up those steps to tear down the barriers that had been  holding us back. She got onto her hands and knees so the rest of us  could rise, working tirelessly to turn the ADA from a dream to a law  that enshrines the basic civil rights that those of us with  disabilities rely on to live our daily lives.   I and countless others am devastated that we lost her so soon, but I  am also deeply grateful to have known her, deeply thankful that, in one  of the toughest times of my life, when I was still adjusting to life in  a wheelchair after being wounded in Iraq, she decided to reach out.  Through her kindness and her wisdom, her strength and her grit, she  quickly went from stranger to mentor to dear friend.   Marca was raised on a farm in upstate New York before moving to  Chicago and earning her nursing degree at Rush University, but less  than a year after becoming a nurse, a diving accident left her  paralyzed from the chest down.   She lost her home because she could no longer access it. She lost her  job because there were no labor protections for those with  disabilities. She lost her health insurance because her injuries and  care were too expensive. But she didn't lose her resolve, and our  country is far, far better because of that and because she believed  that, even if you get knocked down, it doesn't mean you are knocked  out.   Marca's entire life changed the day of her accident. Suddenly, she  looked around and saw a world hostile to her, hostile to all who  couldn't walk or see, couldn't speak or hear.   So she set about changing the world. She saw a country that pushed  people with disabilities into the margins, a nation that treated them  as less than,  [[Page S5703]]  one that overlooked or ignored their needs, making it impossible for  many to work or even to get to work, impossible to go to school or to  lead the normal lives they deserved.   She saw discrimination, and she refused to call it anything else,  refusing to stop fighting until disability issues weren't just  relegated to the doctor's office, weren't just treated as medical  matters, but were recognized as civil rights.   So she spoke out. She chained herself to public buses to demand  wheelchair lifts. She fought for fair housing and founded Access  Living, which she built into one of the leading disability rights  groups in the country. She wheeled herself to the front of the Capitol  Building, got down out of her chair and, one stair at a time, crawled  up its 83 steps, demanding that Congress give Americans with  disabilities the basic rights the Constitution promised. She set up  camp outside GOP offices to tight against cuts to Medicaid, letting  herself get arrested because that is what it took.   In the process, she reframed how this country thought about our  rights. As she famously said, ``My wheelchair wasn't too wide for the  doors. The doors were too narrow for my wheelchair.'' Through all her  work over all these decades, she didn't just widen the doors. She  opened ones that had previously been closed to all of us who happen to  be in a chair.   No one used to think about how we couldn't get from sidewalk to  street when there wasn't a curb cut. No one used to question the fact  that we couldn't climb onto the bus or get down to the subway.   Marca changed all that. She refused to accept a status quo that  didn't accept all of us. She saw us, she fought for us, and she made  our voices heard.   Her work, her friendship, her activism meant so much to me. It is the  reason I am here in the Senate today, and it is the reason I will keep  fighting tomorrow.   My thoughts are with all of Marca's loved ones. Thank you for sharing  your mother, your wife, your sister with the rest of us. We will  continue her legacy. We will keep widening those doors, unlocking them,  crashing through them if need be, just as Marca would have wanted.  Doing everything we can to bring about that more fair, more just, more  accessible world that she worked so hard for, for so long.   Thank you.                            ____________________
