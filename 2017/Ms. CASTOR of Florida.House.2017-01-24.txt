 Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman DeGette  for yielding the time.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 7 and urge the  Republican-led Congress to hear the voices of the millions who marched  on Saturday who proclaimed that women's rights must be respected,  including a woman's right to choose her own health care.   I was part of that march, with many of my neighbors from Florida, to  send a message to this Congress that our rights--our constitutional  rights--must be preserved. Americans have a right to privacy, as we are  reminded on this anniversary week of Roe v. Wade, but this Republican  bill tramples on that right to privacy.   Women, their families, and their doctors have the right to make their  personal healthcare decisions, not the mostly male politicians in  Washington. It is especially appalling that the Republicans have  targeted female veterans and those that serve in the military for  reduction in care.   So, Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on this unconstitutional bill  and encourage Americans to continue to lift their voices.
