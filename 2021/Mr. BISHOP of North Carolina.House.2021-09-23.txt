 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor  retired Lieutenant Colonel Allen Lamb of Lumberton, North Carolina, and  to extend him best wishes for a very happy 90th birthday.   Lieutenant Colonel Lamb, a decorated fighter pilot, led the legendary  Wild Weasels tasked with destroying North Vietnam's air defenses, which  included Soviet-made surface-to-air missile installations. The Wild  Weasels baited the enemy into targeting them with their radar, allowing  their teammates to detect and destroy the anti-aircraft system.   On December 22, 1965, Lamb was the first Wild Weasel to destroy one  of these missile sites, marking a key event in the war and saving  countless American lives.   For his heroic service, Lieutenant Colonel Lamb received two Silver  Stars and a Distinguished Flying Cross. I am honored to call him a  constituent.   Happy birthday to Lieutenant Colonel Lamb.                            ____________________
