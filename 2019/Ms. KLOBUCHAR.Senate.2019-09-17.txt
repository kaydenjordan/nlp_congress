 Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues in  calling on Leader McConnell to immediately bring to the floor  commonsense gun violence prevention legislation that is supported by  the majority of the American people.   We must take action in response to the tragedies that have touched  too many communities across the country, including in Gilroy, El Paso,  Dayton, Midland, and Odessa just this summer. Time and again, we saw  the American people respond with courage--the courage of a mother who  shielded her child from gun fire, the courage of first responders who  ran into the line of fire to save lives. It is time for the United  States Senate to find the resolve to act with courage; the American  people cannot afford any more inaction.   There are three bipartisan bills sitting on Leader McConnell's desk  that will help to save lives: the Bipartisan Background Checks Act,  which requires a background check for the sale of all guns; the  Enhanced Background Checks Act, which closes the Charleston loophole  and gives law enforcement more time to complete a background check; and  the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which includes a  provision based on my bill, the Protecting Domestic Violence and  Stalking Victims Act, to keep domestic abusers and convicted stalkers  from buying or owning a gun.   We should also take action to ban the sale of assault weapons and  high-capacity magazines and encourage States to enact extreme risk  protection order laws to allow law enforcement or family members to  intervene when a person is a danger to themselves or others. In a  nation plagued by gun violence, passing these commonsense provisions  will help save lives.   There are more shootings and more tragic losses all too often, and  every time, we hear expressions of sympathy, but we have yet to see  votes or action. The time has come to act, and we must act now.   Thank you.
