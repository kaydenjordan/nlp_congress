 Mr. Speaker, tonight, I rise to speak on the  vital goal of seeing the Korean Peninsula and its people peacefully  reunited under a commitment to the values of human rights, freedom, and  democracy.   For nearly three-quarters of a century, the Korean people have been  divided by armed conflict and political boundaries. Yet, despite this  adversity, the fundamental unity and shared heritage of the Korean  people continue to endure.   I am, therefore, heartened by the potential of May's talks between  the United States, the Republic of Korea, and the People's Republic of  Korea. While the road to peaceful reunification is a long one, next  month's talks are an essential first step toward the reunification and  the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. I commend  [[Page H3084]]  both the American and South Korean Governments for embarking on this  first step.   I also want to recognize all those who have dedicated themselves to  the cause of reunification, including the wonderful Korean-American  people of my district and the Chicago area, as well as the National  Unification Advisory Council and its Chicago chapter. The work of these  dedicated advocates and others has brought new hope to all who would  see Korea peacefully reunited.                            ____________________
