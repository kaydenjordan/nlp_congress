 Mr. Speaker, as the Chinese Communist  Party marks a century of power, Americans must renew our efforts to  hold this regime accountable for its human rights atrocities. The  Chinese Government has imprisoned more than 1 million Uyghurs,  persecuting this religious minority for their fundamental beliefs.   For 100 years, the Chinese Communist Party has committed gross  violations of human rights, mass imprisonment, torture, and genocide.  Now more than ever, Americans must stand strong with the people of  China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. We must support the Chinese people's  right to free expression, their right to privacy, and the right to life  itself.   As Americans celebrate the Fourth of July, we must remember that our  freedom is much too precious to be taken for granted. As President  Ronald Reagan said, freedom is a fragile thing, and it is never more  than one generation away from extinction.                            ____________________
