 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1619 would ratify and reaffirm a March 2020  decision by the Department of the Interior to place 17 acres of the  land located in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, into trust for the  Catawba Indian Nation.   In 1980, the Catawba Tribe filed a land claim for former Tribal land  in South Carolina, but the agreement they entered with the State failed  to provide a clear understanding as to where the Tribe may have lands  held in trust, what process is required, or whether the Indian Gaming  Regulatory Act applies to the Catawba Nation.    By 1993, the Tribe and the State of South Carolina entered into an  agreement to settle the lawsuit, and the South Carolina legislature  enacted a law ratifying that agreement.   That same year, Congress ratified the settlement agreement by passing  the Catawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina Land Claims Settlement Act  and extinguished any other potential claims of the Catawba.   In exchange, the Catawba received $50 million, the restoration of  their status as a Federally-recognized Tribe, and a streamlined process  for restoring its land base in South Carolina.   But confusion about the Tribe's land continued as it submitted an  application with the Department of the Interior to place land in  Cleveland County, North Carolina, acquired into trust to develop a  casino.   Even after the Department of the Interior approved the Catawba's  trust application, determining that the Tribe met the restored lands  exemption under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, there were still  ambiguities that led to a challenge in court.   Madam Speaker, I hope that this bill will finally resolve the  remaining issues and give the Catawba Tribe certainty about its land  and the ways it can use it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Timmons).    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2758 would extend Federal recognition to the  Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina and remove a bar that has prevented the  Tribe from being federally recognized.   Recognizing the Lumbee Tribe would make its members eligible for  services, benefits, and immunities available to other federally  recognized Indian Tribes. The bill would also establish a service area  to deliver Federal programs to Robeson, Cumberland, Hoke, and Scotland  Counties in North Carolina.   In 1956, an act by Congress designated certain Indians as Lumbee  Indians of North Carolina and declared that they shall enjoy all rights  as citizens of the State of North Carolina and the United States. At  the same time, the act made them ineligible for services available to  recognized Tribes and makes Indian statutes inapplicable to them.   This scheme has led to conflicting Department of the Interior  solicitor opinions regarding whether the Lumbee Tribe may pursue  administrative recognition. H.R. 2758 would resolve those conflicting  administrative opinions and recognize the Tribe so that its Members can  receive the benefits that other Tribes have.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Representative  Dan Bishop from the  State of North Carolina for his leadership on the issue.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop) who has done so much  work on this issue.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  unwavering support for his constituents and his efforts to work across  the aisle.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am ready to close, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1975, the Pala Band of  Mission Indians Land Transfer Act.   This bill would place approximately 721 acres of land located in San  Diego, California, into trust for the Pala Band of Mission Indians.   As Ms. Leger Fernandez said, gaming pursuant to the Indian Gaming  Regulatory Act is prohibited on the lands to be placed into trust by  this legislation. In the early 1990s, San Diego, California, voters  approved a plan to establish the Gregory Canyon landfill project, but  the landfill process fell into bankruptcy and the development company  sold a portion of the land to the Tribe for cultural preservation. The  Tribe is now requesting to have that land placed into trust to be part  of the Tribe's reservation.   I want to thank Mr. Issa for his leadership on this issue, and I  again urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Issa).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his advocacy  on the part of his constituents. I do again urge adoption of this.   I am ready to close, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, today, the Indian Health Services Urban Indian Health  Program consists of 41 nonprofit programs nationwide.   These programs are funded through grants and contracts from the  Indian Health Service, pursuant to the authorities of the Indian Health  Care Improvement Act.   Urban Indian health organizations that participate in the program  provide services such as information, outreach and referral, dental  services, primary care services, community health, and other important  services.   In 2010, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,  Congress reauthorized and amended the Indian Health Care Improvement  Act by adding a requirement that the Indian Health Service confer with  urban Indian organizations.   In 2014, the Indian Health Service established a policy to guide when  the Indian Health Service seeks input from Urban Indian Organizations  on health policy matters.   Other agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services  that serve American Indians and Alaska Natives, such as the Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration, and others, do not have policies regarding conferring  with Urban Indian Organizations.   Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Urban Indian health organizations  were provided no notice that they were required to make selections for  COVID-19 vaccine distribution until the day of the deadline imposed by  an agency.  [[Page H6046]]  This resulted in Urban Indian Organizations struggling to provide  accurate responses to changing public health decisions for Indians  living in urban areas.   This bill would amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to  require all agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services  to establish an urban Indian organization confer policy.   I thank the sponsor of this legislation, Chairman Grijalva, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am ready to close, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I first want to thank Chairman Grijalva and Chairwoman  Leger Fernandez for their cooperation in moving this bill forward.   H.R. 3616, offered by my colleague, Mr. Moore of Utah, requires the  Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study assessing the suitability  and feasibility of designating the Bear River National Heritage Area in  northern Utah and southern Idaho.   The Bear River area straddles the Utah-Idaho border where the Great  Basin and Rocky Mountains meet. It is home to the Northwestern Band of  the Shoshone Nation, the Golden Spike National Historical Park, the  Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge, the Hardware Ranch, numerous Latter- day Saints history sites, the Oregon Trail, and a strong agricultural  economy and abundant natural beauty.   The Bear River area is a great candidate for study as a potential  national heritage area, and this legislation enjoys strong local  support.   I commend Congressman Moore for his work on this legislation, and I  urge adoption of the measure.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Moore).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for bringing this  to our attention, I urge adoption, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Grijalva and Chairwoman Leger  Fernandez for working together on this bill. I rise in support of S.  108. It is a bill that authorizes the Seminole Tribe of Florida to  lease or transfer certain land, and for other purposes.   As Ms. Leger Fernandez described, this bill would exempt lands held  in fee by the Seminole Tribe of Florida from the limitations imposed by  the Indian Nonintercourse Act, which restricts a Tribe from leasing or  conveying any lands a Tribe owns without Federal approval.   The act has generated a great deal of confusion and litigation about  whether a Tribe can buy, sell, or lease land that it owns. The bill  states that the act does not authorize the Tribe to lease, sell,  convey, warrant, or otherwise transfer all or any portion of any  interest in any real property that is held in trust.   This bill was introduced in response to real estate investment issues  encountered by the Seminole Tribe, since at least two title insurance  companies would not grant the Tribe insurance.   The bill ensures that the act does not interfere with the ability to  convey fee land owned by the Tribe, which would impede the Tribe's  economic development activities and hinder job creation.   Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close. I urge adoption of the  measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the Pascua Yaqui Tribe owns several parcels of land  that it would like to use for gaming. This bill allows them to do that.   In May of 2021, the Governor of Arizona and 21 Tribes amended the  Arizona Tribal State Gaming Compact to build a third gaming facility in  the compact-designated area in Tucson.   The compact-designated area is known as the Old Pascua community, an  area with deep historic ties to the Tribe. The compact requires land to  be taken into trust by an act of Congress to open the gaming facility.  H.R. 4881 does this by requiring the Secretary of the Interior to place  any land owned by the Tribe within the compact-designated area into  trust for gaming purposes.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2088, the Eastern Band of  Cherokee Historic Lands Reacquisition Act, as amended.  [[Page H6052]]    I thank Chairman Grijalva and Chairwoman Leger Fernandez for their  cooperation on this bill.   The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians is a relatively small Tribe  located in the Great Smoky Mountains of western North Carolina. The  Tribe's reservation covers over 50,000 acres in a region known as the  Qualla Boundary.   After the completion of the Tellico Dam in Loudon County, Tennessee,  in 1979, the Tribe explained to the Tennessee Valley Authority that  there were areas of historic significance impacted by the dam.   H.R. 2088 would place Tennessee Valley Authority land and permanent  easements into trust along the shores of the Little Tennessee River and  Tellico Reservoir in Monroe County, Tennessee, for the benefit of the  Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.   The parcels to be placed in trust under the bill would primarily be  used for memorializing and interpreting the history of the Eastern Band  of Cherokee Indians. Gaming pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory  Act would be prohibited, and TVA will be able to continue carrying out  river control and development to power the Tennessee Valley region.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I recognize the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann) for his continued work on  this important legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann).    Madam Speaker, I again thank the gentleman from  Tennessee for his work on this legislation. I thank the chairman and  the chairwoman for their work on this package of bills.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
