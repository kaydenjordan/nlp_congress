 Mr. President, nearly 5 million young people ages 16 to  24, or 1 in 9 youth, are disconnected from both school and work. These  disconnected youth often face significant barriers; they are three  times more likely than other youth to have a disability, twice as  likely to live below the federal poverty threshold, and significantly  more likely to live in racially segregated neighborhoods. Disconnection  can leave young people without the entry-level work experience and  post-secondary credentials they need to succeed in the workforce and  with significantly less lifetime earnings than the typical worker.   Disconnection also imposes significant costs on affected young  people, their communities, and the overall economy. According to  Measure of America, in 2013, youth disconnection resulted in $26.8  billion in public expenditures, including spending on health care,  public assistance, and incarceration.   Dedicated Federal funding to support summer and year-long employment  for youth can help to mitigate and prevent disconnection, as well as  help young people, their communities, and the economy to flourish and  develop our future workforce. Twenty years ago, dedicated Federal  funding supported an estimated 500,000 summer jobs for youth. However,  when the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA) eliminated Federal  stand-alone funding, participation in summer youth employment programs  dropped by 50 to 90 percent in most local areas. Through targeted  resources and supports, including funding for summer and year-long  employment and comprehensive supports for youth, we can move closer as  a country toward reconnecting the millions of young people who have  slipped through the cracks and prevent disconnection from occurring in  the first place.   This is why I am pleased to introduce today The Opening Doors for  Youth Act. The Opening Doors for Youth Act aims to assist the 5 million  at-risk young people who are disconnected from both school and work  find summer or year-long jobs that help them to succeed in future  careers. The bill provides, Federal funding so local communities can  create partnerships with businesses, mentoring, financial literacy  planning, and other supportive services. Through the partnerships,  workforce boards can use funds to cover up to 75 percent of wages for  each eligible young person participating in the program.   Young people play a critical role in our economy and communities and  we must ensure that they have the resources and skills to find and  maintain jobs that set them up for future success. With the right  resources, city governments, local workforce boards, school districts,  and employers can work together to help us close the employment gap  we're seeing for at-risk young people. I hope that my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle consider The Opening Doors for Youth Act  commonsense legislation that moves the needle forward on promoting  access for all youth to meaningful employment.                            ____________________     Mr. President, nearly 5 million young people ages 16 to  24, or 1 in 9 youth, are disconnected from both school and work.
