 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on my colleagues and  the President to reopen the government.   Too many lives are being impacted. Too much is at stake. I cannot sit  idly by and watch the impasse that continues to plague our country. I  have been in constant discussions with my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle to come to agreement, but to no avail.   This shutdown is hurting our economy, causing distrust in our sacred  democracy, and putting the lives of hundreds of thousands of Federal  employees in limbo. This is unacceptable.   There are currently 5,730 Federal employees in Michigan who are out  of work. This shutdown is seriously impacting our country's safety and  health.   There are FDA labs in Detroit that inspect for food and drug safety  and oversee the interdiction of items coming into our country. They  must be allowed to continue, this work.   The House just voted on the final appropriations bill to reopen the  government. I urge my colleagues in the Senate and the President to put  an end to this for once and for all, and to pass these bills.                            ____________________
