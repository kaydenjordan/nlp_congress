 Mr. Speaker, for a record-breaking 13th consecutive year,  Old Dominion Freight Line has been named the number one National LTL  Carrier for Quality.   Mr. Speaker, this is a tremendous feat, and one that underscores how  this company has maintained a commitment to excellence since its  inception in 1934.   Not only is Old Dominion a force to be reckoned with in delivering  freight, both domestically and internationally, but it is also an  economic driver in North Carolina.   Congratulations to Old Dominion and its countless dedicated  employees. The work you do around the clock helps the world keep its  promises.                            ____________________
