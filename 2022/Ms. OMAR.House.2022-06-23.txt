 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on  this legislation and for working tirelessly to negotiate a solution.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for the Keep Kids  Fed Act. As food costs continue to soar, this critical legislation is a  lifeline for millions of American families struggling to make ends  meet.   In my home State of Minnesota, one in nine children are food  insecure. This bipartisan legislation builds on my bill, the MEALS Act,  to ensure children continue to receive school meals this summer. I am  proud to have been part of this fight.   While I wish this agreement could have provided a permanent solution,  this is a vital step to prevent millions of children from going hungry  throughout the next few months. In the meantime, I will continue to  fight for the passage of my bill, the Universal School Meals Program  Act, to ensure that no child in the richest country in the world goes  hungry.
