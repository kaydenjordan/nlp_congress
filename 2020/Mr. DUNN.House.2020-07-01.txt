 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember an outstanding  member of the Panama City community, Christ Cordon.   Christ passed away last week. He was a devoted husband, father, and  friend to me as well as many others.   He owned a small business and quietly gave to organizations,  individuals, and causes he believed in. He generously contributed to  the Children's Advocacy Center, checking on and supporting them after  Hurricane Michael.   The fact that Christ gave so much without seeking any recognition  speaks volumes about his character. His death is a truly huge loss for  our community. He was exceptional. He leaves behind a loving wife and a  young son.   I am grateful for the time that I had with Christ Cordon and for the  privilege of calling him my friend. I encourage all of us to think  about the impact we have made on our communities, and how we can  continue to serve our communities in the future, just as Christ did.                            ____________________
