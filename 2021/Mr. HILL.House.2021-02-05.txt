 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition of the National  Apprenticeship Act.   As the co-chair of the Skilled Workforce Caucus with my friend from  Michigan, Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, I have had the opportunity to  see firsthand, professional training programs in my home State of  Arkansas and in Michigan.   And, I want to thank my Democratic colleagues for their sincere  effort to prioritize work training programs, however their efforts are  flawed.   I have heard my colleagues in the Democratic majority say they want  our legislation to reflect America and I share that goal.   I agree that we need legislation that reflects the where people work  in our economy.   However, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, roughly 12.1  percent of Americans are employed by unions.   Frankly, this legislation does not reflect our country's workforce  because it preferences one business model over another.   Rather than encouraging entities and businesses to be empowered to  make training choices that are best for their industry, we are instead  picking winners and losers.   As we move towards recovery from the COVID crisis, we need as wide of  an approach to training programs as possible, and this bill is not the  answer. Republicans, including myself have offered several amendments  that will make a bad bill better. Please support my amendment change to  this legislation. In that regard, I ask for unanimous consent to submit  letters of support for my amendment.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the National Apprenticeship Act.    Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank my friend from Michigan and my friend from North  Carolina for their leadership in promoting apprenticeship programs that  benefit the American people.   Madam Speaker, my amendment is simple. It trades one word for  another, but the impact is significant. The National Apprenticeship Act  states, to the extent practicable, that the partnerships for funding  under Title II be part of an industry or sector partnership and partner  with a labor or joint labor-management organization.   My amendment changes ``and'' to an ``or.'' I am afraid that the  unintended consequences of the word will be treated as a requirement  for the Federal Government that entities requesting funding under Title  II must partner with a union.   This bill, as written, allows the government to play favorites with  Title II funding and, instead, we should encourage entities to be  empowered to make choices that are best for the workforce in their  area.   In my view, entities applying for Title II funding under the bill  should be partnering with both non-union and union industry leaders.  But I have no doubt that should this bill become law, bureaucrats at  the Department of Labor will interpret the use of ``and'' in this  section to mean that if you are not partnered with a union organization  you will not receive funding. That is my concern.   My home State of Arkansas doesn't have a large union presence, like  many States around the country, and this legislation would make it more  difficult for entities in my home State to receive Title II funding.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record letters in support  of my amendment from the National Association of Home Builders and the  Associated General Contractors.                                            National Association of                                                   Home Builders,                                   Washington, DC, February 3, 2021.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: On behalf of the       more than 140,000 members of the National Association of Home       Builders (NAHB), I write to share our views on H.R. 447, the       National Apprenticeship Act of 2021.        NAHB shares Congress's desire to align the national       apprenticeship system with the needs of a 21st century       workforce and ensure it better serves students, employers,       schools, and other stakeholders. For decades, NAHB's       workforce development partner the Home Builders Institute       (HBI) has offered skills development opportunities and career       and technical education to underserved, non-traditional, and       at-risk populations through its Department of Labor (DOL)-      recognized pre-apprenticeship curriculum. We appreciate the       Committee on Education and Labor's engagement with us last       Congress to address concerns we raised during the committee       process. This has, in our view, improved the bill.        However, we remain deeply concerned that the bill includes       ambiguous language requiring eligible entities seeking access       to robust new grant funding to partner with a labor or joint       labor-management organization ``to the extent practicable.''       Consequently, this provision could restrict bona fide,       respected training providers' access to grant opportunities       or force them to partner with organized labor groups with       which they have no purpose for affiliation. NAHB strongly       supports Hill Amendment #29 which clarifies that entities may       partner with an industry sector partnership or with a labor       or joint labor management organization to satisfy the grant       program's eligibility requirements. This will ensure access       to critical funds by a diversity of registered training       programs as employers seek to rebuild their workforces in the       pandemic-ravaged economy.        NAHB recognizes Congress's work to expand youth and adult       access to instruction in the skilled trades and believes the       National Apprenticeship Act of 2021 is a step in the right       direction. As the bill moves forward in the Senate, we look       forward to working together to modernize the national       apprenticeship system to ensure pre-apprenticeships remain a       viable training tool for residential construction.            Sincerely,      James W. Tobin III                                   ____                                                   February 3, 2021.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      AGC Key Vote: Vote ``YES'' on Hill Amendment to H.R. 447, the           National Apprenticeship Act of 2021.         Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: On behalf       of the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC), I       write to urge you to support the Rep. French Hill Amendment       to H.R. 447 which would simply clarify that all registered       apprenticeship programs are eligible for grants under the       National Apprenticeship Act of 2021. Despite the pandemic,       the construction industry continues to experience a skilled       worker shortage and anticipates that persisting in the       future. As such, AGC urges a ``YES'' vote on this amendment       and reserves the right to record your vote as a KEY VOTE for       the education of our more than 27,000 member firms.        Workforce development has historically been a bipartisan       issue. And H.R. 447 is well intentioned in seeking to expand       apprenticeship opportunities and address the skilled worker       shortage. The bill elevates and prioritizes the role       apprenticeships can play, provides incentives for states to       assist employers and offers technical assistance in the       development of programs. Although the bill would provide new       and significant funding increases for apprenticeship       programs, the ability to fully capitalize on opportunities       under Title II of the bill would be put into jeopardy and       many registered apprenticeship programs would be ineligible       to qualify.        The Rep. Hill Amendment addresses the inequities in the       bill by clarifying that all registered apprenticeship       programs would be eligible for grants, not just programs       partnering with unions to receive taxpayer support. AGC is       proud of our contractor members' support of union-affiliated       joint apprenticeship training programs, but we believe all       bona fide and high-quality apprenticeship programs that are       registered with the U.S. Department of Labor and are not       affiliated with a union program are still important       components to addressing the workforce development problem       and should also be eligible for Title II grants under H.R.       447.        Using the power of the federal purse to discriminate       against any U.S. DOL registered apprenticeship program for       the sole reason that they are not partnered with a labor or       joint labor-management organization is contrary to the stated       goals of the legislation. If a program meets DOL's rigorous       standards for registration, then there's no valid reason       Congress should be restricting tools to upskill and train       Americans as the economy and industry emerge from the global       pandemic.        Again, AGC urges a YES vote on Hill Amendment and looks       forward to working with Congress on practicable solutions to       our nation's workforce needs.            Sincerely,                                             James V. Christianson.     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the distinguished ranking member on the  Committee on Education and Labor.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank my friend from Michigan. He, in the last Congress, in putting  the word ``and'' into the act, said he wanted to give a shout-out to  unions. Therefore, I think he has actually identified it very well,  that this does improve flexibility and choice. I am concerned about the  Department of Labor reading the ``and'' as essentially a directive. So  I believe the ``or'' is important, Madam Speaker.  [[Page H430]]    Americans are struggling with the COVID-19 crisis. Restrictions, as  it relates to title II funding of this bill, unintentionally hurt the  American people trying to get new jobs and opportunities. We need every  angle to help our citizens get to a successful career.   I call on my colleagues to support this simple amendment, to change  the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, let me say this. Bottom line, in the construction  industry, important to every one of our States, registered  apprenticeships trained about 28,000 people a year, where the need is  over 440,000 people a year in construction.   We need more flexibility. This amendment is flexible. It supports the  American people.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
