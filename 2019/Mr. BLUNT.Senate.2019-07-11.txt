 Madam President, first of all, let me say that I couldn't  agree more with the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Wicker, than I do.  His points are exactly right. A democracy is finding a way forward. It  is not finding your way forward necessarily. It is obviously finding as  much of your way forward as you can find. But it is finding a way  forward.   Clearly, a top priority of the Federal Government is to defend the  country. It is my top priority. I think I would be safe in suggesting  it is Senator Wicker's top priority. And it is an important priority  for our friends on the other side, but it may not be quite the same  priority on the other side.   For this to work, the House and the Senate have to work together and  the White House has to work together to come up with just that spending  number. Once we have the number that we are going to spend, having the  debate on the floor is suddenly possible.   I am fully in agreement with that, but I want to talk for a few  minutes today about a program that we need to extend for a short period  of time to get it extended to the end of this spending year.
