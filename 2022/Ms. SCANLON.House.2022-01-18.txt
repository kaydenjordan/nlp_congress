 Madam Speaker, last Friday was a big day for  infrastructure in the Philadelphia region.   Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was in Philly to announce the  first tranche of funding for bridges under the new law, including $1.6  billion for Pennsylvania bridges.  [[Page H201]]    That afternoon, I got to highlight how funding from the  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will improve our regional public  transit system, known as SEPTA.   Over the next 5 years, SEPTA will receive more than $500 million more  than expected. That money will help SEPTA accelerate repair efforts,  including rehabilitation projects, vehicle replacement, and improving  accessibility of rail and trolley stations.   While all of these upgrades are needed, the forthcoming work on  accessibility is especially important. In fact, it is essential. People  across our region rely on SEPTA every day to get to work, take their  kids to school, buy groceries, go to the doctor, and more. Our  neighbors should be able to complete these daily tasks without having  to plan around which station has an elevator to accommodate a  wheelchair or which stop is easier to get a baby stroller in and out  of.   I am glad the infrastructure funding that Congress and President  Biden delivered will help get this much-needed work done more quickly.  Our Delaware Valley residents deserve it.                                time  1215                        Election Workers are Essential     Madam Speaker, I rise because we have seen a continuous  assault on voting rights and election integrity in recent years, pushed  by partisan operatives, foreign governments and, most disturbingly,  some of our own elected officials.   Over the weekend, the former President pressed members of his party  in Pennsylvania to plant more Republican operatives in our election  system in order to influence the counting of votes.   The former President said, ``We have to be a lot sharper the next  time when it comes to counting the vote. Sometimes the vote counter is  more important than the candidate.'' That is just wrong.   I will be the first to agree that our election workers are essential,  but not because they are supposed to change the results in our  elections for one political party or another. That is not how American  elections work. Here, the people decide.   This kind of mindset is exactly why it is so important to have people  of good character trained and ready to execute the duties of poll  workers faithfully. Poll workers are the first line of defense for  ensuring the right to vote. They help voters overcome challenges, both  bureaucratic and physical, at the polls. They also help educate the  public about how safe and effective our election system really is.   We need more engaged citizens who want to contribute to our democracy  to get involved and sign up to be poll workers in our communities. I  encourage my constituents to reach out to their county election  officials today to learn more about this unique opportunity to uphold  our democratic system and help ensure that all eligible voters are able  to exercise their most essential freedom, the right to vote.               Bipartisan Infrastructure Law Delivers Benefits     Madam Speaker, one of the highlights of congressional  action last year was the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and we  are already seeing the impact in my district, Pennsylvania's 5th, and  the greater Philadelphia region.   Just before the holidays, EPA Administrator Regan joined me at the  Lower Darby Creek Area Superfund Site to announce that the agency had  committed millions in funding from that infrastructure bill to this  project, moving its anticipated completion date up to 2023.   At this former landfill, chemicals had leached into the soil and  groundwater for decades in the largely minority community of Eastwick.  Thanks to funding from the new infrastructure package, many sites like  Lower Darby Creek will see their cleanup accelerated, and nearly 50  additional Superfund sites will get the green light to be cleaned up.   Less pollution, safer communities, and more jobs.   I am proud to deliver these benefits to PA-05 through the bipartisan  infrastructure law.                            ____________________
