 I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) and  the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Manchin) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) and  the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Manchin) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, yesterday, during a hearing before the  Senate Judiciary Committee, I had a chance to share the story of this  fallen hero from Chicago, IL. Her name is Ella French.   Officer French joined the Chicago Police Department in 2018. A true  public servant, she was always eager to help. She loved people, loved  her family, and loved animals, particularly stray dogs. She would often  pick them up in her squad car and ferry them to safety at the end of  the day.   Last year, tragically, Officer French was shot down during a traffic  stop. She was 29 years old. Her partner, Carlos Yanez, Jr., was  seriously wounded. The gun that was used to shoot both of them had been  straw-purchased in Indiana, a State adjoining Illinois. A straw  purchase takes place when someone without a criminal record, who can  pass a background check, buys a gun for someone who cannot. In this  case, the purchaser was turning the gun over to a convicted felon who  used the gun to kill Ella and seriously wound her partner.   During yesterday's hearing, which focused on law enforcement officer  safety, we were joined by Officer French's mother, Elizabeth. She is a  wonderful  [[Page S3720]]  person. I want to take this opportunity to thank Elizabeth French for  her bravery and her commitment to honoring her daughter's legacy.   I want to thank our witnesses, including Chief Angel Novalez of the  Chicago Police Department, who himself was shot in the line of duty,  for participating yesterday in the hearing.   Every time law enforcement officers put on their uniforms and badges,  they put their lives on the line, especially in a country that is now  awash in guns, America, the country of 350 million people and 400  million firearms. In fact, guns are not only the No. 1 cause of death  for America's children, they are the leading cause of death for  officers in the line of duty, second only to COVID.   We have made some progress in recent months in reducing the risk of  gun violence for police officers and our families. The Bipartisan Safer  Communities Act included a provision I have long supported, cracking  down on straw purchases, like the gun that was used to kill this  amazing young woman.   We still have a lot of work to do. Yesterday, I introduced  legislation--and I have named it in Officer French's honor--that would  provide funding to multijurisdictional task forces to combat straw  purchasing: the Officer Ella Grace French Task Force Support Act. I am  glad her mother was there to hear that.   I hope every Senator who prides himself on supporting law enforcement  will join me in this legislation. I can think of no better way to honor  the service and sacrifice of our officers, to protect our families and  our children, and to demonstrate to America that this Senate is serious  about stemming the tide of gun violence in our country.                          Right to Contraception Act    Madam President, in the United States of America, nearly all women-- 99 percent--use some form of contraception in their lifetime to prevent  unplanned pregnancy. They use birth control pills, IUDs, condoms, and  other devices. Many women who are not sexually active still use birth  control to manage medical conditions.   Further, almost every woman who identifies as religious has used a  contraceptive method in her lifetime--99 percent of mainline  Protestants, evangelical Protestants, and Catholics--and 96 percent of  people with other religious affiliations.   In short, women in all stages of life in America and of all religious  backgrounds rely on birth control. It is their constitutional right. It  is their decision. But this right, this decision, is now under attack.   Over a month ago, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization,  the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, revoking for the first  time ever an established constitutional right: the right to  reproductive healthcare. And I fear that the Court's assault on our  fundamental freedoms is just beginning.   In his concurrence in the Dobbs opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas  urged the Supreme Court to ``reconsider all of this Court's substantive  due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell.''  He made reference in that statement to three Supreme Court decisions  which have been on the books for over 50 years. That is an explicit  threat by Justice Thomas against the very right to same-sex marriage,  the right to consensual relationships between LGBTQ people, and the  right to contraception, which has been protected by the Court's  decision in Griswold v. Connecticut for 55 years.   In that case, Griswold, a supermajority of seven Supreme Court  Justices ruled that married couples have a right to access  contraception. They based it on a word which you will not find in the  Constitution: ``privacy.'' Now, more than half a century later, we are  living in an America where women are no longer guaranteed this right to  privacy, this right to reproductive healthcare, and where their very  right to contraception is now in doubt and in jeopardy.   This is not some alarmist rant. At this very moment, women in America  are being denied their constitutional right to contraception. How could  that possibly be in this country? Well, look no further than your local  pharmacy.   This past weekend, USA TODAY reported on the story of Abigail Martin,  a young woman who has been taking birth control pills for the past 6  years. She went to a Walgreens pharmacy to refill her birth control  prescription, which had been prescribed by her doctor. She was turned  away by a pharmacist at Walgreens. It took 4 days before she was  finally able to access her medication by going to a different  pharmacist. That is a dangerous delay in healthcare. Apparently,  Walgreens allows its pharmacists to refuse to fill a prescription for  which they have ``a moral or religious conviction . . . [and] to refer  the customer to another employee or manager on duty who will complete  the transaction.''   Since Abigail's story went viral, other Walgreens customers have come  forward to say that cashiers refused to ring up their condoms because  they announced it violated their faith.   A pharmacist should not be able to unilaterally decide that their  personal moral or religious beliefs can delay or interfere with the  medical needs of a patient standing at the cash register, buying a  legal medication, which is why this week I sent a letter to the CEO of  Walgreens, an Illinois corporation, for an explanation of their policy.   If Walgreens is going to allow its individual employees to dictate  what legal medical products customers can purchase, then the company  should make this policy known to the public. They should be required to  display signs at their cash registers alerting customers and the public  that they may not be able to fill their prescriptions or buy healthcare  products in a timely manner. Given this information, customers may  decide to take their business elsewhere--to a pharmacy that does not  allow individual staff members to restrict or interfere with their  customers' legal purchasing decisions.   A woman's right to essential healthcare should not differ based on  which pharmacy she chooses, who fills her prescription, or who rings it  up. Her right to this personal decision in her life is fundamental-- fundamental. That is why Congress must pass the Right to Contraception  Act introduced by Senators Markey and Murray. This is a commonsense  proposal, and I have cosponsored it. It would codify the right to  contraception in America nationwide--a right that has been undisputed  for 55 years.    We need this legislation because now women in America are living with  the consequences of six unelected Justices erasing the constitutional  right to reproductive healthcare, and pharmacies, like Walgreens, are  allowing their employees to dictate what healthcare products consumers  are able to purchase. Walgreens says they want to be respectful of the  moral judgment of their employees and staff. Should they not also be  respectful of their customers?   Politicians and pharmacists have no business standing between a woman  and healthcare. If protecting this right sounds like common sense to  you, then join us in supporting the Right to Contraception Act.   If the Supreme Court will not respect this fundamental personal  right, you have the right to demand that your Member of Congress will.                              CHIPS Act of 2022    Madam President, across America, tens of thousands of cars are lined  up bumper to bumper in a total standstill. This is not an ordinary  traffic jam. You see, these cars are brand new. They were assembled by  some of the finest names in American manufacturing. But they are  missing something, a key, essential component: microchips.   If you are in the market for a new car or even a fridge or a  smartphone, there is a good chance you have felt the semiconductor  shortage. These tiny pieces of silicon power nearly everything around  us. But with the coronavirus epidemic, supply chains have been snarled  and foreign factories have been shut down, which has led to a global  shortage of microchips.   This has had a devastating impact on American consumers, businesses,  and workers. Over the past 2 years, the price of a new car has  skyrocketed by 20 percent--40 percent for used cars. We have seen the  repercussions of this firsthand in my home State of Illinois, which is  one of the leaders in the auto industry. Companies like Stellantis,  which runs an assembly plant in Belvidere, have been forced to shut  down production several times this year because of these shortages.  [[Page S3721]]    Today, the Senate did something remarkable: We passed a bill, a  bipartisan bill. How about that. And it is important. We came to the  rescue of job creators like Stellantis and to the rescue of American  consumers. We voted on this legislation to invest billions of dollars  into making microchips right here in America.   This bill is critical for the future of our economy. It is even  critical for our national security. And we need it desperately for more  scientific breakthroughs. But in the near term, the CHIPS Act is  imperative for shoring up our Nation's supply chain and strengthening  our defense system. Why? Because microchips are essential not just for  cars and refrigerators and smartphones but for guided missile systems  and fighter jets.   Right now, America has to rely on foreign suppliers like China to  supply the chips that power the next generation of defense in America.  That wasn't always the case. In 1990, America produced almost 40  percent of the world's supply of microchips. Today, make that 12  percent. Somewhere along the way, we settled for outsourcing  semiconductor production to Asia. That is just unacceptable, and it is  unsustainable. Imagine our turning to the Chinese Communist Party to  determine whether or not we can buy the microchips that fuel our  economy and protect our Nation. That is a dangerous scenario.   I have heard a few colleagues voice concern about the subsidies in  this bill, but--let's be clear--this is no reckless corporate giveaway.  The CHIPS Act will bring American factories back to life, creating good  jobs in our country.   The fact is, our competitors in Asia and even Europe are already  investing billions of dollars in luring chipmakers away from America.  We need to fight fire with fire. The CHIPS Act will. It will  incentivize the biggest names in technology to manufacture right here  in America, and if any company breaks their commitment to make it in  America, we reclaim all of the funding that we give them under this  bill.   But beyond this economic and national security imperative, the CHIPS  Act is important for another reason, one that really strikes at the  heart of America: pioneering innovation. The CHIPS Act includes  historic funding authorization for groundbreaking scientific research  at the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy's  Office of Science.   This has been a particularly important issue to me personally as a  Member of the Senate for many years. It was 7 or 8 years ago when I  decided to try to push for increasing medical research funds at the  Federal level. I concentrated on the National Institutes of Health,  with Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, who was just on the floor before  me, joining me in a bipartisan effort with Patty Murray in an effort to  make this bipartisan and effective. It worked. We dramatically  increased the investment in the NIH. But I knew that wasn't enough. We  needed the Department of Energy's Office of Science, as well as the  National Science Foundation, to have the same increase in funding.  Today, with the passage of the CHIPS and Science bill, we are finally  moving in that direction.   We know how important scientific research is. We have learned it over  and over. For instance, finding that vaccine for COVID-19 in  recordbreaking time was a result of investing in science and medical  research years and years before.   We also know that we have launched some things which are going to  change the world. The James Webb Space Telescope is one of those  things. The deepest and sharpest photos of our universe are finally  coming home to the United States and the rest of the world.   What is NASA doing with this trove of data being collected by this  telescope now? Well, since NASA is funded by taxpayers, they are  sharing it with researchers throughout the country. One professor at  the University of Chicago, Jacob Bean, says that he is planning on  using this data to learn more about exoplanets orbiting faraway stars,  whatever the possibilities may be that they can host a life.   This one image of our universe has unleashed a flood of new ideas and  just countless questions for researchers around the world. It shows how  funding and scientific research can really change the place we live in.   When we support scientists and researchers, we are paving the way for  new discoveries. NASA was critical for developing so many products.  Imagine, if you will, that they had a lot to do with developing  athletic shoes, CAT scans, and smartphone cameras. These staples of  American life and more were unintended discoveries pioneered in NASA's  labs.   With the CHIPS Act, we can kick-start a new generation of discovery.  I am happy to say that, in Illinois, in the Chicagoland area, we have  two of the best research operations in our country: the Argonne Lab and  Fermilab.   With this funding, these facilities will break new ground in  researching emerging technology, like AI and quantum computing. In  fact, Argonne and Fermilab already partnered together with the  University of Chicago to launch the most advanced quantum network in  the world. They are planning to expand it to other parts of the  country, bringing more research into this cutting-edge research  technology.   And much like space exploration 50 years ago, quantum computing is  the new frontier in science. We have only begun to explore techniques  like teleporting qubits, which may sound like a line from Star Trek,  but it has profound implications.   Quantum computing could revolutionize the way we design electric  batteries for cars, even solar technology, to maximize energy  efficiency. These are the possibilities that lie before us. The passage  of the CHIPS and Science Act today on the floor of the U.S. Senate is a  vindication of our commitment to this Nation's future and an investment  that generations will thank us for.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) and  the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Manchin) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, it is not often one gets to experience and  celebrate a living legend. But we have a chance today to do with a  member of our Senate family. On February 27, 1984, an important part of  the Senate community opened: the Senate Employees Child Care Center.  There for that historic opening was a very special teacher, Ms. Phyllis  Green.   Over the ensuing nearly four decades, Phyllis masterfully impacted  the lives of so many students that passed through center. She helped  them get started in their young, tender lives with humor, warmth,  devotion, skill, and of course, great patience.   She is also something of a legend among the families on my staff  whose children had the privilege of being taught by her--Wren, Rayn,  Alex, Leo, Oliver, Avery, and Harry--so much so that even the ones who  didn't have her for a teacher knew of her class. It is hard to imagine,  but students that were in her early classes are now in their 40s.   Some years ago, during her 30th anniversary at the center, a number  of former students, now adults, came back to celebrate with her, and  there wasn't a dry eye in the room. Think about how many of us had a  teacher who made an impact in our lives and the rare opportunity to go  back as an adult to offer warm thanks for those memories. What a gift  to reflect upon so many lives impacted during one's career, so much so  that Phyllis's colleagues said during her final week that ``the  Legendary, the one and only Ms. Phyllis is retiring.''   In fact, one of them wrote a poem that aptly noted of Phyllis, ``Your  patience, knowledge and guidance opened up so much potential. For the  children and the parents, your being has been essential. . . . In the  eyes of many, you are a living legend, A pillar of our community, an  educator, a teammate, a friend.''   On the 30th anniversary of the child care center, the former Senator  Tom Harkin described its teachers and administrators ``as some of the  unsung heroes of the Senate.'' I wholeheartedly agree and certainly  Phyllis Green is one such hero.   I thank Phyllis for her incredible service to nearly four decades of  Senate employee families and their children. You have made a real  impact on our world.                            ____________________     Mr. President, at long last, it is official. Buck O'Neil  and Minnie Minoso are finally where they deserve to be: in the National  Baseball Hall of Fame.   These two remarkable men, who were friends for decades, both started  their careers in baseball's storied Negro Leagues. They went on to make  history again in the Major Leagues--in the city of Chicago--and they  stayed involved with baseball all their lives.   And they were both known, as one writer said, ``as much for their  grace and spirit of generosity as for their immense achievements in the  game.''   I never had the good fortune to meet Buck O'Neil, but I have a  baseball that he signed, and I keep it as a treasure.   I did meet Minnie Minoso. He and Satchel Paige came to a Springfield  Redbirds game many years ago, and I summoned the courage to shake their  hands between innings. What a thrill that was. But meeting Minnie  Minoso was an honor shared by so many Chicagoans.   As his widow, Sharon Rice-Minoso, recalled at the Hall of Fame  induction ceremony, ``Baseball was his life. He was proud to wear his  uniform and come to the ballpark every day to greet fans with a smile  and sign autograph and after autograph. Some people believe that Minnie  signed an autograph for every man, woman, and child in the Windy  City.''   ``The Cuban Comet'' and ``Mr. White Sox.'' That is what the fans  called him. His full name was Saturnino Orestes Armas Minoso Arrieta.  He was born on a sugarcane ranch in Cuba in 1923--or maybe it was 1924  or `25. He was a little fuzzy on his age.   He was a two-time All-Star in the Negro Leagues before becoming the  first Black player for the Chicago White Sox in 1951 and the first  Latino star in Major League Baseball, the Jackie Robinson of Latino  ballplayers.   He was one of the best hitters in the American League in the 1950s, a  seven-time All-Star while with the White Sox and Cleveland Indians.   He hit over .300 eight times, led the American League in stolen bases  three times, hammered double-digit home runs almost every season, and  won three Gold Gloves in left field.   He retired in 1964--or so it seemed. Twelve years later, when Minnie  was 50, the White Sox called him back for three games. He hit a line  drive to left field, making him one of the oldest players in MLB  history to score a base hit.   The White Sox retired his No. 9 in 1983, and he remained close to the  organization and its players until he died in 2015.   Baseball analysts have long considered his omission from Cooperstown  a glaring error. Now, finally, it has been set right.   Buck O'Neil was a two-time All-Star first baseman with the Negro  Leagues Kansas City Monarchs. He went on to be a scout for the Chicago  Cubs, the first Black coach in Major League Baseball, and one of the  most beloved ambassadors for baseball in the sport's history.   He was born John Jordan O'Neil, Jr., in Florida in 1911, the grandson  son of an enslaved man. He joined the Monarchs in 1938 and was a star  player in the 1940s and `50s. As a first baseman, he was known for his  smooth glove work, but he could also handle a bat. He was a three-time  All-Star and became a Negro World Series champion in 1942.   In 1943, at the height of World War II, he enlisted in the Navy and  served for 2 years, including time in the Pacific. He returned to the  Monarchs after the war and was the Negro League's batting champ his  first year out of the service. In 1948, the Monarchs promoted him to  player-manager. Among the many players whose careers he helped shape  was a shy young shortstop who would go on to become the first African- American player for the Chicago Cubs, ``Mr. Cub,'' Ernie Banks.   After the Monarchs were sold in 1955, Buck found work as a scout for  the Cubs. Players he signed as a scout with Chicago--and later, the  Kansas City Royals--included Lou Brock, Oscar Gamble, Lee Smith, and  Joe Carter. He made history when the Cubs hired him as a coach in 1962,  making him the first Black coach in the American or National League.   In 1990, Buck O'Neil began what would become perhaps his greatest  contribution to baseball. With a handful of others, he founded the  Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, just blocks from where he  had played with the Monarchs and where Rube Foster had founded the  Negro Leagues in 1920.   He devoted the rest of his life to baseball and especially keeping  alive the memories of the Negro Leagues. He helped build the Negro  Leagues Museum from one room to a 10,000-square-foot showplace. He  traveled widely, using his grace and wit to tell the stories of Negro  League stars such as Josh Gibson, Cool Papa Bell, Buck Leonard, Oscar  Charleston, and his old Monarchs teammate, Satchel Paige.   In 1994, not long after the World Series was canceled because of a  labor dispute, Ken Burns' nine-part PBS series ``Baseball'' introduced  Buck O'Neil to an even larger audience. He became the beloved Bard of  Baseball.   Also inducted into Cooperstown last weekend were: David Ortiz, ``Big  Papi,'' the slugger who led the Boston Red Sox to three World Series  Championships; Gil Hodges, All-Star first baseman for the Brooklyn  Dodgers and manager of the 1969 ``Miracle Mets;'' Tony Oliva and Jim  Kaat, two teammates from the  [[Page S3739]]  1965 pennant-winning Minnesota Twins; and Bud Fowler, born in 1858 and  often regarded as the first Black professional baseball player.   Minnie Minoso and Buck O'Neil were voted in under new rules that  officially designated the Negro Leagues as a major league in 2020.   Buck had been nominated once before--in 2006--but to the surprise of  nearly everyone, fell one vote short. He accepted the verdict with his  usual grace, even agreeing to speak on behalf of the 17 players who  made it into Cooperstown that year.   With this typical optimism, he told the crowd gathered at Cooperstown  that day, ``I've done a lot of things I liked doing, but I'd rather be  right here, right now, representing these people who helped build a  bridge across the chasm of prejudice.''   Minnie Minoso and Buck O'Neil helped build that bridge, too. And now,  they are finally where they deserve to be, among baseball's immortals.                            ____________________
