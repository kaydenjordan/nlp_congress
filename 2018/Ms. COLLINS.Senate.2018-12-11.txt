 Mr. President, as I listened to Senator Heitkamp's  farewell remarks to us today, I could not help but think of the fact  that she used her final speech on the Senate floor not just to talk  about her accomplishments, of which there are many, but to inspire us.  It was a call to action. It was a call to the better angels of  ourselves to work together in the interests of our country.   Maine and North Dakota are separated by a great distance, but the  people of our two States have in common the qualities of hard work, of  respect for tradition, balanced by a spirit of innovation and a belief  in personal responsibility, always tempered by compassion.   During her years in the Senate, Heidi Heitkamp has demonstrated those  qualities time and again. She is passionate, as we heard today; she is  energetic, as we have seen in her work; and she is a committed public  servant who has worked so diligently for her State and for our country.   Senator Heitkamp has a remarkable record of public service. As her  State's attorney general, she fought to protect the people of North  Dakota against drug dealers, to defend seniors against abusive scams,  and to keep sexual predators off the streets.   Senator Heitkamp has continued those causes, that fight as a Member  of the U.S. Senate. Among the many issues on which we have worked  together, Senator Heitkamp's determined leadership on efforts to  support victims of human trafficking and to prevent youth homelessness  stand out. She and I led the charge to increase Federal funding for the  Runaway and Homeless Youth Act and the McKinney-Vento Education for  Homeless Children and Youth Program.   She has also been such a strong advocate for children, as you all  heard today. She has worked to help teenagers who find themselves  without a permanent home or on the street.   I was proud to stand with her in helping to forge the bipartisan path  forward on the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which became law  and includes Senator Heitkamp's provision to give safe harbor to  victims of human trafficking. She has also shed light on the role  healthcare providers can play in identifying and protecting the victims  of human trafficking by authoring the Stop, Observe, Ask, and Respond  to Health and Wellness Act--the SOAR Act--on which I was proud to be  her lead Republican.   Senator Heitkamp has been such a valued leader in strengthening our  agriculture. In fact, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee  was just talking about the absolutely vital role she has played working  with both the chairman and the ranking member. She knows that when we  strengthen agriculture, we sustain our rural communities.   The Next Generation in Agriculture Act that she authored and I  cosponsored will ensure that new farmers and ranchers have the support  and guidance they need.   It has been so rewarding to work with Senator Heitkamp on so many  bipartisan issues, such as improving school nutrition, increasing  access to healthcare in underserved areas, and expanding mental health  services for our rural vets. She was also instrumental in the success  of the Common Sense Coalition in preventing a lengthy government  shutdown earlier this year.   Senator Heitkamp has been an effective and courageous colleague, but  most of all, she has been a dear friend. Our friendship transcends  party lines and is rooted in mutual respect and trust.   To my friend, I say thank you for your service to our country and  thank you so much for your friendship. I am so grateful that we served  together, and I wish you all the best.   Thank you.    Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague  Senator Angus King in sponsoring this resolution to designate December  15, 2018, as Wreaths Across America Day. Throughout human history, the  evergreen wreath has been offered as a tribute to heroes. On December  15, we gather to offer this enduring symbol of valor and sacrifice to  America's heroes. In this season of giving, we pay tribute to those who  have given us the most precious gift of all, our freedom.   Some who secured that gift did not return home. Some did return but  have since passed on. Some remain missing but will never be forgotten.  Many still live in honor among us.   We here at home must always respect their service. Often, we do this  on those special days we set aside each year--Memorial Day, the Fourth  of July, and Veterans Day. Sometimes, we do this spontaneously because  our hearts, rather than our calendars, tell us to. That is the origin  of Wreaths Across America.   Twenty-six Christmases ago, Morrill and Karen Worcester took time  during their busiest season to donate and deliver 5,000 wreaths from  their company in Harrington, Maine, to Arlington National Cemetery to  mark the graves of fallen heroes. The people of Maine are proud that  this heartfelt expression of America's gratitude began in our State,  and I congratulate Karen and Morrill for being awarded the  Congressional Medal of Honor Society's Patriot Award this April, the  highest award the Society can bestow to civilians.   In the years since, that heartfelt gesture became a national  phenomenon and an American tradition. More than six million wreaths  have been laid by tens of thousands of volunteers at more than 600  cemeteries, here and abroad, and even on ships at sea. This remarkable  effort is made possible by trucking companies across the Nation who  donate their services and by the generosity of thousands of volunteers  and supporters. With the Patriot Guard escort, the convoy from Maine to  Washington is greeted at every stop along the way by grateful citizens  of all ages. On December 15--after months of hard work, careful  planning, and generous donations--wreaths will be laid where American  heroes lie at rest.   This year, for the first time, more than 9,300 Maine-made balsam  wreaths will mark the headstones of all American service members laid  to rest at the Normandy American Cemetery in France. It has been nearly  75 years since our brave troops stormed those beaches to liberate  Europe but they will never be forgotten.   Wreaths Across America honors our departed heroes, but it does even  more. It tells our veterans that we honor their service. It tells our  men and women in uniform today that we are grateful for their courage  and devotion to duty. It tells the families of those serving our  country that they are in our thoughts and prayers. And it tells the  families of the fallen that we share their grief.   The mission of Wreaths Across America is: Remember, Honor, Teach.  Thanks to the spirit of this Maine-made tradition, we remember and  honor America's veterans, while also teaching the generations to come  of the sacrifices that have been made to secure a future of peace and  liberty. May God bless these heroes, and may God bless America.                            ____________________
