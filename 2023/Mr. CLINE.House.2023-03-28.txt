 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Salem High School  forensics team for winning its 17th consecutive State championship.   The team won 5 of the 10 categories, while also finishing runner-up  and third place in another 2 events. These champions include Kade Lakin  and Grayson Mitchell for serious duo, Emma Snead for impromptu  speaking, Ryan Long for original oratory, Connor Smythers for humorous  interpretation, and Courtney Bowen for serious prose.   Ben Hathaway and Kyra Netting finished second in the humorous duo  category, and Colton Easter placed third in the prose category.   Since becoming coach in 2001, Coach Mark Ingerson has instilled in  the students to work for and help each other as a team, bolstering  their success.   With public speaking skills, the future is bright for all of these  students, no matter the path they choose.   Congratulations to the participants, parents, coaches, and staff for  making this milestone possible.                            ____________________
