 Madam Speaker, a year ago, this House passed the  bipartisan H.R. 8 to establish universal background checks to protect  our communities from terrifying, paralyzing gun violence. In the 365  days since, Mitch McConnell has done exactly what the gun industry has  asked him to do: nothing.   Meanwhile, a gunman killed five people yesterday in Milwaukee, and  two teenagers were killed 5 miles from where we stand over the weekend.   Meanwhile, millions live with the physical and emotional scars caused  by guns.  [[Page H1232]]    Meanwhile, the gun industry is wrapped with immunity that shields  their profits and puts more guns on our streets.   Madam Speaker, there is a secret that President Trump and Mr.  McConnell are hiding--you are subsidizing this industry:   Billions in medical costs, covered by your tax dollars;   Billions in lost wages, covered by your tax dollars;   Eighty-seven percent of the costs incurred after a bullet pierces a  person's skin, covered by you.   We are propping up an industry that profits off of our pain.   Enough.                            ____________________
