 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the life and legacy  of Darlene Kehaulani Butts, known by many as Auntie Kehau.   Born and raised in Wahiawa, Oahu, and a proud graduate of Leilehua  High School, Auntie Kehau dedicated her life to serving her community,  advocating for Native Hawaiians, and perpetuating the traditions and  values of Hawaii in the D.C.-Maryland-Virginia area.   In 1998, Auntie Kehau started a catering company in Stafford,  Virginia, to share iconic Hawaiian foods with local residents and  Hawaii expats, myself included. In 2004, she helped found and became  the inaugural president of Ke Alii Makaainana Hawaiian Civic Club.   For decades, she also served as chair of the annual King Kamehameha  Day Lei Draping Ceremony, working closely with the Hawaiian  congressional delegation, local leaders, Native Hawaiian organizations,  and other stakeholders to honor Hawaii's greatest king and Saint Damien  with lei, Hawaiian music, and hula here in the United States Capitol.   In all that she did, Auntie Kehau was never short of aloha. She  helped former Hawaiian residents find homes in the DMV area and  welcomed so many others to take part in preserving Hawaiian culture.   Auntie Kehau's tireless efforts will be remembered and celebrated for  generations to come.   Mahalo.                            ____________________
