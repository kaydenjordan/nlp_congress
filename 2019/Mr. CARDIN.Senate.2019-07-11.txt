 Mr. President, America's strength is in our values. In  that vein, I rise to talk about human rights and America's historic  role as a defender of universal human rights for all peoples.   I have been a member of the U.S. Commission on Security and  Cooperation in Europe for many years. It is also known as the Helsinki  Commission. The Helsinki Commission is an independent entity that  brings together lawmakers and members of the executive branch to  represent the United States at the OSCE, the Organization for Security  and Cooperation in Europe, which was created to explicitly promote  human rights, democracy, and economic, environmental, and military  cooperation among its 57 member nations, including the United States  and Canada, all the countries of Europe, and the former Soviet Union  countries.   When the Helsinki Final Act was signed in Finland in 1975, it  enshrined among its 10 Principles Guiding Relations between  Participating States a commitment to ``respect human rights and  fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of thought, conscience,  religion or belief, for all without distinction as to race, sex,  language or religion.''   Few people have predicted the sweeping, largely unforeseen  consequences of the adoption of this document. From this one provision,  among the 10 that focus on human rights and fundamental freedoms, there  were movements sprung that embraced the Helsinki process as a sword and  as a shield. Independent civil societies coalesced around this basic  principle and used the followup processes that were set in motion by  the Helsinki Final Act to hold their governments' feet to the fire.   In 1976, Congress established the Helsinki Commission with the  mandate to monitor and report on compliance with the Helsinki Final Act  and, most importantly, to press successive administrations to make  human rights and democracy priorities in the conduct of U.S. foreign  policy.   In the subsequent years, Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia, Solidarity in  Poland, and Watch Groups in Moscow, in Kyiv, and in Vilnius sprang up  to push for the release of political prisoners and to defend the rights  of those who wanted nothing more than to worship and to have the  freedom to advocate for refuseniks and others who sought to reunite  with their families across borders.   Through what became known as the Helsinki process, Congress and  previous administrations supported the rights of Lech Walesa, Vaclav  Havel, Natan Sharansky, and countless others who emerged as leaders in  their supporting of the historic transitions to freedom 30 years ago  with the fall of the Iron Curtain, the end of communism, the  unification of Germany, and as President Bush proclaimed, a ``Europe  whole and free.'' The Helsinki process of monitoring, reporting,  advocating, urging, meeting, and witnessing was a catalyst for these  historic changes.   Most importantly, at a time of historic transition, the countries  participating in the Helsinki process all acknowledge that democracy  was the only form of government that we could accept and that issues  related to human rights and democracy were never matters of internal  interference but were matters of direct and legitimate concern to all  participating states. This means, quite frankly, that we have, under  the Helsinki Accords, the legitimate right--I would say the  obligation--to challenge the failure of any one of those 57 states in  its meeting of its Helsinki commitments. That is why it is right that  we in the U.S. Senate speak out against Russia or speak out against  Turkey or speak out against any member state in the OSCE when it  violates these basic principles.   Over the July 4 work period, I was proud to participate in the  largest delegation we have ever had to the annual session of the OSCE  Parliamentary Assembly. The Parliamentary Assembly--facilitating  lawmaker-to-lawmaker interactions and discussions--was established to  complement the intergovernmental work being done. One of the OSCE's  strengths is that there is a parliamentary dimension. It is not just  government officials; it is also parliamentarians who meet to implement  these commitments to human rights and good governance.   The OSCE and its Parliamentary Assembly have been used to advance  U.S. interests, including their support for human rights, free  elections, combating anti-Semitism and human trafficking, and other  initiatives that have come from the U.S. Congress that have then served  as the foundation for U.S. positions and, ultimately, agreements that  have been adopted by all 57 states that have participated in the OSCE.   I remember discussions in the Congress that dealt with fighting  modern-day slavery and trafficking and fighting anti-Semitism. We  initiated them in the Congress. Through the Helsinki Commission, we  raised them in the Parliamentary Assembly. They then got raised in  Vienna, which is where the Ambassadors who represent all of the states  meet, and they were adopted as policy in all 57 states. We have had a  very positive impact.   During this recent Parliamentary Assembly, I hosted an event called  ``Countering Hate: Lessons from the Past, Leadership for the Future.''  As I stated during the event--and I will underscore now--we have  observed an uptick in hate-based instances across the OSCE region and  beyond--from Pittsburgh and Poway to Christ Church. When we fail to  act, we endanger not only the most vulnerable within our societies but  the very foundations of our democracies.   Given how much has been accomplished by the United States and others  through the OSCE over the past 30 years, it is deeply concerning to see  our own American President embrace a drawback of universal human rights  in our own country and embrace dictators around the world, who rule by  promulgating fear and hate.   President Trump has called Turkish President Erdogan a ``friend'' and  has shared love letters with the very brutal Kim Jong Un after calling  him ``very talented.'' Turkey, which has been a member of the OSCE  since its inception and a member of NATO, has witnessed a dramatic  acceleration in President Erdogan's efforts to consolidate power and  hobble his political opposition.   His unrelenting pressure on the judiciary and purges of its ranks of  judges and prosecutors have left respect for the rule of law and due  process in crisis. Tens of thousands have been detained in sweeping  dragnets following the failed coup, including independent voices from  virtually every sector of society--opposition politicians, civil  society activists, journalists, academics, and many more. These vast  purges have had a chilling effect on the free press and the freedom of  expression.   The Committee to Protect Journalists considers Turkey the world's  worst jailer of journalists, with 68 documented cases, although a local  Turkish press freedom organization lists more than 130 who have been  detained. Reporters Without Borders ranks Turkey as the 157th out of  180 countries for press freedom--its lowest ranking ever. Under  emergency powers assumed by President Erdogan after the coup attempt,  the Turkish Government closed around 200 media outlets.   As for North Korea, Kim Jong Un has one of the most deplorable human  rights records in the world.   According to Human Rights Watch:         Kim Jong Un--who serves as chairman of the States Affairs       Commission and head of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea--      continues to exercise almost total political control. The       government restricts all civil and political liberties,       including freedom of expression, assembly, association, and       religion. It also prohibits all organized political       opposition, independent media, civil society, and trade       unions.    President Trump has been repeatedly willing to take the word of  former KGB agent Vladimir Putin over his own intelligence services.   On March 3, 2018, in speaking about Chinese President Xi during a  private fundraising speech at Mar-a-Lago, he said:         Xi is a great gentleman. He's now president for life--      president for life. No, he's great. And look, he was able to       do that. I think it's great. Maybe we'll have to give that a       shot someday.   [[Page S4800]]     That is not who the President of the United States should be  embracing.   He has repeatedly praised Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines. This is  the same leader who independent press, civil society groups, foreign  governments, and international organizations have all confirmed is  engaged in the extrajudicial killing of his own citizens--work that  President Trump praised as doing an ``unbelievable job on the drug  problem.''   Mr. Duterte himself, as a former mayor, has admitted to murdering  people. That Mr. Trump would laud Mr. Duterte for his barbaric  atrocities is outrageous and is another indication that instead of  standing up for America's values, President Trump continues to endorse  leaders around the world who violate the very principles that America's  Founding Fathers enshrined in our Constitution.   I mention our Founding Fathers not in passing, but as we recently  celebrated our Independence Day on July 4, I quote from the Declaration  of Independence, which set our Nation on a path with the ideal that we  hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal;  that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights;  and that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.   So I was particularly troubled that within days of July 4, the Trump  administration, through Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, unveiled what  he referred to as a Commission on Unalienable Rights. In his  announcement, Secretary Pompeo called this new Commission ``one of the  most profound reexaminations of the unalienable rights in the world  since the 1948 Universal Declaration.''    I, along with many colleagues in the U.S. Congress, fear that this  Commission, whose purpose it is to advise the Secretary of State based  on the principles of natural law and natural rights, will undermine or  curtail State Department advocacy in critical human rights arenas,  including women's health as well as LGBT rights.   For 243 years, with all of her imperfections, America has been a  beacon for peoples around the world. Those who have embraced natural  law have not been welcoming. They peddle in hate and division. The ACLU  notes that references to ``natural law and natural rights'' are code  words often used to undermine the rights of women and the LGBT  community. This is just the latest in a string of attacks on women and  the LGBT community by this administration. If the President and the  Secretary of State want to build on protecting human rights, they will  work within the framework that the United States helped to establish,  not question the definition or universality of human rights.
