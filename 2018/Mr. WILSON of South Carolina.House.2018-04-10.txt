 Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, the Syrian  Assad dictatorship mercilessly used chemical weapons of mass  destruction on the last rebel-held stronghold near Syria's capital,  Damascus, murdering over 50 innocent people, including  [[Page H3085]]  women and children. This comes exactly 1 year after the chemical  weapons attack that resulted in President Donald Trump's launching of  Tomahawk cruise missiles at the air base that launched the chemical  weapons attack.   Assad's actions are a clear violation of international law and human  rights, and the world must stand against this indiscriminate massacre.   I am grateful for the leadership of President Donald Trump, United  Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, and National Security Advisor John  Bolton to address this threat to protect American families.   I stand with Ambassador Haley in calling for the United Nations to  adopt a resolution that would condemn the continuing use of chemical  weapons in Syria in the strongest terms and to establish a new body to  determine responsibility for chemical attacks anywhere in the world.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
