 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the  tremendous impact that the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will  have on my home State of Nevada.   Nevada was ground zero for the pandemic, and its effects were  especially felt by the travel and tourism industry, which employs tens  of thousands of Nevadans and brings in the bulk of the State's revenue  each year.   Now that President Biden has signed the Infrastructure Investment and  Jobs Act into law, our leading industries in Nevada and Nevada families  can take part in the economic opportunities and the thousands of jobs  that this bill promises.   Nevada is slated to receive $2.5 billion for highway investments like  the I-15 corridor between Las Vegas and LA, the I-11 corridor between  Las Vegas and Phoenix, and $459 million for public transportation.   This means that not only can Nevada families get to work and school  safely and more efficiently but that millions of our visitors each year  can more easily experience everything that our State has to offer.   Nevada will also get a minimum of $100 million to expand access to  broadband across the State, meaning that no Nevadan will be left  behind.   Nevada also has been ground zero for the effects of the climate  crisis as we continue to face the effects of severe drought.   With the passage of my water recycling infrastructure bill, included  in this, Nevada will now be more equipped to mitigate the effects of  climate change and ensure that our communities have continuous access  to safe, clean drinking water for years to come.   Nevada is only able to reap all of these benefits because Congress  was able to put politics aside and work together to come up with  sensible solutions to create a better future for our Nation. We cannot  stop there.   It is critical that we continue to work side by side to pass the  Build Back Better agenda and make sure that American families don't  just recover from this pandemic but that they prosper moving forward.                            ____________________
