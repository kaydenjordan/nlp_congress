 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.   Madam Speaker, I want to say to my colleague, Mr. Collins, that I  wish to associate myself with the sentiments that he expressed here  today. However, I also rise today to speak of how the tale of two Kings  has brought us to this moment in history.   If he had been allowed to live, today would have been the 90th  birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. Today, this august body stands  ready to vote to disapprove of Representative   Steve King's recent  comments and condemn the evil concepts of white nationalism and white  supremacy.   White supremacy and white nationalism are evils, they are insidious,  and are clear and present dangers to our great Republic. Reported hate  crimes rose 17 percent last year, which was the third consecutive year  that we have seen an increase in this insidiousness. This is appalling  and unacceptable.   When elected representatives give cover and comfort to those who  spread racial divisiveness, we embolden those on the fringes of our  society, and we have seen some of the results: the massacre of nine  parishioners in historic Charleston's Emanuel AME Church at the hands  of a young man who believed he would be, in his words, ``rescued by  white nationalists after they took over the government;'' the murder of  11 Jewish worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh by a  gunman who believed the Jews were, in his words, ``waging a propaganda  war against Western civilization.''   The other term used by Mr. King in his comments to the New York  Times; and we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia, at the white  nationalists' Unite the Right rally, where they chanted the Nazi  phrase, ``blood and soil.''                                time  1415    Some have questioned the timing of this resolution. Why now? they  ask.   My guidance, Madam Speaker, comes from Dr. King, who wrote in his  letter from the Birmingham jail: ``Time itself is neutral; it can be  used either destructively or constructively. More and more I feel,''  continued Dr. King, ``that the people of ill will have used time much  more effectively than have the people of good will.''   Then he closed his thought with these words: ``We must use time  creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do  right.''   Now is the time to do right. We have reached a tipping point. Racial  divisiveness is a fault line that is ripping our Nation apart. This  body must speak out against this evil. The time has come to condemn  those of ill will and say that no part in our great Nation can be had  by them.    Madam Speaker, when the French historian Alexis de  Tocqueville came to this country, he observed its greatness and set out  to find the genius that made it so. He wrote in his book ``Democracy in  America'' that: ``The greatness of America lies not in being more  enlightened than any other Nation, but rather in her ability to repair  her faults.''   White supremacy and white nationalism are faults that cannot be  repaired but must be removed.   White supremacy and white nationalism should be condemned by this  body, and I call upon my colleagues to join me in doing so.
