 Mr. Speaker, I was unable to cast my votes on November  20, 2019 for rollcall 632, rollcall 633, rollcall 634, rollcall 635,  and rollcall 636. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yes'' on  rollcall 632, ``yes'' on rollcall 633, ``yes'' on rollcall 634 (H.R.  737--Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act), ``yes'' on rollcall 635 (S.  1838--Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019), and ``yes'' on  rollcall 636 (S. 2710--To prohibit the commercial export of covered  munitions items to the Hong Kong Police Force). I am proud to support  the people of Hong Kong.                            ____________________
