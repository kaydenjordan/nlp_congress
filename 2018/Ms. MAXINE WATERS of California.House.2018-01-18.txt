 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 2954, the Home  Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act, which would undermine efforts to  monitor trends in mortgage lending, combat discriminatory and predatory  lending, and ensure that consumers who reside in low- and moderate- income communities have fair access to mortgage credit.   In 1975, Congress enacted the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, also  known as HMDA, in response to concerns that despite their  responsibility to provide adequate home financing to qualified  applicants on reasonable terms and conditions, some lenders' failure to  do so had contributed to a decline in housing conditions in communities  of color.   HMDA data provide the only comprehensive picture of the rates at  which American consumers' requests for mortgages are approved and  denied. As a result, it has many important uses.   HMDA data provide information on mortgage lending patterns and trends  that allow regulators, lenders, researchers, and the public to better  understand and address redlining concerns by identifying possible  discriminatory lending patterns, and monitoring compliance with and  enforcement of statutes, like the Community Reinvestment Act; and  Federal antidiscrimination laws, like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act  and the Fair Housing Act.   Local governments also use HMDA data to determine which financial  institutions are meeting the needs of their communities and should  receive important benefits funded by the taxpayers of those  communities.   For example, in Antioch, California, the local government uses HMDA  data when selecting banks for contracts and participation in local  programs.   HMDA data are also used by government officials to determine areas of  disinvestment that are in need of targeted assistance. Take Flint,  Michigan, for example. There, HMDA data has been used to target funds  to remediate blight.   Communities also use HMDA data to identify discriminatory lending  patterns and enforce antidiscrimination statutes. HMDA data, for  example, were used in Chicago to identify discrimination and lending  patterns in its neighborhoods, leading to a large discriminatory  lending settlement.   It was precisely because of HMDA data that Congress learned during  the run-up to the financial crisis that African Americans were  routinely steered into predatory subprime loans, even when they  qualified for prime mortgages, and they received these loans at higher  rates than White borrowers.   Following the financial crisis, Congress updated HMDA when it passed  the Dodd-Frank Act, directing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  to close information gaps about mortgage lending patterns and practices  that contributed to the 2007-2008 financial crisis, as well as other  data that could better identify discrimination.   Accordingly, in 2015, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  finalized a rule that required sufficient information to shed light on  predatory practices in the mortgage market, and it considered  compliance costs and burdens imposed on institutions that collect,  maintain, and report the data. Through this rule, the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau added and  [[Page H515]]  implemented additional data fields that must be reported in order to  further close information gaps about mortgage lending patterns and  practices.   The new data fields include basic loan facts, such as the address of  the property, interest rate of the mortgage, and the borrower's credit  score.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule only excluded truly  small lenders; banks that originate fewer than 25 closed-end loans,  like mortgages; and 100 open-end lines of credit, like home equity  lines, because providing broader relief would negatively affect low-  and moderate-income communities.   Specifically, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau wrote: ``The  loss of data in communities at closed-end mortgage loan volume  thresholds higher than 25 would substantially impede the public's and  public officials' ability to understand access to credit in their  communities.''   Despite the harm posed to low- and moderate-income communities around  the country, H.R. 2954 would permanently raise the threshold for new  HMDA data for both mortgage loan-type data and lines of credit to 500  without a good understanding about the real impact of doing so.   At this level, 85 percent or 5,400 depository institutions and 48  percent of nonbanks or 497 institutions would be exempt. That is 6,000  financial institutions that would no longer report important lending  data.   By prohibiting these important new data fields from being reported  under HMDA, regulators would not be able to fully determine the extent  of redlining, discrimination, and other harmful practices. This will  make it harder for fair lending violations to be detected, as HMDA data  are routinely used by the Department of Justice to identify and remedy  discrimination in lending.   These new data fields are essential for shedding light on the kinds  of discrimination, like age, that now flies under the radar. It is not  surprising that over 170 civil rights, fair housing, consumer and  community organizations across the country have come out strongly  against this bill. These groups have stated that: ``The updated HMDA  data will provide critical information about whether similarly situated  borrowers in underserved communities are receiving equitable access to  mortgage credit, data that we lacked a decade ago when the crisis  hit.''   Mr. Speaker, I recognize the need for Congress to consider tailored  and sensible regulatory relief to community financial institutions, but  this bill is not that relief.   Financial institutions are already required to collect this data as  part of existing mortgage regulations or as part of the mortgage  underwriting process.   Mr. Speaker, I cannot support H.R. 2954 because it undermines  effective fair lending enforcement by reducing HMDA data. This bill  will contribute to unequal access to affordable credit for people of  color, low- to moderate-income families, and borrowers in rural areas.   History has repeatedly shown us that when financial institutions are  merely trusted to operate in good faith, American consumers are left  vulnerable to discriminatory and predatory lending, communities are  stripped of wealth, and our economy is weakened.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject this  rollback of a key fair lending tool and to join me in opposing H.R.  2954.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from  Minnesota who described his district, he failed to mention that the  China-Asia Economic Development Association and the Jewish Community  Action group all oppose this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Crist), a member of the Committee on Financial Services.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Ellison for  the time he has spent with us today opposing this legislation. His  history is such that everyone understands that he represents the least  of these, that he represents working people, that he represents poor  people. Whenever there is an opportunity to speak up for them, he  always does.   Mr. Speaker, I think we need to remember what this is all about, so  let me state the facts.   HMDA data allows us to monitor mortgage lending patterns to identify  underserved communities and populations to combat discriminatory  lending.   HMDA data was used to determine when many of us suspected during the  subprime bubble that persons of color, particularly African Americans,  received predatory subprime loans at higher rates than White borrowers.  They received these loans even when they qualified for prime mortgages.   The Department of Justice and the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau have used HMDA data to bring fair lending cases against banks  for redlining, steering, and other violations of the Fair Housing Act.   It might be true that H.R. 2954 could provide relief to some  financial institutions by exempting lenders from the updated HMDA  reporting requirements. What is true is that the bill would likely also  have far-reaching adverse consequences for consumers, particularly  those in low-income census tracts and rural areas.   Equally disconcerting is that the reduced HMDA data could stop  regulators' ability to identify and stop any emerging predatory or  discriminatory practices faced by those consumers.   Borrowers who take out home equity lines of credit, the HELOCs, are  at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure when property values  decline. In fact, the expansion of HELOCs in the mid-2000s contributed  to the foreclosure crisis that many communities experienced in the last  2000s.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau noted that:         Had open-end line of credit data like HELOCs been reported       in HMDA, the public officials could have had a much earlier       warning and a better understanding of potential risk, and       public and private mortgage relief programs could have better       assisted distressed borrowers in the aftermath of the crisis.   [[Page H520]]     While I am a longtime advocate for community banks, this bill does  not reduce burdens. All of the HMDA data points being discussed today  will continue to be collected by banks because they need this data to  originate mortgages for their customers.   I also understand that personal banking does not mean that  discriminatory lending does not occur in smaller-sized institutions. In  fact, the Obama administration's Department of Justice sued a community  bank located in Chaska, Minnesota, with assets of $1.9 billion.   Mr. Speaker, you have heard the arguments. We are on the side of the  people. I don't know who they represent over there. I simply ask for a  ``no'' vote.
