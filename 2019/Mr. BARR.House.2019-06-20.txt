 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss my amendment to H.R.  2740, the Defense appropriations bill.   With the cosponsorship of my fellow Kentuckian, Congressman Guthrie,  my amendment increases Army, Army Reserve, and Army National Guard  operations and maintenance by $2 million each for training support.  This funding will support the training of National Guard and Reserve  components by the Army in order to improve readiness.   General Lengyel of the National Guard Bureau, earlier this year  before the Appropriations Committee, said: ``There is only one standard  of readiness in fighting America's wars. This readiness requires the  National Guard to be deployable, sustainable, and interoperable with  our Active components.''   As the representative for Kentucky's National Guard headquarters, it  is essential we support training and coordination between the  components of our Armed Forces.   I was proud to advocate for this important increased funding, which  will allow Active-Duty Army personnel to more frequently advise,  assist, and train with Guard and Reserve units on drill weekends to  ensure both are meeting the same level of readiness.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for adopting this amendment.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, on rollcall no. 377, I mistakenly voted ``no''  when I intended to vote ``yes''.              Amendment No. 128 Offered by Ms. Wasserman Schultz
