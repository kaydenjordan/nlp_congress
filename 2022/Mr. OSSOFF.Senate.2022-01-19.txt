 Mr. President, Abraham Lincoln must be turning in his  grave to hear the Senators from the Grand Old Party--the party of  abolition and emancipation and reconstruction--echoing the State's  rights rhetoric of Dixiecrat segregationists to oppose Federal voting  rights legislation, to oppose even the reauthorization of the Voting  Rights Act--the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   In 2021, just one Republican Senator had the courage and principle to  vote to restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965--the Senator from Alaska,  Ms. Murkowski--just one.   For decades, the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act was  bipartisan. Today, only one Republican Senator will stand up for this  landmark achievement of the civil rights movement--not Senator Cornyn  of Texas, who previously said, ``the Voting Rights Act is simply the  most important and most effective civil rights legislation ever passed,  bar none''--no longer his position--not my friend the Senator from  Maine, Ms. Collins, who previously said, ``This bill will ensure that  the voting rights afforded to all Americans are protected''; not  Senator Burr of North Carolina, who previously said, ``Voting rights  for all American citizens regardless of race [are] granted by the 15th  Amendment and enforced by the Voting Rights Act''; and not the minority  leader, who previously said, ``This is a good piece of legislation  which has served an important purpose over many years. . . . And this  landmark piece of legislation will continue to make a difference not  only in the South but for all [Americans] and for all of us, whether we  are African-Americans or not''; not the minority leader, the same  minority leader, who said, ``This bill eliminated the barriers to  voting so that all Americans could participate in the basic opportunity  each of us have,'' who celebrated, ``We have . . . renewed the Voting  Rights Act periodically since that time, overwhelmingly, and on a  bipartisan basis, year after year . . . because members of Congress  realize [that] this is a piece of legislation [that] has worked''--no  more, not in 2022. Only one Republican Senator stood up to support the  Voting Rights Act of 1965.   When Congressman John Lewis and Hosea Williams and Amelia Boynton and  hundreds of others marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody  Sunday, when John Lewis had his skull fractured on that bridge for  daring to demand the right to vote for Black Americans in the American  South, it was the example of their courage and their sacrifice that  paved the way for passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   As my colleague, my brother, Senator Reverend Warnock has often  observed, when Congressman Lewis passed, there were many in this  Chamber on both sides who rightly celebrated his towering achievements  and his legacy. But I speak for the State of Georgia when I say: Do not  invoke Congressman Lewis' name to signal your virtue while you work to  erode his legacy and defy his will.   I have heard a lot from our Republican colleagues about the recently  passed election law in the State of Georgia. Let's be very clear. There  is no one in Georgia on either side of the aisle who doubts or does not  understand precisely what its purpose is.     Forbidding voter registration for run-off elections,  driving down the early vote period during divisive runoffs to drive up  lines at majority Black precincts.   As he used to say, John Lewis didn't give a little blood on that  bridge that day so that Black Georgians would have to wait eight times  longer to vote than White Georgians. John Lewis didn't give a little  bit of blood on that bridge that day so that State legislatures across  this country could pass legislation surgically targeted to make it  harder for some people to vote, all for partisan power.   In the State of Georgia, where now partisan election officials can  step in and throw out locally elected election boards to change who can  vote and where they can vote--this, in the aftermath of a well-known  incident when the former President of the United States threatened  Georgia's secretary of state with criminal prosecution if he didn't  ``find 11,000 votes'' that were never cast for Donald Trump.   The facts of the former President's efforts to seize reelection,  despite his defeat, are well-known. He and his lieutenants mounted an  unprecedented campaign to retain power based on a torrent of lies that  have grievously wounded public confidence in our elections. And it was  only thanks to the integrity of our laws and our courts and principled  election officials and the will of Congress, the will of this Senate,  to ensure the peaceful transition of power in the face of a violent  assault on the U.S. Capitol that this conspiracy was defeated.   So now, this faction seeks to dismantle precisely those bulwarks  which prevented their onslaught from succeeding. The choice is ours  whether we will allow them to do so.   We in the U.S. Congress, Madam Vice President, have the  constitutional authority to make the laws with respect to the  administration of Federal elections.   We in the U.S. Senate have an obligation to defend the legacy of  Congressman John Lewis, to stand up for the sacred franchise, to secure  equal access to the ballot for every single American voter so that this  country can continue its journey toward full realization of our  founding ideals.   I yield the floor.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Georgia.    Mr. President, briefly, in responding to the comments  from Senator Collins from Maine--a Senator for whom I have great  respect and whose reputation for bipartisanship, for substance, and for  a thoughtful statespersonlike and patriotic approach to legislation  precedes her--what I was referring to, Senator Collins, was the  legislation that the Senate took up earlier this year, which, in  response to the Supreme Court's invitation to Congress after the Shelby  County v. Holder decision, would have updated the preclearance formulas  that govern section 4 and section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965  such that the Department of Justice could continue to carry out its  vital work of preclearing changes to voting procedures in States and  jurisdictions that exhibit a history or a pattern of voter suppression.   That is an obligation that I believe this Congress has. The Supreme  Court, in fact, invited us to carry out that obligation, and the  Committee on the Judiciary, under Senator Durbin's leadership,  carefully crafted legislation that we believed responded to the Supreme  Court's invitation to do just that.   Respectfully, Senator Collins, in representing the State of Georgia,  where, as I mentioned earlier, we faced a wave of bills and now law,  which everybody in my State knows are intended deliberately and to  disproportionately impact certain communities--laws that prior to the  Shelby County decision would have been subjected to Department of  Justice preclearance--I believe more strongly than ever that  preclearance is necessary.   What I was respectfully noting, Senator Collins, without any  implications with respect to your motives or integrity, was what I  believed to be an inconsistency, an inconsistency between voting  consistently to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and lauding  it as a signature civil rights achievement, but then voting not even to  allow debate in this body on the legislation that was created to  respond to the Supreme Court's invitation to uphold its preclearance  provision.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.  [[Page S343]]         Mr. President, I know we have other business to attend to  and an important debate on a procedure that is ongoing, but I want to  note, with respect to my colleague from Maine, that section 2 of the  Voting Rights Act is not the entirety of the Voting Rights Act.   Section 4 and section 5, which provide for the preclearance of  changes to voting laws in jurisdictions with a history or a pattern of  voter suppression, are vital precisely because the post-facto  litigation that the DOJ must embark upon to challenge State policies,  once they have already been enacted, can be far too time-consuming to  allow for a remedy to emerge in the courts. This is precisely why  section 4 and section 5 were enacted at the time--to give the  Department of Justice the power it needs to preclear these changes in  places with a history of segregation and voter suppression. In my  State, despite all of the protestations to the contrary, we are, right  now, witnessing a significant wave of voter suppression policies.   The Department of Justice should have the authority to preclear those  changes to law to ensure they don't disproportionately impact minority  communities.   So section 2 of the Voting Rights Act is important, but if section 4  and section 5 were also vital when we voted to reauthorize them in  2006, why aren't they vital today?   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine.
