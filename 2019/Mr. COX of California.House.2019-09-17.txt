 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  life of Anthony Martinez, Sr., a true leader in Delano, California, and  the  [[Page H7747]]  Central Valley, who dedicated his life to helping others.   Tony was born in Santa Paula, California, and grew up in Hanford,  where he graduated from high school, and then went on to pursue higher  education at Bakersfield College, San Jose State, and Porterville  College.   A selfless leader, Tony proudly served in the California National  Guard and the United States Air Force.   Among his many jobs in life, Tony managed a Thrifty Drug Store, but  then, with the support of his wife, Pat, accomplished a lifelong dream  by opening the renowned Tony's Pizza in Delano and also founded the  Anthony Martinez Farmers Insurance Agency.   During his impressive 40-year business career, Tony volunteered  countless hours to his community and served in elected roles as both a  city council member and as mayor.   Tony passed away on June 20, 2019, but he leaves behind a legacy that  will live on.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring the life  of Anthony ``Tony'' Martinez. May he rest in peace, and may we always  remember his dedication to Delano, the Central Valley, and our great  Nation.                            ____________________
