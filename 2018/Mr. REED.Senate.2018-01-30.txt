 Today, I am introducing the Control Your Personal Credit  Information Act, which seeks to give consumers greater control over  when and how their consumer reports are shared by consumer reporting  agencies.   Under existing law, the current consumer reporting system is  backwards. Consumer reporting agencies collect vast amounts of personal  information on consumers, often without our knowledge, in order to  compile consumer reports. These reports are then shared with financial  institutions and others without our consent in all cases.   In the wake of Equifax's failure to secure troves of valuable  personally identifiable information it collected on over 145 million  Americans, it is clear that this system must change. Indeed, the  National Consumer Law Center's  [[Page S583]]  Chi Chi Wu stated in her October 2017 testimony before the House  Financial Services Committee that the Equifax breach ``means half of  the US population and nearly three-quarters of the consumers with  active credit reports are now at risk of identity theft due to one of  the worst--if not the worst--breaches of consumer data in American  history. These Americans are at risk of having false new credit  accounts, phony tax returns, and even spurious medical bills incurred  in their good names.'' To make matters worse, the risks of identity  fraud may not dissipate over time because as Ed Mierzwinski, U.S.  PIRG's Federal Consumer Program Director, points out ``unlike credit  card numbers, your Social Security umber and Date of Birth don't change  and may even grow more valuable over time, like gold in a bank vault.  Much worse, they are the keys to `new account identity theft.'''   My legislation attempts to address these concerns and fix the current  upside down system by giving consumers greater control, at no cost to  the consumer, over when and how their consumer reports are released  when applying for new credit, a loan, or insurance. Under my  legislation, consumer reporting agencies must confirm a consumer's  identity and obtain their written authorization before releasing  consumer reports in the instances that are especially vulnerable to  identity theft and fraud. In addition, my bill requires every consumer  reporting agency to take appropriate steps to prevent unauthorized  access to the consumer reports and personal information they maintain.  These steps are designed to make it tougher for criminals to  fraudulently open new credit or insurance accounts in other people's  names.   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this commonsense legislative  effort, and I thank the National Consumer Law Center (on behalf of its  low-income clients), U.S. PIRG, Americans for Financial Reform, Public  Citizen, Consumer Federation of America, and Consumers Union for their  support.                                  ______                                         By Mr. BOOZMAN (for himself, Mr. Booker, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr.          Inhofe):   S. 2364. A bill to amend the Water Infrastructure Finance and  Innovation Act of 2014 to provide to State infrastructure financing  authorities additional opportunities to receive loans under that Act to  support drinking water and clean water State revolving funds to deliver  water infrastructure to communities across the United States, and for  other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.
