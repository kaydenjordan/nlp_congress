 Madam Speaker, I rise today as a staunch  defender of the rights of the unborn, as a defender of the idea that  human life begins at conception. But these ideals are being threatened  today like never before.   This week, I join my fellow Republicans in speaking out in support of  the Hyde amendment and other pro-life provisions stripped from  appropriations bills by the Democratic majority.   The Hyde amendment is and has been a bipartisan provision included in  every Federal spending measure for the past four decades. It has  ensured that the lives of the unborn are protected and that no Federal  tax dollars are used to fund abortions.   Very simply, the Hyde amendment saves lives.   I am committed to ending the blight of abortion on our Nation and to  stand with all I have to fight to protect the rights and the lives of  the unborn.   My Democratic colleagues are great at changing terms and changing  names. By definition, healthcare protects and improves lives, yet  Democrats changed ``healthcare'' to include abortion. But abortion does  not improve or defend life; it takes life. It is not healthcare.   For this reason, Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committees on Energy and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be  discharged from further consideration of H.R. 18, and I ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.
