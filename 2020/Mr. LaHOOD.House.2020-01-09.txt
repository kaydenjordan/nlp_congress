 Madam Speaker, today, on National Law Enforcement  Appreciation Day, I rise to recognize the brave men and women who work  to keep our communities safe across central and west central Illinois.   From Peoria to Springfield, Jacksonville to Quincy, Macomb to  Beardstown, law enforcement officers in Illinois' 18th Congressional  District are the hidden heroes of our State. Each day, Illinois police  officers, deputies, and State troopers leave their families with no  certainty they will return home safely; yet they are willing to face  these risks to keep our families, our children, and our schools safe.   I am grateful for the courageous men and women who button up the  uniform each day and thank them for protecting our families with  bravery and pride.   Madam Speaker, while we set aside today to recognize law enforcement,  may we remember, each and every day throughout the year, the courage  and sacrifice of these men and women.                            ____________________
