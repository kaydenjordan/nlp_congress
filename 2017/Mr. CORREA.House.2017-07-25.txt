 Mr. Speaker, on Friday we are voting on a crucial funding  program for armed services. Yet somehow it also includes $1.6 billion  to begin funding the construction of an unnecessary border wall.  Without discussion, the funding for the border wall was added.   This wall won't make us safer, and it won't stop drug smugglers, and  it will not keep out the bad hombres.   If we are serious about protecting our borders, then let's invest the  $1.6 billion in programs that have a proven record of success. Let's  invest in drug detection canine teams. Let's rebuild our Coast Guard.  And let's strengthen our partnership with Canadian and Mexican law  enforcement.   These are the proven methods that will keep America safe.                            ____________________
