 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Scott and his staff  for their work on this issue.   I rise today on behalf of the thousands of working families in my  district who are struggling under the burden of seemingly endless  student loan debt.  [[Page H6722]]    A college credential continues to be the surest path to economic  security, and we must help to make sure that every student, regardless  of their background or their ZIP Code, has the resources necessary to  achieve their dreams through education.   That means setting our students up for success, not confining them to  a lifetime of making payments that barely cover the interest on their  loans.   The American people who stand to be harmed by this bill are more than  just numbers. They are not just statistics. These are real live human  beings with real life experiences.   I would remind my colleague, Mrs. McClain of Michigan, that in her  district, there are at least 9,900 borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan,  which will significantly lower their monthly payments.   If Republicans succeed and this bill undoes the income-driven  repayment plan, more than 5 million student loan borrowers enrolled in  the plan will see their monthly payments go up.   These are real people. They are nurses. They are engineers. They are  teachers with families and mortgages and groceries that they need to  buy who are going to lose the opportunity to pay off their loans in a  way that really fits their budgets.   The American people are tired of these empty and broken promises.  They are tired of being asked to give more and more of themselves while  it gets increasingly expensive to acquire the skills necessary just to  make a decent living.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to oppose this bill.
