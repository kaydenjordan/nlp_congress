 Mr. President, earlier today, our 41st President  George Herbert Walker Bush departed the Capitol Rotunda and was  memorialized at the National Cathedral. Now his remains are on the way  back to Houston for a funeral service at St. Martin's Episcopal Church  before he is laid to  [[Page S7300]]  rest right next to Barbara, his loving wife and partner of 73 years,  and their daughter, Robin.   It has been reported that, some years ago, as the Bush family  discussed funeral plans and the subject of lying in state came up, the  former President joked in a self-deprecating way: ``Do you think anyone  will come?''   Well, Mr. President, they sure did. Dignitaries, world leaders, and  thousands of Americans from all walks of life waited for hours and  streamed through this Capitol to pray for and pay tribute to the life  and legacy of George Bush. I might add, in addition to that, on the way  up to the National Cathedral, there were citizens on both sides of the  road, all along the way, with their iPhones, taking photographs of this  great American.   Today, at President's Trump's direction, the country is observing a  national day of mourning. I know this body continues to stand with all  Americans in appreciation for his inspiring example and in solidarity  with the Bush family.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a completely different matter, the  Senate is resuming our work this afternoon. Later today, we will vote  to advance the nomination of Bernard McNamee, the President's choice to  serve on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.   This is an impressive nominee who has the right qualifications for  this important job. In his career as a well-regarded lawyer on energy  issues, he has represented clients and gained expertise all across the  energy sector. He has helped clients build solar projects and natural  gas facilities and get renewable energy standards approved. In his own  words, he said: ``I have not just talked about fuel diversity and `all  of the above' energy policies; I have worked to help make them a  reality.''   Mr. McNamee has worked as an energy policy expert at the Department  of Energy, as well as right here in the Senate. FERC plays a pivotal  role in ensuring our energy security and enabling prosperity. Among  other responsibilities, the Commission is responsible for permitting  important infrastructure investments such as pipelines and export  terminals. Continuing with a deadlocked and understaffed Commission  could threaten the status of these investments and the jobs that  revolve around them. Therefore, we need to confirm Mr. McNamee  promptly.   His obvious qualifications and his commitment to fairness and  impartiality earned him a bipartisan vote out of the Energy and Natural  Resources Committee last month with a favorable recommendation. I hope  the same common sense will prevail today so we can move this nominee  forward with the bipartisan vote he well deserves.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
