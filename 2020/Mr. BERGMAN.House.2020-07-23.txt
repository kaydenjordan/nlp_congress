 Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all veterans living rurally  and remotely, I rise in support of my amendment included in this en  bloc package.   The amendment focuses additional efforts within the Veterans Health  Administration Office of Rural Health on solutions that will bring more  connectivity to veterans living in rural and remote areas.   My district features not just rural but remote communities where many  veterans are unable to access high-speed broadband. The coronavirus has  only further highlighted this digital divide.   The VA and Congress proactively responded to the pandemic with  increased telehealth resources for veterans. This is a crucial and  critical step, but what good is it for the veterans who don't have  access to broadband in the first place?   We need to keep our Nation's promises to all veterans, including  those living in rural and remote communities.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
