 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration and  commemoration of the life of Peter Huizenga from Oak Brook, Illinois,  who passed away last Wednesday at the age of 79.   A businessman, entrepreneur, and philanthropist, Peter Huizenga is  best known for building Waste Management, Inc., into the largest waste  disposal company in the world with his cousin Wayne. Upon immigrating  to the United States in the 1800s, his Dutch ancestors saw a need for  sanitation services in their community west of Chicago. Their humble  family garbage collection business would become a Fortune 500 company  under Peter's management, employing 75,000 workers worldwide. However,  Peter once said: My goal is not to make money but to make a better  world.   Following the sale of the company, Peter devoted his life to  philanthropic work in the community through organizations such as Big  Shoulders Fund; his alma mater, Timothy Christian School; and many  more. His family was always his first priority, and he will be greatly  missed by his wife, Heidi; his 4 children; and his 10 grandchildren.  All of Illinois will miss him.                            ____________________
