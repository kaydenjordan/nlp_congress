 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last month, I received a message that  reminded me of just how important the work we do here is for people and  families in Michigan and all across the country.   Diane of Bloomfield Hills wrote to me about the cost of her  prescription medicine. Diane is diabetic and she takes two types of  insulin or four injections per day. Diane is retired. She is on  Medicare, with a supplemental policy for prescriptions.   Diane told me that usually, when she goes to the pharmacy, she owes a  copay of $650, and sometimes more, for a 3-month supply of just one of  her prescriptions.   But the good news is, not anymore.   Thanks to a unified Democratic majority last year, people on Medicare  now have the cost of their insulin capped at $35 a month--$35 a month  for anyone who is on Medicare.   Last month, Diane went to the pharmacy like usual. The pharmacist  told her that her 3-month supply would now be $105 instead  of $650.   She says:         I paid and walked away with a big smile.    She added this:         I know that for many seniors, the cost of insulin has been       difficult, or impossible, to afford if they have a limited       income or live on the margins.        Thank you for your support of this important legislation       helping seniors (and others) by reducing the cost of insulin.    Mr. President, this $35 cap per month on insulin is helping millions  of people on Medicare breathe a little easier, and I know because of  your strong ``yes'' vote, as well as mine, this is the reason we get up  every day, to be able to help people, to be able to reduce costs, to be  able to make sure that they can enjoy their life and actually have a  life--save their life. Insulin is a serious medication.   And so this was a really important accomplishment that we came  together on.   It was disappointing we didn't have one Republican colleague join us  in the House or the Senate, but we stood together and were able to get  that done.   Unfortunately, people who need insulin and aren't on Medicare are  still paying outrageous prices for a medication their lives literally  depend on.   We tried to cap insulin costs per month for everyone, for children.  We know for children with juvenile diabetes, this is incredibly  serious. We have families who come here to DC every year. We have a  wonderful group from Michigan who comes every year to share their  stories; the children sharing their stories, showing us pictures,  talking about what it is for them to manage this every day; their  families talking about the cost. And we tried to cap their costs at $35  a month as well.   But, unfortunately, because of budget rules, the Republicans were  able to force that to be a 60-vote margin, and they blocked it.  Shockingly to me, they blocked it. So they blocked a $35 insulin cap  for children.   Why?   Unfortunately, to protect pharma profits. I am going to repeat that.  Democrats tried to ensure that families wouldn't have to spend more  than $35 a month on insulin that keeps their children alive.  Republicans blocked it.   It was just one more gift to an industry that has received quite a  few gifts in recent years from Republicans.   First, let me start with the fact that from 2010 to 2019, American  taxpayers contributed more than $230 billion in research funding that  helped drug companies develop new medications. I support that. I  support public-private partnerships. I support public financing of  research. We want that. We want new medications.   But then you turn around and you look at between 2016 and 2020, drug  companies spent $577 billion on stock buybacks, 10 times more than they  spent on research--10 times more than they spent on research.   And they also significantly increased executive compensation. Now,  drug companies CEOs can definitely afford insulin for their children.  We want it for all the children of America.   After the Trump tax giveaway, some giant, profitable drug companies  now have an effective tax rate of under 10 percent. Republicans lowered  it for all corporations to 21, but some of the big drug companies got  even a bigger gift--below 10 percent for an effective tax rate. That is  less than the tax rate a typical postal worker or a typical preschool  teacher pays.   And between 2000 and 2018, big pharmaceutical companies raked in $8.6  trillion in gross profit--trillion with ``t''--trillion dollars in  profits.   Here is the CliffsNotes version: Pharmaceutical companies employed  1,587 lobbyists last year, almost 16 for every Senator--almost 16 drug  company lobbyists for every 1 Senator.   Then, Republicans provide huge tax cuts for them and block  legislation that would help families afford medication that keeps their  children alive.   It is clear whose side they are on--the wrong side, in my opinion.   Diane is lucky. She is on Medicare and can afford a $35-per-month  copay for insulin. A lot of Michigan families aren't so lucky.   Consider the Lockwoods. Three children in the Lockwood family have  type 1 diabetes and take insulin--three children.   A change to their insurance coverage meant that the family went from  paying no copay to paying $600 a month in a copay for insulin for each  child--$1,800 a month in a copay for their three children.  [[Page S220]]    They couldn't afford it so they began driving to Canada--not that far  from Michigan--driving across the bridge to Canada, where the same  medication costs $71 because the Canadian Government negotiates the  best price for Canadians.   Then the pandemic closed the border. Jim Lockwood needed to find a  job with better health insurance, and he did--in Ohio.   American parents shouldn't be forced to either drive to Canada in  order to pay for their children's prescriptions or they shouldn't be  forced to uproot their families and move to another State in order to  find a job with good insurance so they can afford their children's  medicine.   It is time for Republicans to stop working on behalf of their wealthy  buddies and join us in working on behalf of American families.   Children with diabetes, people under age 65 need a $35-per-month cap  on their insulin, just like we have been able to do as Democrats coming  together for seniors, people on Medicare.   I think that is what we should be focused on here together and invite  our Republican colleagues to join us.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
