 Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the distinguished  leader of this debate, Mr. Butterfield, and his service to this Nation.   Madam Speaker, this is a somber, sacred moment in our lives on this  floor. I stand here in the name of the blood shed by those foot  soldiers, Dr. Martin Luther King and John Robert Lewis, who shed his  blood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge.   My friends who vote ``no'' today will disregard and ignore that  bloodshed. I refuse to ignore the blood that was shed for the right to  vote.   As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, this committee built  over the course of 13 hearings in two Congresses led by Jerry Nadler  and   Steve Cohen the record for the John Robert Lewis bill, and for  that I am grateful, for I stand as a victim of the lack of  preclearance.   The bills that we have will eliminate a legislature, as a Texas bill  states, to overturn duly voters' choice. It will prevent the purging of  voters which happens all the time. It will protect you at the polls,  Madam Speaker, and it will disallow people from interfering with your  vote. It is now a sacred honor and charge. We must vote now in the name  of Martin King and John Robert Lewis. We cannot do any less. The Senate  must do its job.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on the Judiciary,  on Homeland Security, and on the Budget, and the Congressional Black  Caucus, I am pleased to co-anchor this Congressional Black Caucus  Special Order with my colleague, the distinguished gentleman from New  York, Congressman Ritchie Torres.   I thank the Chair of the CBC, Congresswoman Beatty of Ohio, for  organizing this Special Order to discuss the reasons why the CBC strong  supports H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which  for nearly 50 years protected the most precious of all rights of a  citizen in a democracy--the right to vote--until it was seriously  undermined by the right-wing conservative majority of the United States  Supreme Court, starting with the outrageously wrong decision in Shelby  County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), and exacerbated by Brnovich v.  DNC, 594 U.S. __, No. 19-1257 and 19-1258 (July 1, 2021).   Over the next hour, several of our colleagues will share their  perspectives on why it is essential that it is urgent and essential to  correct these miscarriages of justice by passing H.R. 4, H.R. 4, the  John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.  [[Page H167]]    Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and an  original cosponsor, let me say plainly at the outset that H.R. 4, the  John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, corrects the damage done in  recent years to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and commits the national  government to protecting the right of all Americans to vote free from  discrimination and without injustices that previously prevented them  from exercising this most fundamental right of citizenship.   I thank my CBC colleague, Congresswoman Terri Sewell of Alabama for  introducing this legislation, to Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Nadler, and  the Democratic leadership, and to the many colleagues and countless  number of ordinary Americans who never stopped agitating and working to  protect the precious right to vote.   Madam Speaker, in response to the Supreme Court's invitation in  Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), H.R. 4 provides a new  coverage formula based on ``current conditions'' and creates a new  coverage formula that hinges on a finding of repeated voting rights  violations in the preceding 25 years.   It is significant that this 25-year period is measured on a rolling  basis to keep up with ``current conditions,'' so only states and  political subdivisions that have a recent record of racial  discrimination in voting are covered.   States and political subdivisions that qualify for preclearance will  be covered for a period of 10 years, but if they have a clean record  during that time period, they can be extracted from coverage.   H.R. 4 also establishes ``practice-based preclearance,'' which would  focus administrative or judicial review narrowly on suspect practices  that are most likely to be tainted by discriminatory intent or to have  discriminatory effects, as demonstrated by a broad historical record.   Under the bill, this process of reviewing changes in voting is  limited to a set of specific practices, including such things as:   1. Changes to the methods of elections (to or from at-large  elections) in areas that are racially, ethnically, or linguistically  diverse.   2. Redistricting in areas that are racially, ethnically, or  linguistically diverse.   3. Reducing, consolidating, or relocating polling in areas that are  racially, ethnically, or linguistically diverse; and   4. Changes in documentation or requirements to vote or to register.   It is useful, Madam Speaker, to recount how we arrived at this day.   Madam Speaker, fifty-six years ago, in Selma, Alabama, hundreds of  heroic souls risked their lives for freedom and to secure the right to  vote for all Americans by their participation in marches for voting  rights on ``Bloody Sunday,'' ``Turnaround Tuesday,'' or the final,  completed march from Selma to Montgomery.   Those ``foot soldiers'' of Selma, brave and determined men and women,  boys and girls, persons of all races and creeds, loved their country so  much that they were willing to risk their lives to make it better, to  bring it even closer to its founding ideals.   The foot soldiers marched because they believed that all persons have  dignity and the right to equal treatment under the law, and in the  making of the laws, which is the fundamental essence of the right to  vote.   On that day, Sunday, March 7, 1965, more than 600 civil rights  demonstrators, including our beloved colleague, Congressman John Lewis  of Georgia for whom this important legislation is named, were brutally  attacked by state and local police at the Edmund Pettus Bridge as they  marched from Selma to Montgomery in support of the right to vote.   ``Bloody Sunday'' was a defining moment in American history because  it crystallized for the nation the necessity of enacting a strong and  effective federal law to protect the right to vote of every American.   No one who witnessed the violence and brutally suffered by the foot  soldiers for justice who gathered at the Edmund Pettus Bridge will ever  forget it; the images are deeply seared in the American memory and  experience.   On August 6, 1965, in the Rotunda of the Capitol President Johnson  addressed the nation before signing the Voting Rights Act:   ``The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for  breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which  imprison men because they are different from other men.''   The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was critical to preventing brazen voter  discrimination violations that historically left millions of African  Americans disenfranchised.   In 1940, for example, there were less than 30,000 African Americans  registered to vote in Texas and only about 3 percent of African  Americans living in the South were registered to vote.   Poll taxes, literacy tests, and threats of violence were the major  causes of these racially discriminatory results.   After passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, which prohibited  these discriminatory practices, registration and electoral  participation steadily increased to the point that by 2012, more than  1.2 million African Americans living in Texas were registered to vote.   In 1964, the year before the Voting Rights Act became law, there were  approximately 300 African-Americans in public office, including just  three in Congress.   Few, if any, African Americans held elective office anywhere in the  South.   Because of the Voting Rights Act, in 2007 there were more than 9,100  black elected officials, including 46 members of Congress, the largest  number ever.   Madam Speaker, the Voting Rights Act opened the political process for  many of the approximately 6,000 Hispanic public officials that have  been elected and appointed nationwide, including more than 275 at the  state or federal level, 32 of whom serve in Congress.   Native Americans, Asians, and others who have historically  encountered harsh barriers to full political participation also have  benefited greatly.   The crown jewel of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is Section 5, which  requires that states and localities with a chronic record of  discrimination in voting practices secure federal approval before  making any changes to voting processes.   The preclearance requirement of Section 5 protects minority voting  rights where voter discrimination has historically been the worst.   Between 1982 and 2006, Section 5 stopped more than 1,000  discriminatory voting changes in their tracks, including 107  discriminatory changes right here in Texas.   Passed in 1965 with the extraordinary leadership of President Lyndon  Johnson, the greatest legislative genius of our lifetime, the Voting  Rights Act of 1965 was bringing dramatic change in many states across  the South.   But in 1972, change was not coming fast enough or in many places in  Texas.   In fact, Texas, which had never elected a woman to Congress or an  African American to the Texas State Senate, was not covered by Section  5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and the language minorities living in  South Texas were not protected at all.   But thanks to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Barbara Jordan was  elected to Congress, giving meaning to the promise of the Voting Rights  Act that all citizens would at long last have the right to cast a vote  for person of their community, from their community, for their  community.   Madam Speaker, it is a source of eternal pride to all of us in  Houston that in pursuit of extending the full measure of citizenship to  all Americans, in 1975 Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, who also  represented this historic 18th Congressional District of Texas,  introduced, and the Congress adopted, what are now Sections 4(f)(3) and  4(f)(4) of the Voting Rights Act, which extended the protections of  Section 4(a) and Section 5 to language minorities.   We must remain ever vigilant and oppose all schemes that will abridge  or dilute the precious right to vote.   Madam Speaker, I am here today to remind the nation that need to pass  this legislation is urgent because the right to vote--that ``powerful  instrument that can break down the walls of injustice''--faces grave  threats.   The threat stems from the decision issued in June 2013 by the Supreme  Court in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which  invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, and paralyzed the application of  the VRA's Section 5 preclearance requirements.   Not to be content with the monument to disgrace that is the Shelby  County decision, the activist right-wing conservative majority on the  Roberts Court, on July 1, 2021, issued its evil twin, the decision in  Brnovich v. DNC, 594 U.S.__, No. 19-1257 and 19-1258 (July 1, 2021),  which engrafts on Section 2 of the Voting Rights onerous burdens that  Congress never intended and explicitly legislated against   Madam Speaker, were it not for the 24th Amendment, I venture to say  that this conservative majority on the Court would subject poll taxes  and literacy tests to the review standard enunciated in Brnovich v.  DNC.   According to the Supreme Court majority, the reason for striking down  Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act was that ``times change.''   Now, the Court was right; times have changed.   But what the Court did not fully appreciate is that the positive  changes it cited are due almost entirely to the existence and vigorous  enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.   And that is why the Voting Rights Act is still needed and that is why  we must pass H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   Let me put it this way: in the same way that the vaccine invented by  Dr. Jonas Salk in 1953 eradicated the crippling effects but did not  eliminate the cause of polio, the Voting Rights Act succeeded in  stymieing the practices that resulted in the wholesale  disenfranchisement of African Americans and language minorities but did  eliminate them entirely.  [[Page H168]]    The Voting Rights Act is needed as much today to prevent another  epidemic of voting disenfranchisement as Dr. Salk's vaccine is still  needed to prevent another polio epidemic.   As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated in Shelby County v. Holder,  ``[t]hrowing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to  work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella  in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.''   Madam Speaker, in many ways my home state of Texas is ground-zero for  testing and perfecting schemes to deprive communities of color and  language minorities of the right to vote and to have their votes  counted.   Consider what has transpired in Texas in recent past, let alone the  noxious voter suppression bill, SB7, it is currently trying to ramrod  through the legislature.   Only 68 percent of eligible voters are registered in Texas and state  restrictions on third party registration, such as the Volunteer Deputy  Registrar program, exacerbate the systemic disenfranchisement of  minority communities.   These types of programs are often aimed at minority and underserved  communities that, for many, many other reasons (like demonization by  the president, for example) or mistrust of law enforcement are afraid  to live as openly as they should.   In Harris County, we had a system where voters were getting purged  from the rolls, effectively requiring people to keep active their  registrations and hundreds of polling locations closed in Texas,  significantly more in number and percentage than any other state.   In addition, the Texas Election Code only requires a 72-hour notice  of polling location changes.   Next, take what happened here in Texas in 2019 when the Texas  Secretary of State claimed that his office had identified 95,000  possible noncitizens on the voter rolls and gave the list to the Texas  State Attorney General for possible prosecution--leading to a claim  from President Trump about widespread voter fraud and outrage from  Democrats and activist groups.   The only problem was that list was not accurate.   At least 20,000 names turned out to be there by mistake, leading to  chaos, confusion, and concern that people's eligibility vote was being  questioned based on flawed data.   The list was made through state records going back to 1996 that show  which Texas residents were not citizens when they got a driver's  license or other state ID.   But many of the person who may have had green cards or work visas at  the time they got a Texas ID are on the secretary of state's office's  list, and many have become citizens since then since nearly 50,000  people become naturalized U.S. citizens in Texas annually.   Latinos made up a big portion of the 95,000-person list.   Texas Republicans adopted racial and partisan gerrymandered  congressional, State legislative redistricting plans that federal  courts have ruled violate the Voting Rights Act and were drawn with  discriminatory intent.   Even after changes were demanded by the courts, much of the damage  done was already done.   Reversing the position by the Obama administration, the Trump  Department of [in]Justice represented to a federal court that it no  longer believed past discrimination by Texas officials should require  the state to get outside approval for redistricting maps that will be  drawn in 2021.   In addition to affirmative ways to making it harder to vote, we also  now face other odious impediments in Texas.   Those of us who cherish the right to vote justifiably are skeptical  of Voter ID laws because we understand how these laws, like poll taxes  and literacy tests, can be used to impede or negate the ability of  seniors, racial and language minorities, and young people to cast their  votes.   This is the harm that can be done without preclearance, so on a  federal level, there is an impetus to act.   Those of us who cherish the right to vote justifiably are skeptical  of Voter ID laws because we understand how these laws, like poll taxes  and literacy tests, can be used to impede or negate the ability of  seniors, racial and language minorities, and young people to cast their  votes.   Consider the demographic groups who lack a government issued ID:   1. African Americans: 25 percent   2. Asian Americans: 20% percent   3. Hispanic Americans: 19 percent   4. Young people, aged 18-24: 18 percent   5. Persons with incomes less than $35,000: 15 percent   And there are other ways abridging or suppressing the right to vote,  including:   1. Curtailing or eliminating early voting;   2. Ending same-day registration;   3. Not counting provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct on  Election Day will not count;   4. Eliminating adolescent pre-registration;   5. Shortening poll hours; and   6. Lessening the standards governing voter challenges thus allowing  self-proclaimed ``ballot security vigilantes'' like the King Street  Patriots to cause trouble at the polls.   The malevolent practice of voter purging is not limited to Texas; we  saw it in 2018 in Georgia, where then Secretary of State and now  Governor Brian Kemp purged more than 53,000 persons from the voter,  nearly the exact margin of his narrow win over his opponent, Stacy  Abrams in the 2018 gubernatorial election.   Voter purging is a sinister and malevolent practice visited on  voters, who are disproportionately members of communities of color, by  state and local election officials.   This practice, which would have not passed muster under section 5 of  the Voting Rights Act, has proliferated in the years since the Supreme  Court neutralized the preclearance provision, or as Justice Ginsburg  observed in Shelby County v. Holder, ``threw out the umbrella'' of  protection.   Madam Speaker, citizens in my congressional district and elsewhere  know and have experienced the pain and heartbreak of receiving a letter  from state or local election officials that they have been removed from  the election rolls, or worse, learn this fact on Election Day.   That is why I am very pleased that H.R. 4 includes language that I  worked hard to include in the Manager's Amendment to the Voting Rights  Advancement Act of 2019 that strengthens the bill's ``practice-based  preclearance'' provisions by adding specifically to the preclearance  provision, voting practices that add a new basis or process for  removing a name from the list of active registered voters and the  practice of reducing the days or hours of in-person voting on Sundays  during an early voting period.   For millions of Americans, the right to vote protected by the Voting  Rights Act of 1965 is sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and toil and  tears and blood of ordinary Americans who showed the world it was  possible to accomplish extraordinary things.   Madam Speaker, it is the responsibility and sacred duty of all  members of Congress who revere democracy to preserve, protect, and  expand the precious right to vote of all Americans by passing H.R. 4,  the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.   Madam Speaker, free and fair elections, along with open, ethical, and  honest government, provide the foundation of our democracy. But these  principles have been threatened in recent years by an unyielding  strategy of voter suppression and outright attacks on historical  statutes which were designed to protect voting rights.   On Tuesday, the President traveled to Atlanta to make the case for  the legislation that we bring to the floor today. My Judiciary  Committee colleagues and I have labored for the last two congresses,  holding more than a dozen hearings to build a record to demonstrate the  critical need for a revitalized Voting Rights Act after the erosion of  the Shelby County and Brnovich decisions.   We must continue to confront the anti-democratic intent of those  behind these discriminatory schemes--attempting to stop any practice  proven to bring more people to the polls--to cling to power in an  increasing multicultural America. Make no mistake, we vote at a  critical juncture in our Nation's history.   I urge all Members to join me in honoring the legacy of our beloved  colleague, the late John Lewis--who shed his blood to secure passage of  the Voting Rights Act--by supporting this vital legislation.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the House Amendment to the Senate  Amendment to H.R. 5746--the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. This  measure would, among other things, revitalize and strengthen the Voting  Rights Act of 1965 to confront the onslaught of discriminatory voting  laws and practices that has emerged in recent years across the country.   Significant portions of this measure--in particular, the bulk of  Division D--rests on a substantial record that the House Judiciary  Committee built over the course of 13 hearings in two Congresses, led  by Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler and Constitution  Subcommittee Chairman Steve Cohen. This record documents the myriad  ways that the right to vote--the most fundamental right in a  democracy--remains under threat for too many Americans.   I also applaud Congresswoman Terri Sewell for introducing H.R. 4, the  John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which was ultimately  incorporated into this measure. I urge all Members to join me in  honoring the legacy of our beloved colleague, the late John Lewis--who  shed his blood to secure passage of the Voting Rights Act--by  supporting this vital legislation.   Make no mistake, we are at a critical juncture in our Nation's  history. The House faces a stark choice with this vote--protect  democracy or let it die.  [[Page H169]]    Madam Speaker, as Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime,  Homeland Security, and Terrorism, and a senior member of the Homeland  Security, and Budget Committees, I rise in strong support of the rule  governing debate for the Senate Amendment to H.R. 5746, the ``Freedom  to Vote: John R. Lewis Act.''   We are here tonight because we must act.   On August 6, 1965, in the Rotunda of the Capitol President Johnson  addressed the Nation before signing the Voting Rights Act--considered  the most effective civil rights statute ever enacted by Congress:   ``The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for  breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which  imprison men because they are different from other men.''   This bill is the result of tireless work and compromise by my  colleagues in the House and my colleagues in the Senate.   The signing of the Voting Rights Act came after, in that same year,  in Selma, Alabama, hundreds of heroic souls risked their lives for  freedom and to secure the right to vote for all Americans by their  participation in marches for voting rights on ``Bloody Sunday,''  ``Turnaround Tuesday,'' or the final, completed march from Selma to  Montgomery.   Those ``foot soldiers'' of Selma, brave and determined men and women,  boys and girls, persons of all races and creeds, loved their country so  much that they were willing to risk their lives to make it better, to  bring it even closer to its founding ideals.   The foot soldiers marched because they believed that all persons have  dignity and the right to equal treatment under the law, and in the  making of the laws, which is the fundamental essence of the right to  vote.   On that day, Sunday, March 7, 1965, more than 600 civil rights  demonstrators, including our beloved former colleague, the late  Congressman John Lewis of Georgia, were brutally attacked by state and  local police at the Edmund Pettus Bridge as they marched from Selma to  Montgomery in support of the right to vote.   ``Bloody Sunday'' was a defining moment in American history because  it crystallized for the nation the necessity of enacting a strong and  effective federal law to protect the right to vote of every American.   However, since the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the  right to vote has been under constant assault.   The Voting Rights Act was enacted at a time when many African  Americans in southern states had been denied the right to vote, and  when attempting to register, organize or even assist others in their  attempt to register to vote meant risking their jobs, homes, and racial  violence.   Prior to the enactment of the VRA, litigation initiated under the  Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 failed to eliminate discrimination  in voting because jurisdictions simply shifted to different tactics in  order to disenfranchise African Americans.   Nearly fifty-seven years later, we face another turning point in the  life of the Nation and for the dignity of men and women and the destiny  of democracy.   Although the Supreme Court has described the right to vote as the one  right that is preservative of all others, this ``powerful instrument  that canbreak down the walls of injustice''--faces grave threats.   The threat stems from the decision issued in June 2013 by the Supreme  Court in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which  invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, and paralyzed the application of  the VRA's Section 5 preclearance requirements.   According to the Supreme Court majority, the reason for striking down  Section 4(b) was that ``times change.''   Now, the Court was right; times have changed.   But what the Court did not fully appreciate is that the positive  changes it cited are due almost entirely to the existence and vigorous  enforcement of the Voting Rights Act, and that is why the Voting Rights  Act is still needed.   As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg stated in Shelby County v. Holder,  ``[t]hrowing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to  work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella  in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.''   The current Supreme Court majority has simply never understood, or  refuses to accept, the fundamental importance of the right to vote,  free of discriminatory hurdles and obstacles.   In fact, were it not for the 24th Amendment, I venture to say that  this conservative majority on the Court would subject poll taxes and  literacy tests to the review standard enunciated in Brnovich v. DNC.   Protecting voting rights and combating voter suppression schemes are  two of the critical challenges facing our great democracy.   Without safeguards to ensure that all citizens have equal access to  the polls, more injustices are likely to occur and the voices of  millions silenced.   And this is exactly what we have seen over this past year.   The polarization of Americans is ever increasing, as seen during the  2020 election through tactics meant to impede the right of certain  Americans to vote, such as the removal of mailboxes and the closing of  postal stations in order to impede mail-in voting.   After the former president was soundly defeated at the ballot box in  what experts unanimously proclaim was the most secure election in  history, still the former president and his cronies propagated the Big  Lie that the election was illegitimate because it was rife with fraud.   The former president persisted in this specious claim even though,  despite ample opportunities to do so, they produced not a scintilla of  evidence to persuade any of the 61 state and federal courts that  entertained the claims.   But to this has been added reactionary state laws passed or  introduced to suppress, abridge, restrict, or deny the right to vote of  millions of eligible Americans, particularly persons of color, young  persons and persons with disabilities, and working parents, precisely  the constellation of persons whose votes determined the outcome of the  2020 presidential election.   In the aftermath of the 2020 election, according to the Brennan  Center For Justice, between January 1 and July 14, 2021, at least 18  states enacted 30 laws that restrict access to the vote, some making  mail voting and early voting more difficult, others imposing harsher  voter ID requirements, and making faulty voter purges more likely.   In total, more than 400 bills with provisions that restrict voting  access have been introduced in 49 states in the 2021 legislative  sessions.   My home state of Texas is ground zero for this desperate effort to  hold back an American future led by the ascendant coalition of young,  racially diverse and all other tolerant, imaginative, and innovative  voters who became energized and inspired by Barack Obama in 2008 and  the belief in a new and just America.   To combat not their ideas but instead their increasing numbers, the  Republican legislature and Governor of Texas passed and signed into law  SB1, which: bans drive-thru voting, 24-hour voting, and the  distribution of mail-in ballot applications; imposes new and extraneous  ID requirements for voting by mail; authorizing ``free movement'' to  partisan poll watchers, effectively turning them into vote suppression  vigilantes; requires monthly checks of voting rolls to facilitate  purging unwanted voters; and imposes onerous new rules for voter  assistance.   All of this is more than enough to sound the warning bell that we are  now engaged, as President Lincoln observed at Gettysburg, in a great  contest testing the proposition that this Nation, or any nation  conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men and  women are created equal, can long endure.   This is the present crisis in which we find ourselves and it indeed  is soul trying.   But as Thomas Paine wrote on Christmas Eve in 1776:   ``The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis,  shrink from the service of their country; but he that stands by it now,  deserves the love and thanks of man and woman. Tyranny, like hell, is  not easily conquered; yet we have this consolation with us, that the  harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph. What we obtain too  cheap, we esteem too lightly: it is dearness only that gives everything  its value.''   The work for civil rights and voting rights involved tens of  thousands of individuals who fought to correct the course of the Nation  by setting it on a path of equal rights and justice for all.   The efforts of Dr. Martin Luther King, Ralph Abernathy, Andrew Young,  Hosea Williams, Coretta Scott King, and John Robert Lewis, among  others, as well as the thousands of foot soldiers in the civil rights  movement succeeded in waking the Nation to the idea that change was  needed.   The result of their work was the establishment of protections that  allowed voters of every race, creed, color, and political belief to  cast ballots free of interference or threat.   The blood spilled during these difficult times is not forgotten by  the communities that saw and experienced these battles, which is why  laws like Texas SB1 cannot go unanswered by the United States House of  Representatives and Senate.   To meet the challenge we have been called upon to face and overcome,  what is needed is for men and women of courage, conscience, and  conviction to step forward and come to the aid of their country by  passing the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act to strengthen the  foundation of our democracy upon which all else depends, including the  important necessary investments to Build Back Better and mitigate the  effects of Climate Change.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this rule governing  debate of Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act.  [[Page H170]]                                     time  1045     Sometimes it is extremely difficult, Madam Speaker,  to really convey in this form both the pain and the emotion of one's  journey in life.   I worked for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the  conference that Dr. Martin Luther King and Ralph David Abernathy  organized and gathered foot soldiers for from around America. They  were, in fact, the beloved community, and included the likes of John  Robert Lewis and many others that sit in this House today.   I walked on plantations and tried to register sharecroppers. And so,  I come today to recount for us the words of Dr. King: ``We shall  overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends  toward justice.''   We need to enact democracy reform now more than ever because State  lawmakers introduced over 440 suppression bills in 49 States.   We cannot allow the other body to stand on some sort of pro forma  dignity that they cannot overturn the filibuster, when people died for  the vote.   We honor Dr. King on Monday. I want that vote to be in his honor that  we have voting rights.                            ____________________
