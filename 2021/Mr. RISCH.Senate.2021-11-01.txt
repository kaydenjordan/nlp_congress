 Madam President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today, I am pleased to honor Florence's Exquisite Chocolates in Rexburg  as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for November 2021.   As the namesake and founder of the business, Florence Manwaring had a  long-standing passion for making chocolate. To pay her way through  college, Florence began working in a chocolate factory where she  learned the art of chocolatiering. Florence combined her work  experience, passion, and giving spirit to make candies for her friends  and family. Her chocolates became popular with her friends, and with  their encouragement, Florence and her husband Var considered launching  a business so she could pursue her passion. As the economy hit a  downturn in the 70s, Var switched his focus from construction to  helping his wife open a small business, and in 1981, Florence's dream  became a reality.   Despite initial struggles, the shop quickly gained the attention of  the Rexburg community and grew so rapidly that Florence's family became  involved as well. A true family-owned business, the Manwarings have the  distinction of employing every single family member, each of whom has  been critical to the company's success.   Some of Florence's iconic chocolates include turtles, haystacks,  toffees, caramels, and mints. The business has received widespread  recognition, garnering positive reception from leaders of The Church of  Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and then-President Ronald Reagan.  Florence's shop has not only found success selling locally, but has  also distributed its candies throughout the region.  [[Page S7537]]    Today, Florence's Exquisite Chocolates remains a family-owned staple  in Rexburg. Florence's son Brian and his wife Michelle keep the  tradition of quality-crafted sweets thriving by making their products  available in other stores and maintaining an online presence to connect  with their loyal customers nationwide. They look forward to continuing  to serve their community.   Congratulations to the Manwaring family and all of the employees of  Florence's Exquisite Chocolates on being the Idaho Small Business of  the Month for November 2021. You make our great State proud, and I look  forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
