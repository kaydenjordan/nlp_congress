 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 4577, the Domestic Explosives Detection  Canine Capacity Building Act of 2017.   In recent years, the volume of air travel has steadily risen, with 42  million people traveling domestically in the last days of 2017 alone.  Last year, the worldwide number of people flying rose to a historic  high of 4 billion passengers.   The high visibility of the aviation sector makes it a persistent  target for terrorists who wish to carry out attacks and inflict harm  upon U.S. citizens. As such, the TSA must continue to collaborate with  stakeholders and better incorporate proven security tools into security  operations. One of the tools that we know to be effective is canine  detection teams, particularly in detecting and protecting against  explosive threats.   In a May 2017 hearing before the Committee on Homeland Security last  year, the Director of the Threat Assessment Division within the  Transportation Security Administration attested to the value of  aviation screening canine teams, saying: ``Canines are incredibly  effective. They can do things we can't even measure with machines.''   The legislation before us today, H.R. 4577, would require the TSA to  establish a working group of stakeholders to determine ways to develop  a domestic canine breeding network to produce explosives detection  canines and modernize canine training standards.   Today, the demand for trained and certified dogs is huge, with more  and more security stakeholders coming to appreciate the explosive  detection capabilities of our four-legged friends. This heightened  demand has led to a shortage, presenting challenges for the U.S.  Government in the procurement of suitable canines.   In testimony before the committee, the TSA and various stakeholders  have cited these challenges and expressed concern regarding how to best  address this shortage. That is why this legislation is so important.   The working group mandated in this legislation draws from authorities  on explosives detection canines and homeland security missions,  including the Transportation Security Administration, the Department of  Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate, national  domestic canine associations, academic experts, and domestic canine  breeders and vendors.   The knowledge and expertise offered by this diverse group of  representatives will ensure that the DHS can implement an effective and  impactful strategy to further the development of explosives detection  canine teams.   For these reasons, Madam Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to  support this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   H.R. 4577 will jump-start conversations on how to increase the supply  of canines and better integrate them in the TSA's layered security at  airports  [[Page H34]]  and surface transportation hubs. Canines have become an invaluable  asset to the DHS in fulfilling its many important missions and goals.   Even prior to the inception of the Department, canines were utilized  by law enforcement and first responder agencies for decades, proving to  be one of the most effective and versatile tools in detecting threats  and protecting the homeland.   Terrorists are working hard to exploit vulnerabilities in our  transportation system, and the U.S. must utilize all of our available  resources to combat these threats. Canines are undoubtedly one such  resource, providing a robust and reliable layer of security and giving  Americans peace of mind.   If enacted, H.R. 4577 would better position the TSA to achieve and  maintain a reliable supply of canines to deploy to not only airport  terminals, but also to cargo operations and mass transit systems.   As such, Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R.  4577, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 4567, the DHS Overseas Personnel  Enhancement Act of 2017.   Madam Speaker, the DHS Overseas Personnel Enhancement Act of 2017  would require the Department of Homeland Security to submit to Congress  an overseas personnel assessment and enhancement plan.   Today, roughly 2,000 DHS personnel have been deployed to more than 70  countries around the world. These DHS employees are involved in a  diverse range of overseas operations targeted at terrorism prevention,  counternarcotics, and preventing human smuggling.   I am particularly interested in the efforts of the National Targeting  Center, which is housed within U.S. Customs and Border Protection, to  embed intelligence analysts in overseas information sharing operations  with international partners to prevent terrorist and other criminal  networks from carrying out attacks and criminal operations with  impunity.   In fact, in a short while, the House will be debating H.R. 4578, the  Counter Terrorist Network Act, which, among other things, authorizes  overseas deployments from the CBP.   About half of overseas DHS personnel are from the CBP and are  involved, among other things, in screening U.S.-bound passengers at  airports, inspecting cargo being loaded on ships bound for the U.S.,  and training other nations' customs and border force.   Additionally, the DHS also assigns Immigration and Customs  Enforcement special agents, Secret Service special agents, and  Transportation Security Administration officials to overseas posts to  engage with international partners on counterterrorism,  counternarcotics, information sharing, and criminal investigations, as  well as security screening and vetting programs.   Just last month, CBP personnel were credited with helping Ecuadoran  authorities interdict and arrest seven people and 800 pounds of  cocaine. Specifically, a CBP team participating in an aerial  surveillance mission in drug transit zones near South America tracked a  low-flying aircraft that intelligence reports indicated had not filed a  flight plan and, with a long-lens camera, snapped images of the plane's  tail number and other identifying details and radioed Ecuador who were  waiting when the plane landed to arrest the smugglers.                                time  1245    According to CBP, its P-3 plane program patrols more than 42 million  square miles in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and the Pacific  Ocean and last year contributed to 145 drug seizures, helping American  and foreign authorities capture a combined 34,108 pounds of marijuana  and 193,197 pounds of cocaine, according to Customs and Border  Protection records.   More broadly, DHS personnel stationed overseas make important  contributions to the Department's efforts in securing the homeland and  keeping the American people safe. As such, it is imperative that these  individuals are utilized efficiently and effectively. This bill seeks  to ensure just that.   In 2016, Congress enacted legislation that the Committee on Homeland  Security, on a bipartisan basis, approved to direct the Secretary of  Homeland Security to issue a strategy for the Department's  international programs.   Among other things, the law required DHS to provide the committee  with an inventory of personnel and resources deployed abroad and a 3- year, risk-based strategy to ensure strategic overseas employment of  personnel.   The statutory deadline for this strategy was June 2017, 7 months ago.  This critical strategy has not been submitted to Congress, as mandated.   H.R. 4567 incorporates an amendment from Ranking Member Thompson that  expands the bill's briefing requirement to include information on  efforts to implement the strategy. Enactment of this bipartisan  legislation should help enhance the effectiveness of DHS personnel at  foreign locations.   Madam Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Payne).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, in closing, H.R. 4567 seeks to enhance DHS' efforts to  push out our borders.   The men and women of DHS face an immense challenge in responding to  the ever-changing terrorist threat landscape. It is imperative that DHS  personnel stationed overseas serve as an effective force in this  mission, and enactment of this legislation would be a positive step  towards this goal.   In fiscal year 2016, CBP officers inspected over 390 million  travelers at 328 ports of entry, of which over 119 million flew into  air ports of entry. Deployed overseas CBP officers, through programs  such as Preclearance and the Immigration Advisory Program, utilize a  risk-based, intelligence-driven strategy to extend our border security  efforts outward to detect, assess, and mitigate, at the earliest  possible point in the travel continuum, any risk imposed by travelers  before they reach the United States.   Today, ICE agents are assigned to 66 offices in 49 countries and work  with their overseas law enforcement counterparts to detect, disrupt,  and dismantle transnational criminal groups  [[Page H36]]  and individuals who seek to harm our country and people.   ICE special agents investigate transnational crime by conducting a  wide range of criminal investigations, in coordination with our foreign  and domestic partner agencies, targeting the illegal movement of  people, merchandise, and monetary instruments into, within, and out of  the United States.    Maintaining an overseas footprint is costly. In fact, the annual cost  of deploying an ICE agent overseas can be four times the cost of  deploying the agent domestically. As such, it is critical that DHS have  a strategy for its overseas programs and execute it.   Congress has an important oversight role to play to ensure that DHS  carries out these programs in a risk-based, strategic manner.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4567, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4561, the Security  Assessment Feasibility for Equipment Testing and Evaluation of  Capabilities for Our Homeland Act, and I encourage my colleagues to  support its passage, which would require the Department of Homeland  Security to develop a new, third-party testing program for  Transportation Security Administration screening technology.   We have heard, time and time again, from vendors that it takes far  too long to get their technologies through TSA testing processes. TSA's  testing and evaluation must be improved not simply to improve  management efficiency, but to address the constantly evolving threat  landscape.   In November, TSA Administrator David Pekoske testified before the  Committee on Homeland Security about the need to accelerate deployment  of innovative security enhancements, as terrorist groups are becoming  more sophisticated. These bad actors are learning about our aviation  security countermeasures and have even gone so far as to post  instructions to build devices to evade screening technologies on the  internet.                                time  1300    As terrorist and criminal organizations become more sophisticated, we  must remain one step ahead. H.R. 4561 seeks to do just that and move  TSA forward in overcoming technology stovepipes that have hindered  state-of-the-art security technology from being integrated into our  Nation's transportation systems in a timely manner.   H.R. 4561 is predicated on the view that, by establishing alternative  avenues to test transportation screening technologies, TSA will be  positioned to introduce innovative security enhancements into  checkpoints sooner, and businesses, regardless of their size, will be  better positioned to compete.   The committee has repeatedly heard from small security manufacturers  about how financially draining it is to wait out TSA testing in the  hopes of a contract. H.R. 4561, if implemented effectively, has the  potential to get innovative technology produced by small businesses in  airport security checkpoints and enhance the effectiveness of TSA's  screening operations.   During consideration of this measure in committee, the majority  accepted amendments offered by committee Democrats to the bill to  ensure that the third-party testing receives scrutiny from the  Government Accountability Office and to build integrity into this new  program.   Given the changes that were made to the legislation in committee and  the potential positive impact this legislation could have on ensuring  innovative technologies are integrated into TSA's security operations,  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4561.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I would first like to point out that this series of  bills that we have presented today has been worked on in a strong  bipartisan fashion.   I would like to thank Chairman Katko and Ranking Member Watson  Coleman for their strong leadership on this subcommittee, Mr. Bilirakis  for his hard work, and, of course, Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member  Thompson for their leadership on the Homeland Security committee.   On behalf of both Members and staff on this side of the aisle, we  also wish Krista Harvey the best of luck in her future endeavors.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4561 is commonsense legislation. This bill promotes  the incorporation of innovative technology in airport screening  capabilities. It does so by requiring DHS to stand up a third-party  testing program to accelerate the evaluation of promising  transportation security technologies, including 3D-imaging computer  tomography, or CT technology.   CT scan technology holds great promise in enhancing the effectiveness  of TSA screening operations insofar as transportation security officers  would have the benefit of seeing a full 3D multicolor image of whatever  the screener is inspecting and getting better detail about any suspect  items.   Presently, TSA is testing a number of systems in the lab and in the  field and has said that it expects to be able to begin deployment of  this new tool to airports by early 2019.    Given the known ongoing terrorist threat posed by electronic devices,  CT technology should be introduced into the airport environment in an  expedited fashion. If done right, the establishment of a third-party  testing program within TSA has the potential of getting innovative  technologies into our transportation security systems quicker and  improving the overall effectiveness of security screening. As such, I  encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4561.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4578, the Counter Terrorist  Network Act.   Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 4578, the Counter Terrorist Network  Act, to support U.S. Customs and Border Protection's ongoing efforts to  prevent individuals who pose a known threat to our country from  entering the United States.   Over the years, the CBP has pushed out our borders through various  programs, including international partnerships where officers are  posted overseas.   The CBP's National Targeting Center, or NTC, uses the latest  technology and analytical tools to identify threats and share that  information with both domestic and international law enforcement  partners.   The CBP vets foreign nationals traveling to the United States prior  to arrival through the use of various sophisticated screening  techniques. Time and again, we see terrorist acts carried out by  individuals who were not on the Federal radar for terrorism.   In the 17 years since the September 11 attacks, we have made huge  investments in this country in intelligence to better connect the dots  about those risks.   My legislation seeks to ensure that the NTC is positioned to continue  embedding its analysts in overseas operations so that individuals  associated with terrorist and transnational criminal networks are  prevented from operating with impunity.   H.R. 4578 authorizes the NTC to continue building its collaborative  intelligence and law enforcement partnerships to stay one step ahead of  those individuals who wish to do us harm or commit other criminal acts.   The bill also authorizes CBP personnel to be posted abroad to perform  critical preemptive operations to make sure the travelers and visa  petitioners coming to our country are thoroughly screened and vetted.   Mr. Speaker, it is imperative for the DHS and its law enforcement  partners to do everything practicable to screen and vet individuals  before they arrive at our borders.   H.R. 4578 underscores this imperative by authorizing the CBP to  counter terrorist and criminal networks' efforts to infiltrate our  borders in a way that has proven effective and adaptive.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4578.   In closing, H.R. 4578 is a bipartisan bill that was unanimously  approved by the Committee on Homeland Security late last year.   The partnerships that the CBP has established to disrupt and  dismantle terrorists and other criminal networks are valuable and merit  congressional support.    H.R. 4578 provides the CBP with statutory authority to continue these  partnerships and it enables CBP personnel to be posted within different  Federal and international entities in furtherance of their  antiterrorism and homeland security missions. Congress must continue to  support this effort, and we can do so today by passing this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Committee on Homeland  Security for their support, and I urge my House colleagues to pass H.R.  4578.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
