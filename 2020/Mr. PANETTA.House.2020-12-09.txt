 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the decades of  service of my good friend, Scott Horsfall.   Scott is retiring this month after decades of serving our  agricultural community on the central coast of California. Scott's  career has been spent serving farmers and farmworkers through his work  at California Grown, at the California Kiwifruit Commission, at the  California Table Grape Commission, and where I got to know him, at the  Leafy Greens Marketing Agreement, where he was the first CEO.   With Scott at the helm for over the past 13 years, leafy green  producers in California have operated under one set of science-based  food safety standards. Over 6,200 government audits have been  conducted, and more than 7 billion servings of lettuce and leafy greens  have been grown and enjoyed by American consumers.   But it is not just about his accolades and accomplishments. It is  about the relationships he has fostered and the work he has done to  build strong relationships on the central coast and throughout our  country.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Scott for his work, his commitment, his  dedication for our food safety, for our agriculture, and for our  Nation's food security.                            ____________________
