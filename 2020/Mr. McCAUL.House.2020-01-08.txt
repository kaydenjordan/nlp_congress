 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of my Promoting United States International  Leadership in 5G Act of 2019, which I am pleased to introduce with my  good friend, Mr. Cuellar, who is also from the great State of Texas.   Texas is home to many leading technology and communication companies  and is an innovation hub.   Cutting-edge technology like 5G holds the promise to create millions  of jobs and add hundreds of billions of dollars to the United States'  economy.   The standards which are set at international bodies, such as the ITU  and the 3GPP, are critical to the future of 5G. They establish a  uniform criterion across devices, markets, and more.   For example, standards are the reason that your USB memory stick fits  into any USB port on any device. And for years, these standards were  adopted on merit.   However, over the last few years, China has been using coercive and  underhanded tactics at international bodies to adopt Chinese technology  in 5G standards. These efforts unfairly benefit Chinese companies and  empower the Communist Party of China.   The 2018 report to Congress by the U.S.-China Economic and Security  Review Commission states that: ``The Chinese Government is encouraging  its companies to play a greater role in international 5G standards  organizations to ensure they set global standards; such leadership may  result in higher revenues and exports from internationally-accepted  intellectual property and technology and more global influence over  future wireless technology and standards development.''   My bill will ensure the U.S. maintains and, in some cases, increases  leadership at the international standards-setting bodies.   Specifically, it creates an international working group to provide  assistance and technical expertise to enhance our representation and  leadership at these bodies.   Additionally, my bill will create strategies for increasing  engagement with our allies, partners, and the private sector. These  strategies will help increase the United States' leadership in the  global race to develop and deploy 5G and future generations of mobile  telecommunications systems and infrastructure.   Finally, my bill will provide an assessment of Chinese activities at  those international bodies. This assessment will help us to ensure that  the standards-setting bodies are not unduly influenced to adopt  standards that unfairly advantage Communist Party of China connected  and supported companies like Huawei.   China seeks to control critical industries and infrastructure by  making them reliant on Chinese technologies. These Chinese companies  are beholden to the laws and regulations in China that demand  cooperation with Chinese intelligence services. The free flow of  information and security of a country's data cannot be guaranteed using  Communist Party of China supplied technology.   There are credible reports of China taking advantage of network  equipment supplied by its companies for intelligence advantage that  date back almost 2 decades.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that the United States leads  at these standards-setting organizations so we are not beholden to  Communist Party of China controlled technologies that will severely  impact the freedoms and securities that we value here in the United  States.   I will say the war on 5G is on, and some would argue in the IC that  we are losing that war, and we need to compete with China, and we need  to win. I think this bill will go a long way towards the United States  taking the lead and backing the Communist Chinese Party from its  intelligence service data collection. I urge support of the bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows).    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from the great State of Texas (Mr. Taylor).    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), a member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close. I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, for decades China has been infiltrating the United  States, espionage, intellectual property theft. I know the issue today  is Iran, but when I asked the Secretary of State what the greatest  threat to the United States is long term? It is China.   We have to compete with China. We can say they are a bad actor, but  we have to compete. And when it comes to artificial intelligence, to  quantum computing, and yes, to 5G, if we can't compete, we lose long  term, and the next generation is counting on us to win this race.                                time  1445    Madam Speaker, if you look at the global map, they are moving from 4G  to 5G in almost 50 percent of the globe now. What happens when the  Chinese come into a developing nation and plant their cheap  telecommunications into the ground? They suck all the country's data.  They steal all the data, and they do it because, long term, they want  to dominate.   We have to compete with this. We have to win. This is equivalent to  when we had a space race to the Moon. This is equivalent to that race.  It is a digital space race, a digital space race against the Chinese to  win against espionage, to win against theft of intellectual property,  and to win for the American people.   I thank Ms. Spanberger for working with my office on this important  measure. She is very involved in the 5G issue, and I applaud that.  Being from the intelligence community, she knows how important this is.   It is refreshing to have a bipartisan moment in this Chamber. I think  that is what most Americans want us to be doing right now. I look  forward to the passage of this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
