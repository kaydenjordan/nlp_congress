 Will the gentleman yield for a question?    Mr. Speaker, my reading of the bill is not furloughed  employees. It is anyone affected. It has a very broad definition.  Without putting any guardrails on it, one could argue that every  American was probably affected in some way. Is that true? Is my reading  of the bill that this extends way beyond furloughed employees? It  affects any consumer affected. Is that correct?    Mr. Speaker, I object.
