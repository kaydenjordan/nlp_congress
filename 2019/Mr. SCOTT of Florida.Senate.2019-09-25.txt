 Mr. President, I rise to speak about my  amendment to H.R. 549, which grants temporary protected status, or TPS,  for Venezuelans from Nicolas Maduro's oppressive regime and reforms the  broken TPS program.   I would like to thank my friends, Senator Marco Rubio and Congressman  Mario Diaz-Balart, who have been tireless advocates for the Venezuelan  people as we fight for freedom in Latin America and across the globe. I  am proud to have worked with Senator Rubio, along with my colleague  from Utah, Senator Lee, and other Republican Senators to offer  protection for the Venezuelan people while making necessary reforms to  TPS.   The crisis in Venezuela is a defining human rights issue of our time.  Maduro is starving his own people, and innocent children are dying.  What is happening in Venezuela is pure genocide. We have to act, but we  also need to be responsible. The courts have basically made a temporary  program permanent, which is not sustainable.   My amendment protects the vulnerable Venezuelan population while  making sure that human rights violators are clearly identified as  ineligible to come to the United States. My bill grants TPS for  Venezuelans right now.   The amendment also makes much-needed reforms to our TPS program. The  amendment grants TPS to Venezuelans for 18 months. It requires  congressional approval for TPS extensions, no more than 18 months at a  time. My amendment limits the ability of illegal aliens with no  connection to the TPS designation to benefit from TPS. It ensures that  human rights violators identified under the Magnitsky Act are not  eligible for TPS status. It includes provisions to distinguish that TPS  status does not count as admission for purposes of the Immigration and  Nationality Act. Under my amendment, TPS recipients cannot return to  the TPS country during the period of designation. And finally, the  amendment requires that current TPS designations will come up for  congressional review 2 years after the enactment of this amendment.   We want those seeking refuge from war and oppressive regimes to have  a safe haven in our country, but we need a system that works and that  is truly temporary.   I am honored to work with my colleagues to get something done today  to help Venezuelan families and to make some much-needed changes to our  broken system.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate in  Spanish.    We need TPS now. I stand with the people of  Venezuela, and I will continue to fight for freedom and democracy in  Latin America. It is time for Maduro and his thugs to leave power.   Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration  and the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 549. I  ask unanimous consent that the Scott of Florida amendment be agreed to  and that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time and  passed, and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    Reserving the right to object, I object on half  of my colleague, Senator Rand Paul.   What I propose is a bill that grants TPS to Venezuelans right now. It  also makes much-needed reforms to the TPS program and gives Congress  real oversight.   I am very disappointed that my Democratic colleagues would block this  commonsense compromise. Republicans support it. The sponsor of the  House-passed bill supports it. I believe the President would sign it.  It is clear that the Democrats actually don't want to get something  done on this issue. Unfortunately, they decided to use the Venezuelan  community as a political prop, instead of working with us to find a  solution. I think that is shameful. Even though the Democrats stood up  and blocked TPS for Venezuelans today, I will never stop fighting to  support the Venezuelan community here.   My amendment is a solution that can be passed by Congress and signed  into law by the President. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle will help us to get this done.   We cannot lose sight of the fact that Nicolas Maduro is killing his  citizens. It is genocide. Every passing day, the situation on the  ground grows worse. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans are fleeing  the violence and starvation of Maduro's socialist regime, and they need  our help.   While extending TPS to Venezuelans is the right move, the United  States and freedom-loving nations around the world need to do  everything in our power to isolate Maduro in Venezuela and cut off the  supply of money from Cuba to Caracas.   It is time to help Venezuelan families. It is time to get TPS reform  done in this country. Temporary protected status was never meant to be  endless. It was meant to help families in need. We need to get this  program to work. We need to get TPS for Venezuelans today.   I look forward to working with all my colleagues to help all the  families in Venezuela and finally get a real long-term solution to TPS.    Mr. President, I would like to recognize  the 100th birthday of Julius Eisenstein who was born on October 13,  1919, in Tomaszow Mazowiecki, Poland. I am honored to have the  opportunity to speak about Julius's remarkable life today.   Living in Poland during the Holocaust, Julius was abruptly taken from  his home and forced into the Tomaszaw Mazowiecki Ghetto from 1940 to  1943. From the ghettos, he was then transported all over Eastern  Europe. Between May 1943 and April 1945, he was interned in the Blizyn  Labor Camp and four other concentration camps. In April, Julius was  finally liberated from Dachau by the U.S. Army. Julius and his brother  Jacob survived the Holocaust.   After he was liberated, Julius lived in Munich for some time. He  married his wife Phyllis in 1947. Julius moved to New York in 1950,  where he owned and operated numerous businesses. Julius now permanently  resides in Florida. Julius and his wife have two children, Tobi and  Fred. Julius's wife Phyllis passed away in 2017.   Julius has been an active speaker for the Holocaust Documentation and  Education Center, Inc., where he has touched the lives of so many.  Sharing Julius's story is so important as we seek to educate our  children and future generations about the atrocities of the past and  stand together against all forms of hate, evil and violence.   The Holocaust is a stark reminder that evil and hate exist in this  world. Even today, we must remain ready to confront this hatred and  bigotry in all forms. Every generation must heed the call to take  action in the face of evil; this is the Holocaust's enduring lesson of  mankind.   Julius has lived through unspeakable horror and has dedicated his  life to educating and inspiring those around him. Our memory of all  those who suffered must never weaken, and we must always fight against  hate. I am honored to wish Julius a happy birthday, and I wish him  continued happiness with his family, friends, community, and loved  ones.                            ____________________
