 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Cincinnati  St. Xavier High School's football team on becoming the Division I Ohio  State champions.   Led by inspirational Head Coach Steve Specht, the St. X Bombers  clinched the title by winning the State championship by a score of 44- 3, setting a record for the largest margin of victory ever in a  Division I final.   This impressive showing followed dramatic come-from-behind fourth- quarter victories in both the quarterfinals and the semifinals.   I am always proud to be a St. Xavier alumnus, and I feel especially  proud of the 2020 Bomber team as the school earned their fourth State  championship.   I am especially proud because it is an understatement to say that the  last several months have been difficult for our communities in Ohio and  across the country. Yet, last Friday night, families, friends,  students, and spectators, alike, were able to return to a little bit of  normalcy--exactly why sports and teamwork are so important to the  Nation.   Congratulations, again, to the St. Xavier players, to Coach Steve  Specht and his staff, and to the St. Xavier faithful.   Go Bombers.                            ____________________
