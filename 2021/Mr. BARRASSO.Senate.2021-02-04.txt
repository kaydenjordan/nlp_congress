 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 653 and ask that  it be reported by number.    Mr. President, my amendment addresses the serious  impacts of the Biden administration moratorium on oil and natural gas  leases and the impact on Federal lands and waters.   Wyoming and many States across the West have Federal land where there  is oil and gas development. The revenue generated from the lease sales  goes to States, which use it for essential services.   One of the many crushing consequences of the moratorium is  eliminating hundreds of millions of dollars for K-12 education for  students, funding all of these States. In 2019 alone, revenues from oil  and gas contributed $740 million to Wyoming's public schools.   This amendment creates a deficit-neutral reserve fund to protect  students and schools from this misguided moratorium by restoring these  lost funds to the States.   I urge a ``yes'' vote.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
