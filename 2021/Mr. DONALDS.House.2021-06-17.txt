 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Raymond  Trujillo, a patriotic American, a United States marine, and a dutiful  officer in Collier County, Florida. He tragically passed away in May at  the age of 56 years old.   Raymond dedicated his life to giving back through service. He joined  the United States Marine Corps as a teenager. Devoted to the Marine  Corps creed, semper fidelis, Raymond spent 17 years in the military  proudly serving our Nation.   Upon his exit from the military, Raymond continued his service in his  community by becoming a police officer with the Collier County  Sheriff's office, to which he would serve the Collier County community  for more than 20 years.   Alongside his brothers and sisters in blue, Raymond protected the  Collier County community for more than 20 years. For years, he worked  in the Youth Relations Bureau helping to mold and shape the children of  today and the future leaders of tomorrow.   Growing up in California, Raymond was a lifelong Oakland Raiders fan  and loved the game of football, so much so he spent his spare time  coaching youth football.   In a moment of history where police officers are vilified, hated, and  looked down upon, Raymond Trujillo wore the badge with honor, dignity,  and respect.   Raymond was a proud father to three sons, Raymond III, Alexander, and  Jason, and a loving grandfather of three, who were his pride and joy.   My prayers are with his fellow marines, his brothers and sisters in  blue, and his family.   As the Representative of Florida's 19th Congressional District, it is  an honor to stand here today celebrating the life of an American  patriot who dedicated his life to a simple, yet so often forgotten  creed: Service above Self.                            ____________________
