 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor one of Georgia's  most successful public servants, Governor Nathan Deal.   Governor Deal has led our State with grace and tenacity for the last  8 years, and his time in office has been marked by years of success for  our State. In fact, since 2014, Georgia has been ranked the best State  in the Nation to do business. That distinction is a direct result of  Governor Deal's leadership, his focus on economic development, his  investment in statewide workforce development initiatives and training  programs, and a shear desire to see our fellow Georgians succeed. His  commitment has, in fact, led to more and better jobs for my fellow  Georgians and produced a workforce that is second to none in the world.   Governor Deal and his wife, Sandra, are headed to a much-deserved  retirement, some rest, and an awful lot of fun. We wish them the best.  I know all Georgians offer their gratitude as well.   Governor Deal, thank you for making Georgia a better place.                            ____________________
