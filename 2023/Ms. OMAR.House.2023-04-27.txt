 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Con. Res. 30,  the Somalia war powers resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I agree with the chairman, a real debate about U.S.  policy in Somalia and in Africa is long overdue. It is debate that  should include a serious discussion of our long-term strategy for  supporting stability and self-governance. It should include clear-eyed  analysis of U.S. counterterrorism policies, including air strikes and  drones, and the consistent problem of civilian casualties of U.S.  operations.   Congress is also overdue for a debate about the expansive use of the  2001 AUMF, which the executive branch claims includes operations in  Somalia.   Mr. Speaker, the resolution before the House today does not address  these significant issues. It is a narrow question of the withdrawal of  a few hundred troops.   Given President Hassan's renewed efforts to eradicate Al-Shabaab, the  resolution does include a long enough timeline to ensure that  operations that we are partnering with can be ended responsibly.   While we should not mistake this poorly crafted resolution for an  honest assessment of U.S. policy in Somalia, it is important that we  support the question before us.   Mr. Speaker, I and many Somali Americans support this resolution, and  I urge my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the U.N. visit to  my Minnesota district to advance racial justice and equality in the  context of law enforcement and address the historic oppression of Black  and Brown people in our country.   It has been nearly 3 years to the day since George Floyd was murdered  at the hands of the Minneapolis Police Department. Sadly, since then,  the number of Black people killed by police has only increased--with  over 1,000 police shootings a year in 2021 and 2020.   This is a systemic issue that requires systemic solutions. That is  why, in the wake of the killing of Daunte Wright and George Floyd, I  introduced a package of bills, including the Protecting Our Protesters  Act, the National Police Misuse of Force Investigation Board Act, and  the Global Police Brutality Resolution. Following the murder of Amir  Locke, I introduced the End Deadly No-Knock Warrants Act.   We can and must fight systemic racial injustices in our criminal  justice system, from the disproportionate arrest and incarceration  rates Black and Brown people face to the marijuana laws that  criminalize Black people and remain on the books.                            ____________________
