The motion is agreed to.                            ____________________     Today, Mr. President, I want to honor my friend Michael  ``Mickey'' Goral. For nearly four decades, Mickey has held elected  office in  [[Page S2797]]  Rockford, the county seat of Winnebago County, IL. I have had the  pleasure of knowing and working with him to serve Rockford and  Winnebago County for many years.   A lifelong resident of Rockford, Mickey Goral grew up on Rockford's  west end graduated from Boyland High School and Northern Illinois  University with a B.A. in political science. He served on the county  board for 18 years before being elected Rockford township supervisor  and has held that post for 20 years.   At 63 years young, Mickey decided not to seek reelection, but refuses  to use the word ``retirement.'' He said: I hesitate to use the `R' word  because I don't play golf, I don't fish, and I have no other hobbies.''  Public service is all that is in Mickey's blood.   Oftentimes, public service becomes about accolades--not for Mickey.  He simply aimed to make a difference in people's lives. Overseeing a  $1.6 million general assistance office, Mickey led a nine-person team  responsible for providing assistance to the communities most  vulnerable: those with no other source of income. His mission was  always clear and simple: treat all people with respect, dignity, and  compassion in providing basic human needs to families while they are on  the road to self-sufficiency, and that is what he did. Mickey's years  of service to the people of Rockford show that public service can make  a real difference in people's lives. Following the great recession of  2008, his general assistant office dealt with more than 150 open cases  every month. Today, that number in a typical month is cut in half. That  is the king of progress Mickey delivered for real working folks in  Rockford.   Mickey Goral also had the privilege of serving as the president of  the Township Officials of Illinois, bringing professionalism and  training for township governments throughout my home State of Illinois,  but for all his accomplishments, Mickey was most proud to the Rockford  township supervisor because his government role was one that was  closest to the people, which meant he had the opportunity to help his  friends and neighbors. We need more people like Mickey Goral.   I especially want to thank Mickey's wife, Tami, and twin daughters,  Karley and Kiley, for sharing so much of their husband and father with  the community. I am honored to congratulate him on a job well done and  wish him and his family all the best in the next chapter of their  lives.                            ____________________
