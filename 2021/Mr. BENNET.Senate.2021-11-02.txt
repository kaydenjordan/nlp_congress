 Mr. President, I ask consent to speak for 5 minutes.    Mr. President, I am coming to the floor to talk about a  nominee that we have before us this afternoon, who is nominated by  President Biden to be the Deputy Under Secretary of the Treasury for  Legislative Affairs.   He is a person who is well known to this Chamber. He spent roughly 20  years working in the Senate. He started out as Senator Paul Sarbanes'  body man years and years and years ago and became chief of staff for  Senator Sarbanes when Senator Sarbanes was the chair of the Banking  Committee. He worked in the House for Representative Sarbanes, was  chief counsel to Senator Warner, and then came to my office and was my  chief of staff.   His name is Jon Davidson, and he worked for the people of Colorado  and for the country for about 10 years in that role. When he came over  as my chief of staff, it was very shocking to me that he was willing to  do it because he had a good job and he was doing really well for  Senator Warner. But it gave him the chance to run a Senate office, and  he did an extraordinary job not just because of his understanding of  policy and his understanding of politics--a lot of people have that  around this place--but also his understanding of human nature and his  belief that in all of us, even those of us who are Senators, there can  be a gem of goodness in us to be found and to be brought along and to  be grown. And that was true not just for me, but for the entire staff.   He was an incredible mentor to probably hundreds of people who worked  for me over the years, both in the State of Colorado and in here. He  was an extraordinary manager who led with integrity and discipline and  drive.   And while I was extremely sorry to lose him, I wasn't at all  surprised that President Biden and the Secretary of the Treasury wanted  him at Treasury, where he could take what he had learned on Capitol  Hill and apply it at  [[Page S7583]]  a moment when the country urgently needs leadership like the leadership  that Jon Davidson can provide.   Just one example: You know, Mr. President, I ran a not very well  noticed campaign for President the last time we were having a campaign  for President, and I ran it on the idea that we could cut childhood  poverty almost in half in this country by adopting the changes that I  had proposed to the child tax credit with Senator Brown from Ohio and  Senator Booker from New Jersey and then-Senator Harris from California.   But, like with anything else a Senator does, the work is actually  done often by the members of that Senator's staff. And in the case of  Jon, the vision also came from him and from Charlie Anderson--another  staff member that I had--and the entire team that worked together not  just for that Presidential campaign but to make sure that, in the wake  of it, that could actually become law.   And because of Jon's tenacity, among other things, and his  willingness to be able to raise this issue again and again and again in  rooms full of staff but also in rooms full of Senators, those changes  in the child tax credit are now the law of the land, and we are cutting  childhood poverty in this country almost in half this year. It is one  of the signature accomplishments, in my mind, of the Biden  administration. It is one that I hope that we are going to be able to  continue.   So, obviously, I was extremely sad to see him go. I was very, very  pleased to see the broad bipartisan support that the cloture vote on  his nomination engendered. And I know great things are ahead for Jon  and for the country because of his leadership.   He knows, I think, that he has got an open invitation to come back  anytime that he wants to.   Before I leave the floor, I also want to say a special word of  gratitude to his dad Garber, who lives in Baltimore; and to his wife  Erin; and to his children Leo, Mia, and Serena--all of whom have been  part of the efforts that we have undertaken on behalf of the people I  represent in Colorado over the last decade and on behalf of the United  States of America.   These opportunities for public service that all of us have are ones  that can't be accomplished without our families; without, I know in the  case of Jon, the mentorship that he received from his father, who  himself was a distinguished public servant in the United States, and  also the support of his family.   So I am filled with great happiness today that we are going to have a  great, positive, bipartisan vote on Jon Davidson, as it should be. And  perhaps that is a sign of things to come when the kind of quality of  somebody like Jon Davidson is recognized in a way that it causes us to  act not in a partisan way but in a bipartisan way, to embrace his  public service but also a vision for the country that can move us  forward.   So congratulations to Jon Davidson. Congratulations to his family, to  the Department of the Treasury, and to the United States of America.   With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 7 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
