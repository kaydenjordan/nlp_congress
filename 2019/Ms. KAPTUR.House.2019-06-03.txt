 Madam Speaker, what defines a traitor to America's  liberty?   The Justice Department defines a traitor as a person, who owing  allegiance to the United States, adheres to their enemies.   President Trump's 2016 campaign manager, Paul Manafort, fits that  definition: a traitor.   Manafort proudly sought out multimillions of dollars from the enemies  of liberty to promote the pro-Russian anti-democratic ruler of  Ukraine--President Viktor Yanukovych.   Yanukovych took his direct orders from Russian dictator Vladimir  Putin who personally directed Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S.  Presidential election.   When Ukrainian people rose up to take back their nation, Yanukovych,  after killing his own countrymen, fled back to his master in Russia to  hide out, looting countless millions that he stole from the Ukrainian  people.   The real question for America is how could a U.S. citizen sell out  liberty for dirty money from such dictators for whom liberty means  nothing.   Mr. Manafort, Trump's campaign manager, is no stranger to criminal  enterprise.   Just weeks ago, news broke out that Manafort got millions upon  millions of dollars, auctioning off high-level Trump administration  positions to a Chicago banker named Stephen Calk.   Madam Speaker, it is a fair question to ask: At what exact point in  his sordid career did Manafort become a traitor to liberty? And, more  importantly, who else is riding his traitorous coattails?                            ____________________
