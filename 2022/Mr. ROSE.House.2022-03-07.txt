 Madam Speaker, this past weekend, on my way to a military  medal presentation in Crossville, Tennessee, I stopped to fill my SUV  with gas. Like many Americans, I was shocked to have to pay nearly $4 a  gallon for gasoline.   Putin's invasion of Ukraine has no doubt made this situation worse,  but our skyrocketing gas prices are primarily due to President Biden's  reversal of President Trump's highly successful energy policies that  had oil and gas production high, gas pump prices low, had created  hundreds of thousands of new energy jobs, and had created an energy- independent United States for the first time in decades.   Instead of admitting this mistake, ending the freeze on new oil and  gas projects, and stopping the regulatory assault on new energy  projects in the United States, the Biden administration has reportedly  been secretly meeting with Venezuela and its corrupt authoritarian  regime to discuss the possible lifting of sanctions against importing  Venezuelan oil.   We currently purchase more than half a million barrels of oil a day  from Russia, which needs to stop immediately. Instead of replacing  Russian oil with equally nefarious Venezuelan oil, why not re-create  those jobs here in America.                            ____________________
