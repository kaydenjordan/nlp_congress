 Madam Speaker, this week the House is considering H.R.  1,  [[Page H2514]]  the For the People Act. This bill takes on one of the biggest issues  facing our democracy: campaign finance reform.   The Supreme Court's decision, in Citizens United, was one of the most  disastrous decisions of our time. It opened the floodgates to the  unlimited amount of unregulated dark money that is now corrupting our  democracy.   And Congress not only has the authority to regulate the way our  political campaigns are financed, but, I believe, we have the moral  responsibility to step up.   This bill would shed light on the billionaires and special interest  groups who are really behind some of the candidates running for office,  and it would level the playing field by giving the power back to the  traditional grass roots donors.   This, without a doubt, is one of the most important issues that we as  a Congress will take on this year, and that is why I urge all of my  colleagues to get in this fight to get unlimited dark money out of the  political system once and for all.                            ____________________
