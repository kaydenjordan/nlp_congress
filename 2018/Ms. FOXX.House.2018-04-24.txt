 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to dispute the absurdity that the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act benefits only the wealthy, leaving nothing but  crumbs for the rest.   As someone who started contributing to my family's household income  at age 12, I am all too familiar with the many struggles of our  country's working and middle classes. Despite their steady perseverance  in the face of politicians whose fiscal philosophy was ``government  knows best,'' the working poor and middle class have been chewed up by  the system that same philosophy promulgated.   Republicans' Tax Cuts and Jobs Act delivers a modern Tax Code that is  fiscally responsible, levels the playing field, and supports working- class Americans. Republicans understand that progrowth tax reform means  simpler and fairer taxes that provide much-needed relief to the middle  class and our small businesses. It also means security for American  jobs, more take-home pay for the workforce, and a level playing field  for Americans' farms and businesses.   By doubling the standard deduction, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will  move more low-income Americans into the zero tax bracket. For married  couples filing jointly, this translates to $24,000 yearly that is  free--free--from Federal taxes. This also means that working-class  Americans will be able to take home more of their hard-earned  paychecks.   Currently, over 70 percent of the people in the United States already  take the standard deduction. By doubling the standard deduction, even  more Americans will be spared from itemizing, and the process will be  so simple that they can file on a postcard. For those few Americans who  do elect to itemize, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act preserves the child and  dependent care tax credit, the adoption tax credit, the deduction for  charitable contributions, the home mortgage interest deduction for  existing mortgages, and the deduction for newly purchased homes for  interest on up to $750,000 of mortgage principal.   It also continues to allow for writeoff of State and local property  taxes up to $10,000. Finally, it expands the medical expense deduction  in 2018 for medical expenses exceeding 7.5 percent of adjusted gross  income and rises to 10 percent beginning in 2019.   Last, by lowering the crippling taxes on businesses, the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act translates to an increase in employment and workers' wages. We  are seeing the lowest unemployment rate since 2000, and 4 million  workers and counting have seen the benefits of these historic tax cuts  in their income. Businesses across the country are giving bonuses, pay  raises, and new investments. Bonuses alone amount to over $4 billion  across businesses countrywide.    The evidence that tax cuts provide substantial relief for the working  and middle classes is clear. The Democrats' approach was to defend a  Tax Code riddled with high taxes and loopholes, but I am proud that  Republicans delivered on our promise to bring relief to American  workers and happy to say that we are only beginning to see the benefits  of this historic tax cut for America's businesses, workers, families,  and job creators.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a member of the  Committee on Education and the Workforce staff who is retiring after  more than 29 years of public service.   Molly McLaughlin Salmi began her congressional career as a staff  assistant on the committee in the 100th Congress. She rose through the  ranks and has served as Deputy Director of Workforce Policy for the  last 16 years.   Eight committee chairs, Republicans and Democrats, have had the  benefit of Molly's guidance, direction, and honest feedback. Molly may  be the longest serving member of the committee's workforce staff, but  she has the heart of an educator.   Long ago, she established herself as a trustworthy, wise, and  encouraging mentor to members of the committee staff. As an educator  myself, I know it sometimes isn't easy to share what you know with  someone one-on-one, to watch them try, sometimes fail, and get back up  again. Molly has not only made mentoring look easy, but she has set a  standard for paying it forward that we should all strive to reach.   Mr. Speaker, we wish Molly all the best, and we will miss her more  than she will ever know.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Wilson for leading the  Special Order on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I will agree with him; the  Lord has blessed me with living in one of the most beautiful places in  the world, the Fifth District of North Carolina. I am very, very  grateful for it.   Last week, tax day was, for once, an occasion to celebrate because  this was the last time Americans filed under the broken 32-year-old Tax  Code. Next tax season, they will file under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  passed by this Congress last December.   Across the Fifth District of North Carolina, the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act has already relieved North Carolinians who are cashing bigger  paychecks and benefiting from the country's lowest unemployment rate  since 2000. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, North Carolina  added 9,000 jobs this February alone. And thanks to lower rates for  individuals and small businesses under the new code, North Carolinians  are keeping more of their hard-earned money. And as Congressman Wilson  points out, it is their money, not the government's money.   This year, married couples in the Fifth District who take the new  standard deduction could receive a tax cut to the tune of $1,834. For  the over 52,000 taxpayers of the Fifth District who have small business  income, these tax savings are not crumbs, as my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle falsely assert. A restaurant owner in Mount Airy  recently told me that allowing immediate capital expensing under the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act empowered her to purchase a new $20,000 piece of  equipment for her business.   You spoke of the Business Roundtable. The Business Roundtable reports  that 68 percent of business leaders similarly expect their capital  spending in the next 6 months to be at its highest in 15 years. This  increased purchasing power for the backbone of our economy is evidence  that progrowth tax cuts work.   Continued growth is also expected by the Congressional Budget Office.  The CBO estimates, for every one-tenth percent increase in GDP, nearly  $270 billion is added to revenue over 10 years. After years of malaise  under the Obama administration, even modest increases in GDP growth  caused by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will substantially contribute to a  leveling off of the deficit. And for the first time since 2008, the  CBO's budget and economic outlook revised its upward economic potential  for 2018. Under current conditions, it notes that 3.5 percent growth is  possible.   In further good news, Fifth District businesses share this optimism  and are investing more in their employees and communities. Just last  week, as part of its initiative to invest in community health with its  tax savings, BlueCross and BlueShield of North Carolina gave $1 million  to Winston-Salem State University's nursing school. North Carolina is  projected to have the second largest nurse shortage in the Nation. This  investment will develop the Fifth District's medical workforce and  increase access to high-quality healthcare, especially in rural areas.   This is just one of the many examples that illustrates how  philanthropy has fostered and communities are developed when the  government scales back.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that House Republicans kept our promise to  bring about more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger paychecks for  hardworking Americans; but I am more proud of the hardworking men and  women in the Fifth District who are seizing the opportunities unleashed  by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to create wealth and serve their  communities.   Again, I thank Congressman Wilson for his leadership on this Special  Order and for allowing us to correct the record that has been distorted  about this bill and bring to the American people the facts about this  wonderful Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
