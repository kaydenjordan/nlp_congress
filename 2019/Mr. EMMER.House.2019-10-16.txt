 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate St. Michael's  city administrator, Steve Bot, for receiving the 2019 James F. Miller  Leadership Award from the League of Minnesota Cities.   This award is the most prestigious award for nonelected public  servants in the State of Minnesota. Our office has the honor of working  with Steve through his role as chair of the I-94 West Corridor  Coalition which works to expand and improve this vital transportation  route in Minnesota's Sixth District.   We recently joined Steve at St. Michael's new public works facility  and saw firsthand the incredible work he is doing in St. Michael. It is  evident that Steve's efforts to improve his community have been noticed  by many, at home and around the State of Minnesota.   I congratulate Steve on this well-deserved award and thank him for  everything he does for our community.      Recognizing Lake Ridge Care Center for 100 Years of Excellent Care     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lake Ridge Care  Center in Buffalo, Minnesota, for providing outstanding care for our  seniors.   This year marks the center's 100th anniversary. For a century, this  facility has offered short- and long-term care for older adults. Since  a large number of residents are not mobile, the staff of this 100-year- old facility found a new way to get residents moving by starting a  ``Daily Boogie Walk'' with music playing over a sound system.   With music requests from the 1950s and beyond, residents have been  motivated to exercise. As a result, the center's quality measures rose  from 41 percent to 70 percent of residents walking. They rose by 130  spots in our State's rankings.   Congratulations to the staff at Lake Ridge Care Center for their  innovation and going above and beyond, and thanks for caring for our  seniors with a profound level of care.             Congratulating Bryan Schafer on 33 Years of Service     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Bryan Schafer,  development director of planning and community for the city of Blaine.  He has done an incredible job. Bryan is officially retiring after 33  years of service.   Bryan started with the city in June of 1986 as a code compliance  officer. Later, he became the city planner. Since 2000, he has been the  director for the city. Bryan has left a lasting impact on our  community.   Bryan's fingerprints are on the largest projects in Blaine, from the  TPC Twin Cities golf course, which is home of the 3M Open--PGA Tour  event, to the largest housing development Blaine has seen thus far, The  Lakes, which added revenue and growing families to the city. Most  notably, Bryan secured 580 acres of land that now serves as the Blaine  Wetland Sanctuary.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Bryan for his service to the city. Good luck to  him in his retirement.                            ____________________
