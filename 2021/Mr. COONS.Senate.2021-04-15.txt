 Mr. President, I rise today in support of Vanita Gupta's  nomination to be the Associate Attorney General of the U.S. Department  of Justice. Those of us who have had the joy and the honor of getting  to know her and working with her know Ms. Gupta to be engaging and  smart, a skilled and balanced lawyer and practitioner, and someone who  will bring great values in leadership to the U.S. Department of  Justice.   Ms. Gupta has devoted her career to public service and to protecting  and advancing the civil and constitutional rights we all cherish as  Americans. President Biden, Attorney General Garland, and Lisa Monaco,  the President's nominee to be Deputy Attorney General, have all made  clear Ms. Gupta would serve as an integral part of the leadership team  at the Justice Department. She would bring to that critical role a long  record of working with folks across the ideological spectrum in our  country on some of our Nation's most difficult and most sensitive  issues, some that are urgent and pressing like criminal justice reform  and policing.   Unfortunately, a campaign launched against Ms. Gupta shortly after  her nomination has painted a misleading portrait of her as a partisan  and a radical. I won't repeat or rehash these unfounded critiques, but  the fact is this caricature could not be further from the truth.   As letter after letter has come in from her supporters to the  Judiciary Committee, in which I serve, we heard over and over that, at  her core, Ms. Gupta is a person who seeks to build bridges, to  understand others' points of view, and to build consensus and solve  problems.   One of the elements of this campaign to mischaracterize her suggests  that somehow she is anti-police or anti-law enforcement, and, in this  particular instance, the distinction between those who worked with her  and know her and what we have heard in this social media campaign and  in our committee and here on the floor of the Senate could not be  sharper.   We heard from multiple leading national law enforcement organizations  that have worked with her in specific and clear and concrete terms. The  National Sheriffs' Association, in their letter of support, said:         Ms. Gupta has an open mind and a strong desire to       understand the viewpoint of each stakeholder. She is able to       find common ground with law enforcement.    They added:         [Ms. Gupta] possesses immense credibility among law       enforcement leaders.    And they said:         [She is] exactly the type of leader who is needed in the       Justice Department today.    From the Fraternal Order of Police:         She always worked with us to find common ground, even when       that seemed impossible. Her open and candid approach has       created a working relationship grounded in mutual respect and       understanding.    And the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association in their letter  said:         [Ms. Gupta has a] proven history of working with law       enforcement agencies . . . and elected officials across the       spectrum.    We even heard from a leading conservative advocate and activist,  Grover Norquist, the leader of Americans for Tax Reform. Mr. Norquist  wrote:         I have come to know and respect Ms. Gupta through our       common work on criminal justice reform issues. I found her       strongly qualified, effective, principled, driven by a desire       to seek common purpose and consensus. . . . At every step,       Ms. Gupta was an honest broker, someone with an ability to       understand, appreciate different perspectives, someone who       sought consensus.    Last but not least, we heard from Mark Holden, general counsel of  Koch  [[Page S1969]]  Industries, who worked with her on criminal justice reform and wrote  the committee saying:         I respected and admired how Ms. Gupta was not ideologically       driven, but principled and solutions-oriented. . . . Ms.       Gupta is a principled leader who seeks to find common ground       and will work with anyone committed to making the system       better and more effective.    I just plead with my colleagues to reflect for a moment: Are these  the sorts of letters that we would have received in support of someone  who is genuinely intolerant and in support of someone who is the  radical activist this misleading campaign has attempted to portray her  as being?   Instead, Vanita Gupta has demonstrated in her work and in her career  that she is pragmatic, she is principled, and she is a relationship  builder in search of solutions. Given this broad and bipartisan support  in the letters that came to us on the committee and as Members of this  body, I was surprised and disappointed that some of my colleagues on  the other side have continued to levee this misleading barrage of  unsubstantiated attacks.   So, in conclusion, I would ask my colleagues to consider her fairly  and to listen to the range and the scores of groups that have described  her as a principled, honest broker. She cares deeply about protecting  the civil rights and civil liberties of all Americans and about being  fairminded and taking into consideration all points of view. She will  bring that same approach to her service and leadership as Associate  Attorney General.   This should not be a party-line, partisan vote. Vanita Gupta is the  right leader at the right time to help our U.S. Department of Justice  tackle some very difficult issues, and I am pleased to stand in support  of her nomination and will vote for her confirmation.
