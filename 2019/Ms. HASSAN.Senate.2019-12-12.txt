 Mr. President, I am proud to recognize Melissa  Matthews and Belle Rae Zachesky/Copp of Raymond as December's Granite  Staters of the Month for seeking to turn their own grief into positive  change and mental wellness for their community.   In the last few months, both Melissa and Belle have lost someone dear  to them. Melissa lost her husband, Graham, to suicide on September 30,  2019; and her niece, 8-year-old Belle, lost her father, Jesse, to an  opioid overdose the next day, on October 1.   In response to their shared grief and to distract from their sadness  Melissa and Belle are seeking to raise awareness about the importance  of mental wellness in their community. Belle and Melissa have started  promoting wristbands with the slogan ``Lets change the `I' in mental  illness with `WE' for mental wellness,'' to help spread this important  message to others.   The two have also started a Facebook page to try to create an online  community of support and positivity. The group's name, MW Warriors--MW  standing for mental wellness--was inspired by the song ``Warrior'' by  singer Demi Lovato, who has struggled with drug addiction and  depression.   Their story is another inspiring example of how people across New  Hampshire come together during difficult times to support one another.  This is particularly true as the opioid crisis continues to ravage our  State, and it is crucial that we continue to be there for the loved  ones of those whom we have lost.   Melissa and Belle are trying to do the challenging but important work  of promoting positive change, all while battling their own loss and  channeling their energy to help others.   Thank you, Melissa and Belle, for your strength and courage.                            ____________________
