 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Buck), for yielding me the customary 30 minutes of  debate. I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, when the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action came before  Congress, I made my objections very clear. I believed then, as I do  now, that the Iran deal too quickly removed the sanctions that brought  Iran to the negotiating table in the first place, allowing Iran to  remain a nuclear threshold state.   However, like it or not, the JCPOA is now law, and it will be wrong  to undermine it for purely political reasons. Unfortunately, that is,  in my opinion, what my Republican colleagues are doing here today. This  is not the way to handle our country's foreign policy.   Mr. Speaker, the most important question that you need to ask  yourself at this time does not have to do with the substance of the  legislation this rule provides for, but, rather, why on Earth this body  is wasting what precious legislative time remains to bring these bills  to the floor today.   The checklist of important items that need to be addressed is long  and time is short. Thanks to the inability of my Republican colleagues  to govern, even within their own conference, we face the specter of yet  another government shutdown next week. The Band-Aid that Republicans  came up with last week to provide funding for the Children's Health  Insurance Program, which insures some 9 million children, expires at  the end of the year. Utah, Colorado, Arizona, California, Ohio,  Minnesota, the District of Columbia, and Oregon are just some of the  States that have had to inform families that CHIP funding is nearing  its end.   Why is this? Historically, the Children's Health Insurance Program  funding has been a largely bipartisan effort. And why shouldn't it be?  We are simply talking about helping to cover roughly 9 million low- income children and pregnant women.   It has been over 2 months since CHIP's authorization lapsed, and it  is far past time for a sensible solution to this problem. Does today's  legislation solve this issue? No, it does not.   We also have 800,000-plus DREAMers waiting for word from this  Republican-  [[Page H9856]]  controlled Congress. Will my friends across the aisle allow these fine  young people to remain in the only country they have ever known as  home? Will you let those DREAMers who have served this country bravely  stay in this country so that they may start their own families here in  the United States, start their own businesses, and go to college?    The idea that my friends would drag their feet on such an issue, let  alone actually allow DREAMers to be deported, is anathema to what this  country stands for, and it will darken the beacon this country has been  for millions of people since our founding: a place where those of  differing backgrounds but dedicated to freedom and the rule of law come  and make a life for themselves.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans control the House; they control the Senate;  they control the White House; and what has that control translated into  for the American people? Absolutely nothing at this point. In fact, it  is looking increasingly more like the first year of a unified  Republican government in over a decade will end with nothing getting  done.   In an attempt to distract from their failures, Republicans have taken  to blaming, and I quote them, ``obstructionist Democrats.'' They point  to this side of the aisle as the cause of their governing woes. That is  a neat trick, but the American people are not going to fall for it, and  I think you saw that last night in Alabama where new stars fell on  Alabama.   It wasn't the Democrats who tried to take healthcare away from 32  million people. It was Republicans. Thank goodness they failed. It is  not the Democrats who are trying to give the wealthy and rich  corporations a tax break on the backs of hardworking Americans. It is  the Republicans. I hope this equally misguided effort likewise fails.   I have some advice for my Republican friends. If, like this side of  the aisle, you spent more time working on policies that help the  American people instead of the wealthy and rich corporations that are  doing just fine, you would likely see more legislative success.   Democrats remain ready to work in a bipartisan way to accomplish all  that remains left to do this year. We are ready to fund the government  and provide for smart investments for the future of our country. We are  ready to pull the hundreds of thousands of DREAMers out of unnecessary  limbo and provide them with the status they deserve. We are ready to  provide the funding and authorization needed to give millions of low- income children the health insurance they need.   The list goes on and on. But, Mr. Speaker, if Republicans continue to  not even allow Democrats in the room to address these issues and if  they continue to burn legislative time on the bills we have before us  today, then it won't be just the Republican majority that pays the  price. It will be the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am expecting another speaker. If we defeat the  previous question, I am going to offer an amendment to the rule to  bring up the bipartisan bicameral bill H.R. 3440, the Dream Act.   Just last week, a group of 34 of my Republican colleagues sent a  letter to Speaker Ryan urging a vote before the year's end on  legislation that would protect the DACA recipients. This means, if we  defeat the previous question and bring up the Dream Act, the bill would  garner enough bipartisan support to pass the House today.   Mr. Speaker, I ask how much longer will this body be complicit in the  Trump administration's assault on DREAMers? It is time we listen to the  vast majority of Americans and this body and act to protect these  courageous young people.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, when my speaker arrives, I will allow Mrs.  Torres to discuss this matter further. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, continuing, we are faced, as I said earlier, with  another government shutdown. The National Flood Insurance Program,  which is particularly critical to those of us in coastal States, is set  to expire. The Republican Band-Aid to keep the Children's Health  Insurance Program funded will run out, leaving millions of children  without the healthcare they need.   The authorization of an important intelligence tool to keep this  country safe is set to expire, and millions of Americans in California,  Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands desperately wait to  find out if they will receive the resources they need to recover from  the devastating hurricanes and the wildfires that we have seen this  year and that are continuing in California.   I have said repeatedly that FEMA is not only dealing with hurricanes  and floods, they are dealing with tornadoes and with all sorts of  matters, and the wildfires manifestly have kept them occupied over the  course of time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Torres), my good friend, as I previously noted, to  discuss the proposal that I spoke of with reference to the DREAMers.    Mr. Speaker, I would advise my good friend that I have  no further speakers and I will be prepared to close when he is  prepared.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as we approach the end of 2017, and with just a few  legislative days left, the Republican majority is focusing on the wrong  things. Plain and simple, the bills before us today are more evidence  of that.   Over the next couple of weeks, we face a terrifyingly long to-do  list, the outcome of which will affect every single American.   Let me be very clear. My friend from Maine and my friend from Texas,  my friend from Maine, especially, passionately put forward significant  matters having to do with Iran. My recollection is that I, for one, as  did many members of the Democratic Party, voted for the transparency  that he calls for and are likely to do so again.   While this is an important matter, it is not nearly as critical at  this time that we be occupying this kind of legislative time. The  simple fact of the matter is we could have put this on the suspension  calendar and not been exercising ourselves in the Rules Committee,  occupying legislative time that could be addressing the Flood Insurance  Program, the Children's Health Insurance Program, and intelligence  tools that keep this country safe that are about to expire.   We could have been addressing the hurricane relief for Puerto Rico,  the Virgin Islands, and southwest Louisiana.   We could have been addressing the fires in California, Oregon,  Montana, and other areas of the country.   We could have been addressing the flood in Texas that devastated  portions of that area, as well as, during that same period of time, we  had tornadoes and other issues indicating how critical it is that we  support these matters.   We could have been dealing with a real infrastructure measure.  Everybody in this country knows that our roads and bridges are in  despicable shape at this point, and it is not as if we do not have the  ability to do something about it. We don't have the political will.   So we are wasting legislative time here today with these daunting  tasks before us, and this is what the Republican majority chooses to  focus on: trying to pass a tax bill, for example, that gives most of  the benefits to the wealthy and rich corporations while adding over  more than $1 trillion to the deficit.   I have said before: Look out. When we finish whatever this tax bill  is--and now it is being called what it is, a tax cut and not tax reform  that is needed in this country. When we finish with that, the next  words out of many of my colleagues' mouths next year are going to be,  ``We need to address the entitlements,'' meaning Medicare, Social  Security, and Medicaid. I can assure you that that is what we will hear  from my former deficit hawk friends who are now in charge of this  country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican friends, for the sake of the  American people, to abandon this reckless tact and return to regular  order. That is something that we are not doing and have not done. We  have had more closed rules in this session of Congress than in the  history of the United States Congress.   They need to work with Democrats in a bipartisan way. I think Alabama  told us that last night, and I hope that that message is pervasive and  allows for us in this body, as well as in the other body, to understand  the importance of everybody, all of these brilliant people that  Americans sent here to work, to work together to solve many of the  issues of this country and address its needs in a meaningful way, not  the needs of the wealthy few. Given everything there is to do, anything  less is abdication of our duty as legislators.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.
