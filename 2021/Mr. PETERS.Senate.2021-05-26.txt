 Madam President, this measure undermines Federal  Agencies' efforts to protect workers, consumers, our environment, and  public health. When Federal Agencies create regulations, they must look  at the full range of costs and benefits, including the impact on  employers, workers, and vulnerable groups.   This measure shuts out most of these voices. It is designed to push  Congress to repeal regulations without considering the concerns of  workers who rely on Federal safety standards or communities whose water  has been polluted by lead.   If Congress is concerned about a regulation, we already have tools to  make the needed changes--either passing a law or using procedures like  the Congressional Review Act. We need to move forward on bipartisan  policies that will improve our Nation's competitiveness, not measures  that will endanger our constituents and our communities. I urge my  colleagues to vote no on amendment 1929.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1929
