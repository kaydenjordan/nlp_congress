 Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentleman for yielding  the time.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand in full opposition to  Securing America's Future Act, H.R. 4760.   First of all, let me say that the only thing that the President's  executive order shows is that he is willing to rip families apart  unless it costs him politically. If there is a political price to pay,  then he will back up and try to confuse what is really going on. But at  the end of the day, this zero-tolerance policy is absolutely wrong and  we have to end it now.   Making unlawful presence a crime is probably a violation of  international law. This bill makes it difficult, makes it impossible  for people who are seeking asylum to come here and try to get their  cases adjudicated. They are running, in many cases, from the most  abominable situations imaginable. People should know that America is  the kind of place you can come to if you are seeking refuge.    Let me also say that this thing to build this wall, we will never  allow that. We will never agree to that, and we will oppose it with  everything we have because it is a symbol of hate and division.
