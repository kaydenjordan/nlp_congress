 Madam Speaker, when we passed the Paycheck Protection  Program, I warned that serious flaws would deliver a windfall to  businesses that did not need it at the expense of those that do. That  is exactly what happened, exhausting the fund within days.   Now it is imperative to replenish this program to assure that small  businesses that desperately need these funds receive them.   Now, this could have been done 2 weeks ago but for the Democrats'  demands that wasted time and added costs.   I supported the CARES Act only because I believed a better bill could  not be produced given the current majority.   For the same reason, I support the bill to be taken up later today,  but with this grave warning: unprecedented and unconstitutional  government edicts have deliberately destroyed the livelihoods of  millions of Americans and have set in motion both an economic  depression and government insolvencies that threaten the very survival  of our Nation. They must end now.
