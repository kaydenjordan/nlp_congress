 Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from the land of Lincoln  for the time to speak on this important bill this afternoon.   Mr. Chairman, I remember Houston in 1972, 45 years ago. Just like  today, we were the heart of America's energy and chemical industries.  But back then, there were far too many days I could not see downtown  from my home 25 miles away because of smog, ozone.   We have made amazing progress, Mr. Chairman. All of America has made  progress. Now it is rare when I can't see downtown from 40 miles away.  I am raising my family in the suburbs of Houston, Texas. I don't want  to see my hometown's air get any worse--or anyone else's, for that  matter.   I want that progress to continue. That is why this bipartisan bill,  H.R. 806, keeps us moving forward with more breathable, cleaner air.   Nothing in this bipartisan bill changes any air quality standard.  Nothing in this bill puts costs before science when EPA sets a new  standard.   I will say that again because there is a lot of misinformation out  there. This bill explicitly says that EPA can never ignore health data  and can never put money ahead of safety.   This commonsense bill is about listening to our job creators back  home. It is about giving local officials the tools they need to make  air rules work. It is about making sure that our communities aren't  penalized for pollution they can't control. It is about making sure  that, when EPA sets a standard, they have to put out the rules to  comply with that standard to our local communities at the exact same  time.   Mr. Chairman, this is commonsense, bipartisan legislation. I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 806 so we can keep cleaning up America's air  while growing our economy.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chairman, Texans like me believe that facts are  little, persistent things. With all due respect to my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle, apparently, facts are annoying little things.  Here are the facts about section 3(b) of my bill:   Section 3(b) states that if the EPA Administrator, in consultation  with the EPA's independent scientific advisory committee, finds a range  of levels of air quality that are needed to protect public health with  an adequate margin of safety, then ``the Administrator may . . . ''-- the Administrator may, not shall, not must, may--``as a secondary  consideration, likely technological feasibility in establishing and  revising the national primary ambient air quality standard for this  pollutant.''   Again, it clearly says may, not shall, not must, but may.   H.R. 806 does not change the Clean Air Act's requirement that  standards be based on the protection of public health. Again, H.R. 806  does not change the Clean Air Act's requirement that standards be based  on the protection of public health. This bill simply clarifies that the  EPA Administrator has the discretion to consider technological  feasibility when choosing among a range of levels identified and  supported by science as protective of public health.   This is a clarification for all future Administrators--Democrat or  Republican--that Congress considers technical feasibility to be a  reasonable part of the decisionmaking process with policy choices.  These policy choices must be made among a range of scientifically valid  options.   Again, facts are little, persistent things, and these are the facts  about section 3(b) of H.R. 806.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Chair, first of all, I appreciate my colleagues's  challenge back in the San Joaquin Valley. It is a very tough place with  ozone.   Fresno County is extreme for ozone, the San Joaquin Valley; Kern  County is extreme for ozone, the San Joaquin Valley; Kings County is  extreme for ozone, the San Joaquin Valley; Madera County is extreme for  ozone, the San Joaquin Valley; Merced County is extreme for ozone, the  San Joaquin Valley; San Joaquin County is extreme for ozone, the San  Joaquin Valley; Stanislaus County is extreme for ozone, the San Joaquin  Valley; Tulare County is extreme for ozone, the San Joaquin Valley.  That is a tough problem for your own district in the San Joaquin  Valley, but your amendment does not fix this problem in any way.   Under this bill, the amount of resources that EPA needs to review  proposed nonattainment designations and approving complex State  implementation plans under 2015 ozone standards will be greatly  reduced. EPA will do more with less. Therefore, EPA will be able to  carry out the new requirements of this bill within existing  authorizations, helping out the San Joaquin Valley.   This amendment is unnecessary because the bill will reduce the  implementation costs by eliminating redundant and overlapping Federal  regulatory requirements. Less red tape means lower implementation  costs.   States testified that the bill will reduce the cost of EPA in their  existing ozone programs while continuing to improve air quality and  reduce ozone emissions. Our States have an excellent track record for  cost-effective emission reductions over the last several decades.   The State of Maine sums up the point of this bill exactly, and they  have very little ozone problems. The director of Maine's Bureau of Air  Quality testified before our committee:         The changes, as proposed, in H.R. 806 to delay final       designations under the 2015 standard until 2025 and to extend       the timeframe for standard review from 5 to every 10 years,       including concurrently published clearly defined implementing       regulations, would allow the due process to be followed and       fulfilled. This would more effectively and efficiently       utilize Federal, State, and individual facility resources to       establish a standard and work for the improvement of air       quality and the protection of the people of our Nation.    This amendment is unnecessary. I urge my colleagues to oppose it, and  I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 1 minute  remaining, and the gentleman from Texas has 1 minute remaining.   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague and friend from  Texas pointing out that we have counties in San Joaquin Valley that  have extreme ozone problems, but to ask to do more with less is not  reasonable. It is the DERA grants given to the counties from the EPA's  budget that have allowed the agencies to have the 80 percent reduction  in air pollution.   So taking that money away is not going to help. It is going to make  matters worse. Our agencies aren't going to be able to do the things  that they have been able to do, and they are not going to be able to  continue those things. So I think saying that we can't put more money  into air pollution reduction is not the answer. We need to be able to  spend money to do this.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this bill ensures that EPA has the money to  help the San Joaquin Valley and every part of America that is  nonattainment for ozone with the funds they need as quickly as  possible. EPA will be more and more and more efficient. I urge  opposition to this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California  will be postponed.                   Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. McNerney    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6  printed in House Report 115-229.   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.

Pursuant to House Resolution 451, the gentleman  from California (Mr. McNerney) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.   Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 806 does have a couple of provisions that would be  helpful to the air district in my region to avoid economic sanctions  for failing to meet certain standards when very specific criteria are  met. However, the underlying bill, as a whole, is completely  unacceptable and has been called the most irresponsible attack on the  Clean Air Act health standards ever introduced.   The Clean Air Act works. It saves lives. It has improved the  environment. I am privileged to represent a portion of the San Joaquin  Valley which, as was pointed out in the prior amendment, has extreme  ozone problems.   We produce more than half of the Nation's fruits, nuts, and  vegetables. Unfortunately, the valley has recently been rebounding from  an economic downturn and is continually hurt by poor air quality.  Action is needed.   This amendment seeks to address the serious health issues that are a  direct result of the poor air quality in the San Joaquin Valley and  other regions that are most at risk. The amendment provides a grant  program for areas that are in nonattainment of PM 2.5, extreme  nonattainment of ambient air quality standards, and those with high  rates of asthma and unemployment. It requires a dollar-for-dollar  matching from the districts receiving the grant.   California has 7 of the top 10 most polluted metropolitan areas and  11 of the worst 25 nationwide. There are millions of people at risk in  the valley and south coast due to high levels of PM 2.5 and ozone,  including children, seniors, and those with chronic illnesses. San  Joaquin Valley counties received F grades for their air quality by the  American Lung Association.   Our kids deserve to be healthy, attend school, and live in a clean  air environment. Studies have shown that high-quality air standards  would prevent thousands of premature deaths in the valley and that it  would work to prevent heart attacks, emergency room visits, and missed  school- and workdays.   One study estimated that in the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale area,  about 2.9 million people missed work or schooldays and were otherwise  negatively affected from conducting normal activities due to poor air  quality.   Valley children miss hundreds of thousands of days of school each  year, and about one in five living in the valley has asthma. Illnesses  related to poor air quality cost the valley billions, annually.   H.R. 806 will be a step backward. That is why I have offered this  substitute amendment that would allow the EPA to target and work with  our Nation's most affected regions, like those in the valley and the  south coast. This is about addressing our environment, the air we  breathe, and helping those most at risk.   At the same time, California has been cleaning the air. Its economy  has continued to grow. In 2016, California's nonfarm employment  increased by 2.6 percent, compared to 1.7 percent nationwide. In 2009,  California's clean energy industry created $2.7 billion and employed  123,000 people. By 2020, we expect it to grow to over $140 billion with  345,000 employed. California's success is proof that H.R. 806 is  unnecessary.   I urge adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.
