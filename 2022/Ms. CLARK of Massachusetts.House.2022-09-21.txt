 Madam Speaker, January 6 is one of the  darkest days in American history. We now know in great detail how the  former President and his cronies were attempting to use the electoral  certification process to undermine our democracy to take away the  people's vote.   They tried to delegitimize a free and fair election with their lies,  subvert the results certified and sent by the States, and pressure a  Vice President into rejecting his constitutional responsibilities, all  of which erupted in violence, hate, and bloodshed right here in our  Capitol.   We walked through the blood and broken glass right outside of this  Chamber to cast our votes to uphold our democracy. Today, we must vote  for the Electoral Count Act to ensure that the rule of law and the will  of the people will always prevail in this Chamber and in this country.
