 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life and  legacy of my good friend and community organizer, Mary Criss, of Fort  Worth. Mary Criss was a mother, a wife, very organized in the  community, and was blessed to have lived a wonderful life.   She was so into I.M. Terrell; loved the I.M. Terrell Association and  being an alumnus and someone that was revered within that high school  alumni association.   In addition to that, she also worked to organize her community and  helped them get streetlights and stop signs put up in her Eastwood  community and Stop Six; and was a longtime precinct chair and supporter  of so many.   But more importantly than that, Mary Criss loved God and was a devout  member of Beth Eden Baptist Church. Mary was married for over five  decades to her husband, Carl, and raised her son, granddaughters, and  loved watching her grandson after school.   She was a family woman and just loved her family intensely. She will  be missed, not only by her family, but everyone in the community, the  I.M. Terrell Alumni Association community, and everyone that knew Mary  Criss.                            ____________________
