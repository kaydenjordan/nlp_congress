 Madam Speaker, we really appreciate Representative Smith.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in solemn memory of the 62 million  innocent lives who have been aborted since the tragic ruling on Roe v.  Wade.   Tellingly, earlier this week, as my wife of 48 years and I welcomed  our 17th grandchild into the world, I was reminded of just how precious  life really is.   Unfortunately, the Biden administration has already shown a blatant  disregard for the unborn of our Nation. The President has promoted  abortion at home and abroad by reversing the Mexico City policy and by  taking the first steps in rescinding a protect life rule known as Hyde.   Although the fight for life will be an uphill battle under this  particular administration, we will never give up. Life is just too  important. In our Declaration of Independence, it is written that we  have the right to life. That is the first of the inalienable rights  that we are granted, the right to life. And although the fight for life  will be tough this administration, we will resolve ourselves to  continue this battle.   At a time when Americans are so deeply divided in our Nation, I pray  to our good Lord above that we unite in the belief that life is  precious and it should be defended at all costs. May we be the  generation that will see Roe v. Wade overturned.
