 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss President Biden's  shortsighted decision to release 50 million barrels of oil from  America's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, depleting this national security  asset by nearly 10 percent when there is no oil supply shortage, only a  manmade one.   The United States' oil reserve is not a tool for the President to fix  his own political problems. Sadly, this administration throws money  away whenever the problems they create reflect poorly on them. We have  seen this with COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns and vaccine mandates keeping  people out of work, leftist political aims resulting in bad  legislation, and a flagrant disregard for the national debt all leading  to wasteful spending.   Rather than drain one of our essential national security assets to  temporarily mask the effects of their policies, this administration  should instead encourage our domestic, independent oil and gas  producers to take steps to get oil production back up. I shudder to  think that the President might drain another 10 percent of our  Strategic Petroleum Reserve 2 months from now if our oil production  continues to wane.   There are other solutions to this issue, like reinstating the  Keystone pipeline and encouraging oil production on Federal lands just  being two of them. Instead, this administration has canceled the  Keystone pipeline, which would make 860,000 barrels of oil available  daily, and has demanded a 50 percent fee increase for oil and gas  leasing on Federal lands.   Just 2 years ago, the United States was producing 2 million more  barrels of oil per day than we are now. We are down from 13 million  barrels per day to 11 million barrels per day. That means if we could  lift regulations and find creative strategies to get our oil production  back up, we could create 50 million barrels of oil in just 25 days  rather than dip into the emergency reserves.   Historically, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has only ever been used  in cases of natural disaster and war. With global unrest from COVID-19  and America's enemies looking to do us harm, this is not the time to  needlessly weaken a national security asset that exists to provide  energy to America in the event of an actual catastrophe in our country.   The only catastrophe in America right now is this administration's  bad policies. I oppose the President using our emergency oil reserves  in this brazen political tactic. This is unnecessary, irresponsible,  and dangerous.                         Waters of the United States     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in defense of Kansas farmers and  ranchers who have the right to manage their own resources without  overreaching regulation from the Federal Government.   The Biden administration is hurting farmers, ranchers, and ag- business owners. Recently, they withdrew from the Navigable Waters  Protection Rule which sought to undo the harm caused by the Waters of  the United States, or WOTUS, rule from 2015, through which the Federal  Government aimed to exact regulatory control over nearly all bodies of  water, regardless of their size or connection to larger waterways.  Because of this legislative mess, farmers and ranchers have had to  conduct their businesses under three different regulatory definitions  of water in just the past 6 years.   On a farm, water is the lifeblood of the operation, and farmers in  Kansas don't need the Federal Government to tell them how to take care  of it. Our farmers and ranchers are the original conservationists who  continually update their practices to reduce water use and inputs to  produce safe, affordable food while maintaining their water supply for  generations to come.   Instead of worrying about what farmers in Kansas are doing with their  puddles, the administration should instead focus on curbing inflation,  getting Americans back to work, fixing the supply chain, and securing  our borders.                                time  1030                         service academy nominations     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss one of my greatest  privileges as a Member of Congress, participating in the service  academy nominations process, which brings together my passions for  engaging with young people, leadership development, and military  service in this great country.   I am proud to come from a State with a rich history of military  service. President Eisenhower graduated from West Point in 1915, which  is why I felt it was appropriate to host our State's nomination process  in his Presidential library in Abilene, Kansas. After watching young  Kansas men and women go through the extensive and competitive  nomination exercise, one of the members of our selection committee  said: ``Meeting and working with these young people gives me hope for  the future of our country.''   In the United States, we have a long tradition of young American  patriots willingly embracing the duty to serve, to protect the  homeland, to keep the peace abroad, and to secure our rights. Leaders  serve, and I want to congratulate all the deserving young leaders who  are recipients of service academy nominations. I thank them from the  bottom of my heart for their willingness to sacrifice for this great  country.                            ____________________
