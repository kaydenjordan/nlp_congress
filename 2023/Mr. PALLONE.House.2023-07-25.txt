 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1345, the NTIA Policy and  Cybersecurity Coordination Act.   Protecting our Nation's communications networks is of vital  importance  [[Page H3919]]  to our national security. This is particularly important now when a  significant amount of our country's economic and social activity has  moved online, and consumers are connecting more devices to these  networks. We must build in safeguards to increase the safety of  communications networks to protect Americans while also promoting  innovation and competition.   H.R. 1345 will help us achieve these goals. This legislation  authorizes the existing Office of Policy Analysis and Development at  the NTIA and renames it as the Office of Policy Development and  Cybersecurity. It also codifies responsibilities of NTIA in  administering parts of the Secure and Trusted Communications Network  Act and requires the office to coordinate and develop policy  initiatives to enhance cybersecurity efforts with respect to our  communications networks.   The office will also be tasked with developing and analyzing policies  that promote innovation, competition, digital inclusion, and workforce  development in the communications, media, and technology markets.   I thank Representatives Wild and Curtis for their bipartisan work on  this bill, which will ensure that there is a firm foundation within the  Federal Government to oversee the security of our Nation's  communications networks.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that  unanimously advanced out of the Energy and Commerce Committee early  this year, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I think this is an important bill, and I  urge everyone to support it on both sides of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1338, the Satellite And  Telecommunications Streamlining Act, or the SAT Streamlining Act.   Within the last decade, satellite capabilities have jumped leaps and  bounds. We have seen significant advancements in satellites providing  broadband internet and other services to consumers and the public  throughout the country and the world. While this is beneficial to all,  it is especially helpful to those living in areas where other types of  technologies have not been built out yet due to geographic  considerations and other factors.   These technological breakthroughs are a positive step forward for our  country, but it is evident that other countries, including our foreign  adversaries, are also aggressively trying to dominate this industry. It  is imperative that Congress act now to retain our country's leadership  position in the satellite marketplace.   H.R. 1338 helps to accomplish this goal. This bill will enhance the  competitiveness of our Nation's satellite industry by requiring the FCC  to set reasonable rules to prevent harmful interference as satellites  utilize spectrum to communicate with one another and with base stations  on Earth. It does not expand the FCC's jurisdiction over the space  industry. Instead, it sets new rules of the road with respect to the  licensing of electromagnetic spectrum, which is needed to operate  satellite systems.   For instance, it establishes application requirements for the  licensing of the spectrum and sets forth the guidelines for how and  when the FCC should consider these applications and the timeframes for  doing so.   We must implement these solutions to ensure the United States remains  competitive with our counterparts across the globe, including China, in  producing cutting-edge consumer innovations and fortifying our public  safety and national security capabilities.   The Energy and Commerce Committee, Mr. Speaker, has traditionally  worked in a bipartisan fashion on key telecommunications matters, and I  commend Chair Rodgers for continuing this tradition with this  legislation. Unfortunately, though, another bipartisan bill that I led  with Chair Rodgers that unanimously passed out of the committee would  have directly addressed the threat of adversaries deploying their  satellite systems for use by U.S. customers. H.R. 675, the Secure Space  Act, would extend the framework Congress adopted in the bipartisan  Secure and Trusted Communications Network Act to satellite operators.  This framework ensures that foreign adversaries cannot use our  communications network for espionage and disruption.                                time  1730    The Energy and Commerce Committee, and then the full Congress passed  last year then-Minority Whip Scalise's bipartisan legislation to extend  that framework to the FCC's equipment authorization process.   It surprised and disappointed me that some members of the Republican  caucus are objecting to the Secure Space Act--again, a bill passed  unanimously out of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Unfortunately, it  can't go forward without amendments limiting its scope, and therefore  its effect, in keeping unquestionably bad actors from infiltrating our  networks.   We should be passing this bill today rather than allowing a small  extreme minority in the House Republican caucus to have veto power over  a policy that is so important to our national security and that a  significant majority of this House favors. It is unfortunate that the  Republican majority continues to cave to the extreme elements of their  party.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1338,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I listened to what Mr. Beyer said, and I know that some  of the leadership on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee are  opposed to this bill. I will say that despite the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee's claims, H.R. 1338, the Satellite And  Telecommunications Streamlining Act does not infringe on the Science,  Space, and Technology Committee's jurisdiction or grant the FCC new  authority with respect to space safety and orbital debris.    Instead, this bill streamlines existing FCC licensing procedures so  the commercial satellite operators can more easily obtain the necessary  spectrum rights to launch their satellite systems into space.   Because the bill deals directly with access to spectrum and the FCC's  management of it, this legislation falls squarely within the  jurisdiction of the Energy and Commerce Committee.   To the extent the bill references space safety and orbital debris, it  is in the context of ensuring that the FCC acts within the bounds of  the rules adopted by the U.S. Government for orbital debris mitigation.   Specifically, the language in the bill simply directs the FCC to  align any licensing requirements that it may impose on satellite  operators concerning orbital debris and space safety--which it can do  today consistent with its existing authority--with the orbital debris  and space safety practices established by NASA and others.   Mr. Speaker, mandating such action is good government as it reduces  the likelihood of conflicting standards or requirements and ensures  that government continues to speak with one voice on these important  matters.  [[Page H3927]]                                     time  1745    Nevertheless, recognizing the Science Committee's concerns, language  has now been added to the bill to make it crystal clear that this  legislation does not give the FCC any new authority on space safety and  orbital debris.   Finally, for those Members suggesting that the Department of Commerce  does not support this bill, I want to be clear that this is not true.  In reality, the Department of Commerce has not taken a position on this  bill.   For all these reasons, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1338 is a worthwhile bill, I  urge all my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this bill on a bipartisan basis. The  committee voted this out, again, on a bipartisan basis. I think it is  very important, and I assure my Science Committee colleagues this does  not impinge on their jurisdiction.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 682, the Launch  Communications Act.   Over the last decade, we have seen the costs of exploring space drop  drastically. As a result, space launches in this country have increased  dramatically. In 2013, the FAA authorized eight launches, but by 2022,  less than a decade later, the number was 79. The number of space  launches from the United States is only expected to increase in the  years to come. We must foster and support this growth in order to  enhance our national security capabilities and cement our Nation as a  global leader in space and other cutting-edge technologies.   Transporting satellites to space cannot happen without launch  entities having reliable access to electromagnetic spectrum. Right now  the FCC only temporarily allocates spectrum for space launches.  Nevertheless, this process is becoming increasingly burdensome given  rise in the number of space launches occurring in our country. For the  United States to continue its leadership in space, it is imperative  that the FCC develop an efficient and effective process to license  spectrum for commercial space launches, as well as the space reentries  that inevitably must follow.   Now, H.R. 682 addresses these challenges. Specifically, this bill  requires the FCC to streamline its process for allocating spectrum  usage rights to commercial space launch providers. These efforts will  better support these providers as they communicate with their launch  vehicles during flight and upon reentry. The bill also directs the FCC  to complete a rulemaking proceeding to adopt service rules for the  spectrum bands identified in the bill for commercial space launches and  commercial space reentries.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Representatives Soto and Dunn for their  bipartisan work on this bill. This important bill helps secure  America's leadership in the commercial space industry by strengthening  our country's position as a prime destination for launching satellites  into space.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation in a  bipartisan  [[Page H3929]]  manner, I look forward to its consideration in the Senate, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Soto), the Democratic sponsor of this bill and a graduate  of Rutgers University.    Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill coming out of the  Energy and Commerce Committee. I urge support for this very important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2544, the Securing the U.S. Organ Procurement and  Transplantation Network Act, seeks to improve the Organ Procurement and  Transplantation Network, or OPTN.   This network, which is operated by the Health Resources and Service  Administration, or HRSA, is responsible for maintaining a national  registry for organ matching, and it is operated by a private  organization under Federal contract.   A number of investigations in the past few years have found that the  OPTN struggles to obtain and distribute organs in a timely and  efficient manner. In fact, more than 6,000 Americans die each year  while waiting for organ transplants. This problem is even more  pronounced for people of color and rural residents.   More than 100,000 Americans are currently on the transplant waiting  list, and 17 Americans die each day awaiting transplants. This is  entirely unacceptable, and we need to do better for the many patients  who rely on the OPTN. The OPTN needs to be improved and modernized in a  number of ways.   HRSA has undertaken a number of efforts to modernize the OPTN, and  this bill, H.R. 2544, complements those efforts. It would ensure that  HRSA has the authority to award multiple contracts to carry out the  many functions of the OPTN. It would also make the OPTN contracts more  competitive in order to increase oversight and transparency and to  enhance the performance of the program.   The organ transplantation network is a lifesaving system that is in  desperate need of repair. This bill will go a long way to improve it,  and it is a huge win for some of the most vulnerable patients in this  country.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Bucshon and Kelly for their  bipartisan leadership on this bill. I am pleased that it is before us  today, and I encourage all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 752, the Securing  Semiconductor Supply Chains Act.   Semiconductors are necessary for the production of everything from  consumer electronics to automobiles to our national defense weapons  systems.   The United States was once a global powerhouse in semiconductor  fabrication, but over the years, it has become dangerously reliant on  other countries for the production of these chips, which are vital to  both our national economic and security interests.   That is why I was proud to lead the effort last Congress when  Democrats were in the majority here in the House to pass and enact the  CHIPS and Science Act. This law was transformational. It will  strengthen our manufacturing base to grow our economy for the future,  help create good-paying jobs for American workers, unleash more  innovation, and lower costs for consumers. It does this by investing  more than $52 billion into domestic semiconductor research,  development, and production so that more of these semiconductors are  built here in the United States by American workers.   When you travel to the industrial heartland, spend time in our  industrial communities, and talk to hardworking, middle-class Americans  whose manufacturing jobs have been sent offshore, it is clear that we  still have to do more. H.R. 752 will provide valuable information about  how we can increase foreign direct investment to further advance our  efforts to strengthen the semiconductor supply chains, create more  jobs, and continue to revitalize American manufacturing.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Representatives Eshoo and Pence for their  bipartisan leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo), the Democratic sponsor of this bill and the  ranking member of our Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on  Health.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to close.   I urge support for this bipartisan bill, which continues our efforts  to deal with chips, basically a follow-up on the CHIPS and Science Act,  which was so important in bringing back American manufacturing and  American innovation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  bipartisan bill to extend the authority for the Department of Homeland  Security's Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program  for another two years. The CFATS program provides critical national  security protections for chemical facilities and for the people who  work and live near these facilities. We should all be alarmed that it  is on the verge of lapsing.   Unfortunately, we have come down to the wire again to reauthorize  this program. Without passage of this bill, the CFATS program will  expire in two days. The program is not perfect, but it should be  continued. This two-year extension will give the committees of  jurisdiction time to consider important improvements to the program  without fear that the program will lapse. To that end, Homeland  Security Committee Chairman Green has begun the process of creating a  CFATS reauthorization working group and Energy and Commerce Committee  Democrats plan to be vocal members. We are prepared to push for our  jurisdictional priorities in those conversations, specifically  advocating for environmental justice communities, first responders, and  worker safety.   Chemical facility safety is not only important to the Energy and  Commerce Committee, but also to my home state of New Jersey, where the  high concentration of industrial chemical facilities coupled with  densely populated cities makes safety and security of these facilities  of the utmost importance. Programs like CFATS and the EPA's Risk  Management Plan program are critical to maintaining the health and  safety of the people who live and work near these facilities, so the  consequences of this program expiring are as personal to me as they are  dire to the safety of our country.   The last few weeks have brought record heat waves, Canadian  wildfires, and catastrophic flooding, all markers of what is to come.  And yet, House Republicans continue to turn a blind eye to the  devastating impacts of the climate crisis. Instead, they work to  rollback our historic investments in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law  and the Inflation Reduction Act and make drastic cuts to critical  programs across the board. It would be dangerous of Congress to believe  that these same extreme weather events don't have the potential to  undermine and threaten our nation's chemical facilities.   We must work in a bipartisan fashion to ensure the safety and  security of the workers, first responders, and communities living near  our nation's chemical facilities. That means extending this program  while taking serious  [[Page H3934]]  steps to improve it for the future. So, I thank my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the  Homeland Security Committee for working to ensure the continuity of  this program. I urge my colleagues to support passage.
