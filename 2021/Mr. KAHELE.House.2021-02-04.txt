 Mr. Speaker, my ohana is from the last native Hawaiian  fishing village in Hawaii, Milolii. You have likely never heard of  Milolii, and if you haven't heard of the small fishing village of  Milolii, then you probably haven't heard of Kalapana.   Kalapana, like Milolii, is an ocean community, but Kalapana sits in  the shadow of the volcano Kilauea. For decades, this area has been  shaped by the various destructive lava flows that have flowed through;  but no matter how many times this happened, the people of Kalapana  remained resilient and proud of their community.   Mr. Speaker, I can think of no one who embodied the pride and  resilience of being Kalapana born and raised than William  Punapaia'alaikahala Kenoi, known to most as Hawaii Island Mayor Billy  Kenoi. Billy Kenoi would proudly talk about the papaya fields of  Kalapana and the mentors who helped him see the world outside of them.  Their inspiration took him from the slopes of Kilauea to the University  of Massachusetts at Amherst.   From there, the boy from Kalapana walked with reverence through these  very Halls, which he regarded as a heiau, or spiritual center of  democracy, as a congressional intern with the legendary Senator Daniel  K. Inouye. He then went on to attend the William S. Richardson School  of Law at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.   As he moved through his career, he remained that same resilient and  proud kid from Kalapana. He worked for justice as a public defender  with indigent clients. He moved home to Hawaii Island as a public  servant, dedicated to helping his island weather the crystal meth  crisis that was ravaging our communities. His leadership in crisis,  born of the lava flows and fields of Kalapana, eventually translated to  leadership at the island level, when he was elected as Hawaii County  mayor in 2008.   Nobody could deny Billy's charm, keen political drive, and  charismatic leadership. And for all his high-level leadership and  larger-than-life personality, he left his mark in the individual  interactions he had with people, always kind and authentic. Some of us  had the fortune of getting to know him as a friend. For me, he was also  a mentor.   I will always remember Martin Luther King Day 2016, because it was  the day my father had a heart attack and passed away a week later. In  the chaotic hours after he passed, there were too many calls and texts  of support to count and certainly too many to answer. Despite all of  this, one person's grief persisted and pierced through the profound  grief: Billy Kenoi.   Billy called, asked where I was, and told me to come to the State  Capitol. He said, ``It was time.'' I didn't know what he meant by that.  My father had just passed, but when Billy spoke, I listened. When a man  who was once a boy from Kalapana calls you in the middle of a family  crisis, you know that he summons with it the resilience and strength of  an island community that persisted through lava flow after lava flow.   I went to the State Capitol, to the desk of my father in the State  Senate, surrounded by his colleagues, and my life was forever changed.  Five years to the day after he passed, Billy Kenoi went into po  himself, and he crossed into the afterlife. He left behind a beautiful  wife, Takako, and three children, Justin, Liam, and Mahina. He was only  52. And like my father, he was too important a leader to lose too soon.   Billy was the personification of Kalapana. No matter what change life  threw at him, he embraced it with pride, resilience, and a sense of  humor. As Hawaii is now altered by the passing of this leader, we will  conjure his spirit and the spirit of Kalapana. We will remember the boy  from Kalapana who became the incomparable leader Billy Kenoi.   Colleagues, I leave you with words from his final speech--and he was  famous for speeches--to remember him and take us to a more resilient  and prouder future: If impossible is nothing, then everything is  possible.                            ____________________
