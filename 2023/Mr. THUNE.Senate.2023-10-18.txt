 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Israel and the world are still reeling from  the surprise attack by Hamas on October 7 that left somewhere around  1,400 Israelis and at least 31 Americans dead. In scale and scope, the  attack carried echoes of our 9/11. And as on 9/11, life changed in an  instant.   I came down to the floor yesterday to talk about these attacks and  the United States' commitment to standing with the Israeli people  against terrorism. And today, I would like to talk about another  important point these attacks raise: the importance of our national  defense and military readiness.   It has been said that ``Only the dead have seen the end of war.'' We  live in a fallen world. And as long as we live in a fallen world, there  will be evil men bent on aggression. And if we wish to continue living  in peace and freedom, we must be always ready to defend against such  men. Military preparedness is an essential and constant need. There is  never a time where we can guarantee our peace and safety, and so there  is never a time when we can afford to be ill-prepared to defend our  peace and safety.   As citizens of the United States--an immense country with a  reputation for military strength--it can be easy to become complacent  and to assume that we will always be able to deter or defeat attacks,  but that is a dangerous assumption. As strong as we are, we are not  invulnerable, and we are not the only great power out there. And if we  don't make the necessary investments in our military to back up our  reputation of strength, we may find our ability to deter hostile  countries quickly waning.   And the fact of the matter is, our military preparedness is not where  it should be. Thanks to budgetary impasses and increased operational  demands, by 2018, our readiness had eroded to the point that the  bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission released a report  warning that we might struggle to win a war against a major power like  Russia or China.   And while we have made progress since then, we are still a long way  from where we need to be. We have military services that are struggling  to meet recruiting targets. There is a persistent pilot shortage, and  in a number of cases, we have too few mission-capable aircraft. And we  are not doing an adequate job of maintaining the kind of supply we need  of munitions.   That is not an acceptable situation for us to be in, and it could  have very serious consequences. To give you just one example, recent  U.S. war games envisioning a United States-China conflict following an  attack on Taiwan have had grim results, showing enormous military and  economic costs on both sides. One story on these war games noted: And  while the ultimate outcome in these exercises is not always clear--the  U.S. does better in some than others--the cost is clear. In every  exercise, the U.S. uses up all its long-range air-to-surface missiles  in a few days, with a substantial portion of its planes destroyed on  the ground.   Let me just repeat that last line:         In every exercise, the U.S. uses up all its long-range air-      to-surface missiles in a few days, with a substantial portion       of its planes destroyed on the ground.    That is not a promising scenario, and it highlights our serious  readiness shortages, shortages that other countries may not share.  China, which is investing heavily in its military, is outpacing our  military in modern capabilities like hypersonic missiles and has  amassed a larger navy. And while Russia is currently expending its  military resources in its war of aggression against Ukraine, it too  does not hesitate when it comes to military investment.   We have serious work to do on the readiness front. And as I said, we  have made progress since 2018. But we still have a long way to go to  ensure that our military is fully prepared to meet and deter 21st  century threats, and this is a priority we need to address now, not  when we are waking up one morning reeling from an attack on our country  or on Americans abroad, but right now.    Investing in our military after we are threatened or attacked is too  late. We can't scale up defense capabilities in an instant or suddenly  produce an adequate supply of munitions out of thin air. We need to get  and keep--and keep--our military where it needs to be on the readiness  front so that we can deter threats and meet them, if needed, with  overwhelming force.   And boosting our strength is important for our friends and allies as  well. We can't and shouldn't send troops into every conflict, and we  can't solve all the world's problems. But sooner or later, world events  do affect us, and we can't retreat from the world stage and allow  maligned powers to fill the resulting vacuum, nor can we afford to  concentrate on one threat or area of the world to the exclusion of  others. Putin's war in Ukraine and Hamas's attack on Israel should be  ample reminders that threats can come from both great powers and non- state actors alike.   So we need to get to work, and that should start with passing a final  version of this year's National Defense Authorization Act and making  progress on our annual appropriations bills, including the defense  appropriations bill. And we should also take up a supplemental to  provide the necessary support to our allies and to ensure that we  provide any additional funding needed for our own military.   October 7 was the latest reminder that we live in a fallen and  dangerous world. Let us ensure that we always are prepared to preserve  the peace and to defend our Nation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Kentucky (Mr. Paul).   The result was announced--yeas 53, nays 44, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 260 Leg.]                                  YEAS--53       Barrasso      Blackburn      Boozman      Braun      Britt      Budd      Capito      Cassidy      Collins      Cornyn      Cotton      Cramer      Crapo      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Graham      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hickenlooper      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Johnson      Kennedy      King      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Manchin      Marshall      McConnell      Moran      Mullin      Murkowski      Ricketts      Risch      Romney      Rounds      Rubio      Schmitt      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Sinema      Sullivan      Tester      Thune      Tillis      Tuberville      Vance      Wicker      Young                                  NAYS--44       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Coons      Cortez Masto      Duckworth      Fetterman      Gillibrand      Hassan      Heinrich      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      Klobuchar      Lujan      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Reed      Rosen      Sanders      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Smith      Stabenow      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Welch      Whitehouse      Wyden                               NOT VOTING--3       Butler      Durbin      Paul   The joint resolution (S.J.
