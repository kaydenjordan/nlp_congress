 Madam Speaker, any trust that Dr. Fauci might have  gained over the course of the pandemic is now completely out the  window. He must resign and his case be referred for prosecution for  perjury.   For the past year and a half, critical decisions for the whole  country have hinged off of Dr. Fauci's advice and decrees. Two  Presidents have used his advice as the basis for our Nation's response  to COVID-19. Yet, here we have clear proof that he has been  intentionally lying to Congress.   How can any American trust his judgment or that he will tell them the  truth when he can look Members of Congress in the eye and boldly lie  about the gain-of-function research?   Dr. Fauci has repeatedly testified in the House and Senate that the  National Institutes of Health did not fund research that was gain of  function, and he had a heated exchange over the specific claim with  Senator Rand Paul.   The NIH notified Congress that it was aware, as of 2018 and 2020,  that EcoHealth Alliance did conduct gain-of-function research at the  Wuhan Institute of Virology in China. This research was not allowed  under the grant's rules.   EcoHealth Alliance had also sought a grant from DARPA in 2018 but was  denied funding because they were worried that it might be potentially  gain-of-function research.   Dr. Fauci must resign and must be prosecuted.                            ____________________
