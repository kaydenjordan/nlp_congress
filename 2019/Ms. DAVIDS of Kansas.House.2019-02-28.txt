 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues,  Representatives Cleaver, Watkins, and Larsen, for cosponsoring this  bipartisan piece of legislation to designate the Quindaro Townsite in  Kansas City, Kansas, as a national commemorative site. I would also  like to thank Senator Pat Roberts for his important leadership on this  issue.   The bill that passed this week honors the significant history of  Quindaro, which served as a key stop on the Underground Railroad and  helps preserve the site for future generations.   Quindaro is an important part of United States and Kansas history in  the fight for freedom and equality. It serves as a reminder of a dark  chapter in our Nation's history.   Sadly, for too long, the Quindaro Townsite has lacked proper  investments needed to preserve it as a historic site. But the community  leaders in Kansas never gave up on fighting for Quindaro, people like  Marvin Robinson a Kansas City, Kansas, native who spent over 30 years  working for this legislation to pass.   He now plans to use the site to improve racial relations in the  community and to educate people about our shared history.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to protect Quindaro's history and keep its  stories alive for future generations.                            ____________________
