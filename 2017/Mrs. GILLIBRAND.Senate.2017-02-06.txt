 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded    Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the nomination  of Senator Sessions for Attorney General.   I would like to preface my remarks with just a statement and  recognition of the outpouring I have received from my State, from  constituents. I have letters. I have postcards sent, some with the  Statue of Liberty. I have letters from constituents from every corner  of my State, passionately writing about their views on President  Trump's nominations, particularly Senator Sessions.   I would like to read one letter because I think it really summarizes  the views of so many New Yorkers. This constituent writes:         As your constituent and as a Reform Jew, I strongly urge       you to oppose the nomination of Jeff Sessions as Attorney       General.        As the top law enforcement official in the country, the       Attorney General has substantial power over the       administration of key legislation that advances the       fundamental rights of all people, regardless of race, class,       sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin.       Senator Sessions' firmly established record of opposition to       protection of and advancements in voting rights, LGBTQ       equality, women's rights, immigration reform and religious       freedom suggests that he would not fulfill the Department of       Justice's mandate to provide equal protection under the law       for all people.    The letter goes on to talk about his votes particularly against the  Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act when it  was added as an amendment to the 2008 Defense Authorization Act. He  also talks about voting against the Violence Against Women's Act.   He continues:         The words of Leviticus 19:18: ``Love your neighbor as       yourself, guide us to stand up against bias, prejudice and       discrimination.''        We cannot place the responsibility of leading the       Department of Justice, the federal agency directly       responsible for ensuring equal protection, in the hands of       someone whose record demonstrates insufficient commitment to       key civil rights protections.        I urge you to oppose Senator Sessions.    Our country desperately needs an Attorney General who will reject  discrimination in all forms. We need an Attorney General who will  defend our civil rights and human rights--with no exceptions. We need  an Attorney General who will not be afraid to challenge the President  if an order is illegal or unconstitutional.   Senator Sessions has not made it clear that he would use his power as  Attorney General to stand up for the voiceless and the oppressed or to  stand up to the President when he is wrong.   Already, in just the first weeks of this new administration,  President Trump has begun to test the strength and limits of our  Constitution. He has challenged the separation of powers. He has lashed  out against the free press. He has singled out individual religions-- and even individual judges.   Now, more than ever, we need an Attorney General whose commitment to  defending our Constitution goes far beyond the commitment to any one  particular President or political party. Would Senator Sessions  challenge the President when he needs to be challenged?   During the Presidential campaign, when the tape was revealed of then- Candidate Trump bragging about groping a woman against her will,  Senator Sessions said he thought it was a ``stretch'' to call it sexual  assault. He said: ``I don't characterize that as sexual assault.''   We need an Attorney General who knows very clearly what sexual  assault is, and who cares enough to prosecute it.   Senator Sessions has voted to make our gun background check system  even weaker. He voted against limits on high-capacity magazines, and he  opposed legislation to make interstate gun trafficking a Federal crime.   We need an Attorney General who will stand up for victims of gun  violence and their families.   Throughout his career in the Senate, Senator Sessions has voted  against or spoken out against important legislation so important to my  constituents, including the Violence Against Women's Act, the Lilly  Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and the Voting Rights Act. These are important  pieces of legislation that protect individuals from discrimination.   We need an Attorney General who will defend the rights of women, who  will defend the rights of our communities of color, who will defend the  rights of the LGBT community, and who will defend the rights of Muslim  Americans, and all minorities.   We need an Attorney General who will fight every day for equal  justice and equal protection under the law.   Senator Sessions has no record of doing that, and I have no reason to  believe that he will do that as Attorney General. So I oppose Senator  Sessions' nomination as Attorney General, and I urge my colleagues to  do the same.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I referred to  be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         As your constituent and as a Reform Jew, I strongly urge       you to oppose the nomination of Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL)       as U.S. Attorney General.        As the top law enforcement official in the country, the       Attorney General has substantial power over the       administration of key legislation that advances the       fundamental rights of all people, regardless of race, class,       sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin.       Senator Sessions' firmly-established record of opposition to       protection of and advancements in voting rights, LGBTQ       equality, women's rights, immigration reform and religious       freedom suggests that he would not fulfill the Department of       Justice's mandate to provide equal protection under the law       for all people.        Senator Sessions has called the Voting Rights Act of 1965       `intrusive.' He vocally opposed the Matthew Shepard and James       Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act when it was added as an       amendment to the 2008 Defense Authorization Act because it       added sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of       classes protected under federal hate crimes law. In addition,       Senator Sessions joined 21 other senators to vote against the       2012 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which       included new protections for immigrants and LGBTQ people.       Finally, he staked out positions that put him far outside the       mainstream as the Senate considered and passed comprehensive       immigration reform legislation in 2013 and has expressed       support for a religious test for entry into the country.        The words of Leviticus 19:18, `love your neighbor as       yourself,' guide us to stand up against bias, prejudice and       discrimination. We cannot place the responsibility of leading       the Department of Justice, the federal agency directly       responsible for ensuring equal protection, in the hands of       someone whose record demonstrates insufficient commitment to       key civil rights protections.        I urge you to oppose Senator Sessions' nomination and to       vote against his confirmation on the Senate floor.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
