 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  National Police Week, and the brave, dedicated, and selfless heroes who  work tireless long hours to keep the public safe in communities across  this country.   This is deeply personal to me, as someone whose own loved ones wear a  badge, and as someone who worked for nearly 18 years as a 9-1-1  dispatcher for the Los Angeles Police Department.   So I want to take this moment to say thank you, not just to the men  and women in uniform on our streets, but also to their counterparts in  service who answer the call whenever someone dials 911.   Dispatchers have a unique vantage on police work--they know how  harrowing the situations police officers face are; how important police  work is to people in their most vulnerable moments; and how committed  officers are to serving the public.   After all, dispatchers are the ones who answer those calls for help  in the first place.   But dispatchers also play a key role in keeping our officers safe.  They gather situational awareness, so our officers know what to expect  when they approach a scene; they send backup when more support is  needed; and they send medical help if the unthinkable happens and an  officer is hurt.   So as we honor those who serve, let's also honor the people who keep  them safe every step of the way.   Public safety workers of all types are under new stresses right now  as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the uptick in gun violence  that is tragically endemic to the United States.   So as we honor this valiant profession and acknowledge the harrowing  circumstances they face, we must also take time to make sure they have  the support they need, from PPE to mental health reources and  everything in between.   Today, Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize National Police Week  and the men and women who keep us safe at great personal sacrifice, and  at great sacrifice to their own families.                            ____________________
