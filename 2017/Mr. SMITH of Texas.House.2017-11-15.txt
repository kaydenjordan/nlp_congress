 Mr. Speaker, the Pew Research Center recently  studied how the media covered the first 60 days of each recent  administration. Not surprisingly, 62 percent of the media coverage of  President Trump was negative, compared to 20 percent for President  Obama and 28 percent for Presidents Bush and Clinton.   As Investor's Business Daily put it: ``The media from the get-go had  decided Trump was a bad President--before any of his policies had a  chance to take hold.''   Now that his policies have taken hold and improved the economy, the  media still does not want President Trump to succeed. You have seldom  heard or read a word about our strong economic growth, the record- breaking stock market, high consumer confidence, and the record-high  household income.   The liberal media seldom highlight this news because they would have  to credit President Trump's successful policies. When the liberal media  give the American people the facts and present the news objectively,  they will have earned our trust. Until then, they just serve as another  biased source of information.                            ____________________
