 Mr. Speaker, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, is home to  some of the most thoughtful and compassionate people in the Nation.  This was on full display earlier this month when parents and students  from the Howard Hersch Religious School at Congregation Brothers of  Israel held a reception for first responders, called Hearts for Our  Heroes.   Held at the Newtown Township Building, first responders in attendance  received letters of appreciation and cookies for their service and  their sacrifice. Students also sang a song of gratitude to the heroes  in our community.   I would like to honor several people, Mr. Speaker, who played a  pivotal role in ensuring that our community's first responders received  the recognition they deserve: Joan Hersch, Congregation Brothers of  Israel Religious School director; and Janet Barudin and Amy Stinson,  who co-chair the congregation's Caring Committee; as well as Rabbi  Aaron Gaber.   I would also like to extend my gratitude to all first responders in  Newtown Township and throughout Bucks County for all they do to keep us  safe.                       Recognizing Judge Rea B. Boylan     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  remarkable career of a public servant in Bucks County, Pennsylvania,  who will be retiring at the end of her term.   Judge Rea Boylan, a resident of Hilltown, has spent 20 years on the  bench and is the most tenured member of the Bucks County court of  common pleas.   In her years of service, Judge Boylan has worked in the public  defender's office, the office of the district attorney, and also was  Bucks County controller before her judgeship.   Throughout Judge Boylan's tenure, she has been known as a fair judge  who is not afraid to hold people accountable and always seeks to  rehabilitate those in need.   Notably, her work with juveniles and those struggling with addiction  truly embodies her dedication to both justice and fairness.   I wish Judge Boylan all of the best in her retirement, and I speak on  behalf of all of Bucks County when we thank her wholeheartedly for her  service.      Congratulating North Penn High School Swimming Coach Jeff Faikish     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate North Penn  High School swimming coach Jeff Faikish for being named Pennsylvania  Coach of the Year for girls swimming and diving during the 2017-2018  school year.   The National Federation of State High School Associations awards  coaches who exemplify the high standards of sportsmanship, ethical and  moral character, and have received the endorsement of their State high  school association.   Last fall, the North Penn High School swim team won the State  championship and, under John's leadership, has competed in seven State  championship meets.   Mr. Speaker, we congratulate John for receiving this honor and all  the athletes of the North Penn girls swim team for their outstanding  achievements. We wish them all continued success in their future  endeavors.                            ____________________
