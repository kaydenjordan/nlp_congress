 Madam President, first, I would like to associate myself  with the comments of the Senator from Oklahoma and thank him for all of  the work he has done on this.   The Abraham Accords are really something to celebrate, something that  we should be building on. And there is not a lot of good news right now  on a whole bunch of scores, and this is worth celebrating. So  commendations on your resolution.   Something we shouldn't be celebrating is inflation, and I wasn't  invited, but it looks like there was one heck of a party this week at  the White House.   In case folks missed it, President Biden, Majority Leader Schumer,  Speaker Pelosi, and others gathered on the south lawn of the White  House on Tuesday afternoon to clink champagne glasses and celebrate the  so-called Inflation Reduction Act, passed along straight party lines  last month. James Taylor even flew in for the festivities.   But at the same time that Washington politicians were patting  themselves on the back, here is actual reality--not Orwellian rhetoric,  not sort of made-up names for legislation to spend hundreds and  hundreds of billions of dollars--here is actual reality: Americans are  getting slapped in the face with yet another month of bad news. Core  inflation grew another six-tenths of a percent just in the month of  August, defying even the most pessimistic estimations and analyses  heading into those reporting numbers.   Both the Dow and the S&P had their worst day since the very arrival  of COVID.   Consumer prices are now up 8.3 percent for the year, but it is worse  than that for median-income households in America. Grocery prices are  13 percent more expensive this middle of September than they were the  last middle of September.   How do you think about what 13 percent inflation looks like? Here is  the way I explained it to my kids: You know, if a year ago today, you  went to the grocery store checkout line and you had $100 in your pocket  and you had a cart full of groceries and you paid your $100 for the  $100 of groceries, if you showed up today at the checkout line at the  grocery store with the exact same cart and the exact same hundred  bucks, you would then have to awkwardly and in an embarrassed way, in  front of the people behind you in line, say: I have to figure out how  to take $13 of stuff off this checkout line because the $100 that I had  last year that bought $100 of food only buys $87 of food right now.  That is what 13 percent inflation means.  [[Page S4807]]    Even CNN had to admit that the White House's timing was awkward,  calling the event ``a bizarre split-screen moment,'' with President  Biden taking a victory lap with a so-called Inflation Reduction Act  while in the real world, inflation was tanking markets. That was  actually what was happening on Tuesday. On air, the CNN anchor  suggested it ``feels a little hard to be celebratory.'' That is a kind  of awkward, timid way to tell the truth.   Lots of Americans have become used to this split-screen reality where  Washington says one thing, but reality is completely different. It  often feels like officials in Washington are living alternate realities  and then trying to convince the American people: You don't know what  you are talking about. What you are actually experiencing at the  checkout line when you had to put back $13 of groceries--it is not  really true. The great news is, we have wine glasses in our hands;  let's clink them together.   Washington, DC, is obviously in a bubble--and not for the first time.  The same folks who threw that party are the types who order lots of  their food from DoorDash and therefore might actually not know what the  price of eggs, milk, and meat is. They are the kind of folks who see  inflation as something that happens on paper, but seeing it on paper is  different than feeling it.   DC sees many problems on paper but doesn't really connect with what  the American people are living. DC saw the housing crisis of 2008, 2009  as something on paper, not as reality. Why? Well, because five of the  seven richest counties in America are the five suburban counties of  Northern Virginia and Maryland that ring Washington, DC. Think about  that. Of 3,000 counties in America, 5 of the 7 richest ones are the  places that surround the city.   So in 2008, 2009, when housing was collapsing everywhere, when lots  of people were going bankrupt in the country, people in this city said:  I don't know what the heck you are talking about. We have massive  demand. Houses sell with escalation clauses.   There are way more buyers than there are sellers, so housing prices  in Washington, DC, in Northern Virginia, and in suburban Maryland went  up even as the country was living that collapse.   Opioids are a crisis that a lot of people in Washington, DC, know  only on paper because they don't see it around the yuppified  neighborhoods of Washington, DC.   Inflation is now that kind of crisis. It is a very real thing, and  yet people in this city host white wine parties to talk about how great  it is passing legislation that spent hundreds of billions of dollars  more, accelerating inflation, and they decided they would name it the  ``Inflation Reduction Act.''   Let's review a little bit of history about what we have learned about  inflation over the last 15 months.   More than a year ago, last summer, when Americans were already  feeling their prices creep higher, the President dismissed long-term  worries about inflation with this quote:         There's nobody suggesting there's any unchecked inflation       on the way--no serious economist.   What?   That was an incredibly bizarre, dishonest statement, and everyone  knew. When it was spoken and when speechwriters wrote it, they knew  that that wasn't true.   Why did they know? Well, because inflation had gone from 1.4 to 5.5  percent in the 3 months before that statement was uttered.   Larry Summers, a longtime Democratic economist across multiple  administrations and who is well respected by folks in academia and in  government and in both parties, was screaming at the White House not  just in private but in public that this was nonsense, that they were  delusional about what was happening with inflation numbers. Yet our  President said that there was nobody suggesting that unchecked  inflation was on the way--no serious economist.   Here is what was actually happening in White House meeting rooms at  that time. Half of the Obama economic team was coming in and telling  the Biden economic team: Hey, you guys are going to get caught with  your pants down. That isn't true. That spin isn't reality. Inflation is  big, it is bad, and it is growing.   Yet the speechwriters said: Let's have the President go out to the  podium and say there is no serious economist who believes inflation is  coming.   That was in July of 2021.   In February of this year, when inflation had hit 7.8 percent, our  President predicted that ``inflation ought to be able to start to taper  off as we go through this year.'' He had predicted in December that  inflation had already peaked. Every one of these comments was detached  from reality, and the people writing the speeches knew they were  detached from reality.   The President is obviously not the only offender. Last October, with  high prices already eating away at families' savings accounts, White  House Chief of Staff Ron Klain applauded a tweet describing inflation  and supply chain snarls as ``high-class problems.'' That is some white  wine-drunk commentary for you. This is a middle-class American problem  that families in all 50 States are suffering.   A week later, the White House Press Secretary shrugged off the same  problem when asked about inflation as being ``the tragedy of the  treadmill that's delayed.'' ``The tragedy of the treadmill that's  delayed''--ouch.   Do these people know anyone in America who has ever had to put stuff  back at the checkout line at the grocery store? Because that is what I  have experienced and see at Walmart and Hy-Vee right now in Fremont,  NE.   Have they ever sat down with people to compare their receipts week  over week or month over month--those people who are looking at their  receipts, knowing that they have to put stuff back? They are not wrong,  and they are not talking about a 3-month delay on a Peloton delivery.   Just 2 months later, another White House Press Secretary declared  that the United States is ``stronger economically than we have ever  been in our history.'' That is what was said at the White House podium:  ``stronger economically than we have ever been in our history''-- totally drunk stuff.   According to a Gallup poll, 56 percent of Americans now say price  increases are causing financial hardships for their families. That is  up from 49 percent a couple of months ago and 45 percent the previous  fall.   According to a Monmouth poll, nearly 9 out of 10 Americans say the  country is on the wrong track, but the White House is throwing wine and  cheese parties to celebrate the Inflation Reduction Act.   Americans have watched the President announce that he plans to force  noncollege graduates in Scottsbluff, NE, and Beckley, WV, to pay for  the debt burden of people with masters and Ph.D.s who live in Berkeley  and Bethesda. Let's be clear. Fifty-six percent of all of the student  loan debt in America is held by people with graduate degrees. The  majority of college loan debt in America is held by people with  graduate degrees, and about a third of Americans go to college. But  what we should do, Washington says, is take money from noncollege  graduates and give it to folks with graduate degrees. Then let's claim  it is somehow going to reduce the deficit. Drunk stuff.    Americans have watched as every basic household necessity has become  more expensive, from groceries to gas. Then they hear politicians  change the name of their bill to the Inflation Reduction Act and  applaud themselves for spending hundreds of billions of inflationary  dollars. This was on the steps of the White House on Tuesday afternoon.   Folks, this isn't just offensive; it is the kind of behavior and the  kind of dishonesty that poisons democracy. Politicians are saying  things here that are 180 degrees reversed from reality, and that cuts  to the issue of public trust. It doesn't just matter economically; it  matters civically.   The relationship between the American people and their leaders is a  relationship built on trust--a trust that, when elected officials are  at their desks in Washington, takes seriously the needs and desires of  their constituents. We have a bunch of people in Washington, DC, who  mistake the Washington, DC, elite experience, where the income of folks  who work for the Federal Government is substantially higher than that  of the median American. It attacks public trust. Elected officials are  not special. Elected officials, quite frankly, are often  [[Page S4808]]  not that impressive. Elected officials are not demagogues. Public  servants are supposed to be serving the public.   It is in our job description to trust that the people we represent  actually know something about their struggles and their challenges and  their day-to-day difficulties of making ends meet. It is in our job  description to listen to them, to look at their experiences, and to  take them to heart. It is in our job description to think carefully  about the challenges they face and the ways we can address those  challenges, always with a mindful eye to the direction established by  our constitutional order and the best of our democratic traditions.   That relationship is destroyed when Washington, DC, breaks faith with  the American people, when it declares: You don't know what you are  talking about. You don't know what your experience is at the grocery  store checkout line. There is no serious inflation, and no serious  economist thinks inflation is coming.   The actual numbers are 13 percent grocery and 8\1/2\ percent overall.  These are late 1970s kinds of numbers.   Politicians know best.   No, we don't.   The relationship is destroyed when self-satisfied appointees and smug  bureaucrats in Washington bustle up and down Pennsylvania Avenue and  decide that division is more efficient politics than competent  governance. Lectures about the soul of America ring pretty hollow from  practitioners of this craven kind of politics of contempt.   Americans deserve better. Starting with honesty is a pretty good  start.   Here is honesty: We have an inflationary crisis on our hands, and the  reality is that inflation is making life a lot more difficult and a lot  more precarious for millions and millions of our neighbors. Our  families and friends are feeling pain at the pump and at the checkout  lines. They are watching their savings accounts and pensions be nibbled  away. They haven't imagined a hardship. This is reality--experiential  and economic reality.   The only thing that is misaligned is the rhetoric of this place, and  Americans won't be bludgeoned into believing that they are actually  thriving when they are experiencing 13 percent grocery inflation.  Things are hard, and the barest minimum this White House could do is to  admit it, to tell the truth, and to put away the party hats.   The American people are resilient. We are tough. We are not ready to  accept this as the new normal. We are going to work our way through  this, but we need less condescension and less spin. We need a lot more  truth-telling from those in power. We need fewer tone-deaf, wine-glass- clinking parties from folks who have escalated inflation with reckless  spending and then claimed that the American people are wrong and that  this new spending will somehow reduce inflation. Nobody really believes  that.   The folks who are writing those press releases and those speeches and  inviting people to parties at the White House should reconsider. They  should tell the truth. It is hogwash, and they know it. More  importantly, the American people know it, and we should tell them the  truth.                            ____________________
