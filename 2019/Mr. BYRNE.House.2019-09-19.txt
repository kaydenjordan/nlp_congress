 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of  Tuscaloosa Police Department Investigator Dornell Cousette.   Officer Cousette was tragically killed in the line of duty Monday  night. He was only 40 years old. He leaves behind two young children  and his fiance.   As a 13-year veteran of the Tuscaloosa Police Department and a  veteran of the United States Army, Officer Cousette was loved and  respected in the Tuscaloosa community.   This awful event reminds us that the men and women of law enforcement  do not get the appreciation they deserve. Not only are they public  servants in the truest sense, but they have wives and husbands. They  have children that they care for. They are active members of their  communities. They put their lives on the line to protect. They deserve  our thanks and gratitude and our prayers.   I offer my sincerest condolences to the family of Officer Cousette.  We can all be proud of the record of service and sacrifice he leaves  behind. Dornell Cousette will not be forgotten.                            ____________________
