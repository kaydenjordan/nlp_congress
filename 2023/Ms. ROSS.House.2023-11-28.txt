 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the exceptional  achievements of the Women's Cross Country Team at North Carolina State  University.   Go pack.   The Wolfpack women have dominated the NCAA once again, winning their  third national championship in a row.   Senior Sam Bush and all-American Katelyn Touhy helped NC State storm  to victory in a close finish against Northern Arizona.   With their latest trophy, the NC State women's cross country team has  now passed the men's basketball team for the most national titles in  the university's history.   In addition, no college team has won three straight women's cross  country titles since Stanford in 2007.   Far too often, outstanding women athletes don't get the recognition  that they deserve. I am proud to represent the Wolfpack women and  congratulate them on their fantastic accomplishment.                            ____________________
