 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading, and in  order to place the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule  XIV, I object to my own request.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it recess until 10 a.m., Thursday,  January 13; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of  proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be  reserved for their use later in the day, and morning business be  closed; that upon the conclusion of morning business, the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. 3436, as provided under the previous  order; further, that the Senate recess from 12:45 p.m. until 2:15 p.m.;  that at 2:15 p.m., there be 30 minutes for debate, equally divided  between the two leaders or their designees, and that upon the use or  yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on passage of S. 3436, as  provided under the previous order.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand in recess  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:04 p.m., recessed until  Thursday, January 13, 2022, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
