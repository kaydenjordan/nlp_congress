 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the First  Baptist Church of Corona on its 100th anniversary.   First Baptist is the bedrock of Corona, Queens. It provides a food  pantry, tax preparation, summer youth employment, and more. The  church's service extends well beyond its congregation to all of Corona,  one of the most diverse immigrant communities in the world.   First Baptist is led by Pastor Patrick H. Young. Pastor Young's  commitment to service is unfailing. When Corona became the epicenter of  the pandemic in early 2020, he and First Baptist community members  stepped up the church's food distribution, serving hundreds of families  each week. He also hosted multiple mobile testing and vaccination  sites. Now, the church seeks to start a medical clinic to help their  community recover and thrive.   Mr. Speaker, I ask our colleagues to join me in recognizing the First  Baptist Church of Corona. In their century of service, they have  modeled the true values of welcoming the stranger and loving thy  neighbor. It is my privilege to represent them.                            ____________________
