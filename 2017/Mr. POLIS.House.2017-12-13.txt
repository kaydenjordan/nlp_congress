 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30  minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule. This rule that we are  looking at today has two bills under it, and this is the 56th closed  rule allowing no amendments that we are bringing to the floor this  year. Over the past year, we have not considered any legislation under  an open rule that would allow Republicans or Democrats to bring forward  amendments here on the floor.   When the 115th Congress opened, Speaker Ryan promised regular order  bills would make their way to the floor after hearings and markups.  Instead, we have seen bill after bill rushed to the floor. Many bills  haven't even gone through committee or skipped hearings. That is true  for the failed healthcare bill, and it is also true for the tax bill  currently in conference, the major bill this Congress.   This tax bill, that somehow we understand there is a ``deal'' on  before the conference committee even met, was crafted behind closed  doors, and no Member was able to offer their ideas on the House floor.  I offered several bipartisan amendments in the Rules Committee, but  they were locked out, as were amendments from every other Democrat and  Republican that chose to offer amendments.   The tax legislation would explode our debt. It is a giveaway to  wealthy corporations and does nothing to help the middle class.   Now, the benefit of having an open process is creating better ideas:  having Democrats and Republicans bring forward those ideas, see who can  muster a majority of votes here on the floor of the House, and include  that in a tax bill. We are a legislature. That is how we are supposed  to work.   Instead, a bill was crafted behind closed doors to raise taxes on 78  million Americans and add $1.7 trillion to the debt. When you add to  the debt, that is a tax on future Americans. Instead of taxing them  today, you are taxing them tomorrow. The tax-and-spend Republican Party  continues to add to the deficit and add to the debt day after day after  day.   Mr. Speaker, we only have a few legislative days left before the end  of the year, and we have very important work to do, like reauthorizing  the Children's Health Insurance Program and funding the government for  the remainder of the fiscal year.   There are millions of Americans who have been negatively affected by  devastating hurricanes and wildfires in Puerto Rico, Texas, Florida,  and the Virgin Islands, and Congress has not stepped up to the plate.   There are also over 800,000 aspiring Americans who are at risk of  being deported from the only country they have ever known as home  because of the reckless actions of President Trump. Congress needs to  act to find a real solution so DREAMers can continue to work legally in  the communities that they live in, and they continue to thrive and give  back to make our country even greater.   We have a lot of critical tasks ahead, which is why I am really  surprised, with all of this work to do, and only 7 or 8 days to do it,  that here we are considering two bills where we will have our debate,  but they are not bills of great importance. We are using our floor  time--very limited, 7 days before the end of the year--when we could be  debating tax reform and offering amendments, when we could be  addressing the needs of the DREAMers, where we could actually be doing  something about the deficit, reining in out-of-control wasteful  government spending. We are not doing any of that.    We are doing two minor bills that are favors for public companies, or  whoever they are. I am happy to talk about them. I am going to do my  role in debating them. One I am even fairly supportive of. But they are  completely separated from the actual concerns of the American people.  [[Page H9862]]    No wonder the approval rating of this institution is under 15  percent, because we continue to debate these minor bills under a closed  process, when, this very week, we could have had an open process for  tax reform. We could be voting on 10 or 20 amendments a day, passing  some and rejecting some. I have no problem if I bring forward some  Democratic amendment and it fails. That is the process. That is fair.   But we have bipartisan, commonsense amendments that should be part of  tax reform. Representative Schweikert and I have a bill to provide a de  minimis exemption on taxation for use of cryptocurrencies, to allow  them to be used for amounts under $600 in everyday purchases and to  remove the specter of IRS enforcement.   Let's put it in. Let's have a vote on it. Let's see if a majority of  Congress agrees with me. I hope they do. If not, I am a big boy. It is  my job. I can go home. But to not even be able to fight for the issues  that my constituents have hired me to fight for is not only the  frustration I have, and not only the frustration many Republicans have,  but it is the frustration the American people have with this  institution.   Now, let's get to these bills. Typically, the Financial Services  Committee did not hold a hearing on either of these rules. It is a  closed rule.   The first one, H.R. 2396, the Privacy Notification Technical  Clarification Act, would remove privacy notice requirements for  financial institutions to consumers that share or sell a customer's  personal information with third parties.   We are all for reducing unnecessary regulations. When I get to the  next bill, the Republicans are actually trying to add paperwork and  regulations. This one does, but it picks a very poor one to get rid of.  It gets rid of privacy notices for financial institutions that tell  consumers that they can share or sell their personal information. Of  all of the places to cut paperwork, why would you want to cut the one  piece that consumers and retail investors actually care about?   Back in September, 143 million Americans had their personal and  sensitive information shared widely, as a result of a data breach at  Equifax. Congress should be looking at ways to better secure our  sensitive information--a cybersecurity bill, better information  sharing--instead of actually making it easier for our personal  information to be shared more widely and giving you, as the consumer,  less ability to find out where it is being shared.   A hearing would be helpful to understand the full effects of this  legislation to see what the unintended consequences are. We do know  that it would eliminate clear disclosure to consumers about their  privacy rights--never a good thing, especially in these times-- including a consumer's ability to opt out from having their information  sold to certain third parties. We can do better.   The other bill, H.R. 4015, the Corporate Governance Reform and  Transparency Act, makes a change to how proxy advisory firms provide  information to shareholders. It would require that they make their  recommendations available to companies.   This bill is problematic from a number of perspectives. Here is what  it does. Proxy advisory firms provide independent advisory services for  investors and have fiduciary responsibility to their investors.   Under this legislation, they would actually have to open themselves  up to lobbying for companies and add additional paperwork. They would  have to register with the SEC, whereas they now don't, before trying to  issue vote recommendations or trying to change the corporate board.   Here is who the players are in this fight: On the one hand, you have  public companies; on the other, you have investors, which means your  pension fund, and mine, Mr. Speaker. It means university endowments. I  know you all don't like those, and you are going to tax them soon. It  means, perhaps, using an individual investor, through a mutual fund or  other vehicle. So investors on one side, public corporations on the  other.   But the problem is: it is not the shareholders of the public  companies, it is the insular governance and management structure of  those organizations. Many of them do need to be shaken up in the name  of efficiency.   There are many examples of investor pressure that has been applied to  good effect: to meaningful reforms and corporate governance; preventing  conflict of interest, making sure that the board oversees the CEO are  not just his golfing buddies, and he is on the board, or she is on the  board, of their companies, too.   I have generally been on the side of investor empowerment in that:  not to the extreme, not to make it impossible to be a CEO on a publicly  traded company, to run a publicly traded company. But, if anything, we  should make sure that the actual owners of the companies are empowered  to make the changes they need to increase efficiency.                                time  1415    This bill goes the wrong way. It adds red tape and paperwork. It adds  regulations to investors and prevents them from being able to exert  influence in the same way they do today, adding one degree of  additional regulation and paperwork to allow them to do the kinds of  good governance activities in terms of running competitive fights for  boards of directors.   Now, I get that there is another side. There can be a steamy  underbelly to investor engagement as well. There are some investors who  only care about short-term gains, who try to institute practices or  bully management around in a way that is not conducive to long-term  value but, rather, just pump-and-dump schemes that they try to make  money off of, and I totally get that.   But in general, it is the owners of a company to whom the fiduciary  responsibility of the directors and the CEO lie; and we should empower  them, for better or for worse, to make the changes to increase the  overall productivity of the company.   We should not burden investors with additional red tape, as  Republicans are doing, by creating more bureaucracy and paperwork and  compliance costs with this bill.   Frankly, I was surprised to see this bill come out of Financial  Services Committee because Republicans have been fairly consistent in  trying to remove regulations from Dodd-Frank. That has generally been  the approach. I supported the removal of some of those unnecessary  regulations. Others are important regulations, like this privacy  disclosure that I don't think is a good idea.   But here, they are actually adding reporting requirements above and  beyond Dodd-Frank. They are out ``Dodd-Franking'' Dodd-Frank.  Republicans are saying there is not enough reporting; there is not  enough paperwork; there is not enough money going to lawyers and  accountants. In Dodd-Frank, we are going to require that they file even  more paperwork with the SEC.   I think that is the wrong way to go, Mr. Speaker, and I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to resist this effort to burden  shareholders who actually own companies with additional costs and  paperwork and prevent them from making necessary management  improvements to the companies that, at the end of the day, are run for  them, not for the benefit of management.   That is why I oppose this bill. Shareholders should have a right to  impartial information about the company in which they have invested. We  should minimize paperwork where possible. I have been proud to support  a number of bipartisan proposals to do that. This bill goes the  opposite way.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I include in the Record the Republican bill summary from the majority  on the Rules Committee for H.R. 4015.                             Committee on Rules                 Pete Sessions, Chairman--December 11, 2017    H.R. 4015--Corporate Governance Reform and Transparency Act of 2017         Purpose: To improve the quality of proxy advisory firms for       the protection of investors and the U.S. economy, and in the       public interest, by fostering accountability, transparency,       responsiveness, and competition in the proxy advisory firm       industry.        Background and Legislative History: Each year, public       companies hold shareholder meetings at which the company's       shareholders vote for the company's directors and on other       significant corporate actions that require shareholder       approval. As part of this annual process, the Securities and       Exchange Commission (SEC) requires public companies to       provide their shareholders with a proxy statement before       shareholder meetings. A proxy statement includes all       important facts about the matters to be voted on at a       shareholder meeting, including, for example, information on       board of director candidates, director compensation,       executive compensation, related party transactions,       securities ownership by certain beneficial owners and       management, and eligible shareholder proposals. The       information contained in the statement must be filed with the       SEC before soliciting a shareholder vote on the election of       directors and the approval of other corporate actions.       Solicitations, whether by management or shareholders, must       disclose all important facts about the issues on which       shareholders are asked to vote.        In general, state corporate law governs shareholder voting       rights, including the types of corporate actions that require       shareholder approval. However, Section 14 of the Securities       Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) authorizes the SEC to       promulgate rules governing the solicitation of proxies for       most public companies. SEC Regulation 14A governs proxy       solicitations and sets forth the categories of information       that must be disclosed in proxy solicitations.        Largely as a result of the SEC's regulations, proxy       advisory firms now wield outsized influence in the U.S. proxy       system. In particular, regulators, market participants, and       academic observers have highlighted potential conflicts of       interest inherent in the business models and activities of       proxy advisory firms. For example, as indicated above, proxy       advisor firms may feel pressured by their largest clients--      many of whom are activist investors--to issue vote       recommendations that reflect those clients' specific agendas.       In addition, proxy advisory firms often provide voting       recommendations to investment advisers on matters for which       they also provide consulting services to public companies.     Mr. Speaker, the reason I do this is, my colleague from  Georgia somehow said that it was laughable, this characterization that  it is adding paperwork.   That is exactly what this bill does. In fact, in this exhibit, this  is a Republican summary of their own bill. It says: ``The information  contained in the statement must be filed with the SEC. . . .''   The whole bill is about adding paperwork. That is what the bill does.  You can argue it is paperwork all you want because corporate CEOs want  it and many existing board members want it. Investors don't want it.  But we are talking about additional paperwork, and there is nothing in  that statement that you can refute because the Republican bill summary  explains that that is what they are doing. I mean, there is no  disagreement.   And he is correct. I am sure there are some Democrats who support  these bills, some Republicans who support them, some Republicans and  Democrats who might oppose these bills, but that is what the bill does,  it adds paperwork. That is why I mentioned I was surprised to see it  come out of the Financial Services Committee that, in general, had been  more interested in reducing paperwork. Here, they are interested in  adding compliance cost and paperwork to investors.   Mr. Speaker, I have to say that if we defeat the previous question, I  will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up Sean Patrick Maloney's  bill, H.R. 4585, which would block the FCC's rule rolling back net  neutrality from taking effect to ensure the internet remains open to  all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Mitchell). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney) to discuss the  proposal.   Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman from Colorado for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to defeat the  previous question so we can turn our attention to the issue that is so  critical for this body to address right now. I speak of the Federal  Communications Commission's decision and its assault on net neutrality.   The FCC is expected to vote tomorrow to eliminate the rules that  protect  [[Page H9864]]  our internet. They are about to fix something that is not broken.   Now, maybe the words ``net neutrality'' make your eyes glaze over,  but this issue is critical to anyone who uses the internet, which is  really all of us, and it is not that complicated.   We call the rules that protect the current internet ``net  neutrality'' because they, more or less, keep the internet neutral for  everyone. A neutral internet means we all have access to the same legal  content and services no matter where or how we get our internet.   These rules aren't new, and they are working. In fact, when you think  about it, one of the last places where quality really reigns in our  society is on the internet. We don't discriminate against the content  or the intellectual creations of one young entrepreneur versus a big  business or an established entity. It is one of the few places left in  America where we are all on equal footing.   That is the current net neutrality system that we must protect. The  folks who want to end net neutrality say they need to rewrite these  rules to spur innovation.   Really, Mr. Speaker?   It is hard to look at the internet as it has blossomed in America and  say we lack innovation. Innovation is everywhere. Look at all the new  apps, websites, devices, and services that we all rely on every day.   This innovation exists not in spite of net neutrality. This  innovation exists, in large part, because of net neutrality. Net  neutrality is not a bug, Mr. Speaker. Net neutrality is a feature, and  that is why we must protect it.   Of course, the real reason that people want to end net neutrality is  money and profitability. Getting rid of net neutrality would expose  consumers to all sorts of practices that, right now, are banned;  practices like throttling, which means the internet company doesn't  have to provide the same access to all companies. So they don't like  one company, they can slow down your access to that site. They could  block the site entirely.   They could tell a streaming service, like Netflix, that they have to  pay more or make their site work differently. These extra costs for  Netflix are going to get passed on to all of us, the consumers.   While some of us have a few choices when it comes to internet service  providers, most of us don't.   How many have more than one option when it comes to internet in your  home or office?   These companies have a functional monopoly, so many of them can do  basically whatever they want and not lose customers. That is why we  need some commonsense rules in place to protect consumers. These rules  are called net neutrality.   So what can we do to stop the FCC from harming this free internet?   Well, I have introduced legislation in just the last couple of days  that would block this proposal and protect the internet. H.R. 4585, the  Save Net Neutrality Act, would simply prevent the FCC from relying on  this process they have used to roll these rules back. It is really that  simple. And we know the FCC's rulemaking process was so messed up, so  corrupted, so screwed up that it is being investigated right now by the  New York attorney general.   So I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to defeat  the previous question so we can move to debate my bill, the Save Net  Neutrality Act, and address this critical issue. This is our chance to  protect the internet, as it has always existed, an internet that is  working fine as it is.   To the FCC, we say: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I can see my good friend, Mr. Duffy, is very excited about this, very  engaged. It is a hard issue. I don't think many Democrats are that  excited either way. They are all going to decide where they stand  because it is just a fight between corporate CEOs and big institutional  investors. They are both fine. I mean, you have got to pick one or the  other in voting ``yes'' or ``no'' on this bill.   I think, as Democrats, we are more interested in how the people are  doing who are working for those companies. How are we doing about  sustainable practices over time?   Yes, every Democrat and Republican will cast their vote here either  for institutional investors or for corporate CEOs and insular boards.  Fine.   It does add paperwork. We talked about that. Mr. Duffy said: Oh, it  adds paperwork. Democrats should like it.   Yes, maybe there are some. I think some Democrats voted for it in  committee. There are Democrats that want to increase paperwork. I am  not one of them. I want to decrease paperwork and streamline it.   But, no, I am sure there will be some Democrats who support it. There  are probably Democrats who, themselves, agree with the corporate CEOs  over the institutional investors.   I have taken a company public. I have run private companies. I have  seen this world. I think it is a good thing that the share of  institutional investment has increased. I don't have the statistics in  front of me. The gentleman from Wisconsin said something along the  lines of 46 to 75 percent of the capital is institutional.   The big problem in public corporate governance is not too much  shareholder engagement; it is not enough. When you have a diffuse  shareholder base, when you don't have institutional investors, when you  have, proverbially, 200 people who each own half a percent of the  company or even more and they never talk and don't know each other, the  ability of management to run amok in their own interests, to the  detriment of the shareholders, plagues our public marketplaces.   So to have sophisticated, active investors who own enough and can  work together, sometimes through these proxy fights when it comes to  it, to be able to maximize long-term value is a good thing. It is a  good thing.   Of course, everybody can point to times that it has been good for  companies and times it has been bad. Generally speaking, this bill is  adding paperwork to move the bar the wrong way, to move it towards  management, away from shareholders.   I agree you need a balance. I wouldn't support a bill that moved it  all the way to shareholders either. You are just encouraging agitators  to get in on a short-term basis and speculative basis.   But I think we are close to the right place; and if you ask me where  I would move it, I would move it a little the other way to empower  shareholders. In fact, I have a bill that does that. It is part of a  bigger bill, but it is a bill that gives shareholders more of a direct  say over the pay of top executives because, again, there is a problem  with insular corporate boards. Part of the answer is empowering  institutional investors and empowering individual investors.   So, look, Democrats will hold their nose and vote for either  corporate CEOs or for big investors, and that is fine. I firmly think  that the best interests of our economy and the people and  sustainability lie in moving it toward the investors.   This bill moves it the wrong way and adds paperwork and costs to the  investors. So I really think it moves the wrong way, which is why I  oppose this bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''   There was also a discussion, Mr. Duffy mentioned why aren't we just  talking about the rule. It is because, Mr. Speaker, like 56 other  rules, it is a closed rule.   What else can we say about closed rules? We have said everything.  There are no amendments. I could spend an hour complaining about how  they are not allowing amendments in and it is closed and so are 56  other rules, but it is more productive to get to the underlying issues  because we have had the debate on closed rules 56 times just in the  last 10 months.   That is a record, Mr. Speaker. You should be proud of presiding over  a record number of closed rules for a United States Congress. But it is  not very interesting to talk about for another hour.  [[Page H9866]]    So they will talk about an interesting bill, a minor bill. I think I  discussed that. I mean, we have a government shutdown; we have an issue  with tax reform; we have DREAMers; we have a million things we could be  doing. This is a minor bill.   Okay. Let's talk about the merits of giving the current corporate  boards that might be too insular and the current CEOs and management a  little more power, like this bill does, by increasing red tape and  paperwork on investors versus the merits of empowering investors. Fine,  we will have that discussion. We will cast our ballots. We will see  what happens.   Another issue that is very important and timely that this Congress  should get to is the one my good friend Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney  raised. When we defeat the previous question, we can bring up an issue  that, again, is not a partisan issue.   As the cofounder of Apple, Steve Wozniak, said, the end of net  neutrality would end the internet as we know it. It is an issue every  American citizen is looking to us to take leadership on.   In my time in office, I have had to make a number of controversial  votes, whether it is for the Affordable Care Act or repeal of this or  that, and oftentimes I hear from constituents on both sides. I remember  we got thousands of letters for the Affordable Care Act, thousands of  letters against it--very typical.    Net neutrality has been a unique and singular experience in my 9  years in Congress. We received 1,500 calls and over 5,000 emails about  the issue, and I asked my staff to double-check this because I didn't  believe this, and they did. One hundred percent of the emails and calls  were for net neutrality. That is right. Not a single constituent of  mine contacted me on the other side.   In a district that has a plurality of unaffiliated voters and a  similar number of Republicans and Democrats, they are never shy to  contact me. So it is not partisan. It certainly united Republicans,  unaffiliated voters, and Democrats in my district to be unanimously for  net neutrality, which surprised me. But it also means that Congress  should not be tone deaf to that, and that is why it is important to  defeat the previous question.   Republican Senators like Senator Thune have come together to call on  colleagues to come together and protect net neutrality. My good friend  and colleague from Colorado Mike Coffman announced that we should--the  FCC should delay their vote and that we should protect net neutrality.   It is common sense, Mr. Speaker, and by defeating the previous  question, we can get on to an issue that the American people care about  rather than a fight between CEOs and investors and which side you take.  It is about protecting your internet in your home so you can access the  content of your choice--a consumer issue and an issue for small  businesses.   We had a digital roundtable last night, Mr. Speaker. I think  thousands of people from my district watched as I had several experts,  including several small businesses from Colorado, talk about the  importance of net neutrality to them in creating jobs and being able to  have a predictable and sustainable business model, and then being able  to compete with large, entrenched companies and be disruptive with new  innovation.   So I hope that we can defeat the previous question and get on to  that. If we don't, I am going to ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on  the bill that adds paperwork and costs, requiring SEC filings for the  investors who are fighting bills, who are fighting proxy fights, and  then I urge my colleagues to look closely at the privacy bill.   That one, again, I would not characterize as a major bill. I will be  voting ``no.'' I understand there might be some Republicans and  Democrats voting ``yes'' on that one as well. But, you know, whether  they delete that clause or not is hardly the game changer for the  economy that tax reform will be.   I have ideas, bipartisan ideas, bills that I have sponsored with my  Republican colleagues that should be part of tax reform, that would  help the economy go, that would create far more jobs than a two- sentence disclosure, whether it is there or not, and, frankly, more  important, also, than this, whether the proxy fight people have to file  with the SEC. I mean, I am sure they will be able to do it. I mean,  yes, you Republicans want to give them more paperwork and create more  bureaucracy, but I am sure they will survive.                                time  1445    But let's do something important like open process tax reform. We  could be debating amendments right now and voting on them like our  job--you know, like 100 amendments from Republicans and Democrats. I  would even be open to let's just consider bipartisan amendments, throw  out amendments that only Republicans support or only Democrats support.   To be fair, you are in the majority, Mr. Speaker, how about just  amendments that Republicans alone support or are bipartisan? You don't  have to do any Democratic amendments only because let's just have an  open process. Let's allow some amendments.   Every amendment was locked out of tax reform. I offered like, what,  16 myself? I remember my colleague Mr. Woodall was there. They were  commonsense ideas. There was a little fix I did with Mr. Tipton from  Colorado for Kombucha, that is fermented tea, and it had to do with the  tax treatment, de minimis. Senator Cory Gardner supports it in the  Senate, our Republican Senator. Noncontroversial, next-to-no fiscal  impact, and the Rules Committee still didn't even allow me to debate  the amendment on the floor for 10 minutes, for 5 minutes, for 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, enough with these closed rules, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we have a couple problems with this rule. First of all,  the rule brings to the floor the wrong bills. These are minor bills. I  will give a recap in a moment, but oh, my goodness. Two sentences of a  disclosure and a little more filing costs for pensions and investors.  Okay. We will get past that. They probably won't become law anyway. You  can blame it on the Senate, you can blame it on the House, but most of  these things we do don't become law.   I understand that many of my colleagues are frustrated with the  Senate, but whatever the case, we just do these things.   But there is stuff that might become law, that could become law, like  tax reform; like the fact that the government is shutting down next  week if we don't continue the funding. We have a clock ticking on our  debt ceiling. We have 800,000 aspiring Americans who don't even know if  they can go to work legally, like they can today, in another few months  because of President Trump's decision to end their provisional status.   These are real issues--the cost of healthcare going up for my  constituents and yours. But we are not doing that. We are bringing up  two bills. I will give you the summary of them. Even these two bills,  closed process, no amendments. If I was able to offer floor amendments,  as I said, I could offer an amendment that would actually move the  balance the other way toward investors and empowering investor  activism, perhaps even look at giving them a safer pay, if you will,  over executive pay, and reining in some of the problems of this bill.  But we are not allowed. We are not allowed to offer any amendments here  on the floor.   Again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again,  again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again,  again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again,  again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again,  again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again,  again, again, again, again, again, again. That is 56, by my count.   That is 56 times Republicans have brought bills to the floor and  haven't allowed Democrats or Republicans to offer amendments.   Look, my colleagues can say: Oh, Democrats weren't great on this, and  they had too many when they controlled it. You know what? First of all,  Republicans set a record. This is the most number of closed rules ever.   Secondly, I am not here to defend the Democrats. If the Democrats  were in  [[Page H9867]]  charge, they should offer more open amendments. There is no question.  But Republicans, whatever they complained about the Democrats, they  outdid them by a big factor. Ten months, 56 bills that no single Member  of the House is allowed to offer an amendment on just to have a fair  up-or-down vote. It is wrong. It is wrong.   That is why I hope my colleagues can defeat this rule to say: Enough  is enough.   Mr. Speaker, we have to defeat this rule and move on to the issues  important to the American people, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.
