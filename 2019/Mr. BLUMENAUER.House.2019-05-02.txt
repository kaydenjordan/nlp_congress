 Mr. Speaker, it was an honor to preside over the  House during the debate on H.R. 9 yesterday to uphold our commitment to  the Paris climate accord, our first real piece of climate legislation  in over 9 years. It may have been an honor, but it was jarring to  listen to my Republican colleagues in denial.   For decades, Americans have seen with their own eyes rising sea  levels, extreme weather events, and temperature increases, all  terrifying prospects for our children and grandchildren, yet  Republicans are defending the Trump administration's action to undercut  and isolate the United States as the only country to withdraw from the  climate accord, placing us firmly on the wrong side of history.   In contrast, I am thankful that today's action demonstrates that  Democrats are on the side of protecting our children's future. H.R. 9  is a first step towards a future of climate action and climate justice,  a Green New Deal for clean energy jobs, rebuilding and renewing our  infrastructure, sustainable agriculture, and environmental justice.   We can't afford to wait, and neither can the planet.                            ____________________
