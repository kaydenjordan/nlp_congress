 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Davis for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank   John Shimkus and wish him the  very best in his retirement.   Now, John, you may not remember this, but 4 years ago when I joined  this Congress, I said I would like to come and meet you, so you invited  me to your office. You could not pronounce my name. Few people can. I  said, Just call me Raja. My last name allows me to get on a first-name  basis with everybody in this place.   From that point forward, we developed a relationship, a friendship,  to the point where very recently, I came to him and asked him to  cosponsor a piece of legislation, and he just said, ``Put me on it,''  without even asking me what I was asking him to cosponsor.   It was moving to me, because he trusted me, and it was based on a  friendship rooted on shared values. Even though we may not be in the  same party, we are all Americans, and that is something that I deeply  cherish about our relationship.   Now, as a wise man once said, we can find common ground only by  moving to a higher ground, only by moving to a higher ground.   Working with John proved to me that we can ascend to higher heights,  but only if we try.     John Shimkus represents the epitome of a legislator who tries to  ascend to higher ground every day.   Madam Speaker, I thank John and his excellent staff, including his  long-time chief, Craig Roberts, for their incredible devoted service to  their family, to their community, and to their country.
