 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Greg  Bollard, who will be honored at the 15th anniversary celebration for  Friends of the Lake on August 9, 2018. His numerous accomplishments on  behalf of Lake Lillinonah have made a great impact on the health of  Connecticut's environment.   Mr. Bollard is the cofounder of Friends of the Lake, a nonprofit  organization created to improve the water quality of Lake Lillinonah in  Connecticut, enhance the enjoyment of the lake's pristine and stunning  surroundings and protect that portion of the Housatonic River and its  watershed.   Friends of the Lake works alongside an array of community and  environmental organizations, Federal, State and local officials, and  residents in order to acquire vital funding to improve the lake, raise  awareness of the project and its importance, and bring together the  community around Lake Lillinonah. Mr. Bollard has worked tirelessly  over the past decade and a half to obtain and deploy a monitoring buoy.  This buoy uses the Global Lake Observatory Network GLEON, to share data  about the lake with scientists and other lake organizations worldwide,  in order to facilitate more thorough monitoring and study of lake  ecology.   In order to ensure Lake Lillinonah is clean, safe, and accessible to  the community, Mr. Bollard has led tireless efforts to learn more about  invasive species and control their populations, along with chairing the  water quality committee. He is known as an incredibly dependable man,  who is able to fix any problem by spearheading key efforts to develop a  solution and bring the right group of people together to see it through  successfully.   Mr. Bollard's desire to help his community extends beyond his work  with Friends of the Lake, as well. For 16 years, he served on the  Bridgewater Inland Wetlands Commission, and he continues to dedicate  his time to his community through his role as an EMT and ambulance  coordinator for the Bridgewater Fire Department, a firefighter and EMT  for the Morris Volunteer Fire Department, and as a member of the  Shepaug parent council.   Through his devotion to helping our State with Friends of the Lake  and his great work as a public servant, Mr. Bollard has left a lasting,  positive impression upon Connecticut and laid a profoundly strong  foundation for improving our State's environment in the years to come.   I applaud Greg Bollard's dedicated commitment to improve and protect  Lake Lillinonah, and I hope my colleagues will join me in  congratulating Mr. Bollard on his well-deserved honor.                            ____________________
