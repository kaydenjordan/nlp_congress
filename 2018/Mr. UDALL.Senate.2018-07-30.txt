 Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the late Las  Cruces City councilor Olga Pedroza, a champion for justice. Ms. Pedroza  passed away February 9, 2018, in Las Cruces, NM.   Ms. Pedroza was born in a small town in Mexico, San Luis Ayucan, on  September 28, 1942. Her parents Celia and Jesus came to Chicago in the  1940s, where she attended Catholic school for elementary through high  school. She graduated from Mundelein College in 1963 with a bachelor's  degree in sociology and minors in elementary education and theology.   Ms. Pedroza then set off and worked on behalf of her community the  rest of her life. She worked as a teacher for many years and, in 1980,  moved to New Mexico with her then-husband and three children. By then,  she had earned a master's in education. Ms. Pedroza decided she wanted  to use the law to promote her social justice goals. She entered the  University of New Mexico Law School and graduated in 1985, in her early  40s.   Ms. Pedroza began working for Centro Legal Campesino, the legal aid  farmer worker unit, in Las Cruces in 1990. She was there over 15 years,  primarily as the managing attorney. During that time, she filed over 50  Federal lawsuits representing farmworkers in their fight for fair wages  and other rights.   Ms. Pedroza began her third career in 2009 when she was elected to  the Las Cruces City Council District 3 seat, which covers central and  southeast Las Cruces. Ms. Pedroza believed in change and often said,  ``City Council could be a place to start.'' She served two terms before  retiring. During her tenure, she fought for a living-wage ordinance and  always prioritized the needs of those overlooked by society. Among  other community needs, she advocated for community gardens and improved  tennis facilities. Ms. Pedroza was a great tennis enthusiast and even  competed in the Senior Olympics.   She was active in the community, serving on the board of directors of  the Women's Intercultural Center in Anthony, as cochair of the local  women's bar association, and on the board of the court appointed  special advocates.   Ms. Pedroza worked throughout her life to change the world for the  better. Her compassion, warmth, and sense of humor will be missed by  her children, grandchildren, and community. I honor her work and  unflagging commitment to social justice.  [[Page S5450]]                                ____________________
