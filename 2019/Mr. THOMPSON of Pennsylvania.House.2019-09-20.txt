 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize and congratulate a friend and educational leader, Dr. Neil  Sharkey, vice president for research at Penn State University, upon his  retirement.   For the last 22 years, Dr. Sharkey has managed, facilitated, and  advanced the university's entire research portfolio to dig deeper and  discover innovative solutions to society's most challenging questions.   Under Dr. Sharkey's leadership, Penn State's research expenditures  reached an all-time high in 2017 and 2018, totaling $927 million. This  investment in the university's research has helped fund important  research projects in life sciences, cyber science, social science,  cancer research, energy and the environment, and a variety of other  interdisciplinary fields.   Before his position as vice president of research, Dr. Sharkey served  as the associate dean for research and graduate education in the  College of Health and Human Development, as well as a professor of  kinesiology.   I always say we cannot make good decisions without good data. Dr.  Sharkey has been a leader in this feat, and I wish him the best of luck  as he embarks on his new endeavors.                            ____________________
