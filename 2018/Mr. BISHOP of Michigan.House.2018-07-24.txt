 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 6084) to amend title VII of the Social Security Act  to provide for a single point of contact at the Social Security  Administration for individuals who are victims of identity theft, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6084         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Social Security's       Service to Victims of Identity Theft Act''.       SEC. 2. SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT FOR IDENTITY THEFT VICTIMS.         (a) In General.--Title VII of the Social Security Act (42       U.S.C. 901 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the       following:       ``SECTION 714. SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT FOR IDENTITY THEFT                     VICTIMS.         ``(a) In General.--The Commissioner of Social Security       shall establish and implement procedures to ensure that any       individual whose social security account number has been       misused (such as to fraudulently obtain benefits under title       II, VIII, or XVI of this Act, in a manner that affects an       individual's records at the Social Security Administration,       or in a manner that prompts the individual to request a new       social security account number) has a single point of contact       at the Social Security Administration throughout the       resolution of the individual's case. The single point of       contact shall track the individual's case to completion and       coordinate with other units to resolve issues as quickly as       possible.        ``(b) Single Point of Contact.--        ``(1) In general.--For purposes of subsection (a), the       single point of contact shall consist of a team or subset of       specially trained employees who--        ``(A) have the ability to coordinate with other units to       resolve the issues involved in the individual's case, and        ``(B) shall be accountable for the case until its       resolution.        ``(2) Team or subset.--The employees included within the       team or subset described in paragraph (1) may change as       required to meet the needs of the Social Security       Administration, provided that procedures have been       established to--        ``(A) ensure continuity of records and case history, and        ``(B) notify the individual when appropriate.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment of       this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on H.R. 6084, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.  [[Page H7114]]    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here today and pleased that we are  considering this bipartisan legislation that I introduced with a friend  of mine from Connecticut, Ranking Member Larson, H.R. 6084, the  Improving Social Security's Service to Victims of Identity Theft Act.   This is an issue that is important to all of us in all of our  districts. As you well know, Mr. Speaker, identity theft is a crime  that is growing at very alarming rates around the country. Supporting  victims of identity theft is something I have long championed. As a  former local prosecutor and advocate for victims, I gained a real  understanding of the plight of many Americans and what they face in  recovering from identity theft and from other forms of exploitation.   In response, I spent a large part of my legislative career working on  victim's rights and ensuring justice. I am pleased that we are  considering H.R. 6084 today.   Mr. Speaker, Americans who are victims of identity theft often face  an uphill battle when they contact the Social Security Administration  for help. All too often, these individuals find themselves being  bounced around in phone trees from recording to recording, person to  person, only to start all over again with each new person with whom  they speak.   In many cases, an individual will speak to multiple people at the  Social Security Administration by phone, only then to be told that they  need to go to a field office to resolve the situation.   Mr. Speaker, I just think that is wrong. These are victims of  identity theft who urgently need assistance from the Social Security  Administration so that they can get their lives back on track. But too  many of these victims are being revictimized by the Social Security  Administration's cumbersome and disorganized system. It is high time  that the Social Security Administration improves its customer service  to victims of identity theft.   That is why I introduced H.R. 6084, the bipartisan legislation which  will require the Social Security Administration to provide a single  point of contact at the agency to an individual who needs to resolve a  problem with the Social Security Administration because of the misuse  of his or her Social Security number.   This important bill will help Americans get the assistance they need  from the Social Security Administration by implementing a customer- focused process. I am pleased to have the support of AARP, the National  Council of Social Security Management Associations, and the Association  of Mature American Citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record statements of support for my  bill from those groups.                                                           AARP,                                      Washington, DC, June 21, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, House Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Ways and Means,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady and Ranking Member Neal: On behalf of       AARP's 38 million members, we are writing in support of the       H.R. 6084, the Improving Social Security's Service to Victims       of Identity Theft Act of 2018. The bill directs the Social       Security Administration (SSA) to provide a single point of       contact and a team of SSA staff to help redress any problems       faced by Social Security ID theft victims. AARP is strongly       committed to protecting consumers from identity theft and       supports your efforts to improve the assistance offered to       individuals whose Social Security number has been       compromised.        An individual's Social Security number is critical       financial information and integral to everyone's personal       identity. The range of fraud that can be committed when an       individual's Social Security number has been compromised is       truly staggering, and the time and effort required to       reassert one's financial identity can be daunting.       Streamlining and simplifying the assistance that the SSA       offers an identity theft victim will be welcomed by       individuals who are caught in an often overwhelming       situation.        We look forward to continuing to work with you to promote       the integrity of the Social Security program, and to protect       the identities of American workers and their families.            Sincerely,                                                Joyce A. Rogers,                                              Senior Vice President,      Government Affairs.                                   ____                                                             AMAC,                                                      June 18, 2018.      Hon. Mike Bishop,      8th Congressional District, Michigan, Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Bishop: On behalf of the 1.3 million       members of AMAC, the Association of Mature American Citizens,       I am writing in support of H.R. 6084, the Improving Social       Security's Service to Victims of Identity Theft Act. This       important piece of legislation will make it easier for       seniors to track the status of their identity theft claims at       the Social Security Administration (SSA). By establishing a       single point of contact for an identity theft case, H.R. 6084       is a smart, senior-focused solution to a growing problem.        Every year, millions of Americans, and particularly       seniors, fall victim to identity theft. While being       victimized is bad enough, the process of restoring financial       security and recovering peace of mind can be a long, arduous,       and convoluted process. For seniors, these problems are       particularly acute as they primarily work with SSA--one of       the nation's largest federal bureaucracies--to restore their       financial security.        H.R. 6084 seeks to improve customer service to identity       theft victims in a way that is both smart and practical.       Under this proposal, when an identity theft victim requests a       new Social Security number, they will be assigned a single       point of contact at SSA to manage their case until it is       resolved. For seniors, this will prove invaluable as they       will no longer have to navigate SSA's massive federal       structure to resolve their identity theft case. Seniors can       have a singular, reliable, and approachable case manager who       can answer their questions, monitor the status of their       claim, and help seniors in need of assistance.        As an organization committed to representing mature       Americans and seniors, AMAC is dedicated to ensuring senior       citizens' interests are protected. We applaud Congressman       Bishop for his practical and timely solution to help identity       theft victims in their most vulnerable time. AMAC is pleased       to offer our organization's full support to the Improving       Social Security's Service to Victims of Identity Theft Act.            Sincerely,                                                         Dan Weber,      President and Founder of AMAC.                                   ____           National Council of Social Security Management             Associations, Inc.,                                      Arlington, VA, July 16, 2018.      Hon. Mike Bishop,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Sam Johnson,      Chairman, House of Representatives, Subcommittee on Social           Security, Washington, DC.      Hon. John B. Larson,      Ranking Member, House of Representatives, Subcommittee on           Social Security, Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Bishop, Chairman Johnson and Ranking       Member Larson: On behalf of the National Council of Social       Security Management Associations (NCSSMA) and our members       throughout the nation, I would like to thank you for your       introduction and original cosponsorship of H.R. 6084, the       Improving Social Security's Service to Victims of Identity       Theft Act. We very much appreciate your leadership on this       important legislation to ensure a measure that will not only       benefit and protect the American public, but also ease the       administrative burden on the hardworking employees of the       Social Security Administration (SSA) by establishing a single       point of contact for an identity theft case. H.R. 6084 is a       commonsense solution to a growing problem.        NCSSMA is pleased to support H.R. 6084 as it reinforces       NCSSMA's own efforts and initiatives to provide the best       service to the American people, through the effective and       efficient administration of SSA's programs. Millions of       Americans fall victim to identity theft every year. We       believe this legislation will help identity theft victims       work with a single point of contact at SSA to assist in       resolving their identity theft case.        As an organization that is committed to improving       management and program administration in SSA while advocating       for an agency that remains customer focused with an emphasis       on excellent public service, we commend you for your       practical and timely solution to help identity theft victims.       NCSSMA is pleased to offer our organization's support to the       Improving Social Security's Service to Victims of Identity       Theft Act.        Thank you again for your leadership. Please do not hesitate       to contact me if you have any questions or if we can provide       additional assistance.            Sincerely,                                               Christopher Detzler,                                                  NCSSMA President.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sam Johnson), one of the great leaders of  this body.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, as today's debate on this legislation has shown, victims  of identity theft in this country are facing an uphill battle in  getting assistance from the Social Security Administration. Simply put,  the current disconnected structure at the Social Security  Administration isn't working for the American people. In response, my  bill would require the Social Security Administration to assign a  single point of contact at the agency to those who need to solve a  problem with the Social Security Administration because of the misuse  of his or her Social Security number.   This simply put but important reform will bring an added level of  comfort to victims of identity theft and will ensure that they are  receiving the quality care that they deserve.   In closing, I thank Ranking Member Larson for assisting in this bill  and joining me in offering the bill. I also thank Chairman Brady,  Ranking Member Neal, and my fellow Ways and Means members for their  support.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important bipartisan legislation, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
