 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my greatest concern  and the urgency to act now to address our Nation's opioid crisis and  drug overdoses.   At the height of the pandemic in 2020 we saw record numbers of  overdoses across the country, and in Michigan we saw even more alarming  rates. In 2020, the opioid crisis claimed the loved ones of over 2,400  Michiganders and communities like Ecorse, Michigan, in the 13th  District, has seen the highest overdose rates in our State.   The physical and mental health of our communities are under siege. We  must do more and act with urgency to save lives. Accessibility to  preventive treatments and resources for harm reduction is critical in  keeping our communities safe.   Also, we must not forget the importance of holding for-profit Big  Pharma companies accountable in fueling this epidemic through the sale  of higher doses of opioids to our communities. We must make the bold  action to remove the stigma as well of this crisis, create equitable  treatment plans, and expand access to harm reduction tools for those  who need help.   I applaud the administration for understanding the importance of this  issue, but our communities can't wait another year for a grant or  another study. We must hold the corporate profiteers accountable and  get the boots on the ground to address this crisis.                            ____________________
