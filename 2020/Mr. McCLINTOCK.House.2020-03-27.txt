 Mr. Speaker, COVID-19 didn't kill our economy.  Government policies, however well intentioned, did that. In just a few  weeks, they have derailed the most promising and prosperous economy of  our lifetimes and put us in imminent danger of permanently destroying  millions of American jobs.   The unprecedented spending in this bill threatens to destabilize the  fiscal structure of our Federal Government and suppress future economic  growth.   But in order to deal with those issues, we must first arrest the  damage caused by the actions that have plunged us into a recession.   Temporary job losses will soon become permanent job losses, without  federally guaranteed loans to preserve those jobs and a way for  families to recoup their financial losses. This bill does so, although  inefficiently, wastefully, and at enormous cost.   Despite all its flaws, passage of this bill is, therefore,  imperative. But it is no substitute for getting Americans back to work  soon.
