 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Protecting the  Right to Organize Act.   For more than a decade, I helped lead the Culinary Training Academy  of Las Vegas, the largest job training program  [[Page H1130]]  in Nevada and one of the largest in the country.   Our work to train and place thousands of Nevadans in good union jobs  taught me a lifelong lesson about the power of organized labor to  uplift working people.   As a founding member and co-chair of the Congressional Labor Caucus,  I am proud to support the PRO Act, which will return power to the hands  of workers instead of Wall Street.   The PRO Act will ensure that workers have a seat at the table to  advocate for higher wages, fair benefits, and security in employment  and retirement.   Passing this legislation will protect the right to organize and  provide basic labor protections to millions of workers who are not  currently in a union.   Passing the PRO Act means undoing the damage of the Supreme Court's  Janus decision, revitalizing the National Labor Relations Board, and  rebalancing the scales between corporations and working people.   So I am proud to support the PRO Act because I know that when unions  are strong, America is strong. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  the PRO Act.                            ____________________
