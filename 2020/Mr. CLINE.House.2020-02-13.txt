 Madam Speaker, advancing the cause of our constitutional  Republic by adopting policies that restore the confidence of the public  in the U.S. Congress is one of the goals I have had since my election  last November.   The current lack of confidence is largely due to the dysfunction,  partisanship, and distrust that is so prevalent. That is why I am proud  to work together with my colleagues who are on the Republican Study  Committee government reform task force and who are committed to helping  reform our bloating Federal Government in order to expand opportunities  for all Americans.   Congress was established through Article I of the U.S. Constitution,  and, as such, our Founding Fathers put the utmost responsibility in  lawmakers to uphold their inalienable rights and to maintain proper  transparency while doing so.   Sadly, today's Congress has strayed far from that through Federal  overreach. This makes the task force even more timely and important.   The three main focuses of this task force are reforming government  power structures, practices, and personnel policies. Each of these  categories has a considerable amount of reform that would be meaningful  and effective if enacted.   I am committed to ensuring the beliefs of our Founding Fathers live  on today through Congress' actions by reforming government so that it  truly serves the people for whom it was created and by whom it is  empowered.                            ____________________
