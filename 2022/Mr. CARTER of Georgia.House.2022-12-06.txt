 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Kate  Haslam for her placement on ``Georgia Trend's'' annual 40 Under 40  list.   Kate is a Savannah-based certified public accountant working as an  audit principal for Hancock Askew & Company.   A graduate of the University of Georgia, Kate inherited her ambitious  spirit from her mother who competed in two sports at the college level  while pursuing several graduate degrees--the same drive that allows her  to build a high-level career in accounting while raising two young kids  at home.   Kate is not only a leader in her workplace, but also a leader in the  broader Savannah community. She was a 2021 graduate of Leadership  Savannah, an organization dedicated to instilling good leadership  qualities in managers from a diverse cross section of industries in the  Savannah area.   On top of all this, Kate still finds time to give back to her  community. She participates regularly in volunteer services for the  families of fallen first responders as well as for United Way and the  March of Dimes.    I am proud that so many young people in our district are as  impressive as Kate is, and I am glad that Georgia Trends recognizes  these accomplishments, too.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Kate.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding, and I thank him for sponsoring this Special Order. This is  certainly important, important to all of us who are believers, and I  count myself as one of those.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of one of the greatest gifts  that God has given us, His Word that is the Bible.   As we near the holiday season, we must be mindful of why we  celebrate, which is the birth of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.   As we enter the Christmas season, it is easy to be consumed by the  laundry list of items and tasks that must be completed before you host  or travel to see family and friends. It is easy to become lost and  forget the true meaning and purpose of Christmas.   Friends and fellow Americans, I urge you to remain grounded in the  true story of Christmas, because it is indeed some great news.   Luke Chapter 2, verses 9 through 11, tells us: ``An angel of the Lord  appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they  were terrified. But the angel said to them, `Do not be afraid. I bring  you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. Today in  the town of David a Savior has been born to you; He is the Messiah, the  Lord.' ''   Wow, what a powerful moment that must have been to the shepherds that  night.   The Christmas story is the greatest feel-good story anyone could ever  ask for, that no matter how we sin, what we do, or the disagreements we  may have, the Lord our God, the living God, sent His one and only Son  to die for each of us so that we may all join Him in eternal paradise.  Now, that is the awesome Christmas gift.    Thank you to my friend from Colorado for hosting this important  Special Order. It is indeed important, particularly during this time of  year.
