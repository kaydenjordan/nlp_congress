(b) This paragraph shall not apply to an amendment between       the Houses.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule for consideration of H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure  Appropriations Act, 2018. The rule provides for 2 hours of debate  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the  Appropriations Committee.   Mr. Speaker, the appropriations package in front of us represents the  end product of many months of work by the Appropriations Committee. In  this package, we will be considering four appropriations bills:  Defense, Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military  Construction and Veterans Affairs. Together, the four parts of the bill  make up the Make America Secure Appropriations Act for fiscal year  2018.   The legislation ensures that our most important government services  will be funded responsibly and appropriately and that we will fulfill  our most important responsibilities as legislators: funding the  government and keeping it open to serve our constituents.   The bill provides a total of $658.1 billion for defense, an increase  of $68.1 billion in discretionary funding above the fiscal year 2017  levels, and an increase of $28.3 billion over the President's request.  It also includes $73.9 billion in Overseas Contingency Operations and  Global War on Terrorism funding.   These funds will help us enhance our military readiness, and the  substantial increase marks an end to the ongoing erosion of our  national military strength that occurred during the Obama  administration.   Importantly, this bill also provides an increase in funding for  veterans. Over the past several years, the House has worked to improve  the Department of Veterans Affairs and to ensure that all veterans  receive the care and benefits to which they are entitled.   The Department of Veterans Affairs will receive a 5 percent increase  in this bill, including $74 billion for the Veterans Health  Administration.   The increased funding represents an important step toward fulfilling  our promise to improve care, reduce wait times at the VA, and enhance  benefits for our Nation's veterans.   The Energy and Water portion of this appropriations bill provides  $37.6 billion in funding for fiscal year 2018, a decrease of $209  million from fiscal year 2017.   The bill includes an increase in funding for the National Nuclear  Security Administration that includes funds to restart the licensing  process for Yucca Mountain, the national disposal repository for spent  nuclear fuel. It also provides $6.16 billion for the Army Corps of  Engineers, a $10 million increase over fiscal year 2017.   H.R. 3219 also provides $3.58 billion for the Legislative Branch. It  does not recommend funding levels for the Senate, as per our  longstanding tradition.   The bill includes a significant increase in funding for U.S. Capitol  Police and adds additional funds for securing offices in Washington and  in congressional districts. Importantly, it continues the freeze on  Member pay.   The package before us represents the House fulfilling its primary  responsibility: to fund the government. This package funds hundreds, if  not thousands, of Member priorities, particularly on the defense side.   I applaud my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their  months of working and making this bill a reality. It shows what the  House can do as we move forward toward completion of the fiscal year  appropriations process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the rule and the underlying  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  before I go to my first speaker in order to respond to some of my  friend's points. I want to begin by talking about the amendment process  just very quickly.  [[Page H6316]]    It is worth noting 72 amendments are made in order here; 47 of those  were actually Democratic amendments. Many of the amendments that my  friend referred to that had been submitted to the Rules Committee, at  least a third of them, were knocked out because they were simply out of  order.   But my friend is correct: it is not an open rule. I do remind him  that the first people to eliminate open rules on appropriations bills  were not Republicans. It was actually the Democratic majority in 2009  that ended the practice and, for 2 years, allowed almost no amendments  on any appropriations bills, and most appropriations bills never came  to the floor. So I think my friends bear a considerable amount of  responsibility for where we find ourselves today.   I do want to talk a little bit, too, briefly, about my friend's  comments about the AUMF, because he has been a good friend and a close  ally in an area that we have a similar concern.   I agree with my friend. We need to debate this, and we need to have  an AUMF that is more in tune with the times and, frankly, reintroduces  congressional power and congressional oversight. I have worked with my  friend in the past on that. I am going to continue to work with him on  it going forward.   But in the case of the Lee amendment, which, in full disclosure, I  supported in the Appropriations Committee, the chairman of the  committee of jurisdiction, which is not the Appropriations Committee,  made it known that he would lodge a point of order; so, in other words,  that would never get to the floor.   In place, we have put something that, frankly, will at least require  the administration, on the passage of this bill or the Defense  Authorization Act, in which it is also found, to submit a report that  justifies where the administration is legally, lays out their strategy,  lays out their costs, and gives us a chance to begin a debate.   As a sign of good faith, I am happy to report that the Foreign  Relations Committee, which actually does have jurisdiction here,  actually had their first hearing on a new AUMF earlier this week. So I  think we are trying to get to the same place. My friend may have a  different way to get there, but I agree with him, we need to reexamine,  redebate, and, I think, reenact a new AUMF. I think we are trying to  get there in a step-by-step, logical progression.   Finally, while my friend is concerned about where we will end up in  this process and, I think, legitimately so, I also want to point out we  have actually managed to come together here the last couple of years  and, I suspect, will again.   In fiscal year 2016, we had the same series of events, and yet  Congress came to an agreement on full funding that was bipartisan and  passed by substantial numbers of both parties participating, a majority  in each party. The same thing was true in fiscal year 2017. My hope is  that it will be true again in fiscal year 2018.   But this is an important part of the process. We need to go through  this. At the end of the day, and I tell this to my friends on the right  and the left, we will end up with a bicameral, bipartisan  appropriations bill. There is simply no other way to fund the  Government of the United States, and we pledge to work toward that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Byrne), my good friend, a member of the Rules Committee, but also a  distinguished member of the House Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, before I go to my next speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume to respond to my friends.   First, to my good friend from Massachusetts, and he is very much my  good friend, but when I was in the minority, I asked repeatedly, I used  to come up to the Rules Committee, as a former member of the Rules  Committee, and I always got the warmest, most gracious reception, but I  don't think I ever got an amendment approved. You can legislate on  appropriations bills if the chairman of the authorizing committee  consents to allow you to do it.   I have a great deal of sympathy with my friend's position on Ms.  Lee's amendment. I actually supported that amendment in subcommittee,  but I recognize that we are not the appropriate committee, and if a  different authorizing chairman wanted to do something, he could.   Finally, with all due respect to my friend, we are not the ones that  began this process of eliminating open rules on appropriations. My  friend's party is. We actually tried to restore it. I regret that we  did not succeed in that. This was not something I like doing, but,  frankly, it has gotten around here where people are more interested in  ``got you'' amendments than real amendments, and that is basically what  has happened here. I hope we can revisit that someday and go back to  the traditional way of doing this.   Finally, to my good friend from Minnesota, I want to make a pledge to  her, and she knows it is sincere: we will work together. I don't think  this bill ultimately will be passed without bipartisan cooperation, and  I look at the 2015, 2016, and 2017 bills that all did end up as  cooperative measures.   Just to refresh my friend's memory, it was back in April that we  passed a $1 trillion-plus spending bill for fiscal year 2017 that was  extremely bipartisan. A majority of my friends on the other side of the  aisle voted for it, the majority of my friends voted for it, and the  President of the United States signed it.   This is a long and lengthy process to fund the government, and I  suspect, at the end of it, we will come together. That is certainly  what I am going to try to do as I work through the process.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Gibbs), a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to respond very quickly to my good friend from  Oregon. I just remind him this is a long and  [[Page H6318]]  winding road. It is a long process. As he said, the Senate may very  well move in a different direction.   I tend to focus here on veterans' issues as issues that have largely  brought us together. Quite frankly, this bill has a very substantial  increase in spending at the VA, and that is something that I know, in  committee, garnered wide bipartisan support. Let's wait and see where  we go.   I just want to say I think there will be continuing discussion about  this, but there is also a concern, always, on something like this that  is controversial. We have seen our friends do this before. Sometimes  you will put an amendment in but you won't vote for the final bill.   When you are trying to calculate whether you pass something, you  can't have amendments that cost you votes, that don't get you votes. I  am not suggesting that is my friend's purpose. It is not at all. I know  it is not. I know he is very sincere in this. I am saying that could  easily be the effect.   All I can tell you is we will continue to work through the bill. I  suspect when we get there, at the end of the day, this will be a very  bipartisan bill. It will pass with a very bipartisan majority.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I just want to quickly respond to my friends and remind them that it  wasn't Republicans that got rid of open rules on appropriations. It was  my friends. So you can't set one standard for yourself, and then say:  But you now have to go back to the way it was. We now have to be  treated as a minority, in contrast to the way that we treated you.   I am sorry, that is just difficult. We actually tried to do that for  a couple of years, and we did come back to open rules. And I would  still prefer that, to tell you the truth. I have lost this argument in  my own conference.   But if my friends will recall, last year on, I believe, the Energy  and  [[Page H6319]]  Water Appropriations bill, they slipped an amendment in. It was  perfectly legitimate for them to do so. It was an open rule. They got  that amendment adopted. They did not vote for the bill, even though the  amendment was adopted. We lost a lot of votes, in consequence, because  of the amendment.   So there is always that calculus when you put these things together.  There is a difference between an amendment that is a substantive  amendment, and an amendment that is unrelated and a poison-pill  amendment. Our side just decided they weren't going to subject  themselves to that any longer. I am not sure that I agree with that  decision, but that is the reality of where we are.   There is a second consideration here, too, in terms of limitation  that I think is worth noting. We are moving under an expedited  situation because we began this process late. I want to take  responsibility for that on our side of the aisle.   I think all of the appropriations bills could have and should have  been finished for FY17 in December of 2016. Instead, we started to  allow the new administration to have input. We pushed that off and did  a 4-month continuing resolution. During that period, we did not  negotiate back and forth. We finally passed a bill in April. So we are  moving with exceptional speed.   I think it is pretty remarkable at this point that all 12  appropriations bills have been reported out of committee, and are  preparing to go here. Our leadership made, I think, a smart decision,  in that here are four that all relate to a common theme of security for  the country. Let's get those done. That is sort of first things first.   Let's come back and deal with the other eight in September. It is my  hope that that is what we will do, probably in packages again. But we  are trying to move quickly.   It is also finally worth noting that, again, this process, compared  to the process my Democratic friends followed, is far more open. There  are far more amendments now, even under a structured rule like  this, than they allowed when they were in the majority on  appropriations bills.    We can go get the numbers and count, but we are at least trying to  get back to getting the bills to the floor and having a pretty generous  latitude for serious amendments. We will always disagree over which  ones are made in order. A lot of Republican amendments weren't made in  order either, but 72 amendments on an appropriations bill is a lot of  amendments.   Hopefully, this process can get better as we go forward. I want to  work with my friends in that regard, but I am still very proud of the  product that we are presenting and very proud of the number of  amendments that are being allowed.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I certainly would never expect my friend to vote for the rule. I  mean, I don't think I have ever voted for a Democratic rule. I know  very few Democrats have ever voted for our rules. I don't think I know  any. So that is kind of a normal part of the Chamber.   I want to commend the gentleman for getting that language into the  bill. Again, I respect the gentleman's right to not vote for the bill.  It is a big bill. There are lots of different things in it.   But I think he makes an important point, indirectly, that there are  lots of overlapping things where we do agree inside this bill. My  friends are certainly free to vote ``no,'' and I suspect many will.   There are many occasions in a bill like this, particularly related to  defense and particularly related to veterans, where the component parts  actually have enormous bipartisan support.  [[Page H6322]]  That is certainly true in the Veterans Administration. It is certainly  true with the gentleman's provision that he has gotten in now  successive bills even under Republican Congresses.   I want to commend him for his work in that regard. I agree very much  with his intention. My friend from Massachusetts and I may have some  differences on this and that process, but that is another person that I  agree with in terms of the War Powers Act and in terms of trying to get  a new AUMF and reclaim congressional power.   I actually think, strangely enough, even though we disagree on this,  that this bill starts us maybe down that road again by requiring the  administration to submit a report to justify legally where we are at  and why, to tell us the strategy, to lay out the costs.   I commend my friend, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee,  Mr. Royce, for holding a hearing on that. I see us moving back in that  way toward regular order and, hopefully, toward common ground.   Again, I understand my friend's objections, even when I don't agree  with him. But I also thank my friend from California for pointing out  that there are parts where we do agree. They are important, and they  are incorporated in this bill. Maybe we can make it better in the  amendment process.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank, as always, my good friend for a spirited and  thoughtful debate. He always makes good points. Frankly, I always find  myself more comfortable when we are on the same side--as we  occasionally are--than when we are on opposite sides.   My friend has made many valuable contributions to this institution,  particularly pushing us relentlessly in the right direction of  reclaiming our war-making authority. Having said that, it is always  great to call for a new system, a new way, or a return to open rules  without admitting you are the ones that abandoned them. We actually  tried to restore them. I regret we failed in that, quite frankly, but I  will have to say both sides have gotten used to not doing open rules  because they don't want to cast tough votes. That is why my friends  abandoned the open rule process when they were in the majority in 2009,  and, honestly, that is why we abandoned it last year.   I regret that. I will work with my friend probably not today but  going forward in trying to reclaim that because I think when we lost  it, we diminished the power of every individual Member in Congress. We  thought we were protecting them, but the reality is they now can no  longer come to the floor as an individual and present their own idea.   But at least in this case there are 72 amendments. The majority of  them are from my friend's side of the aisle. I would hope going  forward, particularly when we consider the next eight appropriations  bills, we will continue to be very generous in that regard.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to encourage all Members to support  the rule. H.R. 3219 represents the first step toward fulfilling our  primary obligation as Members of Congress: to fund the government.   We should all be proud of what we have accomplished in putting this  bill forward.   The bill contains the provisions of four of the bills passed out of  the Appropriations Committee representing the work of the Subcommittees  on Defense; Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies;  Legislative Branch; and Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and  Related Agencies.   The bill will significantly increase funding for national defense and  ensure that the men and women in the Armed Forces have the tools they  need. We also increase funding to our veterans to ensure our fighting  men and women will be taken care of long after they leave the service  of their country, and we fund key Member priorities in the areas of  Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies; and Legislative  Branch.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud my colleagues for their hard work.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H.

Sec 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3219, H.R. 2998, or H.R. 3266.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is ENTITLED to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . . . [and] has       no substantive legislative or policy implications       whatsoever.'' But that is not what they have always said.       Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative       Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th       edition, page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the       previous question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is       generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority       Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . . . When       the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of       the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to       ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then       controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or       yield for the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the instructions  in each of the amendments numbered 60, 61, and 66 printed in House  Report 115-259 be modified by striking ``the division'' and inserting  ``division D''.
