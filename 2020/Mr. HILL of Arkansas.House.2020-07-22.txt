 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the heroic  life of Congressman John Robert Lewis and his historic contribution to  the nation we know and love today.   In September 1957, the Little Rock Nine walked into history as they  walked up the front steps of Central High School. It was a pivotal  moment in history.   John said this moment inspired him in his own leadership as an active  member of the Civil Rights Movement.   I had the pleasure of calling John a friend, as did many of my  colleagues, and will cherish the time we had together in the people's  House.   John joining me as legislative cosponsors to expand the Little Rock  Central High National Park boundary is a highlight of my congressional  service.   John will truly be missed, but long remembered. As the USNS John  Lewis sets sail as a new class of naval vessel, we are reminded to  carry on his legacy of dignified leadership.   I join all Americans in honoring the remarkable life of John Lewis.  Martha and I offer prayers for his family and for all those he inspired  and who thus grieve over his loss.
