 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Savannah's E. Shaver, Bookseller, which was voted the South's Best  Bookstore 2020 by the readers of Southern Living magazine.   This cherished bookstore is Savannah's oldest independent bookstore,  and it makes its home in a building erected in the 1840s by Eliza  Jewett, one of the few female builders in the city at the time.   Ed and Esther Shaver turned this space into a bookstore in 1975,  after selling antiques for a short time, and it has been thriving for  over 40 years.   In 2015, Jessica Osborne took the helm in leading this special  bookstore to make it the success that it is today.   This bookstore is more than just a store. It is an important part of  downtown Savannah's character and charm.   I am thankful for Mrs. Osborne's commitment to keeping reading alive  and well and for putting a smile on all faces that enter.   During difficult times like these, it is imperative we support small  businesses like E. Shaver now more than ever.                            ____________________
