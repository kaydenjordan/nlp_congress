 Madam President, along with my colleagues Senator  James Risch, Representative Mike Simpson, and Representative Russ  Fulcher, I congratulate Mark Duffin on his retirement from the Idaho  Sugarbeet Growers Association, after serving as the association's  executive director for the past more than 28 years.   We have greatly valued Mark's insight and partnership on agricultural  and related issues over the years. Mark has not only been an Idaho  agricultural leader, but also a national agricultural leader, given the  high profile of the sugarbeet industry and the crucial role Idaho plays  in supplying the market. Mark has been a stalwart advocate for Idaho's  sugarbeet growers and provided essential guidance on Federal policy  matters impacting the industry, particularly trade, transportation and  labor. From sharing the growers' perspective on multiple farm bill  reauthorizations, international trade agreement negotiations, natural  resource management, and much more. Mark has provided helpful  perspective on Federal policy over the years. Throughout, his  judicious, considerate, and experienced approach has been instrumental.   His understanding of the challenges of agricultural production and  appreciation for those he represents is apparent in his thoughtful  advocacy. Mark grew up on a farm in southeastern Idaho and farmed with  his brother before leading the association. The majority of this Idaho  congressional delegation had the honor of serving with him in the Idaho  State Legislature, as Mark served in the legislature from 1984-1990.  Mark also served as the Power County Farm Bureau president, president  of Food Producers of Idaho, and president of the University of Idaho  College of Agriculture's Agricultural Consulting Council.   We thank Mark for his assistance on behalf of Idahoans and the  producers he has represented and wish him well on his retirement. We  hope Mark enjoys his retirement, but should he find himself with some  spare time, he can always find work driving trucks for his friends and  neighbors in the Idaho sugarbeet industry.                            ____________________
