 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to remember James Butler  III of East Lansing, Michigan.   Lovingly known as the Godfather of Lansing, Mr. Butler lived a life  of service that began when he was born into a Navy family in 1943.   His achievements speak for themselves. He was called to serve in the  Army, finishing top of his class as a noncommissioned officer at Fort  Benning. He served in Vietnam, earning two Purple Hearts and four  Bronze Stars for heroism in combat.   However, if you really want to know who James Butler was, listen to  the words he promised while serving: ``If I make it back, I will give  back.''   Well, he made it back, and he spent the next 30 years working at IBM,  moving to Michigan and breaking barriers as the first Black man to hold  an executive-level position at the company.   Even in retirement, Mr. Butler answered the call to serve, working  under former Governor Granholm as the director of the Michigan  Broadband Development Authority.   In short, Mr. Butler lived a life of giving back. For his work, he  was recognized by too many organizations to list at this time.   But for those who knew him best, Rishan, his wife of 52 years, his  three kids and seven grandkids, he was a good and kind man, and he will  be dearly missed by all.                            ____________________
