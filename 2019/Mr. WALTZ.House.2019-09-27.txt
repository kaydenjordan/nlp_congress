 Madam Speaker, 1 year ago, on October 2, Volusia County,  Florida, lost one of its greatest public servants, Dorothy Hukill.   Dorothy Hukill was a servant leader who dedicated more than two  decades of her life serving our community, working tirelessly to  improve the lives of residents in our area.   She served as a councilwoman of Ponce Inlet before becoming the mayor  of Port Orange. She then headed to the Florida House of  Representatives. It was there that she fought for education and  financial literacy, encouraging high school students to take courses on  money management.   Dorothy didn't care about the spotlight. She preferred to be quiet,  yet effective. She was always on her A game, and she truly cared about  her constituents. Dorothy didn't see people as Republicans, Democrats,  or Independents. She understood the need to work with everyone, and she  truly cared about her community and the people she represented.   Dorothy would put up welcome signs for people in our community who  often planned months in advance to travel to Florida's capitol in  Tallahassee.   Madam Speaker, she was a true example of a servant leader. She sought  to inspire others to make her community a better place, and she is  missed dearly. It is my honor to recognize her on the floor of the  House of Representatives today.                            ____________________
