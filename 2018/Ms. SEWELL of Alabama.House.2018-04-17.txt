 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a mentor, a  fellow Selma, Alabama, native, voting rights activist, and an American  hero, Rev. Dr. Frederick Douglas Reese, who passed away on April 5,  2018, at the age of 88. Dr. Reese is best known for the pivotal role he  played in the Selma to Montgomery march that led to the passage of the  Voting Rights Act of 1965.   It was Dr. Reese, as president of the Dallas County Voters League,  who invited Dr. King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference  to Selma to organize and support their local voting rights campaign. As  a longtime educator, pastor, and civil rights activist, Dr. Reese's  life and legacy stands as a testament to the power of one man's ability  to change the world.   Dr. Reese was born in Selma, Alabama, on November 28, 1929, the only  son of a strong, matriarchal family led by his mother, Ellie R. Reese,  and that included his older sister siblings, Doris Reese and Annie  Ratliff. His strong educational and spiritual home environment, coupled  with the Christian education training he received, was the solid  foundation of his success.   An outstanding student, Dr. Reese graduated from Alabama State  University and Livingston University with a degree in mathematics and  continued his education at the University of Alabama, Southern  University, and Auburn University before receiving his doctorate of  divinity from Selma University.                                time  1030    Dr. Reese's teaching career began in Wilcox County, Alabama, where he  taught science for 9 years and, most significantly, met his future  bride, Alline, a fellow teacher. The two were married on June 28, 1953,  and she remained his lifelong companion for 64 years.   By the mid-1960s, Dr. Reese had returned to teach in Selma, Alabama,  where he became the president of the Dallas County Voters League and  president of the Selma Teachers Association. He used both leadership  positions to actively educate Blacks in Selma about the right to vote.  With courage and tenacity, Dr. Reese led the first-ever teachers march  to the Selma Dallas County Courthouse in which over 100 Black teachers  demanded the right to vote. He challenged his fellow teachers to  exercise their right of citizenship by saying: ``How can we teach  American civics if we ourselves cannot vote?''   As the president of the Dallas County Voters League, he invited Dr.  King to Selma to support their local efforts. With the help of Dr. King  and SCLC, Dr. Reese organized a voting rights march on March 7, 1965, a  day that will live in infamy as Bloody Sunday. During the march,  protesters were brutally beaten and sprayed with tear gas simply for  speaking out for their right to vote.   The sacrifices made that day by foot soldiers like Dr. Reese were  captured on national outlets and led to the rise of so many Americans  who came to Alabama to support their efforts. The Selma to Montgomery  marches which Dr. Reese set in motion led to the passage of the Voting  Rights Act of 1965. While many minority Americans continue to face  barriers to the polls today, our progress as a nation is unmistakable.  We have Dr. Reese to thank for that progress.   On a personal note, I know that I would not be here today as  Alabama's first Black Congresswoman were it not for the work of Dr.  Reese and so many foot soldiers who led the way, who looked our  democracy in the eye and made us hold up to those ideals. It was my  greatest honor as a Member of Congress to present to my fellow Selma  native Dr. Reese the Congressional Gold Medal for his work in the  voting rights movement on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the  Selma to Montgomery march.   Dr. Reese and others helped to change the course of American history  and open the doors of opportunities for African Americans all across  this Nation. We shall never forget the sacrifices that they made to our  country.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Seventh Congressional District of  Alabama; a great, grateful nation; and the State of Alabama, I ask my  colleagues to join me in celebrating the life and contributions of  Reverend Dr. Frederick Douglas Reese.   Dr. Reese was an American hero, a national treasure, a beloved Selma  native whose life's fight for voting rights will forever change the  fabric of American history. May we all recommit ourselves to the cause  he fought for by voting in every election: local, State, and Federal.  [[Page H3349]]                                ____________________
