 Madam Speaker, it is an honor to join  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as Americans to address this  issue and to recognize National Police Week, to support the brave men  and women who protect and serve our communities every day, and to honor  those who paid the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.   The work you do is extraordinary, and it makes me proud to be the  granddaughter of a former Las Cruces police sergeant, Angel Torres. He  didn't talk much about his work on the beat, but  [[Page H3915]]  throughout my life, I have been stopped by people who have told me the  difference he made in their life because he showed he cared by holding  people accountable. He was the true embodiment of what it means to be a  selfless public servant, just like so many in New Mexico and across the  country.   It means something, something I will never fully understand, to know  that every day you risk your life because of what you do.   It means something, something I will never understand, to know that  every day and every time you enforce the law, you could lose your life  because you signed up to serve.   As you risk your life to treat people with humanity, dignity, and  respect, that is superhuman. That is why, during National Police Week  and every day, we support our law enforcement officers and work to  ensure they have the resources they need to protect and serve our  communities.
