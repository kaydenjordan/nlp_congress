 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express opposition to H.  Con. Res. 3.   The resolution is nothing but a political move by extreme Republicans  that is both disingenuous and actually puts healthcare clinics at risk.   This resolution only focuses on protecting pro-life pregnancy centers  and faith-based women's health clinics, which are not medical  facilities.   Let me be clear: I condemn violence in all of its forms. In fact,  here is a fact: At clinics that provide abortion services, attacks are  on the rise, increasing 128 percent in just 1 year. This source is from  the National Abortion Federation report.   The resolution before us today falls short of condemning violence.  The Pro-Choice Caucus resolution that I support condemns all acts of  violence on healthcare personnel, patients, and facilities and affirms  that everyone has the freedom to access reproductive healthcare  services without fear of violence.   Let us all stand together and condemn all acts of political violence.                            ____________________
