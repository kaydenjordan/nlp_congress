 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of this package  and an amendment that includes additional funding for the Native  American CDFI Assistance Program.   The CDFI Fund's Native Initiatives program seeks to level the  economic playing field by providing awards to organizations that make  credit, capital, and other essential financial services available to  underserved and impoverished Native communities.   In the past, this program has provided funding to organizations like  Lei Ho'olaha, which provides financial training and loans to charter  schools and community centers in Hawaii to help make them creditworthy.  It also provides funding to the Council for Native Hawaiian  Advancement, which helps provide access to capital for people living in  Native Hawaiian communities to help them purchase affordable homes,  start new businesses, and to help drive commerce.   We must build upon this progress in Native communities and increase  the funding for the CDFI Fund's Native Initiatives to build businesses,  create jobs, empower these Native communities, and spur economic  growth. Please support this amendment.
