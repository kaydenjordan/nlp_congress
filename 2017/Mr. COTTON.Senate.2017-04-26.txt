 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to honor the memory of  former Congressman Jay Dickey, who passed on April 20. When Jay Dickey  roamed the Halls of Congress, you knew there might be mischief afoot-- and what merry mischief it was.   Jay was opinionated, colorful, and zany. Now that he has passed, the  warm laughter of memories once again echoes in these cold, marble halls  as we reflect on his life.   He died last Thursday after a battle with Parkinson's, a battle he  fought like every other--with determination and gusto. I, for one, will  miss his counsel and friendship, as will the people of Arkansas whom he  loved so deeply.   Jay was an Arkansas original. He was born and bred and in the end  breathed his last in his hometown of Pine Bluff. He shared a lot in  common with the mighty pines of South Arkansas. He stood tall and proud  of his community's heritage. He was a pillar of the community. A lawyer  and a businessman, he left his mark as an entrepreneur, starting  franchises throughout the State, as an advocate representing the city  and later taking on such famous clients as coach Eddie Sutton.   Unlike the proverbial tree in the forest, now that Jay Dickey has  fallen, the whole State has taken notice.   But, of course, a man's accomplishments are only a window into his  character. You had to know Jay personally to get a sense of all the fun  there was inside him. It was as if his feet had sunk deep into the soil  and soaked up all of the Natural State's richness: its humor, its  earnestness, and its strip-the-bark-off candor.   I got to know Jay in my first political campaign. We had never met,  and I was a political newcomer, but Jay spent many hours getting to  know me and ultimately supported my candidacy, which helped to put me  on the map.   Of course, Jay shared a lot of candid advice too. After attending one  of my early townhalls, Jay and I went to lunch down the road at Cracker  Barrel. I asked him how I did. Jay replied:         Ya did good. Ya did good. But you gotta cut it down some.       Ya see that baked potato there? That's a fully loaded baked       potato--it's got cheese, sour cream, bacon, onions. Your       answers are like that fully loaded baked potato! Make em like       a plain potato.    That is just one of the countless stories that added to his legend.   This was the man who offered a ninth grader a college-level  internship because he thought the kid had potential; the man who  answered any phone in his office that rang twice, just to keep his  staff on their toes; the man whose dog once drove his truck into a  radio station in Hampton because he left the truck running during an  interview to keep the dog cool, and somehow that dog put it in gear;  the man who kept a picture of Jesus on his wall, and who, when meeting  a new client, would point to the picture and say: ``Have you met my  friend?''   Yes, the first great joy of his life was his faith, but the second  great joy was politics. Jay was the first Republican elected to  Congress from South Arkansas since Reconstruction. He won in 1992, the  very same year Arkansas elected our Democratic Governor as President.   Despite being who the Democrats must have viewed as the most  Republican incumbent in the country, he held onto that seat for almost  a decade. Arkansans knew good stock when  [[Page S2543]]  they saw it. He lost only by the narrowest of margins in 2000, with  President Bill Clinton campaigning for his opponent, then-State Senator  Mike Ross. True to form for Jay, he and Mike would become friends after  that race, speaking regularly about issues and their faith.   Jay's time in office will not be remembered as a historical oddity,  an anomaly, or a one-off because unconventional though it was, it was  also a forerunner of things to come. It was an early sign of a coming  political realignment, as the small towns that dotted rural America-- towns where few people had ever even seen a Republican, never mind  voted for one--were starting to cast their votes up and down the ballot  for the Grand Old Party.   In other words, Jay Dickey was a trailblazer--or perhaps a bulldozer.  He smashed through history and precedent and grooved a path in rough  terrain for the rest of us to follow. For that, he has my thanks and  the thanks of the people of Arkansas, and for his humorous, quirky,  unparalleled example, he has the thanks of the U.S. Congress, which  today is a little sadder for his passing but also a little brighter for  his memory.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
