 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and H.R.  3905, the Minnesota Economic Rights in the Superior National Forest  Act.   17,000 jobs, $3 billion for education, $1.5 billion in annual wages,  and $2.5 billion annually for our economy are at risk if we don't pass  H.R. 3905. Further, there are more than 4 billion tons of ore  containing copper, nickel, and other metal resources within the area  the previous administration tried to shut down, which represents the  largest known undeveloped deposit of strategic and critical minerals in  the world.   If left unchallenged, these political anti-mining and anti-education  actions set precedent for a sweeping executive power grab that  threatens communities throughout the country. Education will be  significantly harmed, as Minnesota is projected to lose up to $3  billion in royalty revenues for the State's permanent school trust fund  that would support nearly 900,000 K-12 students statewide if the  withdrawal application and canceled leases are not rejected.   As the President, on January 19, was leaving office, he actually  proposed a massive land withdrawal in northern Minnesota, immediately  placing 245,000 acres off limits to development potentially for 20 more  years in the future.   In conjunction with this massive mineral withdrawal, the Obama  administration's Bureau of Land Management inappropriately rejected  Twin Metals Minnesota's application to renew two hard rock mineral  leases in Minnesota's Superior National Monument.   Finally, I want to put to rest the false claim raised by the  extremist groups that this bill would affect the 1.1-million-acre  Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness that already has a significant  buffer between it and the forest.   No one is advocating to mine in the wilderness or the surrounding  buffer zones. In fact, the bill clearly states on page 4: ``Nothing in  this section may be construed as permitting the prospecting for  development and utilization of mineral resources within the Boundary  Waters Canoe Area Wilderness or Mine Protection Area.''   Congress has authorized mining in the forest by law two different  times, and the 1986 Forest Service and 2004 Forest Plans both concluded  mining is a desired condition in the Superior National Forest.   Mr. Speaker, I ask Members to support this commonsense, job-creating  bill and to support the rule to bring this bill to the floor for proper  adjudication.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 631, I call up  the bill (H.R. 3905) to require congressional approval of any mineral  withdrawal or monument designation involving the National Forest System  lands in the State of Minnesota, to provide for the renewal of certain  mineral leases in such lands, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H.R. 3905.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), the originator of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), the originator of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to remind everybody I am wearing a copper tie,  and that is because I come from Arizona. We are known as the 5 Cs: for  the cotton, for the climate, for the cattle, for the citrus, and for  copper. It is a critical mineral.   We have seen these displays here in the well this morning, diverting  the public's attention about what truly is actually here.   This is actually a cite to explain to people exactly the clear  definition. Let's look at this.   What you see in red and yellow, just like a light that you see red,  stop; yellow, caution; green, go, the red is the Boundary Waters. The  red is the Boundary Waters: no mining, no mining whatsoever. The yellow  is a buffer.   By the way, the only place in the United States in which a monument  is surrounded by a buffer: no, don't proceed.   They confused you with that map. This is where we are talking about,  down in here, in the green area. It is not the Boundary Waters. The  pictures you saw that were in the well so eloquently shown to us were  of the Boundary Waters, not where the mining is going to take place.   Let's dispel the rumors. Let's get back down to facts.   Red, no mining; yellow, no mining; green, okay. But that is following  rules. That is following all rules.   Once again, just to remind folks back home that are watching, the red  is the Boundary Waters. There is no mining in the Boundary Waters. The  pictures you saw in the well are of the Boundary Waters. No mining  occurs in the Boundary Waters.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the charge is Minnesotans strongly oppose mining near  the  [[Page H9509]]  Boundary Waters, so let's go back, remind everybody back at home about  the red. We are not talking about the red or the yellow in the previous  document. Let's go through what we see.   Minnesota's Democratic Governor was for mining in the area before he  was against it. Several polls over the years consistently show strong  support for copper-nickel mining in general and for allowing companies  to explore and propose projects.   In November of 2016, a poll of 400 registered voters in the Eighth  Congressional District found, among other results, by greater than a 3  to 1 margin, survey respondents support environmentally responsible  mining in the region.   By greater than 2-to-1 margins, respondents support the building of a  new copper-nickel mine and believe copper-nickel mining can be done in  an environmentally responsible way. They demand that. More than 60  percent support an underground copper-nickel project, the Twin Metals  mine.   In October 2013, a poll of more than 600 registered Minnesota voters  statewide found, among other results, a majority of voters, 56 percent,  favor expanding Minnesota's mining industry.   A plurality of voters, 48 percent, support expanding the nickel- copper mining industry in the State.   All mayors, State legislators, the county commissioners that  represent the Iron Range region, and the area proposed for the  withdrawal are pro-mining advocates. Fifty-three bipartisan State  legislators, including leadership of both parties, have endorsed the  bill and support the passage.   Why is that?   These aren't just your average jobs. They don't pay service wages of  $20,000. These are $100,000 plus and, additionally, have benefits.  Those are jobs that Americans sink their teeth into. That is what built  America.   Stay tuned. I am going to show you some other photos of how they  really look at mining.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This bill alters no current environmental laws or protections. Mining  companies will still have to comply with the Clean Water Act, Clean Air  Act, NEPA, and all State and Federal laws.   In fact, the local communities--everybody wants clean water. These  people actually live in the area. These local communities actually want  mining in Minnesota. It results in cleaner water. This is actually a  viewpoint of an actual mine site. This is a long time ago. This is a  pit. What ends up happening is, they are very proud, because Minnesota  is proud of their water.   This picture is before, and this is after. Can you imagine local  municipalities and towns lining up for this water? This is the cleanest  water in Minnesota. This is how they will actually reclaim the water.  This isn't me. These are the people from the area who gave us these  photos. And if you want to see an in-depth video, go to YouTube and  look up the video that the people back in this region put together.  This actually shows you, this is clean water. This is where you have  pristine fisheries. They line up for this water.   There are no environmental hazards. Minnesota's mining industry has  been proud of what they have actually built. Once again, before and  after, it is an inconceivable difference.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    That is a taconite pit.    Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman is talking about this whole  aspect, the gentleman is right, but it is about all mining. This isn't  just about copper mining. This is about taconite and all other mining.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask a question of the  gentleman from California. Can the gentleman give me an example of a  mine that he actually supports?    I yield to the gentleman from California.    Reclaiming my time, once again, the gentleman can't  identify a single mine that is permissible to the opposition.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We have heard some other charges that H.R. 3905 changes five Federal  laws for Minnesota's national forests. This bill alters no current  environmental laws or protections. The Federal Land Policy and  Management Act, NEPA, and all other environmental laws still apply to  Minnesota.   Let's go through this history. In 1950, Congress took action to make  land available for mineral exploration and development within the  Superior National Forest. Congress did. Then again, in 1978, Congress  passed the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act, a compromise that  prohibited mining within the 1.1 million acre Boundary Waters; once  again, the red area and the yellow. No mining.   But again, it specifically authorized mining in the Superior National  Forest, the green. Once again, red, no; yellow, no; green, go. But that  is fulfilling all current legislative and environmental laws.   The General Mining Act of 1872 that we heard about earlier governs  most mining on Federal lands. However, in this case, it does not. It is  the Weeks Act that controls projects in this area because they are  located on acquired National Forest mineral leases on these lands.  There are no indefinite agreements. They typically retain a  nondiscretionary right--nondiscretionary right, once again--to renew  every 20 years. The two leases for the mineral deposit in question  began in 1966, were renewed in 1989, and again in 2004, without  controversy.   The MINER Act halts last-minute political mineral withdrawals by  requiring congressional approval. Once again, the magical words are  ``congressional approval.'' The return to federalism--amazing--renews  those two mining leases that were denied for political reasons under  the same terms they were renewed twice previously and ensures any  future mining projects will have to satisfy all existing environmental  permitting requirements, including NEPA.   These people demand that they do it in a righteous way. There is no  digging right now. These are proposed. The Minnesotans whom I came up  to visit, they happily shared their history and their area with me.  They want it done right because they have to live with the  consequences; not somebody who comes from Twin Cities once in a blue  moon.   Once again, let's go back. This is the Boundary Waters. This is what  you have heard misrepresented all the way around. There is no mining  going on in the Boundary Waters. There is no mining going on in the  buffer area. Once again, no other buffer exists around a national  monument except this. This is hallowed ground. Green, go.   Now, it is also very unfortunate that we hear rumors going around  from Members of Congress that the Department of the Interior actually  is against this. That rumor is far from the truth. We just received an  email from the Secretary of the Interior that they are not opposed to  this bill.   I include in the Record a list of over 150 groups, individuals, and  community leaders who now want to be on record as supporting the lawful  aspects of returning this back to the folks in Minnesota for mining.

Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, what transpired here was a travesty. As I  outlined, historically, Congress dictated twice in a usual fashion this  green area for go. They designed the Boundary Waters and a buffer area  for protection.   Once again, no Boundary Waters--you are being misled--no Boundary  Waters are having mining. This is as clear as it gets. What ended up  happening was in an illegal action by the President last year, or  earlier this year, he wiped this away.   This doesn't wipe away any environmental laws. What it does is, it  returns it to the way it was. The way that it should be; the way that  Congress dictated. Federalism, a return to the people in that State.   Mr. Speaker, I ask everybody to vote for this bill and support this  bill. I also ask everybody to go to a video that has been produced by  the people in this iron-ore range to see exactly how the people of that  area of Minnesota actually feel about it. It is magnificent.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, in July, the Subcommittee on Energy and  Mineral Resources heard all about how royalties, if ill-constructed,  serve only to disincentivize investment in self-sufficiency and  increase our reliance on imported critical minerals.   This amendment is a hallmark example of such a poorly designed  royalty. This amendment doesn't specify what the royalty will be  applied to, when in the mining process it will be assessed, and it  doesn't even have a cap, for that matter. This amendment is just a  thinly veiled means to prevent this important mining project from  getting off the ground. The author actually stated that in his  comments.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this amendment. I ask all Members to vote  against it, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, once again, we may want to go back to misinformation.  This does not pertain to the Mining Act of 1872. In fact, this is under  the Weeks Act, which controls projects in this area because they are  located on acquired natural forest land. Mineral leases on these lands,  though not indefinite agreements, typically retain nondiscretionary  right for renewal every 20 years.   The two leases for mineral deposits in question began in 1966, were  renewed in 1989, and again in 2004 without controversy.   I would also like to take the opportunity to go through a number of  groups that actually are against this amendment and endorse the bill.   Fifty-three bipartisan State legislators from the State of Minnesota  are for this bill: ``As elected leaders of the Minnesota Legislature,  we are writing in strong support of H.R. 3905. This legislation  supports jobs, economic development and industry in northeast  Minnesota, and will reverse an onerous, overreaching, and politically  motivated decision by the Obama administration. H.R. 3905 has  bipartisan support, and it is our sincere hope that it will become law  for the well-being of our State and its citizens.''    A second one from the Range Association of Municipalities and  Schools:         The results of the withdrawal and a potential 20-year       moratorium would have a devastating impact on the financial       support for our statewide public school system and future       generations of Iron Rangers who would be employed in any       future mining developments. It has been estimated that within       20 years of mining for precious metals, our Permanent School       Trust Fund would reap nearly $3 billion in royalties if       allowed to go forward. The Miner Act does not infringe or       restrict these very strenuous and stringent environmental       review processes, and we emphasize there will be no mining in       the Boundary Waters or the buffer zone specifically       surrounding the Boundary Waters.    Let's go to the next one from the American Exploration & Mining  Association: ``H.R. 3905 will eliminate delays, return to good  stewardship of fair process and restore the opportunity to explore  strategic metals critical to our economy and national security in one  of the richest mineral deposits in the Nation. . . . The emerging  mining industry is an investment in the future well-being of our State  and Nation; without this legislation, that future is at risk.''   Here is another one from the Competitive Enterprise Institute: ``The  bipartisan H.R. 3905 is a welcome reassertion of congressional  authority over public lands. Article 4 of the Constitution vests  Congress--not the President--with plenary power over public  [[Page H9512]]  lands. Members on both sides of the aisle should take umbrage at  President Obama's lameduck machinations to withdraw from the multiple- use framework more than 230,000 acres of public lands in Minnesota-- with the mere stroke of a pen. By treating public lands regulation as a  means to build a Presidential legacy through midnight regulation, the  previous administration flouted the spirit of participatory and  inclusive lands-use statutes as designed by Congress. Lawmakers should  correct the course by passing the excellent H.R. 3905.''   Finally, the Associated General Contractors of Minnesota:         H.R. 3905 changes no environmental review processes,       relaxes no environmental standards, and specifically restates       Congress' prohibition on any mining activity in the Boundary       Waters and surrounding protective buffer areas. H.R. 3905       would reaffirm longstanding congressional intent that       actually espouses that this area be designated for mining and       timber sales.    Mr. Speaker, I ask everybody to vote against this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
