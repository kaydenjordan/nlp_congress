 Mr. Chairman, I can only tell you what I was       thinking at the time. That is not what I understood the       President to be doing.         No, sir.         No, sir.         That is correct, sir.         It did not, sir.         No, sir.         Correct, sir.    Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Significantly, the Ukrainian Government never  raised any concerns about the July 25 call. Just hours after the call,  Ambassador William Taylor, head of the U.S. mission in Ukraine, had  dinner with then-Secretary of the Ukrainian National Security and  Defense Council, who seemed to think that the call went fine.         The call went well. He wasn't disturbed by anything.    The House managers didn't tell you that. Why not?   Ambassador Kurt Volker, the U.S. Special Representative for Ukraine,  was not on the call, but Ambassador Volker spoke regularly with  President Zelensky and other top officials in the Ukraine Government  and even met with President Zelensky the day after the call. He  testified that in no way, shape, or form in either the readouts for the  United States or Ukraine did he receive any indication whatsoever for  anything that resembles a quid pro quo on the July 25 call.   Here is Ambassador Volker.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
