 Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator Jim Risch  and Representative  Mike Simpson, I congratulate all those who worked  on the completion of the Idaho Gold Star Memorial Monument to honor  Idaho's fallen servicemembers and commemorate the enormous cost of our  freedoms shouldered by their families.   We commend the members of the Idaho Gold Star Families Memorial  Monument Committee on their work to see this project through to  completion. Bringing together the partners, volunteers, and many  supporters to make the monument happen was no small undertaking. We  extend a special thank you to the committee's chairperson, Gold Star  mother Rebecca Webb, for leading the establishment of the memorial. You  have turned your profound sorrow for the loss of your son, MSG  Christopher Webb, and the grief of all Gold Star Families, into a  profound tribute to the great strength and devotion of our Nation's  servicemembers and their families.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S2570, May 18, 2021, the following appears: MSA  Christopher Webb      The online Record has been corrected to read: MSG Christopher  Webb    ========================= END NOTE =========================      How great it is to reach the final stage in the transformation of a  piece of Idaho into an enduring memorial. From the memorial's large,  central gold star symbolizing the great loss experienced by loved ones  of fallen servicemembers, to the inherent recognition of the service of  those who laid down their lives for our country, the depth of your love  is clear in every thoughtful detail. You honor not only the memories of  your loved ones but also the lives of the servicemembers and families  who served our country before them and those who will follow in their  eternal footsteps.   We are blessed to have this outstanding tribute in Idaho and to be  part of the network of Gold Star memorials nationwide. You have created  a beautiful place of tribute to Gold Star Families, who give far more  to our country than we can ever reciprocate. The Idaho Gold Star  Families Memorial stands as a lasting place for all Americans to  remember fallen servicemembers and the great sacrifice of the families  who stood with them and will always love them.                            ____________________
