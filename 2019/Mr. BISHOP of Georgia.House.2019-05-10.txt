 Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Madam Chair, on October 10, 2018, my district  took a direct hit from Hurricane Michael, one of the most powerful  storms to make landfall in U.S. history. It slammed into the Florida  panhandle and drove through much of the Southeast, leaving a path of  destruction all the way up to Virginia.   In Georgia, many producers suffered nearly 100 percent crop losses.  Hurricane Michael killed more than 2 million chickens and devastated  the Georgia cotton crop, which was nearing peak harvest and was on  track to be the best crop in years. This is the third straight year  hurricane damage caused significant losses to peanut, pecan, cotton,  vegetable, landscaping, and the agri-tourism industries.  [[Page H3701]]    The Carolinas also suffered billions in damages a month earlier from  Hurricane Florence. Californians had another devastating fire season,  including both the largest and deadliest fires on record. In Hawaii,  volcanic activity cost pineapple farmers nearly $30 million in damages.  Americans in the Mariana Islands and American Samoa were also hit by  cyclones.   To meet these needs, this House passed and sent to the Senate an  emergency supplemental appropriations bill on January 16 that allocated  $14 billion in emergency spending to help families and communities  recover from these hurricanes, wildfires, and other natural disasters.   Agriculture provided $3 billion for crop losses, $150 million for the  Rural Community Facilities Program, $480 million for the Emergency  Forest Restoration Program, and $125 million for the Emergency  Watershed Program. They provided $600 million in desperately needed  funds to help with Puerto Rico's continued recovery from Hurricane  Diane in 2017.   Madam Chair, I thank my fellow Georgian, Austin Scott, and the  bipartisan leadership, the House leadership, our committees for quickly  getting this bill passed. But as we passed it and sent it to the  Senate, the Trump Office of Management and Budget issued a Statement of  Administration Policy saying that FEMA had enough money and that this  money was not needed. That could not be further from the truth. I  disagree. Farmers and communities in all of the impacted States  disagree, and even the USDA disagrees.   The emergency supplemental appropriations bill has been stalled in  the Senate for 4 long months, with no action and no relief for  Americans who are suffering. American farmers are living through the  worst economic crisis in 30 years, driven by low commodity prices,  trade war pressures, and natural disasters. Those impacted have had  their patience stretched thin and cannot wait any longer for disaster  assistance that they were promised.   Right now, due to the disaster losses, farmers can't pay their  operational loans from last year, nor can they get new loans to plant  and operate this year. Planting season is now. We already are in the  growing season, with conditions permitting normal growth. If we miss  this window, it will have lasting effects on agriculture production,  including food, fiber, building materials, and fuel, that will increase  costs for American consumers all over this country.   We are about to enter the 2019 hurricane season, which starts June 1.  So today I am once again supporting this emergency supplemental bill,  as more disasters have hit since the last bill passed, the latest being  terrible floods in the Midwest and tornadoes that ripped through  Georgia and Alabama.   This expanded supplemental bill will provide for the needs of those  who suffered in those disasters and will add $3 billion, bringing the  appropriations total to $17.2 billion, which will cover all disasters  and get much-needed funds to those who were devastated and affected by  Hurricane Michael.                                time  1000    From coast to coast throughout the territories, there is an urgent  need for this disaster bill. As I said last October, after touring the  damage from Hurricane Michael with the President, Vice President, and  the Secretary of Agriculture, responding to natural disasters and  helping our communities recover is a responsibility that we all share,  regardless of ideology or political affiliation. Failure to respond now  will result in failures later and suffering later throughout this  country.   Madam Chair, I urge my House and Senate colleagues to support this  bill to finally bring relief to our long-suffering communities.   Madam Chair, I support the gentlewoman's amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  although I support the amendment.    Madam Chair, I understand that this sudden  reversal in the program was disconcerting for many of the universities  and researchers that have received funding in the past and hope to do  so in the future. Based on that, I have no objection to this amendment,  and I fully support it.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  although I support the amendment.    Madam Chair, until the Midwest floods struck,  the U.S. Department of Agriculture was fairly confident that the  Emergency Watershed Protection Program needs were fully met with the  $125 million that was in the bill. However, on April 25, the USDA  advised us that the estimate had increased to $435 million with large  funding needs in Iowa and in Nebraska, in particular. This amendment  would bring the bill to that level. So I am therefore happy to support  the amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.  Fortenberry), who is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and  Related Agencies of the Appropriations Committee.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Utah (Mr. Curtis).    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my  time.
