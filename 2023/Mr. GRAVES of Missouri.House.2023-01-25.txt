 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 255) to amend the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of  2018 to develop a study regarding streamlining and consolidating  information collection and preliminary damage assessments, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H. R. 255         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Disaster Assistance       Coordination Act''.       SEC. 2. STUDY TO STREAMLINE AND CONSOLIDATE INFORMATION                     COLLECTION AND PRELIMINARY DAMAGE ASSESSMENTS.         (a) In General.--Section 1223 of the Disaster Recovery       Reform Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-254) is amended to read as       follows:       ``SEC. 1223. STUDY TO STREAMLINE AND CONSOLIDATE INFORMATION                     COLLECTION AND PRELIMINARY DAMAGE ASSESSMENTS.         ``(a) Information Collection.--Not later than 2 years after       the date of enactment of this section, the Administrator, in       coordination with the Small Business Administration, the       Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Disaster       Assistance Working Group of the Council of the Inspectors       General on Integrity and Efficiency, and other appropriate       agencies, shall--        ``(1) conduct a study and develop a plan, consistent with       law, under which the collection of information from disaster       assistance applicants and grantees will be modified,       streamlined, expedited, efficient, flexible, consolidated,       and simplified to be less burdensome, duplicative, and time       consuming for applicants and grantees; and  [[Page H294]]         ``(2) develop a plan for the regular collection and       reporting of information on Federal disaster assistance       awarded, including the establishment and maintenance of a       website for presenting the information to the public.        ``(b) Preliminary Damage Assessments.--Not later than 2       years after the date of enactment of this section, the       Administrator, in consultation with the Council of the       Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, shall convene       a working group on a regular basis with the Secretary of       Labor, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget,       the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Administrator       of the Small Business Administration, the Secretary of       Transportation, the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for       Economic Development, and other appropriate agencies as the       Administrator considers necessary, to--        ``(1) identify and describe the potential areas of       duplication or fragmentation in preliminary damage       assessments after disaster declarations;        ``(2) determine the applicability of having one Federal       agency make the assessments for all agencies; and        ``(3) identify potential emerging technologies, such as       unmanned aircraft systems, consistent with the requirements       established in the FEMA Accountability, Modernization and       Transparency Act of 2017 (42 U.S.C. 5121 note), to expedite       the administration of preliminary damage assessments.        ``(c) Comprehensive Report.--The Administrator shall submit       one comprehensive report that comprises the plans developed       under subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) and a report of the       findings of the working group convened under subsection (b),       which may include recommendations, to the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate.        ``(d) Public Availability.--The comprehensive report       developed under subsection (c) shall be made available to the       public and posted on the website of the Federal Emergency       Management Agency--        ``(1) in pre-compressed, easily downloadable versions that       are made available in all appropriate formats; and        ``(2) in machine-readable format, if applicable.        ``(e) Sources of Information.--In preparing the       comprehensive report, any publication, database, or web-based       resource, and any information compiled by any government       agency, nongovernmental organization, or other entity that is       made available may be used.        ``(f) Briefing.--Not later than 180 days after submission       of the comprehensive report, the Administrator of the Federal       Emergency Management Agency, or a designee, and a member of       the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and       Efficiency, or a designee, shall brief, upon request, the       appropriate congressional committees on the findings and any       recommendations made in the comprehensive report.''.        (b) Technical Amendment.--The item relating to section 1223       in the table of contents of the FAA Reauthorization Act of       2018 (Public Law 115-254) is amended to read as follows: ``Sec. 1223. Study to streamline and consolidate information collection                and preliminary damage assessments.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Mrs. Gonzalez- Colon) for her leadership on this bill.   H.R. 255 is commonsense legislation to establish a process that is  going to identify ways to streamline and consolidate the collection of  certain disaster information.   While the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, is the lead  Federal agency on disasters, there are often many Federal agencies  involved in the disaster response and recovery process.   It is critically important that these agencies are all working  efficiently to minimize overlaps in their assessments and utilize new  technologies to streamline processes.   Specifically, the legislation is going to establish a Federal working  group led by FEMA to coordinate with the Council of the Inspectors  General on Integrity and Efficiency to identify ways to reduce  duplication and streamline the Federal damage assessment process.   This is just a good government bill that will help improve disaster  recovery efforts which were previously passed by the House in the 116th  and 117th Congresses.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, H.R. 255 is just  good government legislation that is going to help streamline disaster  recovery efforts by improving the coordination efficiency of Federal  agencies involved in disaster assistance.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 259) to provide for an online repository for  certain reporting requirements for recipients of Federal disaster  assistance, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 259         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Post-Disaster Assistance       Online Accountability Act''.       SEC. 2. SUBPAGE FOR TRANSPARENCY OF DISASTER ASSISTANCE.         (a) Establishment of Repository for Reporting       Requirements.--The Director of the Office of Management and       Budget, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury       and the head of each covered Federal agency, shall establish       a subpage within the website established under section 2 of       the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of       2006 (31 U.S.C. 6101 note) to publish the information       required to be made available to the public under this       section.        (b) Submission of Information by Federal Agencies.--Not       later than 30 days after the end of a calendar quarter, each       covered Federal agency that made disaster assistance       available to an eligible recipient during such quarter shall,       in coordination with the Director of the Office of Management       and Budget, make available to the public on the subpage       established under subsection (a) the information described in       subsection (c), and ensure that any data asset of the agency       is machine readable.        (c) Information Required.--The information described in       this subsection is, with respect to disaster assistance       provided by the covered Federal agency--        (1) the total amount of disaster assistance provided by the       agency during such quarter;        (2) the amount of disaster assistance provided by the       agency that was expended or obligated to projects or       activities; and        (3) a detailed list of all projects or activities for which       disaster assistance dispersed by the agency was expended,       obligated, or used, including--        (A) the name of the project or activity;        (B) a description of the project or activity;        (C) an evaluation of the completion status of the project       or activity;        (D) any award identification number assigned to the       project;        (E) the Catalog for Disaster Assistance number assigned by       the Federal Emergency Management Agency;        (F) the location of the project, including ZIP Codes; and        (G) any reporting requirement information being collected       by a covered Federal agency with respect to that agency's       disaster assistance.        (d) Guidance.--Each covered Federal agency, in coordination       with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and       the Secretary of the Treasury, shall issue such guidance as       is necessary to meet the requirements of this Act.        (e) Agreement With Private Entity.--The Director, if       necessary for purposes of transparency, may enter into an       agreement with a private entity, including a nonprofit       organization, to develop the subpage required under this       section.

[[Page H296]]      Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material into the Record on H.R. 259.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 259, the Post-Disaster Assistance Online  Accountability Act, introduced by our Republican colleague from Puerto  Rico (Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon), will increase transparency for post- disaster Federal assistance.   H.R. 259 requires agencies that provide Federal disaster assistance  to update a central website quarterly with information on their  disaster assistance programs. This increased transparency is going to  allow the American taxpayers to see where their hard-earned dollars are  going and which areas are receiving the most Federal assistance for  post-disaster recovery.   The Post-Disaster Assistance Online Accountability Act passed the  House last Congress overwhelmingly by a vote of 412 yeas to 2 nays. I  hope we can repeat this very strong showing this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Small Business,                                   Washington, DC, January 19, 2023.      Hon. Sam Graves,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Graves: I write concerning H.R. 259, the Post       Disaster-Assistance Online Accountability Act. The bill was       referred primarily to the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure, with additional referrals to the Committee on       Financial Services and the Committee on Small Business.       Specifically, provisions of H.R. 259 fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on Small Business.        I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this       legislation before the House of Representatives in an       expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on Small       Business will forgo action on the bill. However, this is       conditional on our mutual understanding that doing so will       not prejudice the Committee on Small Business with respect to       the appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional       claim over the subject matter contained in the bill or       similar legislation that falls within the Committee on Small       Business's Rule X jurisdiction. Further, should a conference       on the bill be necessary, I appreciate your agreement to       support my request to have the Committee represented on the       conference committee.        Finally, I would ask that a copy of this letter and your       response acknowledging our jurisdictional interest in the       bill be included in the Congressional Record during       consideration of H.R. 259 on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                 Roger Williams,                                                           Chairman,      House Committee on Small Business.                                   ____           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,                                        House of Representatives,                                   Washington, DC, January 19, 2023.        Hon. Roger Williams Chairman,      Chairman, Committee on Small Business,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Williams: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 259, the Post Disaster Assistance Online Accountability       Act. I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively to       ensure that H.R. 259 is considered expeditiously before the       House of Representatives.        In response to your letter, I recognize that this bill       contains provisions that fall within the jurisdiction of the       Committee on Small Business. I also acknowledge that your       Committee's decision to forgo consideration would not       prejudice your Committee regarding the appointment of       conferees, to any future jurisdictional claim over the       subject matters contained in the bill, or to similar       legislation falling under your Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction. In addition, should a conference on this bill       become necessary, I would support your request to have       members of the Committee on Small Business represented on the       conference committee.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during consideration on the House       floor. Thank you again, I appreciate your cooperation       regarding this legislation and look forward to continuing to       work with you as this measure moves through the legislative       process.            Sincerely,                                                        Sam Graves,      Chairman.                                   ____                                    Committee on Financial Services,                                        House of Representatives,                                   Washington, DC, January 20, 2023.      Hon. Sam Graves,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Graves: I am writing concerning H.R. 259, the       ``Post-Disaster Assistance Online Accountability Act.'' Per       your request, I agree that the Committee on Financial       Services shall be discharged from further consideration of       the bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House       Floor. The Committee takes this action with the mutual       understanding that, by foregoing consideration of H.R. 259 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that the       Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved on       this or similar legislation as it moves forward. The       Committee also reserves the right to see appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any conference with the       Senate involving this or similar legislation, and we request       your support for any such request.        Finally, as you mentioned in your letter, I ask that a copy       of our exchange of letters on this bill be included in your       committee's report to accompany the legislation, as well as       in the Congressional Record during floor consideration       thereof.            Sincerely,                                                   Patrick McHenry,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services.                                   ____           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of             Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, January 17, 2023.      Hon. Patrick McHenry,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McHenry: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       259, the ``Post-Disaster Assistance Online Accountability       Act.'' The bill was referred primarily to the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure, with additional referrals       to the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on       Small Business.        I ask that you allow the Committee on Financial Services to       be discharged from further consideration of the bill so that       it may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in       no way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of       the bill, and it will not serve as precedent for futural       referrals. In addition, should a conference on the bill be       necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee       on Financial Services represented on the conference       committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter       and any response in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration, to memorialize our understanding.        Thank you for your consideration of my request.            Sincerely,                                                        Sam Graves,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Mrs. Gonzalez-Colon).    Mr. Speaker, in closing, this commonsense  accountability measure is going to enable taxpayers to get a greater  sense of where their money is going and allow agencies to see where  they can coordinate post-disaster recovery efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 388) to amend title 40, United States Code, to  eliminate the leasing authority of the Securities and Exchange  Commission, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 388         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Securities and Exchange       Commission Real Estate Leasing Authority Revocation Act''.       SEC. 2. LEASING OF SPACE FOR SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE                     COMMISSION.         (a) In General.--Section 3304 of title 40, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(e) Leasing of Space for Securities and Exchange       Commission.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, on       and after the date of enactment of this subsection, the       Securities and Exchange Commission may not lease general       purpose office space. The Administrator may lease such space       for the Securities and Exchange Commission under section 585       and this chapter.''.        (b) Limitation on Statutory Construction.--The amendment       made by subsection (a) may not be construed to invalidate or       otherwise affect a lease entered into by the Securities and       Exchange Commission before the date of enactment of this Act.       SEC. 3. INDEPENDENT LEASING AUTHORITIES.         (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the United       States shall submit to the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure of the House of Representatives, the Committee       on Environment and Public Works of the Senate, and the       Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of       the Senate a report on the review described in subsection       (b).        (b) Review.--The Comptroller General shall complete a       review under which the Comptroller General shall update the       2016 report of the Comptroller General (GAO-16-648) with a       specific focus on the following:        (1) Updating the information included in Appendix II:       Federal Entities That Reported Having Independent Leasing       Authority for Domestic Offices and Warehouses of such report.        (2) Determining to what extent Federal entities with       independent leasing authorities have had such authorities       rescinded or amended and the number and amount of office and       warehouse space such entities lease.        (3) Determining to what extent have agencies with       independent leasing authority utilized the General Services       Administration for leasing, including utilization of       delegation of authority.        (4) Identifying progress made on implementing the       recommendations in such report.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  [[Page H298]]  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and insert extraneous material in the Record on H.R. 388.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   H.R. 388 revokes the Securities and Exchange Commission's, or the  SEC's, leasing authority for general office space and brings them in  line with current leasing practices through the General Services  Administration, or the GSA.   In 2012, the SEC violated Federal law by signing a lease for 1.4  million square feet that cost taxpayers $566 million. This resulted in  investigations by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and  the SEC's Inspector General.   The conclusions of these investigations indicated that not only did  the SEC exceed its authority with this lease, but also that the SEC had  a history of mismanaging its leasing authority.   Recent actions by the SEC during GSA's procurement of leased space  for the SEC seem to indicate that the agency may be turning back to its  old ways.   This bill ensures that the SEC, like other Federal agencies,  continues to use the GSA for its space needs and provides more  safeguards for the taxpayers' money.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time to close.   H.R. 388 ensures that the SEC is going to work with the GSA on  leasing to improve oversight, reduce costs, protect taxpayers against  wasteful spending, and minimize Anti-Deficiency Act violations in the  future.  [[Page H299]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 346) to establish a task force on improvements for  notices to air missions, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 346         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(2) NOTAM.--The term ``NOTAM'' means notices to air       missions required by international or domestic regulation or       law, as described in FAA Order 7930.2S.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material in the Record on H.R. 346, as  amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 346, as amended, the NOTAM  Improvement Act of 2023.   Just 2 weeks ago, Americans woke to the largest ground stop of  aircraft since 9/11 due to the outage of the Federal Aviation  Administration's, FAA's, notice to air mission, more commonly called  the NOTAM system.   As a professional pilot, I use the NOTAM system on a regular basis  and know firsthand just how important it is to ensure that it is  reliable and functional.   This incident highlights a huge vulnerability in our transportation  system. As much as I wish we could say that this incident surprised us,  this kind of issue was inevitable. Committee leaders have repeatedly  raised the alarm about our woefully out-of-date NOTAM system.   This same bill has been introduced and passed two Congresses in a  row, and multiple laws coming out of the Transportation Committee have  demanded that the Department of Transportation and the FAA step up and  address the well-known issues with the NOTAM system.   What occurred nearly 2 weeks ago is unacceptable, and the American  people deserve much better. Hopefully, this incident was the wake-up  call that the DOT and the FAA needed to shake off their ongoing failure  to properly maintain our Nation's air traffic control system.   H.R. 346, as amended, is going to help address this failure by  identifying issues with the NOTAM system and proposing solutions to  prevent an incident of this magnitude from ever occurring in the  future.   This bill creates a special task force to improve the utility,  stability, resiliency, and cybersecurity of the FAA's NOTAM system.  Composed of representatives from airlines, aviation safety experts, and  other important aviation stakeholders, the task force is going to  review existing NOTAM policies, regulations, and the system's overall  integrity to determine best practices to increase the system's  efficiency and decrease its susceptibility to outages, which cause  other disruptions.   Originally, this bill was focused on improving the NOTAM presentation  so that pilots and dispatchers could focus on critical information that  matters. In 2017, an Air Canada flight nearly landed on a crowded  taxiway in San Francisco because the NOTAM informing them of a runway  closure was buried on page 8 of 27.   Mr. Speaker, we urgently need a better system and a more stable  system. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber) and the  gentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier) for their leadership and  foresight on this particular piece of legislation.   H.R. 346 is a good, bipartisan, and timely aviation safety bill. It  shows that the people's House can rise to the urgent issues of the day.   Mr. Speaker, I support the legislation, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber), the sponsor of  the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am  prepared to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, H.R. 346, as  amended, takes a very important step in ensuring that America's  National Airspace System is going to remain intact, remain operational,  and remain safe for the American people.   Again, I thank Mr. Stauber and Mr. DeSaulnier for their work on this  legislation. It is a good bill, and I urge all Members to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
