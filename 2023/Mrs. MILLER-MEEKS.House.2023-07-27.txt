 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to acknowledge the many  stellar accomplishments the University of Iowa has achieved in  astrophysics. The University of Iowa has been a longstanding leader in  the field. They built instruments flown on 70 spacecraft in 60  successful missions.   Between 1958 and 1998, the University of Iowa developed more  spaceflight instruments than any other university. These instruments  were used in the first observations by spacecraft at seven of the eight  planets in our solar system. Iowa's technology produced the first  evidence of Earth's radiation belts.   Without the contributions of the University of Iowa to the field of  astrophysics, space research would not be the same.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the University of Iowa for their out-of-this- world work.                Honoring the Life and Career of Johnny Lujack     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life and career  of the indestructible Johnny Lujack who passed away at the age of 98.   In 1947, Johnny Lujack won the Heisman trophy capping off a college  football career as Notre Dame's quarterback where he won three national  championships.   He was unanimously named All-American twice. He was named the 1947 AP  Athlete of the Year. He also served our country as a Navy ensign in  World War II.   After college, he played for the Chicago Bears and he made two Pro  Bowls. In 1949, Johnny Lujack led the NFL in passing touchdowns and  passing yards.   After retiring from football, he and his wife moved to Patricia's  hometown of Davenport, Iowa, and ran the largest Chevy dealership in  the State of Iowa.   He spent the next 67 years in the Quad Cities and was a titan in our  community and even served on the Board of Trustees for St. Ambrose  University.   He moved to Naples, Florida, in 2021 to be closer to his grandson,  much to the dismay of many Iowans who missed him dearly. My prayers are  with his family as they mourn the loss of such a remarkable man as  Johnny Lujack.                            ____________________
