 Mr. Speaker, it has been 3 weeks since the U.S. withdrew  troops from Afghanistan. Today, I rise to pay tribute to the heroes who  paid the ultimate sacrifice in carrying out Operation Allies Refuge,  and I would like to especially recognize the members of Joint Base  Charleston Airlift Wing and their spouses who supported the overall  mission.   I begin with a moment of silence for the 13 soldiers who selflessly  gave their lives Hamid Karzai Airport on August 26.   I also am recognizing this morning the courageous effort of our  servicemembers stationed in Charleston as they evacuated U.S. citizens,  Special Immigrant Visa holders, and vulnerable populations from  Afghanistan.   With one of the largest C-17 fleets in the country, the Lowcountry of  South Carolina is proud of our soldiers at Joint Base Charleston that  were tapped to support our airlift efforts. Reservists in the 315th  Airlift Wing even helped deliver a baby on board one of their flights.   Back at home, Joint Base Charleston spouses put together pallets of  supplies, sending over 10,000 pounds of food, baby wipes, drinks, and  clothing overseas.   The Taliban now have control over Afghanistan. It has led many to  question what we have accomplished there over the last 20 years.   But there is no question of the unbelievable effort put forth by our  airmen and airwomen, our veterans who served in Afghanistan, and those  that loved and supported them and their families during the war.   Today, I think about the 124,000 people who now have freedom and the  thousands of Americans and allies who have been safely returned home,  and I am proud of the difference the Lowcountry has made in those  efforts. God bless our troops, God bless the Lowcountry, and God bless  America.                                Parris Island     Mr. Speaker, as the House continues to consider the 2022  National Defense Authorization Act, I wanted to take this opportunity  to highlight the Parris Island Protection Act. This critical bill will  preserve Parris Island Marine Corps Recruiting Depot for decades to  come. Parris Island is responsible for training over a million brave  marines, including every enlisted female marine that has ever served in  our Marine Corps.   Not only is Parris Island critical to our national defense, but it is  also an integral part of the Lowcountry community. It is responsible  for the creation of over 6,000 jobs and generates almost $800 million  in economic activity every year.    Sadly, this Congress' version of NDAA is one of the first  authorizations not to include any protections against base realignment  and closures. I was disappointed to see that absent these usual  protections, my amendment to protect Parris Island was not made in  order this week as we went through amendments for the NDAA.   I look forward to working with the House Committee on Armed Services  to ensure Parris Island remains open, functional, and continues to  contribute to the best and brightest in our national defense.                              Clean Energy Week     Mr. Speaker, as National Clean Energy Week comes to a  close, I rise today to bring attention to a spectacular environmental  protection effort in my district and the efforts of the 32nd annual  South Carolina beach and river sweep, which brought volunteers down to  clean up Old Town Bluffton and the May River.   This was the single largest statewide volunteer cleanup of beaches,  marshes, and waterways. We know how to take care of our environment in  South Carolina's First Congressional District. In fact, across the  State we have thousands of volunteers participating every single year.  South Carolina's residents  [[Page H5101]]  along the coast are passionate about keeping our sparkling waters  pristine and our beaches pure.   This year we had an untold number of kids that participated and  showed up for the community cleanup. This impact was immeasurable.  Seeing our youngsters, our students, and our children participate in  environmental cleanups, we are setting ourselves up for success in the  Lowcountry and our future by educating our kids who have a passion and  love for the Lowcountry, who love our ecosystems, and want to keep them  clean. We love seeing our students serving in their community.                            ____________________
