 Mr. Speaker, each day law enforcement officers all across  our Nation risk their lives to keep our communities safe. Today at the  37th Annual Peace Officers' Memorial, we remembered the 21,541 fallen  officers lost in the history of our Nation.   It was an honor to sit in solidarity with the families of Officer Gil  Vega and Lesley Zerebny, two fallen heroes from my district.   I am proud to welcome Officer Vega's wife, Susana; daughters, Andrea  and Vanessa; son, Isaac; and grandchildren, Marshal, Raul, and Sophia;  and son-in-law, Raul, who are in the House gallery with us today.   It is our solemn duty to honor and respect the sacrifice of our law  enforcement and their families, and I am humbled to author H.R. 5006,  the Heroes Lesley Zerebny and Gil Vega First Responders Survivors  Support Act. This legislation will help ensure that no officer has to  worry whether or not their family will be all right if something  happens to them in the line of duty.   It is an honor to serve in this great House, and we must do what is  right for those who serve us and risk their lives in the streets.
