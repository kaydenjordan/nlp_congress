 Madam Chair, let's lay out the fundamental  rights of parents. That is what we are discussing here today.   Number one, every parent should be given a choice and a voice on how  their child receives an education.   Number two, school curriculum should not be used to politically  indoctrinate our children.   Number three, parents deserve options. They deserve a choice on how  their child receives an education.   In my family, my wife and I made a personal decision to homeschool  our children. Every parent should be free to make that choice, not just  the wealthy ones.   What is the parents bill of rights? What are the pillars of this  bill?   Parents deserve the right to know what is being taught in schools and  to see the reading material. It is very simple.   Parents deserve to be heard.   Parents deserve the right to see where the taxpayer dollars are  going, how they are spent, and how they are being used. It is a  fundamental principle of good governance.   Parents have the right to protect their children, to protect their  children's privacy.   Parents absolutely should be updated and informed in the instances of  violence that seem to be increasing in our schools, many of which go  unreported.   I am very honored to be a member of the House Committee on Education  and the Workforce and to support this bill, to support parents, and to  support parents' rights, particularly that our children get the best  possible education. This is a significant step forward.                                time  1615
