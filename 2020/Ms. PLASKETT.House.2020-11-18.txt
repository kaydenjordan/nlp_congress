 Mr. Speaker, as a Member of Congress representing the  Virgin Islands, I came to Congress determined to increase long-term  Federal investment in infrastructure, among other things.   I congratulate the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee  chairman, Mr. DeFazio; Highways and Transit Subcommittee chair, Ms.  Norton; and other committees for H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act.   In the midst of so much uncertainty in the economy during the current  public health crisis, the American people need the certainty of H.R. 2  to count on stable and strong investment in infrastructure to sustain  and create jobs, and enhance the mobility and safety of American  motorists, passengers, and throughput systems.   The Moving Forward Act makes a real investment in America, especially  in underserved districts like my own. While all of the States have  received small and steady increases in funding over the recent decade,  severe cuts have disproportionately and negatively affected Americans  in U.S. territories.   In the meantime, substandard highways, roads, and stormwater  infrastructure have further affected harsh weather patterns. In my  district, we still feel the aftermath of major category 5 hurricanes  every day. It has been our new normal for some time before the current  COVID normal.   We know firsthand that there are areas throughout this country that  are  [[Page H5877]]  in desperate need of revitalizing infrastructure. The American people  and businesses are rightly concerned with the infrastructure.   In the 117th Congress, we must show our constituents that the next  Congress is determined to build America back better.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague representing  the great people of New York, but also who hails from the Caribbean and  understands the importance of legislation like this.   As the representative of a Caribbean island, an English-speaking  Caribbean island, I am grateful to be yielded the opportunity to talk  about this important Caribbean Basin Security Initiative.   Traffickers frequently transport cocaine and other contraband from  South America through the Caribbean Sea. Building the law enforcement  and interdiction capabilities of our Caribbean partners helps them stop  illicit flows, making our Caribbean nations safer.   By developing these capabilities, partner countries also can hold  perpetrators accountable and deter further criminal activity that might  harm their citizens, threaten their economies, and endanger U.S.  citizens at home and as tourists in the Caribbean.   The United States has committed over $556 million for CBSI for fiscal  years 2010 to 2018. Congress has appropriated $58 million for fiscal  year 2020.   Bravo.   To enhance maritime domain awareness and interdiction, we have  improved radar coverage and sharing capacity, enhanced port security,  and provided boats, equipment, and training to partner nations.    In the Dominican Republic, the largest Caribbean transit point for  cocaine,  [[Page H5902]]  CBSI programs have yielded a 250 percent increase in cocaine  interdictions. USAID programming targets the drivers of youth crime and  violence to reduce the risk of youth involvement in transnational  organized crime.   USAID uses risk assessment tools to identify at-risk youth in  countries like St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Guyana. USAID then  partners with those host countries, delivering support to families and  youth. Across those three countries, 75 percent of the youth targeted  have reduced risk levels.   To augment law enforcement, CBSI supports efforts to professionalize  and reform law enforcement institutions and enables partner governments  to better prevent, investigate, and prosecute crime. These are  tremendous tools.   Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are transshipment points for  illicit drugs that have been smuggled from source countries into the  U.S. mainland, as well as destination points for drugs distributed  within the two territories. This bill is very essential to us.   Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are situated between the U.S.  mainland and drug-source countries such as Colombia and Peru, making  them ideal gateways for movement of illicit drugs onward to the U.S.  mainland.   The Caribbean sits as a transshipment area for so many goods: first,  people, sugar, and, in many instances, drug trafficking now.   Drug trafficking organizations and criminal groups use commercial and  private maritime vessels, commercial private aircraft, and package  delivery services to smuggle illicit drugs into and through Puerto Rico  and the U.S. Virgin Islands.   Large drug shipments are often offloaded in Puerto Rico and the U.S.  Virgin Islands, repackaged, and stored in secluded areas until they are  distributed locally or transported to the U.S. mainland.   What is the outcome of this? Wreaking havoc in our communities.   There were 52 murders this year on the Virgin Islands, 49.2 per  100,000 people; in 2018, a whopping 52 individuals in a community of  100,000 people. Many of those deaths--most of those deaths--related to  drug trafficking, drugs that we do not even use on the islands.   This bill is vital to combating drug trafficking, promoting good  governance, independent justice sectors, and empowering civil society  in the Caribbean.   Too often, the Caribbean is ignored. We must correct this by  deepening our partnerships and cooperation with some of our closest  allies. Working together, we can help increase citizen security, build  resilience to natural disasters caused by climate change, and improve  strategies to reduce illegal narcotics trafficking.    Mr. Speaker, I won't need all of that minute, but I  want to thank the gentleman for the time.   This bill is so vital, not only to stopping drug trafficking, but  supporting our communities, helping youth within the Caribbean to reach  their potential.   I want to thank the authors of this bill. I am grateful this is a  bipartisan effort to not forget the Caribbean. I thank my colleague,  Mr. Espaillat, and the members of the committee.
