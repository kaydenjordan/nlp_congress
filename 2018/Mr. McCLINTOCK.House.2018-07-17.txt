 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4645) to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate  certain segments of East Rosebud Creek in Carbon County, Montana, as  components of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4645         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``East Rosebud Wild and Scenic       Rivers Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--        (1) East Rosebud Creek is cherished by the people of       Montana and visitors from across the United States for its       clean water, spectacular natural setting, and outstanding       recreational opportunities;        (2) recreational activities, including fishing, hunting,       camping, paddling, hiking, rock climbing, and wildlife       watching, on East Rosebud Creek and the surrounding land       generate millions of dollars annually for the local economy;        (3) East Rosebud Creek--        (A) is a national treasure;        (B) possesses outstandingly remarkable values; and        (C) merits the high level of protection afforded by the       Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1271 et seq.) in order       to maintain the benefits provided by the Creek, as described       in paragraphs (1) and (2), for future generations to enjoy;       and        (4) designation of select public land segments of East       Rosebud Creek under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C.       1271 et seq.) would recognize the importance of maintaining       the values of the Creek while preserving public access,       respecting private property rights, allowing appropriate       maintenance of existing infrastructure, and allowing       historical uses of the Creek to continue.        (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to designate East       Rosebud Creek in the State of Montana as a component of the       National Wild and Scenic Rivers System to preserve and       protect for present and future generations the outstandingly       remarkable scenic, recreational, and geologic values of the       Creek.       SEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF WILD AND SCENIC RIVER SEGMENTS.         (a) Designation.--Section 3(a) of the Wild and Scenic       Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1274(a)) is amended by adding at the       end the following:        ``(213) East rosebud creek, montana.--The portions of East       Rosebud Creek in the State of Montana, consisting of--        ``(A) the 13-mile segment exclusively on public land within       the Custer National Forest from the source in the Absaroka-      Beartooth Wilderness downstream to the point at which the       Creek enters East Rosebud Lake, including the stream reach       between Twin Outlets Lake and Fossil Lake, to be administered       by the Secretary of Agriculture as a wild river; and        ``(B) the 7-mile segment exclusively on public land within       the Custer National Forest from immediately below, but not       including, the outlet of East Rosebud Lake downstream to the       point at which the Creek enters private property for the       first time, to be administered by the Secretary of       Agriculture as a recreational river.''.        (b) Adjacent Management.--        (1) In general.--Nothing in paragraph (213) of section 3(a)       of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1274(a)) (as       added by subsection (a)) creates a protective perimeter or       buffer zone outside the designated boundary of the river       segment designated by that paragraph.        (2) Outside activities.--The fact that an otherwise       authorized activity or use can be seen or heard within the       boundary of the river segment designated by paragraph (213)       of section 3(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C.       1274(a)) (as added by subsection (a)) shall not preclude the       activity or use outside the boundary of the river segment.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, East Rosebud Creek is located in Carbon County, Montana,  just north of Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness in the Custer National  Forest.   The bill before us designates a 13-mile segment of East Rosebud  Creek, beginning at its source, the East Rosebud Lake, as a wild and  scenic river. A second 7-mile segment from the outlet of East Rosebud  Lake to the point where the waterway enters private property would be  designated as a recreational river.   This legislation specifically applies only to the segments of the  creek that lie within public lands. Important historical uses outside  of the wild and scenic boundary are protected by this bill.   Finally, H.R. 4645 explicitly prevents the creation of a buffer zone  to restrict land use outside of the designated area.   This legislation is the result of a compromise supported by a diverse  coalition that includes local ranchers, sportsmen, conservationists,  and business owners. Companion legislation has been introduced with the  support of both Montana Senators.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  [[Page H6338]]  the author of this measure, the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Gianforte).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1037) to authorize the National Emergency Medical Services  Memorial Foundation to establish a commemorative work in the District  of Columbia and its environs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1037         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. AUTHORIZATION TO ESTABLISH COMMEMORATIVE WORK.         (a) In General.--The National Emergency Medical Services       Memorial Foundation may establish a commemorative work on       Federal land in the District of Columbia and its environs to       commemorate the commitment and service represented by       emergency medical services.        (b) Compliance With Standards for Commemorative Works.--The       establishment of the commemorative work under this section       shall be in accordance with chapter 89 of title 40, United       States Code (commonly known as the ``Commemorative Works       Act'').        (c) Prohibition on the Use of Federal Funds.--        (1) In general.--Federal funds may not be used to pay any       expense of the establishment of the commemorative work under       this section.        (2) Responsibility of national emergency medical services       memorial foundation.--The National Emergency Medical Services       Memorial Foundation shall be solely responsible for       acceptance of contributions for, and payment of the expenses       of, the establishment of the commemorative work under this       section.        (d) Deposit of Excess Funds.--        (1) In general.--If upon payment of all expenses for the       establishment of the memorial (including the maintenance and       preservation amount required by section 8906(b)(1) of title       40, United States Code), there remains a balance of funds       received for the establishment of the commemorative work, the       Foundation shall transmit the amount of the balance to the       Secretary of the Interior for deposit in the account provided       for in section 8906(b)(3) of title 40, United States Code.        (2) On expiration of authority.--If upon expiration of the       authority for the commemorative work under section 8903(e) of       title 40, United States Code, there remains a balance of       funds received for the establishment of the commemorative       work, the Foundation shall transmit the amount of the balance       to a separate account with the National Park Foundation for       memorials, to be available to the Secretary of the Interior       or Administrator (as appropriate) following the process       provided in section 8906(b)(4) of title 40, United States       Code, for accounts established under 8906(b)(2) or (3) of       title 40, United States Code.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, each year 850,000 EMS providers answer more than 30  million calls to serve 22 million patients in need at a moment's notice  and without reservation. For these heroes who serve on the front lines  of medicine, sacrifice is a part of their calling. EMTs and paramedics  have a rate of injury that is about three times the national average  for all occupations, and some pay the ultimate price in the service of  helping others.   The men and women of the emergency medical services profession face  danger every day to save lives and help their neighbors in crisis. They  respond to incidents ranging from a single person's medical emergency  to natural and manmade disasters, including terrorist attacks. But  while their first responder peers in law enforcement and firefighting  have been honored with national memorials, EMS providers have not. H.R.  1037 aims to change that.   The National Emergency Medical Services Memorial Foundation exists to  honor, recognize, and remember the commitment, service, and sacrifice  of our Nation's EMS heroes. H.R. 1037 would authorize this foundation  to place a commemorative work on Federal land in the District of  Columbia to commemorate the commitment and service represented by the  EMS community. The foundation will be solely responsible for funding  the project, and no Federal funds will be required.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts  for bringing this bill to us. I urge its adoption, and I yield back the  balance of time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3777) to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to convey  certain National Forest System land containing the Nephi Work Center in  Juab County, Utah, to Juab County, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3777         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Juab County Conveyance Act       of 2018''.       SEC. 2. LAND CONVEYANCE, NEPHI WORK CENTER, JUAB COUNTY,                     UTAH.         (a) Conveyance Required.--Subject to valid existing rights,       if the County submits a written request to the Secretary not       later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act,       the Secretary shall convey, without consideration and by       quitclaim deed, to the County all right, title, and interest       of the United States in and to the parcel of National Forest       System land, including improvements thereon, described in       subsection (b).        (b) Description of Land.--        (1) In general.--The parcel of National Forest System land       and improvements to be conveyed under subsection (a) is the       Nephi Work Center at 740 South Main Street, Nephi, Utah,       which consists of approximately 2.17 acres within Nephi Plat       B Block of the Nephi Townsite Survey as Parcels #XA00-0545-      1111 and #XA00-0545-2, and is identified on the map entitled       ``Nephi Plat B'' and dated May 6, 1981.        (2) Map and legal description.--        (A) In general.--As soon as practical after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the       Committee on Natural Resources of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition,       and Forestry of the Senate a map and legal description of the       parcel described in paragraph (1).        (B) Minor modifications.--The map and legal description       submitted under this paragraph shall have the same force and       effect as if included in this Act, except that the Secretary       may make minor modifications of any clerical or typographical       errors in the map or the legal description.        (C) Copy on file.--A copy of the map and the legal       description shall be on file and available for public       inspection in the appropriate field offices of the U.S.       Forest Service.        (c) Survey.--The exact acreage and legal description of the       National Forest System land to be conveyed under subsection       (a) shall be determined by a survey satisfactory to the       Secretary.        (d) Costs of Conveyance.--As a condition for the conveyance       under subsection (a), the County shall pay the reasonable       costs incurred by the Secretary for--        (1) the survey required by subsection (c); and        (2) any environmental or administrative analysis required       by law related to the conveyance.        (e) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The conveyance under       subsection (a) is subject to any other terms and conditions       as the Secretary considers appropriate to protect the       interests of the United States.        (f) Time for Completion of Conveyance.--The Secretary shall       complete the conveyance under subsection (a) not later than       one year after the date on which the County submits the       written request described in subsection (a).        (g) Definitions.--In this Act:        (1) County.--The term ``County'' means Juab County, Utah.        (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary       of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the U.S. Forest       Service.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3777, introduced by Congresswoman Mia Love, would  authorize the transfer of approximately 2.6 acres of U.S. Forest  Service land and improvements in the city of Nephi to Juab County,  Utah. The bill would require the county to pay all conveyance costs,  including the cost of environmental analysis and surveying.   This land has been designated by the U.S. Forest Service for  administrative disposal since 2013. Under an agreement with the Forest  Service, the county fire department houses its mitigation program on  this site.   On August 15, 2017, the county requested the Secretary of Agriculture  to transfer this property to the county, which intends to use the land  to house its wildlands fire team and equipment, with plans to construct  a new fire station on the property.   As fires continue to rage across the West, Congress should take every  opportunity to give local communities the resources and support they  need to combat these catastrophic events.   While this transfer represents just two ten-thousandths of 1 percent  of the 1.5 million acres of Federal land in Juab County, the new fire  station it will facilitate could mean the difference between  suppression and conflagration when wildfire threatens Juab County.   The legislation would also improve fire response services to  surrounding communities and the Federal lands, since Juab County plans  to use this land to house its wildlands fire team equipment.   There is strong local support from the county and its elected  officials for this conveyance. By ensuring that the surrounding  communities and public lands have the emergency response resources they  need to respond to catastrophic wildfire, H.R. 3777 furthers the  important local-Federal partnership  [[Page H6340]]  that is critical to restoring the Federal Government as a good neighbor  to the communities it impacts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Utah (Mrs. Love).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4032) to confirm undocumented Federal rights-of-way or  easements on the Gila River Indian Reservation, clarify the northern  boundary of the Gila River Indian Community's Reservation, to take  certain land located in Maricopa County and Pinal County, Arizona, into  trust for the benefit of the Gila River Indian Community, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4032         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Gila River Indian Community       Federal Rights-of-Way, Easements and Boundary Clarification       Act''.       SEC. 2. PURPOSES.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 4032, the Gila River Indian  Community Federal-Rights-of-Way, Easements and Boundary Clarification  Act, introduced by Congressman O'Halleran of Arizona.   The Gila River Indian Reservation was established in 1859 and later  expanded by a series of executive orders  [[Page H6342]]  in Maricopa and Pinal Counties, Arizona. In 2006, the Tribe sued the  Federal Government, alleging a breach of the United States' fiduciary  duty for its failure to accurately survey the reservation's  northwesterly boundary, resulting in the patenting of land along the  Salt River to non-Indians.   The Tribe also asserted a failed duty to document rights-of-way  across the reservation, collect rent, and account for the Tribe's and  allottees' trust assets. Rather than litigate the case, the Obama  administration settled with the Tribe in 2016.   The settlement provided that the United States would survey all the  Federal rights-of-way on the reservation. It would also take  approximately 3,400 acres of Bureau of Land Management land into trust  for the Tribe, after the Tribe purchases the land for fair market  value.   Finally, the settlement provided monetary damages of about $12.5  million from the judgment fund, an issue not addressed by this bill.   This legislation is needed to facilitate portions of the settlement  by clarifying the northwestern boundary of the reservation, documenting  the existing Federal rights-of-way on the reservation, and placing the  3,400 acres into trust after the Tribe buys the land from the Federal  Government.   The bill is cosponsored by the entire Arizona delegation, and I  commend their work to resolve this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
