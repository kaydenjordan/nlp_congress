 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the career and  service of Carl Adrian, who is retiring this month after more than 16  years as the president of the Tri-Cities Economic Development Council  in my home State of Washington.   Carl has devoted his career to making the Tri-Cities an economic  powerhouse, and throughout his time as the longest serving president of  TRIDEC, Carl Adrian accomplished so many important things for the  region. Thanks in part to his work, the Tri-Cities of today is very  different from the Tri-Cities of 16 years ago.   Under Carl's leadership, more than 1,300 businesses set up shop in  the Tri-Cities and more than 35,000 new jobs were created. These  business leaders weren't drawn to the Tri-Cities just because of the  weather or the excellent Washington wine; they came because Carl helped  create new opportunities and supported significant investments for  employers in the region.   I have been so pleased to partner with Carl and TRIDEC on so many  endeavors over the years. When it comes to Hanford, Carl saw the site  as history that should be celebrated and remembered. We worked together  to establish the Manhattan Project Historical Park in Richland, which  honors the more than 51,000 Hanford workers who helped drive our  country's nuclear program and remembers those whose lands were taken  when the facilities were built. The site is helping to educate new  generations and bringing new visitors to the Tri-Cities. More than  10,000 people visit every year from all 50 States and more than 80  countries.   Carl also knows how important it is that we get Hanford cleaned up.  He has been a stalwart advocate for the funding we need to clean up the  site. And I share his strong belief that the Federal Government has a  moral obligation to the Tri-Cities and our State to make sure the  Hanford cleanup and its workers receive Federal funding they need.   Throughout his time at TRIDEC, Carl has worked on so many other  projects of importance to the Tri-Cities. He has been one of the  Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's strongest supporters, working  tirelessly to make sure Congress and the Department of Energy recognize  the importance of the lab to our region and country. As a result of his  advocacy, the lab has experienced significant growth, particularly in  energy innovation including grid security, battery storage and clean  energy technologies.   I was also proud to work with Carl and TRIDEC to expand the Tri-City  Regional Airport. His leadership enabled the airport to bring non-stop  daily flights from San Francisco, Minneapolis, and Chicago to the  region, along with many other destinations. These flights have helped  grow the attractiveness of southeastern Washington and allowed many  more people to see what the Tri-Cities have to offer.   For more than 16 years, Carl Adrian's leadership of the Tri-Cities  Economic Development Council has made an impact throughout Southeastern  Washington and our entire State. We are all grateful for his hard work  and many contributions.   Congratulations on your retirement, Carl. I wish you and Rheta great  success as you transition to the next chapter of your life.                            ____________________
