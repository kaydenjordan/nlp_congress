 Madam Chairman, I call up amendment No. 6 to H.R. 1585.    Madam Chairman, the Violence Against Women Act  reauthorizes the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program through 2024.  This amendment simply requires State and local governments that are  recipients of the grant program to include information in their reports  to the Attorney General on best practices for reducing the backlog of  DNA evidence.   This grant program was originally authorized under the Justice for  All Act of 2004 to provide grants to State and local governments for  the collection and analysis of forensic samples and to ensure the  timely processing of DNA evidence by law enforcement. Congress  reauthorized the program several times, most recently providing $151  million for fiscal year 2019.   Despite these efforts, the backlog of untested DNA evidence is still  high. According to reporting from The Texas Tribune, a paper back in  the State of Texas, it costs between $500 and $2,000 to test a kit, and  there are approximately 3,500 untested kits in Texas  [[Page H3033]]  alone. We must continue working to reduce this backlog so that we can  bring justice to the victims of assault.   State and local grant recipients are required to submit a report to  the Attorney General which is then summarized for Congress. My  amendment adds best practices for reducing the backlog to the report  required by grant recipients in order to better understand the needs of  entities directly involved in collecting and processing DNA evidence.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his support,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
