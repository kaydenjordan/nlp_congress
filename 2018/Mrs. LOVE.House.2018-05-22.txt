 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise awareness about  postpartum depression. I rise today to raise awareness about maternal  deaths. I rise today to let the country know about one of my  constituents, Emily Dykes.   Emily was a good person. She was active in her community and beloved  by all who knew her. But most of all, she was an amazing mother.  However, with her fifth child, she developed some difficulties, and  Emily was overtaken by severe anxiety. It was so severe, in fact, that  it led to her mistreatment, misdiagnosis, and misunderstanding of her  condition. Eventually, it led to her suffering so badly that, in her  search for safety, she ran onto a freeway and was killed by a semi  truck.   The horrible fact is that Emily is not the only woman who suffers  from this. Right now, there are thousands of women who suffer just like  Emily suffered.   As a mother, I want those women to know that they are not alone.  There are many who have gone through very similar experiences, and  there are places that mothers can go and get help. I encourage them to  reach out. I encourage families to help out.   This is not something that will go away unless we work to find a  solution, that is, unless we as a society recognize it and take away  the stigmas related to postpartum depression and help provide support  to those who come forward for help.   As we raise this awareness, we can find solutions that will make sure  that the tragedies that befell Emily and her family won't happen again.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my community, State, colleagues, friends, and  Members of Congress to come to the table to help save lives so that  children like Emily's five children are not left without a mother.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, we have an economy that is humming right now.  Utah's unemployment rate is better than the national average, and it is  the best it has been in 10 years. We are adding jobs--1,400 just last  month.   I am urging a ``yes'' vote on this bill because I want to keep the  good news coming. America needs a financial system that is strong,  resilient, and innovative.   As a former mayor, I know that access to credit is crucial for cities  to build schools and roads, for families to buy a home, and for farmers  to buy tractors. After the 2008 financial crisis, Congress passed laws  to rein in large financial institutions, but the rules went  [[Page H4348]]  too far, and they are hurting the smaller banks, who can't handle all  the red tape. S. 2155 would ease that burden without risk to the rest  of the financial system.   My bill, H.R. 4771, is included in this package to help those small  banks gain the access to capital they need to serve their community.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote for the good of people and for the  health of our economy.
