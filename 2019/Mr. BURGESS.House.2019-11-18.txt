 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I am happy to come to the floor tonight to reflect on a great Texan,  a great American, Secretary Rick Perry.   It has been an honor to have served the people of Texas alongside  Secretary Perry. In fact, my first political race in 2002 was alongside  then-Governor Perry, who had succeeded Governor Bush when Governor Bush  won the Presidential election and Governor Perry was running for his  first full term as Governor. Then, as we know, he went on to serve a  full 14 years as Governor of the State of Texas.   He began serving our country as a C-130 pilot in the United States  Air Force. More recently, he has been leading the United States  Department of Energy. With each task, Secretary Perry has shown true  leadership and fought to uphold the Constitution.   Most recently, as Secretary of the Department of Energy, Secretary  Perry was dedicated to putting forward innovative ideas while reducing  Federal overreach and the regulatory burden on Americans.   Back in 2007, in the Subcommittee on Energy and the full Committee on  Energy and Commerce, I worked to prevent a mandate on light bulbs that  I thought was ill-advised. I thought it would be better to let the  consumer make these determinations rather than the government. I  continued this fight during the appropriations process to delay  rulemaking at the Department of Energy.   Then, after assuming office, Secretary Perry took steps to protect  consumer choices and rolled back the mandates on light bulbs. I  appreciate Secretary Perry's efforts in this area to reduce Federal  overreach.   Mr. Speaker, I certainly want to wish the departing Secretary and his  wife, Anita, the very best, the very best for their family as they  embark on this new journey.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Secretary Perry for many years of dedicated  service to our State and our country. As the song says, ``God bless  you, Texas.''
