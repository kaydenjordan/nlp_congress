 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the eyes of history are upon us today. Each  of us will be faced with a momentous question: Can we put petty  differences aside, and can we come together to defend our friend and  our ally Ukraine against imminent Russian aggression?   This isn't theoretical. Russian tanks and troops are, right now,  massed on the Ukrainian border, and they are preparing for invasion.  The Senate, in just a few hours, will vote on a bill that represents  the best way to deter Putin from invading Ukraine by sanctioning the  company that is racing to finish and make operational the Nord Stream 2  Pipeline, which Putin desperately wants completed so that he can use it  as a cudgel against our European allies. If we don't come together  today, Ukraine risks getting wiped off the map altogether.   Putin didn't just wake up one day and decide he wanted to invade  Ukraine. He has wanted to invade Ukraine for years. He did so already  in 2014, but he stopped short of a full invasion because he couldn't  endanger Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which he needs to get  Russia's natural gas to Europe. That stopped Putin from marching all  the way to Kiev. The next year, in 2015, Putin began the Nord Stream 2  project--to build a pipeline to go around Ukraine so that he could get  his gas to Europe and invade Ukraine with no risk to the billions he  relies on every year.   Nord Stream 2, as we know and as we have heard from Republicans and  from Democrats--literally hundreds of times over the past years on this  floor, in committees, in briefings--Nord Stream 2 was designed to  circumvent Ukraine. It is why the Senate has worked together for years,  in a bipartisan manner, to stop Nord Stream 2 from coming online.    In 2017, Congress came together and passed the Countering America's  Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA, which sanctioned  investments in Russian energy export pipelines.   In 2019, Congress passed Protecting Europe's Energy Security Act, or  PEESA, which sanctions Nord Stream 2 directly. I authored that bill,  along with Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen.   And, in 2021, Congress expanded those sanctions in the Protecting  Europe's Energy Security Clarification Act. Again, I authored that  bill, along with Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen.   For the next several hours, this body will revisit and debate this  issue once again. We will revisit our successes from 2019 to 2021 in  using targeted sanctions to end construction of the pipeline.   When President Trump signed our bipartisan sanctions into law, Putin  stopped construction of the pipeline literally 15 minutes before the  law became effective. Sanctions worked. They succeeded. Together, we  won a bipartisan foreign policy and national security victory.   But we will also revisit in this debate the catastrophic decision  President Biden made in May of this year to waive those sanctions. The  sanctions that had worked, the sanctions that were successful,  President Biden waived them nonetheless.   When this debate is over, each of us will have to decide whether he  or she will vote to finally and definitively put an end to this  pipeline through mandatory sanctions.   Our Ukrainian allies are crying out for us to do so. Ukraine's  President and Prime Minister and Speaker of the Parliament have all  explicitly and passionately done so in recent days. Ukraine's Prime  Minister said last week that Nord Stream 2 is ``no less an existential  threat to [Ukraine's] security & democracy than Russian troops on our  border.'' That is the Prime Minister of Ukraine begging this body, the  U.S. Senate, to help him.   Just this week, a public letter from leaders in Ukrainian civil  society said--and I want to quote this at length. They said:         Since late October 2021, Russia has amassed more than       120,000 troops close to the Ukrainian border along with the       logistical support for a major new offensive. This menacing       build-up had been accompanied by increasing belligerent       rhetoric from senior Russian officials. We believe the green       light given to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline in May 2021 served       as one of the key triggers for the current crisis and must be       urgently revised.    In ordinary times, that open letter from Ukrainian civil society  would resonate with both Democrats and Republicans. This is a plea for  help.   Opponents of our legislation are clutching at pretexts to avoid doing  what we have done many times before, and I want to address those  pretexts one at a time.   One argument we have heard again and again is that imposing sanctions  on Nord Stream 2 AG, the Gazprom-owned cutout that runs Nord Stream 2,  would shatter European unity. That is an argument that is being  repeated by the White House repeatedly--that this is all about  transatlantic unity; we should give Putin its pipeline because of  transatlantic unity.   I urge every Senator to ask a simple question: What unity and with  whom?   In January, the European Parliament voted to condemn and stop the  Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. The vote was 581 to 50--581 to 50. If you care  about transatlantic unity, let me suggest that we side with the 581 and  not the 50. The Biden White House's argument is literally: Go with the  50 in the name of transatlantic unity.   I don't know how you stand up and make that argument with a straight  face--581 to 50.   In August of 2021, the chairs of the Foreign Affairs Committees in  nine countries opposed explicitly the Nord Stream 2 U.S.-German  agreement--the Biden agreement--to allow the completion of Nord Stream  2. Among those countries that explicitly opposed that agreement:  Estonia, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,  Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. Are those countries Europe? Do we care  about transatlantic unity with those countries that are begging us to  find the courage to stand up to Vladimir Putin?   When President Biden made his deal to allow the pipeline to go  through anyway, the Foreign Ministers of Ukraine and Poland issued a  remarkable joint statement declaring that the decision President Biden  made to surrender to Putin, that it created an immediate ``security  crisis'' for Europe. They told us then--Ukraine and Poland both told us  then--that, as a result of waiving sanctions, we are going to see  Russian troops. They were right. It is almost as if they understand  their neighbor. It is almost as if they understand Putin's desire to  reassemble the Soviet Union. It is almost as if they believe Vladimir  Putin when he said that he believed the greatest geopolitical disaster  of the 20th century was the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and he  wants to bring it back together by force, which I would note would be a  grave national security threat to the United States.    Now, some will say, when they say European unity, they really mean  unity with Germany. Indeed, I have heard Members on this floor say:  Listen, I am just not prepared to sanction Germany.   This bill doesn't sanction Germany. It doesn't sanction the German  Government. It doesn't sanction the German company. It sanctions Nord  Stream 2 AG, which is wholly owned and controlled by Gazprom. This is  sanctioning a Russian cutout because this pipeline is a tool for  Putin's aggression in Europe.   And even when it comes to unity in Germany, what they really mean is  unity with Angela Merkel, and I will concede that. Angela Merkel wants  this pipeline. I don't fully understand why, but she does. But Angela  Merkel is no longer the Chancellor of Germany. Indeed, the German  people went  [[Page S204]]  to the polls, and they voted her party out of office. So one would  think from the United States, to the extent we are concerned about  standing with an ally, we should be concerned about the current  Government of Germany, not the former government, and we should respect  the views of the German people.   Now, the current Government of Germany is hopelessly fractured on  Nord Stream 2. The Greens, who are part of this coalition government,  passionately oppose Nord Stream 2. Vocally, repeatedly they have  condemned Nord Stream 2, and they are an integral part of this German  Government. But just a few hours ago, the German Defense Minister, on  the other side, said Nord Stream 2 is off the table. They are not  willing to do anything to stop Nord Stream 2. And the German Chancellor  has said the same, declaring that he seeks a positive reset with Putin.  This is the same Putin who has tanks on the border of Ukraine, and he  is preparing to invade.   Another argument that we will hear is that sanctions should be kept  in our pockets. We should reserve them for use later in the case of a  Russian invasion. I would note, this is not what our Ukrainian allies  advocate, and I have trouble believing anyone in this Chamber actually  takes this argument seriously, nor should they. Putin doesn't.   Putin believes that once he brings Nord Stream 2 online, and once he  has changed the region through invasion, that no one will have the will  to impose sanctions. And I would note, he is not crazy to believe that.   When the Biden administration first capitulated to Russia on Nord  Stream 2, the Biden administration and the German Government made a  promise. They said if--if, if--Russia uses energy for energy blackmail,  then we will stop the pipeline. They beat their chest with that  promise. They were quite bold about it. I have had some Members of the  Senate say: Well, we have got really strong promises from Germany now.   Well, what has happened since then? Russia has nakedly and  unequivocally used energy for energy blackmail. Energy prices have  skyrocketed in Europe, and Putin is openly boasting, he is laughing and  saying: Well, turn Nord Stream 2 on and your energy prices will go  down.   He is not hiding it. He is not pretending. He did exactly what the  Biden White House and the German Government said: If you do x, we will  stop it.   He did it openly, brazenly, laughingly, and absolutely nothing  happened--zero, crickets.   Mr. President, I ask you, as a reasonable man, if the German  Government and the Biden White House were unwilling to impose sanctions  when Putin immediately triggered what they said was their redline, in  what universe would the Biden White House or the German Government have  greater resolve once millions of Germans are dependent on Russian  natural gas from Nord Stream 2 to heat their homes when it is literally  stopping the Germans from freezing to death? Because that, if the  Ukrainian pipeline is shut down, becomes the only viable source of  heat. Do we really think they are going to have greater courage then  than they have had so far? Nobody does. Putin doesn't.   It is important to understand that the debate before this Chamber is,  Do we impose sanctions before an invasion in order to stop the invasion  or do we threaten sanctions after an invasion is done?   The bill that my colleague Senator Menendez is pushing would do the  latter. It would impose sanctions after an invasion is completed. I  don't think Putin believes those sanctions would ever be imposed. But I  can tell you, Ukrainian President Zelensky has very expressly addressed  this issue. Here is what he said: ``Only if the sanctions are applied  prior to the armed conflict would they become a prevention mechanism  for any possible escalation.'' That is the President of Ukraine begging  the Members of this Senate to vote in favor of the bill on the floor  today.   Today will be one of our very last chances to stop Nord Stream 2 and  to stop an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine.   Just a few minutes ago, two of my colleagues, Senator Murphy and  Senator Shaheen, had a colloquy in which they explained why they have  flipped their positions. They and every other Democrat in this Chamber  have voted for sanctions on Nord Stream 2 not once but twice. Every  Democrat voted in support of my bipartisan sanctions on Nord Stream 2.  Only two things have changed since all of the Democrats voted in favor  of these sanctions: No. 1, the occupant of the White House, who now has  a ``D'' behind his name instead of an ``R.''   The White House is furiously lobbying Democrats, asking Democrats to  stand with their party--sadly, at the expense of our allies, at the  expense of Europe, and at the expense of U.S. national security.   On the merits, this should be a very easy vote. And I would suggest,  if Joe Biden were not President, if Donald Trump were sitting in the  Oval Office today, every single Democrat in this Chamber would vote for  these sanctions--all of them--as they did twice when Donald Trump was  sitting in the Oval Office.   The other thing that has changed, by the way, is the Russian troops  on the border of Ukraine, which is exactly what the Ukrainians and the  Poles told us would happen when Biden waived these sanctions.   Those are the two things that have changed.   I have to say, my colleagues Senators Murphy and Shaheen had a very  odd colloquy because they decided to go after me personally instead of  focusing on the merits of the issue. In particular, they said: You  know, when Trump was President, Senator Cruz didn't hold his State  Department nominees over Nord Stream 2, and Trump didn't impose  sanctions over Nord Stream 2.   Now, I recognize in politics sometimes, in the heat of the moment,  you say things; you don't entirely think through them. But even in the  annals of bad arguments, that is a singularly absurd argument. It is  true I didn't hold the State Department nominees over Nord Stream 2. It  is true Trump didn't impose sanctions. Why? Because we stopped Nord  Stream 2, because we were successful.   When I authored the bipartisan sanctions, there were significant  elements of the Trump administration that resisted it. The Department  of the Treasury fought mightily against it. And I was more than happy  to battle my own party on this because this was the right thing to do  for U.S. national security. Is there even one Democrat with the courage  to do that against his own party now that it is the other side?   The argument I didn't hold any nominees--why would I hold nominees?  President Trump signed the bill. I have said from the beginning: If  Biden imposes the sanctions, I will lift all the holds. I lifted 32  holds in December to get this vote.   My focus is on stopping this pipeline and stopping Putin and Russia.  And their argument that, well, Trump didn't impose sanctions--that is  correct, because Putin stopped building the pipeline.   I remind you of the timing. President Trump signed the bill, if my  memory serves correctly, at 7 p.m. on a Thursday night. Putin stopped  building the pipeline at 6:45 p.m., 15 minutes beforehand. There was  nothing to sanction because they didn't commit the sanctionable  conduct; they stopped. They only returned to building the pipeline-- does the Presiding Officer know what date Putin began building the  deep-sea pipeline once again? January 24, 2021, 4 days after Joe Biden  was sworn into office. Putin knew that Biden was going to do what he  did: waive the sanctions and surrender. The sanctions worked. We had a  bipartisan victory that, inexplicably, this White House gave away.   I want to take a minute to speak to my Democratic colleagues.   Listen, there are lots of issues we are going to disagree with one  another on a partisan matter. That is fine. We will talk about tax  rates, whether they should be high or low. We can have good, vigorous  arguments about that. That is a part of our democracy. But in this  instance, the Biden White House is carrying out a policy that makes no  sense, that abandons our allies, that is harmful to American national  security, that strengthens and encourages the aggression of Vladimir  Putin, a bully and a tyrant, and that makes war much more likely.   Most, if not all, of my Democratic colleagues know all of this. I am  going  [[Page S205]]  to ask my Democratic colleagues to do something hard, which is to have  the courage to stand up and take some partisan grief for voting against  the White House on this one. Save the White House from the mistake they  are making. That is one of the roles of the Senate. We keep hearing the  analogy the Framers used of a saucer to cool the tempers of the moment.  The Senate did that with President Trump. The Senate should do so with  President Biden as well.   In my 10 years in the U.S. Senate, I have taken a lot of votes. The  Presiding Officer has taken a lot of votes. There are very few votes  that I think are as consequential as the vote we are getting ready to  take.   If Senate Democrats put partisan loyalty above national security, if  they vote simply by party line, it will dramatically increase the  chances of a violent Russian invasion of Ukraine. Days or weeks or  months from now, if we turn on the television set and see Russian tanks  in the streets of Kiev, the reason will be that the U.S. Senate heard  the pleas of our Ukrainian allies and we turned a deaf ear to them. I  pray that we don't do so. The eyes of history are upon us, and this  body, Republicans and Democrats, should rise to the occasion.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, in a few minutes, the Senate is going to  take a vote of incalculable importance to our national security, to the  future of our allies in Europe, and to the very existence of the nation  of Ukraine.   Right now, Vladimir Putin has assembled over 100,000 troops on the  border of Ukraine. More troops and more  [[Page S214]]  weapons are arriving every day. Putin yearns to reassemble the old  Soviet Union. Putin would see Ukraine wiped off the face of the map.   This is not the first time that the people of Ukraine have had to  face down Russian aggression and authoritarianism. Throughout the Cold  War and through their independence in 1991, millions of Ukrainians died  as they struggled for independence from the Soviet Union and from  Soviet Russia.   In 1994, the United States signed the Budapest Memorandum on Security  Assurances. We committed--the United States of America committed--to  ensuring Ukraine's territorial integrity in exchange for Ukraine  voluntarily giving up the world's third largest nuclear arsenal, which  it had inherited following the collapse of the Soviet Union. That was  our commitment, and it is now our national obligation.   Russia, of course, also signed the Budapest Memorandum. Nevertheless,  in 2014, thousands of Ukrainians died when Putin invaded Ukraine.   Putin only stopped short of a full invasion because he couldn't  endanger the Ukrainian energy infrastructure, which he needs to get  Russian gas to Europe. He now believes that Nord Stream 2 is a done  deal, thanks to President Biden's catastrophic surrender and waiving of  the mandatory sanctions passed by Congress.   Putin sees Nord Stream 2 as an alternate route to get his gas to  Europe that Ukraine cannot touch, and so he has moved to complete what  he couldn't do in 2014. When President Biden waived the sanctions on  this Russian pipeline, the governments of Ukraine and Poland warned  then that the result would be Russian troops on the border of Ukraine  and an imminent invasion. They were right.   In recent weeks, the people of Ukraine and their government--the  President, the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the Parliament--they have  all called on this body to fulfill the commitment that we made to their  nation. They have explicitly and repeatedly called upon the U.S. Senate  to pass this bill before us, imposing immediate sanctions on Nord  Stream 2.   None of us can know if that will change Putin's calculation, but we  must acknowledge, as the people of Ukraine have pleaded with us to  understand, that it is the only thing that can do so.   That is why today, in just a few minutes, we will have one last  chance to stop the pipeline that Putin built so he can invade Ukraine.  For 2 years, this body has had bipartisan consensus and unanimity on  standing up to Russia on stopping Nord Stream 2. It is only with a  Democrat in the White House that suddenly scores of Democrats have  decided partisan loyalty is more important than standing up to Russia;  partisan loyalty is more important than stopping Putin; partisan  loyalty is more important than standing with our European people  allies. And, I would note, ironically, the White House's lead talking  point is ``transatlantic unity.'' When the Parliament voted on Nord  Stream 2, it voted to condemn and shut down Nord Stream 2 by a vote of  581 to 50--581 to 50. The White House is saying: Stand with the 50.  Stand with 9 percent of the European Parliament against 91 percent of  the European Parliament.   That makes no sense, and no Democrat uttering those talking points  believes it. But there are too many Democrats who are deciding partisan  loyalty matters more than standing with our allies. Partisan loyalty  means more than standing with our European friends. Partisan loyalty  means more than honoring our treaty commitments. Partisan loyalty  matters more than protecting the national security of the United  States.   For 5 years, Democrats have uttered the words: Russia, Russia,  Russia. We will now learn whether they meant those words when they said  them, or was that simply animus for President Trump?   We should stand together. If a Republican were in the White House,  every Democrat in this Chamber would vote to sanction Nord Stream 2.  The only reason not to do so is because, for some Democrats, partisan  loyalty matters more than standing up to Russia or defending our  national security.   Let me, finally, say: If the Senate votes down these sanctions in  just a few minutes, it will effectively give a green light to Putin.  That is what the leaders of civil society in Ukraine have told us. And  if, as a result of the Senate's vote, the Democrats vote with Russia,  with Putin, we may well see in the days or weeks or few months ahead  Russian tanks in the streets of Kiev. And every Senator--Democrat or  Republican--will remember this moment, this moment we had to stop the  Russian invasion of Ukraine. And those Senators who put our obligations  to our friends, our obligations to our Nation, our obligations to  security above partisan loyalty, they will remember that. And those  Senators that didn't, they will remember that.   The eyes of history are on the Senate. There are moments,  particularly dealing with war and peace, when the consequences of our  actions echo throughout the days. This moment is one of them.   I yield the floor.
