 Mr. Speaker, today, I will be supporting this  bipartisan relief bill.   It will give small businesses access to additional funds that will  help them keep their doors open.   And, it will also assist hospitals overwhelmed by this virus, get  health care workers the protective gear they need, and help expand  rapid testing nationwide.   While this bill will do a lot of good, it still does not go far  enough for my state of Texas and people across America.   Texas is 49th out of 50 states for testing per capita, and in large  cities like Houston nearly 60 percent of COVID-19 related deaths were  of African Americans and nearly 20 percent Latino.   We need to do more to help community health clinics helping poor  people, expand mobile testing sites in hard hit communities, and deploy  rapid testing nationwide now.   And we also need to ensure that we are getting more direct aid into  the hands of folks across America.   This is critical as we work to responsibly open our country.   We must put working families first and I urge my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle to join us in getting this done in the next  package.
