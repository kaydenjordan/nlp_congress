 Mr. President, it has been a year since we in the  Senate confirmed Merrick Garland to be Attorney General.   During his confirmation hearing, I outlined what a successful  Department of Justice looks like and what I expected of him as our new  Attorney General. I gave him the answers to the tests. By this rubric,  he has failed. For instance, I urged him to build off the successes  from the previous Justice Department to reduce crime, maintain the rule  of law, and protect our civil liberties. But violent crime continues to  rise, the rule of law is undermined, and our civil liberties are in  danger.   Instead of condemning all violent crime, Attorney General Garland's  Justice Department targets lawful gun owners and blames those gun  owners for the rising murder rates, carjackings, and attacks against  law enforcement.   But the explosion of crime in blue cities is actually tied to  depolicing measures, hiring progressive prosecutors, and enacting  disastrous bail reform policies. Lawful gun owners are not to blame for  this rise in crime.   And in the midst of a crime spike, a number of Biden appointees and  judicial nominees strongly backed by Attorney General Garland have  supported radical ideas in the past, like defunding the police or at  least reducing funding for police. And some have even advocated not  prosecuting certain crimes. So how do you expect to effectively fight  crime with the lineup that I just gave you?   Instead of tackling the opioid crisis, the Garland Justice Department  wants to make it easier for fentanyl traffickers to spread their  poison. Fentanyl analogs are responsible for most overdose deaths and  are lethal in very tiny amounts, as we all know. But the Garland and  Biden administration support eliminating mandatory minimums for these  fentanyl analog dealers. Really?   In addition, Garland has wielded his power to undermine the rule of  law and cave to political pressures. The Attorney General has summarily  reversed a number of decisions issued by Attorneys General Sessions and  Barr that helped enhance the integrity of our asylum system.   This Attorney General has also issued memos, interpretations, and  filings to the Supreme Court that contrast with previous Department of  Justice positions.   Let me give you an example. His Department of Justice reinterpreted  the law to make sure that inmates released to home confinement under  COVID relief stay there. His Solicitor General also switched positions  on a cocaine sentencing case that was before the Supreme Court. Now, it  happens that both of these policy outcomes align with my positions. I  agree with those outcomes. But his way of getting there is political.  Rule of law must be consistent and not political.   So Garland's flip-flopping also jeopardizes our Nation's security.  Instead of protecting the American people from the Chinese Communist  Party's espionage, he disbanded the previous administration's  successful China Initiative. This program prioritized investigations of  national security from China, which is still a very serious threat  given that the FBI opens a new Chinese espionage case every 12 hours.  So I don't know why this would be disbanded. This move is concerning  and dangerous to our national security and reflective of partisan  pressures trumping smart law enforcement.   Also, political decisions are getting in the way of the consistent  application of the rule of law. For example, Attorney General Garland's  Department of Justice is politically selective about which cases to  pursue and which cases to dismiss. Despite the 100-night siege against  the Portland courthouse in 2020 and 96 people being charged as violent  rioters, almost half of those charged have been dismissed.   Compare this to the Department of Justice's own statement on the 1- year anniversary of January 6:         The Department of Justice's resolve to hold accountable       those who committed crimes on Jan. 6, 2021, has not, and will       not, wane.    Now, we all know that those who break the law should be held  accountable--no question about that. And as our Nation's top law  enforcement officer, it is incumbent upon him to enforce the rule of  law. He cannot pick and choose when the rule of law is politically  convenient or easy.   Under Garland's leadership, the Department of Justice is also  undermining valuable civil rights. This is something that he and I have  had a lot of discussions on as he has appeared before our committee.   So undermining valuable civil rights, instead of prioritizing that,  Attorney General Garland has killed the speech of American parents. He  sent a memo to the FBI and the U.S. attorneys around the country to be  on the lookout for upset parents at school boards. He did this after  the National School Boards Association suggested that some people  should be branded domestic terrorists. Imagine that charge--that you go  to a school board meeting, you might be a domestic terrorist.   What is even worse, there seems to be some evidence that the  Secretary of Education may have asked the National School Boards  Association to write that awful letter, which the association later had  to apologize for. Garland says his memo was just about violence and  threats of violence; but sure enough, whistleblower reports show that  the FBI's counterterrorism division was looking way beyond only  violence and threats. Parents' ability to voice their concerns,  especially now, is a precious right, and the Department of Justice's  actions cannot kill such vital speech constitutionally protected by the  First Amendment.   Also, instead of being responsive, the Attorney General has been  evasive. Last year, I sent approximately 50 letters to the Department.  That is one-third of all letters that they received from Members of the  U.S. Senate.    The Attorney General wanted me to know that I sent one-third of all  the letters he got from the other 99 Senators. So when the Attorney  General told me that, I don't think he meant it as a compliment.   I received some letters in response. However, when I am told that  they have responded to me, simple or lots of words on a piece of paper  don't, in and of themselves, make a letter responsive.   Furthermore, the Department has failed to provide responsive records,  with the exception of one or two small productions. By way of example,  I received a 30-page production of records from the Department. It  included improper FOIA redactions and failed to  [[Page S1075]]  include the necessary spreadsheets. Accordingly, that production is a  failed production because FOIA does not apply to documents going to the  Congress of the United States, so you shouldn't have that redaction.   Also, I have repeatedly asked if Nicholas McQuaid is recused from the  Hunter Biden criminal investigation, and that is an important thing  because he seemed to work in the law firm that was representing Hunter  Biden. And it ought to be a simple question to answer, but Attorney  General Garland refuses to tell me whether McQuaid is recused from  those cases.   At the Judiciary Committee's October 27, 2021, Justice Department  oversight hearing, I said to Attorney General Garland:         When I placed holds on your nominees for the Department's       failure to comply with Republican oversight requests, I said       either you run the Department or the Department runs you.       Right now, it looks like the Justice Department is running       you.    That ends my quote of October 27 last year.   So that statement still holds true. Instead of protecting the  American people, the Attorney General is sacrificing our Nation's top  law enforcement agency to politics during a violent crime spike.  Instead of being stewards of our Nation's laws, the Attorney General is  leading the charge upending the rule of law. Instead of fighting for  civil rights, he is chipping away at those civil rights.   Attorney General Garland, there is still time to change. You have 3  years left in this administration. I urge you to change course. I urge  you to bring the Justice Department back to a place of leadership:  leadership in reducing violent crime, leadership in maintaining the  rule of law, and leadership in protecting our civil liberties.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, Vladimir Putin's brutal invasion of  Ukraine rests on the false historic claim that Ukraine is not a real  country but a part of Russia.   Both Ukraine and Russia trace their roots to ancient civilizations  centered in Kyiv. Kyiv was a major city when Moscow was a backwater  that no one had heard of.   The devastating and brutal Mongol invasion in the 13th century  changed everything. Collaboration with the Mongols allowed Muscovy, the  predecessor of modern Russia, to become a dominant regional power.  Meanwhile, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania exerted control over much of  what is now Western Ukraine, giving it a very Western European  perspective.   Russia, since the Mongol invasion, has been ruled with an iron fist.  By contrast, Ukraine has been home to the Cossacks, who embody a sense  of freedom and individual autonomy. Just think of Ukrainian Cossacks as  the equivalent of the American cowboys of the Wild West. They hated  serfdom and oppressive government and sought to elect their own rulers,  which they called a hetman.   A Cossack state using the name Ukraine in what is now Ukraine's  southeast became a major power in the mid-17th century. Then, when  Catherine the Great conquered that Ukrainian state, she is recorded as  having said:         Every effort should be made to eradicate them and their age       from memory.    Ukrainians' strong national identity threatens the claim of Russian  nationalists to be the heir to the ancient Kyiv civilization. When  Ukrainians revolted against the Soviet collectivization of agriculture  dictated from Moscow, Stalin seized the Ukrainian wheat harvest and  food stores, starving millions of Ukrainians to death. This is  remembered as Holodomor, which means ``extermination by hunger'' in the  Ukrainian language.   Putin rehabilitated the image of Stalin and banned the human rights  organization memorial which investigated Stalin's crimes against  humanity. Putin is following, then, in a long tradition of Russian  nationalists and the autocrats associated with it who have tried to  stamp out Ukrainian national identity.   When Putin talks about being threatened by NATO, he does not mean he  thinks the Russian Federation faces a military threat. Until Russia  invaded and occupied Crimea and portions of Eastern Ukraine, our NATO  allies bordering Russia hosted no troops from other NATO countries.  Today, there are a small number of U.S. troops in NATO's eastern flank  which were reinforced only as a result of the current Russian invasion  of Ukraine. But these defensive troops are still dwarfed by the number  of Russian military personnel in Russia's western military district.  NATO does not have enough troops deployed to repel an invasion, much  less to be considered an offensive threat to Russia.   What Putin is really threatened by is that Ukraine, true to the  history I just gave you, is asserting an independent path. They don't  like that independent path because it separates them from Russia.  Ironically--in fact, very ironically--his aggressive actions to date  have only unified Ukrainians in Ukraine's determination to be free of  Russian influence. Putin has pushed Ukraine toward the European Union  and toward NATO.   Putin seems to believe his own twisted view of history, so he  convinced himself that the current freely elected government of Ukraine  is not supported by the Ukrainian people. Putin thought that he could  topple President Zelenskyy and appoint a puppet government.   Putin thought Ukrainians would not fight. Boy, has he been proven to  be wrong--really wrong. Putin cannot achieve his goal since the  Ukrainians will never, never accept Russian domination. So Putin has  taken to leveling civilian areas, cynically agreeing to humanitarian  corridors to allow families to escape, only to shoot those who have  gathered, bombing maternity wards, killing many women and babies. And,  of course, as you see every day on television, the atrocities can only  get worse.   We must provide Ukraine with everything it might need to stop the  mass murders. That includes military aircraft, drones, anti-aircraft  systems, anti-missile systems--almost anything they need--and we must  do it now.   I wanted more arms and sanctions before the invasion happened. We saw  that invasion coming. Any bureaucratic delays now are unacceptable. Our  Eastern European allies acted with lightning speed. We seem to follow  them. Our European allies were giving up weapons that they need for  deterrence in their own defense, and then we followed. We ought to  continue to follow their example; but instead of following, we should  be leading. And we should agree to fill any gaps caused by past and  future donations of weapons to Ukraine by frontline allies.   Ukraine's success and its defense will prevent a wider war that will  cost more in lives and resources. It is in our interest to do  everything we can to stop the Russian terror campaign now. We should be  leading--not leading from behind. We should lead NATO--not follow NATO.   We should be the great United States of America that we are because  we are dealing with a sick autocrat, probably with an ego that has to  be satisfied; and it is all totally understandable, except that  somebody is very sick.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Leahy for  joining me to discuss the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022. He and  I have worked together on the issue of EB-5 reform for many years.   Because of that, we are proud that the Consolidated Appropriations  Act 2022 includes the provisions of the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act  of 2022, of which we are the primary authors.   Congress originally authorized the EB-5 Regional Center program in  1993 as a pilot program, and, in recent years, its reauthorization was  often included in appropriations bills. However, due to lack of an  agreement to reauthorize and reform the program last year, it lapsed on  June 30 and has remained lapsed since that time.   This legislation formally repeals the pilot program created by  Congress in 1993 and codifies in its place a new regional center  program reflecting a number of reforms that we have pursued for many  years.   All regional centers which operated under the lapsed and repealed  pilot program will be expected to seek a new regional center  designation in compliance with the new requirements and reforms laid  out in our bill. However, the bill allows petitions filed by immigrant  investors under the old pilot program to continue to be adjudicated  under the law as it existed when they were filed.   The EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 codifies a number of our  long-sought reforms designed to enhance the integrity of the regional  center program and prevent fraud and abuse that have plagued it for far  too long.   The bill also requires that DHS issue regulations regarding the  redeployment of investor funds if certain conditions are met. We expect  USCIS to oversee redeployments and take action as necessary. Investors  should not be left vulnerable and regional centers cannot be allowed to  deploy funds in any way they please. We expect capital to remain at  risk, as required by the law, and the redeployment of funds to be in  projects that are preapproved.   The legislation codifies the definition of and the designation  process for a ``high unemployment'' targeted employment area that was  found in the 2019 EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program Modernization Rule.  As under the 2019 rule, the bill allows only DHS to make such  designations.   The codification of the so-called donut model from the 2019 rule will  significantly limit the number of census tracts that may be used to  seek a designation as a ``high unemployment'' TEA.   This limitation, combined with the exclusive authority of DHS to make  high unemployment TEA designations, will crack down on the notorious  practice of TEA gerrymandering, the practice of creating elaborate  configurations of multiple census tracts strung together so that a  census tract with high unemployment at one end can be used in order to  obtain a TEA designation for a building project within an affluent  census tract at the other end, perhaps many miles away.   It is also our expectation that ``high unemployment'' TEA  designations will be reserved for census tracts that have experienced  persistently high unemployment for a number of years and not because of  temporary anomalous circumstances such as local unemployment caused by  the COVID-19 pandemic.   Finally, the legislation puts in place specific visa set-asides for  rural area projects, high unemployment area projects, and  infrastructure projects. The visa set-aside for infrastructure projects  is limited to true public infrastructure projects--that is, those that  benefit the public and the American people--not public-private  partnerships or projects for a private business.   The EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 is the result of years of  hard work and negotiation, and it is our hope that it brings meaningful  reform to a program badly in need of it and, most importantly, much- needed investment capital and the permanent jobs that can come with it,  to inner city and rural areas where it is normally difficult, if not  impossible, to attract investment capital. We are grateful that it was  included in the Omnibus bill and look forward to seeing it signed into  law.            Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization Act of 2022     Madam President, I have been impressed that our Eastern  European allies have been able to act so quickly in providing aid of  all kinds to Ukraine, including weapons these countries need for their  own defense to deter Putin.   Even the notoriously bureaucratic European Union has acted with  unprecedented speed.   When asked by Eastern European diplomats why Congress is taking so  long to pass aid for Ukraine, I do not have a good answer.   It always takes time to negotiate and draft an appropriations package  to get it just right. But the Ukrainians do not have the luxury of  time.   We should have passed a Ukraine supplemental last week, even if  imperfect. It would have passed overwhelmingly, sending a strong  message to Ukraine, our eastern flank allies, and the aggressor Putin.   Now, the much needed Ukraine supplemental has been rolled into a  giant Omnibus bill.   This package has some things I strongly support, or even helped  write. But these provisions are riding along with a big growth in  spending, which I do not support.   I typically vote against giant take-it-or-leave it omnibus bills.  They are no way to legislate.   Senators who are not on the Appropriations Committee never see the  contents of an Omnibus spending bill until we face a deadline for  government funding running out--and an up-or-down vote; with no  amendments.    I urged my party's leadership to insist on a separate vote on the  Ukraine funding package in their negotiations with Democrat leaders,  but here we are, nevertheless.   Urgent aid for Ukraine shouldn't be wrapped up in an Omnibus full of  unrelated spending.   A cynic would say Ukraine aid was added to the Omnibus intentionally  to help it pass. Well, this is a town where cynicism is often well- deserved.   Senators who support helping heroic Ukrainians defend themselves from  a barbaric onslaught, as I do, are being forced to swallow a giant,  bitter pill.   So, for the record, I oppose the spending level in this Omnibus bill  and the broken process by which it was cobbled together. I am not happy  about being pushed into a corner yet again. Be advised--I will not roll  over and play nice going forward.   But I cannot in good conscience vote in a way that would further  delay urgently needed support for Ukrainians fighting for their freedom  on the front lines against tyranny.                           Vote on Motion to Concur     Mr. President, I intend to object to any unanimous  consent request at the present time relating to the nomination of Mayor  Eric Garcetti, of California, to be the U.S. Ambassador to India.   I will object because I have received numerous credible allegations  from multiple whistleblowers alleging that Mr. Garcetti, while mayor of  Los Angeles, had knowledge of sexual harassment and assaults allegedly  committed against multiple city employees and their associates by his  close adviser and that he ignored the misconduct. The allegations  involving the mayor's office have been the subject of public reporting  and a purportedly independent investigation. However, serious questions  remain regarding the alleged misconduct, as well as the mayor's  knowledge of that misconduct.   First, whistleblowers who have spoken with my office have not  previously spoken to the Foreign Relations Committee and are presenting  new allegations that must be fully investigated. Second, the  investigation of the Los Angeles mayor's office reportedly found no  wrongdoing by the mayor or his staff.   However, information provided by multiple whistleblowers strongly  suggests that this investigation was incomplete at best. The extent to  which the investigation was truly independent is also not clear, and  the report has not been made public.   The United States owes it to the Republic of India to send them a  qualified Ambassador that will represent the values of the United  States. Mayor Garcetti may very well be fully qualified, but at this  time, the Senate needs to look into these allegations further.   So until my staff and I have conducted a thorough investigation and  are able to speak with everyone involved, I cannot vote to confirm Mr.  Garcetti.                            ____________________
