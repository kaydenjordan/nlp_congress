 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 7734, which increases transparency and  restores a strong record of cooperation with the Treasury Department.   H.R. 7734 would require prompt delivery of certain Bank Secrecy Act  reports to the committees of Congress that rely on those records for  oversight and legislative work.  [[Page H7127]]    Under Secretary Yellen, the Treasury Department has taken an  unprecedented position that Congress cannot have access to Bank Secrecy  Act reports. This should concern all of us on both sides of the aisle.   For the last 20 years, FinCEN has provided BSA reports to the  appropriate committees of Congress without delay. FinCEN must  understand that this is not a partisan matter.   I look forward to continuing to work with my Democratic colleagues to  promote accountability at Treasury and to restore Article I oversight  authority.   I support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Rose), my colleague on the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7734,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank my colleague from Missouri, Mr. Cleaver, for offering this  bill and for working with Republicans on the Financial Services  Committee to make it a better bill.   H.R. 7733, as amended through bipartisan negotiations, would lower  the CDFI Fund's Bond Guarantee Program minimum issuance threshold from  $100 million to $25 million. It would also require the Secretary of the  Treasury to review the effectiveness of the CDFI Bond Guarantee Program  and report its findings to Congress; and the program would sunset after  4 years allowing Congress adequate time to make adjustments and ensure  proper stewardship of taxpayer dollars.   This increased accountability will allow Congress to make certain  that the programs that we authorize match the needs of the communities  to be served.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1730     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 7733,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, H.R. 4586, the  Risk-Based Credit Examination Act. I thank the chairman and ranking  member for their support.   Under Dodd-Frank, the SEC's Office of Credit Ratings, OCR, is  required to  [[Page H7129]]  conduct annual examinations of credit rating agencies on eight review  areas. Evaluating each of these eight areas is resource-intensive for  both the OCR and the rating agency and is oftentimes redundant when  there have been no identified material issues.   H.R. 4586 is a straightforward bill to provide the OCR with  discretion concerning these eight reviewable areas during their annual  examinations.   Dodd-Frank's increased compliance requirements for nationally  recognized statistical rating organizations, or NRSROs, put small  credit rating agencies at a disadvantage in the market, chilled  competition among rating agencies, and further consolidated power in  the largest rating agencies. Additionally, small credit rating agencies  were not the cause of the financial crisis and should not be treated as  such.   The marketplace needs commonsense reforms like this. By providing  discretion to the SEC's OCR for these eight review areas, H.R. 4586 is  right-sizing the SEC's oversight of NRSROs and alleviating costly  burdens that especially impact the smaller NRSROs.   By adopting a risk-based approach, H.R. 4586 allows for continued  oversight by OCR but in a more efficient and targeted manner. It also  removes burdensome and unnecessary compliance costs for small rating  agencies to promote much-needed competition in the credit rating  industry.   Mr. Speaker, I obviously support H.R. 4586, and I encourage my  colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 310, a bill that will  posthumously award the Congressional Gold Medal to four American heroes  who died in Benghazi on September 11, 2012.   H.R. 310 will recognize the sacrifice that Ambassador J. Christopher  Stevens, Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods, and Staff Sergeant  Sean Smith made for our country. These four men lived exceptionally  impressive lives that should be recognized and honored today.   Ambassador Stevens, born in Grass Valley, California, joined the U.S.  Foreign Service in 1991. Over his 21-year career he held a number of  important posts including section chief in Jerusalem, political officer  in Damascus, and consular officer in Cairo before he returned to D.C.  to serve as Director of the Office of Multilateral Nuclear and Security  Affairs and Pearson Fellow with Senate Foreign Relations Committee  under then-Senator Richard Lugar. Ambassador Stevens was a dedicated  public servant who traversed the globe to carry out the mission  statement of the Foreign Service: to promote peace, support prosperity,  and protect American citizens while advancing the interests of the U.S.  abroad.   Petty First Class Glen Doherty, born in Winchester, Massachusetts,  was a decorated Navy SEAL sniper and corpsman. Doherty served in both  Iraq and Afghanistan and responded to the infamous USS Cole bombing in  Yemen. Doherty left the Navy after 12 years of service. He went on to  continue to protect U.S. interests by working as a contractor for the  State Department.   Senior Chief Petty Officer Tyrone Woods, known by his friends and  family as ``Rone,'' was born in Portland, Oregon. Tyrone Woods, like  Doherty, was a retired Navy SEAL who continued to serve after an  illustrious military career by protecting American diplomats. During  his time as a SEAL, Woods was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with combat  ``V'' for valor in Iraq and served multiple tours in Iraq, Afghanistan,  the Middle East, and Central America.   Staff Sergeant Sean Smith was born in San Diego, California, and  served in the U.S. Air Force for 6 years. During this time, he was  awarded the Air Force Commendation Medal. Smith retired from the Air  Force and continued to serve as a U.S. Foreign Service officer. Smith  was posthumously awarded the U.S. Department of State's Thomas  Jefferson Star for Foreign Service on May 3, 2013.   Mr. Speaker, these four men served honorably and died in service to  our country. H.R. 310 will honor these men with the recognition that  they deserve.   I thank my colleagues, especially Representative Lynch of  Massachusetts and Representative Mast of Florida for their bipartisan  work on this very important piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I wholeheartedly support this bill, I urge my colleagues  to support it as well, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 310,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5128, the Expanding Access to  Capital for Rural Job Creators Act.   I thank Representatives Axne and Mooney for their work on H.R. 5128.  In the Financial Services Committee, we continually highlight the  importance of capital formation for entrepreneurs and job creators in  the underbanked rural communities. We all know constituents who have  struggled to gain capital to begin their own small businesses.   Small and rural counties and the small businesses in those areas are  even more vulnerable during recessions and during economic recovery.  H.R. 5128 is an example of legislation that can help solve one of the  biggest issues for a number of rural small businesses: access to  capital.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1800     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5128,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   On January 5, a fire broke out in an apartment building in  Philadelphia, a terrible tragedy that took the lives of 12 people,  including 9 children.   Even though the building was operated by the Philadelphia Housing  Authority, not one of the battery-powered smoke detectors was  operational that morning, so residents had no warning as the fire grew  out of control.   While HUD already has regulations in place to ensure that federally  assisted units install functioning smoke detectors, after a  heartbreaking event like this, Congress has a responsibility to ensure  that the rules are updated to prevent future tragedies.   H.R. 7981 would require Public Housing Authorities and property  owners within HUD's programs to install smoke alarms that are tamper- resistant and hardwired, or use long-term, 10-year batteries.   Making sure that we have modern, up-to-date safety code devices like  smoke alarms in all our federally assisted housing units is fundamental  when it comes to trying to protect the lives of our residents.   H.R. 7981 will create safer homes for HUD's residents.   I congratulate Ms. Dean for her tremendous work on this, and I urge  my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H7134]]         Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
