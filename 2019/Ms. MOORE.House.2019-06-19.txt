 Madam Chair, my amendment would add an additional $5  million for DOJ grants to Tribal Governments to support the exercise  special jurisdiction over those who commit domestic violence related  offenses on tribal lands.   Tribal sovereignty is absolute and non-negotiable.   This amendment fulfills our trust obligation to our First Peoples.   That is why in 2013, when I led VA WA reauthorization, I fought to  grant tribes the ability to prosecute those who commit acts of domestic  violence on tribal lands.   This ability is essential to protecting American Indian and Alaskan  Native women who currently experience the highest rates of domestic and  sexual violence.   Relying solely on federal law enforcement to investigate and  prosecute these cases has been wholly inadequate, allowing many to  escape justice despite committing despicable crimes against Native  women.   With this year's VA WA reauthorization, we built on previous changes  to allow tribes to act swiftly against those non-Native perpetrators  who assault law enforcement, commit sexual violence, engage in sex  trafficking, and engage in stalking.   We need to give them funding to robustly carry out existing and new  responsibilities. My amendment helps to that.   I thank my cosponsors, Rep. Deb Haaland, and Rep. Sharice Davids, for  their support and for working on this issue and I urge the House to  support my amendment.
