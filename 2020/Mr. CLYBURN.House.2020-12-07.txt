 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Butterfield for  yielding to me to talk on this very momentous occasion. I thank him for  bringing attention to this issue, the 155th anniversary of the  ratification of the 13th Amendment.   Now, having not listened to all of the discussion before, and I hope  I am not too repetitive here, but I want to bring to the attention of  all here this evening and our listeners two conflicting events.                                time  1700    Now, we often hear talk of the Emancipation Proclamation. The fact of  the matter is, there were two Emancipation Proclamations, the first one  freeing the formerly enslaved living in the District of Columbia, and  that became effective upon its signing in 1862.   The second one, also written in 1862 and signed by President Abraham  Lincoln, was to become effective January 1, 1863, and that was to free  the other enslaved people in the former slave States, which meant that  in those States that did not have officially sanctioned slavery but did  have slaves, in order for them to be free and in order for the  descendants of those from the District of Columbia and those affected  by those two proclamations, we needed a constitutional amendment,  because as we know, executive orders could very well change with the  next executive.   So Abraham Lincoln set out to lay the groundwork for the Thirteenth  Amendment, and so we are here celebrating the 155th anniversary of  that.   But we also this week will be celebrating the 150th anniversary of  another momentous event. 150 years ago come Saturday, we will  commemorate the swearing in to this august body the first African  American to serve in the United States Congress, Joseph H. Rainey.   Joseph Rainey was from Georgetown, South Carolina, and early in his  life moved to Charleston. He worked as a barber. His father was a  barber, and he took up the barbering trade, and made enough money as a  barber to purchase his and his family's freedom.   Now, the interesting thing about this is that I often talk about the  French historian Alexis de Tocqueville, who came to this country in the  1830s to study our penal system, but while here, he saw what he  considered to be a certain magic about this country. Back around 1836,  he wrote a book, a two-volume book, called ``Democracy in America.''   Now, de Tocqueville, in trying to figure out what it was that he  considered to be magical about this country, wrote in those books this  little phrase:         America is not great because it is more enlightened than       any other nation . . .    Just think about that, not more enlightened than any other nation,  because we had slavery. This was the 1830s. That was not an enlightened  institution.   But, he said:         . . . rather, because it has always been able to repair its       faults.    Just think about that. De Tocqueville said that this country is great  because it is able to repair its faults, writing that at a time when we  had slavery in this country in the 1830s. It was some 30 years later  when slavery was abolished.   Now, the thing that I like to point out is the fact that we talk  about all of these things that happened during Reconstruction, and most  times the things we are talking about did not happen during  Reconstruction, they happened after Reconstruction.   Reconstruction was ushered in by the freeing of slaves in 1863. It  came to an end in 1877 when Rutherford B. Hayes removed all of the  Federal oversight and this country lapsed into a period that we call  the Jim Crow era starting around 1877 and lasting all the way up to  Brown v. Board of Education in 1954.   Now, I wanted to point that out tonight as we celebrate these  milestones in our history, the 155th anniversary of the Thirteenth  Amendment and we will be celebrating this week the 150th anniversary of  the first African American to come to this august body. But I want to  point out something interesting about that.   The last African American to serve in that century, to serve in this  body, left Congress in 1897, George Washington Murray, the last from  South Carolina.   Now, I know G.K. Butterfield will get up and tell you about 1901,  when Mr. White left the Congress and left with that great speech, Like  the Phoenix, but in South Carolina, the first State to give an African  American to this body, the last one, George Washington Murray, left in  1897, and there was not another person of color to represent South  Carolina until I got elected in 1992, 95 years later.   Why? Because of something called voter suppression.   I think that a lot of these former slave States have gone back into  history and ripped out the textbooks, and we are seeing voter  suppression being practiced today much like it was practiced back in  the 19th century when they successfully removed all people of color  from elective office.   So I want to thank G.K. Butterfield for bringing attention to this  today. It gives us an opportunity to ask the people of the country to  really think about this period of time and think about what we are  experiencing today.   Think about what is going on in the State of Georgia today, when we  see interposition and nullification falling from the lips of the  President of the United States in trying to overturn an election, much  like they did that ran all Blacks out of Congress and much as they did  that took Blacks out of elective office, took Blacks out of schools to  be educated, all those things, and made it illegal for people of color  to even get an education.   I would hope that during this period of time, the people of this  country will think a little bit about what is going on around us and  just remember there is precedence for what the President of the United  States is doing today.
