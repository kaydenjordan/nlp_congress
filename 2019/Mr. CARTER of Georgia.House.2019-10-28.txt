 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I rise to speak in support of H.R. 2115, the Public Disclosure of  Drug Discounts Act. I am very glad to see this bill, which was part of  the METRIC Act Representative Schakowsky and I passed out of Energy and  Commerce, being moved through the House floor. This is important  legislation that brings desperately needed transparency to our drug  supply chain.   So much of the debate around how we can lower drug prices in this  country has been focused on drug manufacturers. This bill highlights  the need for reforms throughout our entire drug supply system.  Specifically, this bill shines a spotlight on the middlemen in our drug  supply chain: the pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs.   For context, three PBMs control almost 80 percent of the marketplace,  and while originally designed to primarily process claims data, these  companies are now some of the largest corporations in the country. For  the year 2019, the major PBM companies had a higher projected revenue  than Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google combined.   Again, for this year, 2019, the major PBM companies had a higher  projected revenue than Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google  combined.   In a time where patients are facing higher and higher drug costs, it  is clear that more transparency of these middlemen is desperately  needed, at the very least. This bill, H.R. 2115, will require PBMs to  report information on all of the rebates, fees, and discounts they  extract before a drug ever reaches patients.   PBMs argue that it is actually better for patients that the PBMs  extract all of these increasingly high rebates and fees because they  pass those discounts on to the insurance plans to lower premiums.   While I completely disagree with that premise, this bill will finally  allow all of us to see for ourselves exactly how much of a cut these  middlemen are taking out of the system.   Transparency is absolutely critical if we are going to lower drug  prices for patients, and this bill is a big step in the right  direction.   I applaud Representatives Spanberger, Arrington, and Boyle for their  leadership on this bill, as well as my Energy and Commerce counterpart,  Congresswoman Schakowsky.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2115.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 647, the Palliative Care  and Hospice Education and Training Act. I am proud to be a co-lead on  this much-needed piece of legislation.   In my years as a pharmacist working in long-term care, I saw how  patients with all types of illnesses face the challenges of end-of-life  care. Whether you are talking about patients with cancer, Alzheimer's,  or some other ailment, critical to our healthcare system is valuing a  patient's quality of life. That is why palliative and hospice care are  an important piece of our healthcare system.   As our population ages, the need for quality, well-trained hospice  and palliative providers is only growing. The George Washington  University Health Workforce Institute projects the number of patients  who could benefit from palliative care could increase by 20 percent  over the next 20 years. By establishing palliative care and hospice  education centers to train and educate new providers, this bill is a  critical step in meeting the needs of future patients.   Additionally, this bill enhances the NIH's research into palliative  care, improving our capability to care for patients in even more  effective ways.   Finally, PCHETA also establishes a nationwide campaign to better  inform patients, their families, and their healthcare providers about  palliative care services. This is critical to ensuring patients have a  clear picture of all of their options so they and their families can  make informed decisions of the care that they want.   This bill is an important investment towards a patient-centered  healthcare system that values and improves a patient's quality of life.   I applaud Representatives Engel, Reed, Clarke, Pallone, and Walden  for their leadership on this bill, and I urge my fellow Members to  support H.R. 647.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of my bill, H.R. 1781, the  Payment Commission Data Act.   Last year, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, and the  Medicaid and CHIP Payment Advisory Commission, MACPAC, who serve as  nonpartisan advisory panels to Congress, came to us with a problem:  They did not have the data needed to fully study prescription drug  rebates.   This bill ensures MedPAC and MACPAC have access to the data they need  to make informed recommendations to Congress. This increase in  transparency is extremely helpful in allowing MedPAC and MACPAC to  analyze how competition in our drug market is currently working and how  part D plans are managing the growth in drug prices. They will be able  to turn that new knowledge into improved policy recommendations on how  we, as Congress, can bring down the price of drugs for patients.   Simply put, this bill is just good governance.   Importantly, I think this bill, as well as the bill we just spoke  about, H.R. 2115, are shining examples of what is possible when  Republicans and Democrats are working together to lower the cost of  drugs for patients.   In the Energy and Commerce Committee, we have worked all year to  advance a number of good, bipartisan drug policies that could make a  difference for patients.                                time  1945    Looking across the Capitol, there are dozens more bipartisan reforms  that I think could get robust support here in the House.   The issue of prescription drug costs is simply too important to be  sacrificed in the name of electoral politics. Today is proof that we  can, in fact, pass bipartisan drug pricing reforms.   So I call on my colleagues on the other sides of the aisle: Let's  build on today and continue advancing the bipartisan policies we know  can become law and actually make a difference for patients in the  country.   I want to thank my friend and colead, Representative Tom O'Halleran,  as well as Representatives Rice, Panetta, Gianforte, and Welch for  their leadership on this bill.   I urge my fellow Members to support transparency in our drug supply  chain and to support H.R. 1781.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Hancock  Day School for being recognized by the Department of Education as a  Blue Ribbon School for 2019. This prestigious award recognized around  350 schools across the country for their commitment to academic  excellence and closing the achievement gap among diverse groups of  students.   To commemorate this award, Hancock Day School will receive a flag  that is a symbol of excellence in teaching and learning. Recognized  throughout the Savannah community as a stalwart of quality education, I  am proud to see Hancock receive the national recognition it deserves.   The school was founded in 1953 and serves pre-K through eighth grade  students. Using the ``Hancock Way,'' teachers are given autonomy to  teach free of busywork and red tape while they push their students to  succeed and refuse to water down any part of the curriculum.   The school's founder once said that students need to ``grow a little  new wood each day,'' and they are certainly succeeding.   To teachers, students, and staff alike at Hancock Day School:  Congratulations on your award, and keep up the good work.                            ____________________
