 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of the  late Gladys Shipman, a lifelong champion of civil rights and pillar in  the Greensboro community.   Gladys began her journey as a civil rights pioneer with protests at  the Woolworth's lunch counter where the Greensboro Four Sit-In  occurred. By the time of her passing, she was a board member on the  International Civil Rights Center & Museum in that very same building.   Gladys was the first woman to lead the Greensboro NAACP, served on  the city of Greensboro Human Relations Commission, and held many other  influential positions.   As a businesswoman, civil rights leader, mother, grandmother, and  great-grandmother, she approached every aspect of life with care and  compassion. Her passion for social justice and equality guided her as  she improved the lives of those around her and inspired future  generations to carry on her legacy.   Madam Speaker, I am thankful for Gladys' steadfast commitment to  bettering our community, and I am inspired by her kind and determined  nature. Her memory will be a blessing for all who knew her.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Women's  Health Protection Act. Congress must take action against the  Republican's relentless attacks on women's reproductive freedom,  including medically unnecessary restrictions and blatantly  unconstitutional bans on abortions. These State bans go against 50  years of judicial precedent.   We must take action now to protect women and their freedom to make  decisions about their own bodies, their own health, their own families.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this vital bill.
