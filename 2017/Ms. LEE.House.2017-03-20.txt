 Mr. Speaker, first let me thank Congressman Veasey for his  tireless work to protect healthcare for all people.   Also to Congresswoman Plaskett, I thank the gentlewoman for  continuing to speak out, to organize us, and for her stellar  representation of her district.   Let me also thank Congressman Richmond, Chair of the CBC, for his  steadfast leadership on so many issues.   Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago Republicans unveiled their dangerous plan to  repeal the Affordable Care Act.   A plan the CBO confirmed would rip healthcare away from 24 million  Americans.   This week--on the 7th anniversary of the Affordable Care Act--their  terrible plan will make it to the House Floor.   Mr. Speaker, one thing is clear: the proposal Republicans wrote in  secret backrooms would be a disaster for struggling families, seniors,  and people with disabilities.   Their proposal would mean 24 million fewer people with health  insurance and 2 million jobs lost.   Their plan defunds Planned Parenthood and rations healthcare for low- income Americans.   It would make working people sicker, in order to provide a $600  billion tax giveaway for billionaires.   We know who this plan will devastate the most: communities of color,  especially African Americans.   By ending Medicaid as we know it, at least 1.5 million low-income  African Americans could lose their coverage.   And millions more would lose access to high-quality healthcare with  the elimination of the ACA's marketplace.   Mr. Speaker, this is outrageous.   We know that African Americans already suffer from shocking health  disparities, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.   And sadly, these disparities are all too often fatal.   Mr. Speaker, when we wrote the ACA, we worked hard to ensure that our  healthcare bill would help end these disparities.   I was Chair of the CBC at the time and addressing harmful health  disparities--especially for African Americans--was at the top of our  priorities in drafting the ACA.   The final legislation was a huge step forward for underserved  families--particularly communities of color.   Through the exchanges and Medicaid expansion, millions of African  Americans gained the insurance that they needed and they deserved,  including those living with pre-existing conditions.   Take the issue of HIV/AIDS for example. Although they represent only  12% of the population, African Americans disproportionately account for  44% of new HIV cases and 40% of those living with HIV in the U.S.   Before the ACA, many African Americans living with HIV didn't have  any insurance at all.   Through the exchanges and Medicaid expansion, millions of African  Americans gained the insurance that they needed and they deserved.   Let me be clear: For people living with HIV in this country-- repealing the ACA could mean a death sentence.   Without the Affordable Care Act, people living with HIV are at risk  of losing access to the medicine and doctors that keep them healthy.   Clearly, health insurance is critical to keeping people healthy and  reducing health disparities.   Mr. Speaker, we know that the ACA works.   It has provided healthcare for over 20 million Americans--7 8 million  of whom are African American--since it was signed into law.   And because of this bill, young people, working class people, and  people of color now have high-quality, affordable healthcare.   But Republicans don't seem to care.   They are on a rampage to make America sick again--and we must stand  in their way.   Mr. Speaker, millions of Americans are making their voices heard in  protests, in town halls and in the streets.   And their message is simple: ``Keep your hands off of our  healthcare.''   I'm standing with the millions of Americans who are in opposition to  this disastrous healthcare bill.   The fight to protect affordable healthcare is on.   We will not rest until Republicans and Trump end their cruel campaign  to kick American families off their healthcare.                            ____________________
