 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, this weekend, I was  grateful to lead nine of our colleagues in the House of Representatives  on a congressional delegation to Jerusalem for the opening of the U.S.  Embassy with Ambassador David Friedman, Ivanka Trump, and Jared  Kushner.   I was joined by Representatives Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, Ron  DeSantis of Florida, Jody Hice of Georgia, George Holding of North  Carolina, Steve Knight of California,  Tom Rice of South Carolina,  Dennis Ross of Florida, Scott Taylor of Virginia, and Lee Zeldin of New  York.   I appreciate Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry for  authorizing the delegation.   We had the opportunity to meet with members of the Knesset, the  Israeli parliament, and I was especially grateful, as a senior member  of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, to meet with the Knesset  Foreign Affairs Chairman Avi Dichter.   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu welcomed us to his office and  confirmed our shared heritage. We must work together to stop Hamas  terrorist attacks using human shields financed by Iran.   With President Donald Trump, the American-Israeli alliance has never  been stronger to protect American families.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
