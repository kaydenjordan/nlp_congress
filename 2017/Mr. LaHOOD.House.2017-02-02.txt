 Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate National Catholic  Schools Week.   America's Catholic schools educate over 2 million students from  diverse backgrounds each year, effectively preparing them for a  brighter future and instilling in them faith-filled values. Data show  that Catholic schools are often the highest-performing educational  institutions in our communities. In fact, 99 percent of students from  Catholic schools graduate from high school.   This week, I applaud Catholic schools for making a difference with  students throughout our country; I applaud the educators who invest in  their students' academic and spiritual formation; and I applaud the 28  Catholic grade schools and high schools that faithfully work in the  18th Congressional District of Illinois.   Today I am a cosponsor of a resolution that expresses congressional  support of Catholic schools for their invaluable contributions to  students and families across America. It is with deep gratitude that I  recognize those Catholic educators who are shaping the next generation.                            ____________________
