 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, but I do  support the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment  introduced by Congressman Pascrell, and I am a proud cosponsor in this  bipartisan effort to address the increased rate of cancer incidents  with firefighters.   While common sense tells us these emergency responders frequently  inhale smoke and other harmful substances, it is essential that a link  is identified between specific chemicals and diseases and cancers in  order to provide more safeguards for our first responders.                                time  1745    This registry will allow the Centers for Disease Control to compile a  large database of cancer incidents amongst firefighters, and through  expanded research, we hope to develop new technologies, protocols, and  safeguards for these brave men and women.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member  Granger for providing increased funding to the Firefighter Cancer  Registry compared to last year; however, it is vital that we secure the  full authorized amount of $2.5 million to ensure the registry can be  fully implemented by the CDC.   Mr. Chair, I am proud to have worked with Congressman Pascrell in  passing the Firefighter Cancer Registry Act last Congress, and look  forward to continue working together to support the firefighters who  risk their lives every day.
