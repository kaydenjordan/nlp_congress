 Mr. Speaker, restaurants have been hit  particularly hard during the pandemic, taking on increasing costs while  facing huge revenue losses.   Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, the Restaurant Revitalization  Fund provided $28.6 billion for restaurants nationwide and delivered  over $85 million to restaurants in my community.   Still, the demand was greater than the resources made available by  Congress, with over 175,000 eligible restaurants that applied for  grants through the program going entirely unfunded.   This week, we have the opportunity to fill that gap, support small  businesses, and save jobs by passing the Restaurant Revitalization Fund  Replenishment Act. I am proud to support this bill and encourage my  colleagues to do the same.   After a long, difficult period of isolation, people are coming  together and going back to restaurants, but we need to make whole these  restaurants that have lost money based on nothing that they have done.                            ____________________
