 Madam Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member for  yielding. And I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Connolly) for his leadership on this.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2166, the Global Health  Security Act. And this was already stated, it was bipartisan  legislation offered by my good friend, Mr. Connolly. We have worked on  a whole range of issues in a bipartisan manner over the years. He is a  Democrat and I am a Republican, but we actually worked together. He and  I introduced it at the beginning of last year. So this was early 2019  to strengthen U.S. and global preparedness for and capacity to respond  to pandemics like the coronavirus.                                time  1300    This legislation was not born out of the coronavirus. It was born out  of a bipartisan vision for strengthening global health systems around  the world in case a disease like the coronavirus emerged. And as we  know, it did, catching the whole world really flat-footed.   Congressman Connolly and I introduced this legislation in April 2019,  well before anyone had ever heard the term ``COVID-19.'' When the  Foreign Affairs Committee considered this legislation in March of this  year, there were 100,000 coronavirus cases worldwide. That number has  now risen, as we know, to over 30 million that we know of.   The Global Health Security Act has two main objectives.   First, it codifies bipartisan support for the Global Health Security  Agenda. This multilateral partnership started under the Obama  administration and was embraced by the Trump administration. It aims to  strengthen health systems and laboratories in countries across the  globe so that they meet International Health Regulation standards.   Many of our constituents may wonder why we should support health  systems abroad when there are so many needs here at home. Well, the  coronavirus pandemic clearly shows that a weak and opaque health system  in another country--in this case, China--can directly threaten us right  here in America. That is why we must remain vigilant, so we can contain  future emergent deadly diseases where they originate before they have a  chance to become a pandemic and affect us here at home.   Second, our bill makes sure that we have the personnel in place to  prepare and respond to pandemics like the coronavirus. We need someone  to coordinate our government's response since that response inevitably  involves several agencies across the government, from the State  Department to the CDC, et cetera.   Several Republicans, including then-Chairman Ed Royce, called on the  Obama administration to appoint a single point person with a health  background during the Ebola outbreak back in 2014. President Obama's  team got it half right by choosing a single person, who was a political  appointee. The Trump administration appointed Dr. Debbie Birx, this  time a universally respected health expert, as White House Coronavirus  Response Coordinator under Vice President Mike Pence.   In any event, our bill would make this position permanent so that  when the next pandemic comes, America and the world are fully prepared  to address that crisis.   Witnessing the death toll and the economic devastation that the  coronavirus has brought, I think all Americans will agree that  protecting our Nation's health from future pandemics must be seen as a  national security priority. We need to take this opportunity to  recommit to leadership on global health security and prepare the world  to face and defeat the next pandemic.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I again thank the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) for his leadership on this bill.
