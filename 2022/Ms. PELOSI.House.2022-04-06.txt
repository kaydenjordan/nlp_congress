 Mr. Speaker, for generations, America's innovations, from  electricity to automobiles, robotics to plastics, have shaped the  course of history.   We prevailed because we were preeminent in our investments in  science, research, and technology.   But today, America's preeminence is being challenged. Other countries  have followed our lead in research, science, and technology.   As a result, more of the technology that we are relying on today is  made abroad, driving up the cost at home, contributing to inflation,  threatening our workers' financial security and their jobs, and eroding  our Nation's competitiveness.   That is why Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson and the Committee on  Science, Space, and Technology, along with 13 other committees of the  House, crafted a data-driven, results-oriented package to help our  Nation meet and win in the 21st century.   I associate myself with the remarks of the gentlewoman from Michigan  in support of the COMPETES Act. The House America COMPETES Act is  precisely what is needed to ensure America's might in manufacturing and  innovation while creating good-paying jobs and lowering costs for our  Nation.   Our bill helps bring manufacturing back to our shores, including $52  billion for chips, which are crucial for making cars, cell phones, and  more.   Our bill will help reinvigorate America's industry, securing $45  billion to strengthen our supply chain, reduce dependence on foreign  nations, and lower costs.   Our bill invests in research and education so that we diversify our  STEM workforce with apprenticeships and the rest.   And our bill will promote U.S. global leadership.   In the spirit of patriotism and unity, the House will champion these  priorities when we go to conference to craft a bold, bipartisan,  bicameral package to send to the President's desk.   I hope that we will have the opportunity to go to conference soon. We  are waiting for the signal from the Senate.                            ____________________
