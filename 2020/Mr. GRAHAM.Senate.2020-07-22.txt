 Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to someone  many of my colleagues knew and admired, Lorne Craner, who passed away  on July 2 at the too young age of 61, a victim of cancer.   Lorne dedicated his professional life to advancing freedom and  justice in the world. He served that cause faithfully as the longest  tenured president of the International Republican Institute, IRI, as  the Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor  in the George W. Bush administration, as Director of Asian Affairs on  President George H.W. Bush's National Security Council, and as an  advisor to Members of Congress, including his service as foreign  affairs aide to a newly elected Senator from Arizona, our late  colleague, John McCain. He continued to advance American values abroad  as president of the American Councils for International Education, as a  board member of several distinguished organizations, including the  Millennium Challenge Corporation.   I got to know Lorne when Senator McCain, who was IRI's chairman,  asked me to serve on its board. I saw the Institute thrive in size and  reach under Lorne's leadership, becoming one of the world's most  effective agencies for democratic development, respected by human  rights advocates around the world and in both U.S. political parties.   Like John, Lorne was a tireless defender of the dignity of all human  beings, the bedrock value that democracies are instituted to respect.  Like John, Lorne fought the bad guys to defend the little guys. Toward  that end, he usually exercised a little more skill at diplomacy than  John sometimes possessed, but they shared an equal devotion to  mankind's right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  Secretary of State Colin Powell awarded Lorne the Distinguished Service  Medal, the State Department's highest decoration.   Lorne and John shared, too, a dedication to the peaceful conduct of  international relations. Both knew that our interests and values  sometimes had to be defended by force of arms, but they were both so  personally familiar with the costs of war that they worked hard to  resolve international conflicts peacefully where possible and to make  new friends of former enemies.   Lorne went to work for John in his last term as a Member of the House  and his first term in the Senate, but their relationship began earlier  than that. Lorne's father, Air Force Colonel Bob Craner, resided for  more than 2 years in the cell next to John's in a Hanoi prison the POWs  called, ``the Plantation.'' John described Colonel Craner to me as one  of the finest officers he had ever served with and ``probably the  person I was closest too in my life that I wasn't related to.'' John  was held in solitary confinement at the time, the hardest period of his  imprisonment, and he credited Bob Craner, whom he constantly  communicated with by tap code, ``with keeping me sane.''   Despite the mistreatment of the POWS, John resolved early in his  Senate career to help America reconcile with Vietnam, recognizing that  the U.S. and Vietnam had shared interests in Southeast Asia, and that  the cause of human dignity in the country where he had resided  involuntarily for over 5 years could be served through friendly rather  than hostile relations. The normalization of relations between the U.S.  and Vietnam wouldn't have happened when it did if not for John's  efforts to help bring it about. I think it is one of his greatest  achievements. And Lorne Craner, the son who was deprived of his father  for 5 years by the Vietnam war, provided invaluable help in that  effort.   Lorne travelled to Vietnam with John in 1990, where he helped John  build productive partnerships with Vietnamese officials who would help  resolve issues that were in the way of better relations. And from his  positions in government and at the IRI, he continued to advance  American interests and ideals in Southeast Asia. Today, growing  security and commercial ties between the two former enemies, symbolized  by the port calls in Vietnam by U.S. Navy ships, including the USS John  S. McCain, are a testament to both John and Lorne's vision and  effectiveness. They imagined a better future out of the resentments and  rubble of war, and, with others, made it a reality. They were both men  who believed to do good in the world was why we were put on this earth.   Lorne was deeply committed to his cause, a cause he never strayed  from, for a day in his life, and we are all better for it. He was, too,  as all who knew him will testify, a devoted father and husband, and his  family's loss is the most profound. He was a hard man to lose at such a  young age, for his family and friends, and for the country and the  world.   Lorne Craner, son of Robert and Audrey Craner, husband of Anne  Craner, father to three beloved children, Isabelle, Alexander, and  Charles, brother of Charys, an American patriot, a man of justice, a  peacemaker, and a friend to many, is gone. But his memory is a blessing  to all who had the good fortune to have known him.   To his wife and children, the people who loved him most, as much as  you hurt today, time will assuage your grief, and you will still feel  his presence in your hearts. I lost my parents when I was a young man.  I can say with confidence that the day will come when you will recall,  without heartache, the good and honorable man who loved you so and with  whom you will one day be reunited. God bless you.   Thank you.                            ____________________
