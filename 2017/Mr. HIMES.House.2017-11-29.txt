 Mr. Speaker, I rise to mourn the lost opportunity for real  bipartisan tax reform. There were lots of Democrats, Mr. Speaker, who  were ready to make a deal to make our Code simpler and more  competitive. There were lots of Democrats who would have said, yeah,  let's lower rates, but let's do it responsibly so that we don't balloon  the deficit. And there were lots of Democrats who said let's eliminate  that incentive for companies to operate abroad.   But instead, we are where we are today, where we have a bill here and  in the Senate that will raise taxes on millions of middle class  Americans, that will deliver a huge windfall to the wealthiest  Americans, and that will send a tsunami of cash to American  corporations.   For what purpose?   American corporations, today, are swimming in cash. They are  profitable like never before. There is this fantasy that they will hire  more people, but let's actually listen to the corporations. Cisco,  Pfizer, and Coca-Cola have said they will take this money and they will  return it to shareholders as, quite frankly, they probably should,  since it is shareholder money. It is not going to go to new jobs. And  remember--this is the kicker--35 percent of shareholders of American  corporations are foreigners.   This is not a win. This is a loss for the American people.                            ____________________
