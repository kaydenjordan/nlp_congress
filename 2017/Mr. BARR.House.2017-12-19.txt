 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a bipartisan bill,  the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2017, introduced by my  good friend and colleague, Congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer from  Missouri.   I also want to thank Chairman Hensarling for his leadership and, for  my friends on the other side of the aisle, particularly Mr. David Scott  from Georgia, for his leadership in support of this legislation.   Among the least transparent and most mysterious black holes of the  United States Government is the process under the Dodd-Frank financial  control law, by which U.S. financial firms are designated too big to  fail.   Formally called systemically important financial institutions, or  SIFIs, these firms are considered by all-knowing Washington bureaucrats  as businesses so critical to the Nation's economy that they need to be  burdened with additional regulations, supervised more strictly to  further the cause of bureaucrats, and designated as a SIFI to send a  clear signal to investors that it is a firm which is most likely to be  bailed out by taxpayers during the next crisis.   For bank SIFIs, there is a one-size-fits-all designation model that  says that any bank with more than $50 billion in assets is  automatically a SIFI. Bureaucrats do little to nothing to account for  the unique nature of each institution that may indicate it is more risk  adverse or better positioned to handle a turbulent economy.   Bank SIFIs suffer from the same plight, in that they are not told by  the U.S. Government what they need to do to rid themselves of the  shackles of this SIFI designation. Instead, these firms are left in the  dark to guess what they can do to de-risk by Federal regulators. And  even if firms try to make reforms, they have no idea if the changes  they are making will help them shed themselves of this arbitrary  designation.                                time  1530    In the end, the entire SIFI process does little to make our economy  stronger and more resilient. Instead, designated U.S. firms and their  workers are harmed and disadvantaged relative to their international  competition, undermining credit availability, causing weaker jobs and  economic growth in America.   For these reasons, I support the Systemic Risk Designation  Improvement Act, which will give much-needed transparency to the SIFI  designation process and eliminate the arbitrary automatic SIFI  designation of banks with $50 billion or more in assets.   Under this legislation, banks will be judged by their merits, such as  interconnectedness, size, cross-jurisdictional activity, complexity,  and substitutability, and the justifications for a designation will be  clearly communicated to them. The end result will be greater credit  availability for small businesses, more capital formation, more help  for consumers, greater consumer choice, greater economic growth, and  greater competition.   Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank Mr. Luetkemeyer and Mr.  Hensarling for their leadership on this critical issue, and I urge my  colleagues to vote for this legislation.
