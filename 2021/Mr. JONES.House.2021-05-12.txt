 Madam Speaker, the American Rescue Plan is the most  transformative economic legislation for working families in a  generation.   Our expansion of the child tax credit will literally cut child  poverty in half. But unless we make the expansion permanent, we will  find ourselves a year from now in the same dire straits that existed  before the pandemic: A country where we accept that 11 million people  live in poverty, nearly 15 percent of all children in this country; a  country where we accept that 25 percent of Black children live in  poverty.   I have been in Congress for 5 months and I am already tired of having  to vote to reauthorize things that we know should be permanent.  Expanding the child tax credit is a moral and economic imperative. It  should not have an expiration date.   For the last year, we have talked about the impossible choices that  families have been forced to make: childcare or healthcare; food or  rent.   The reality is, these impossible choices existed for millions of  families before the pandemic began, and they will continue to exist  after the pandemic is over. Poverty is a choice that we make here in  this Chamber, and we can choose to end it.                            ____________________
