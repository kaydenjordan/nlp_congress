 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of communities across  the Nation that have been contaminated with PFAS.   PFAS represents a clear and present danger to families in my  district, and I am disappointed that certain provisions to protect  public health and our environment were abandoned by negotiators of the  National Defense Authorization Act.   I am encouraged that several PFAS-related provisions were included,  like the one I introduced which creates a clearinghouse of information  for affected servicemembers and their families and one that phases out  the use of PFAS in firefighting foam by 2024.   But Congress should have seized the opportunity to go much further in  protecting people from these toxic-forever chemicals. Losing provisions  for drinking water standards, environmental protections, and cleanup  was a shameful missed opportunity.   People are getting sick from PFAS contamination, families are scared,  and they are looking to us for answers. They need action now, and we  must continue to fight for health information, stricter regulations,  and mitigation so we can protect families, communities, and the  environment from PFAS.   This fight is just beginning, and I look forward to working with my  colleagues in both parties to pass additional legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, when I travel around New Hampshire asking  constituents what is on their minds, there is no topic more urgent or  more personal than combatting the skyrocketing cost of prescription  drugs.   I have heard from a senior who is unable to retire because his life  is dependent on drugs that cost $3,000 out-of-pocket.   I have heard from a mother who shares a painful chronic condition  with her daughter and has to decide every month whose prescription to  fill because she can't fill both on her fixed income.   Americans can no longer afford Big Pharma's runaway costs. That is  why I am proud to support H.R. 3, which makes historic reforms to drive  down the cost of prescription drugs while expanding and strengthening  Medicare. This package also includes my Advancing Enrollment and  Reducing Drug Costs Act, which makes prescription drugs more accessible  for seniors.   My provision assists low-income seniors by automatically enrolling  them in Medicare Part D's subsidy program, ensuring they receive this  benefit without jumping through bureaucratic hoops.   It is time to deliver transformational change and pass H.R. 3 to  ensure the health and well-being of the American people.
