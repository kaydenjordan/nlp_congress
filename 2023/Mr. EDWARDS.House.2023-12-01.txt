 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Brevard  High School boys' cross country team for winning the 2A State  championship. This is the second 2A State championship title that this  team has won in the last 3 years.   The Brevard Blue Devils dominated the championship race with a score  of 45 points, scoring well ahead of the runner-up team. The Blue Devils  also had three runners finish in the top 10.   I congratulate the Blue Devils. Their recent success is a testament  to the countless hours of training, hard work, and a genuine passion  for athletics and a quest for knowledge.   They have each made western North Carolina proud. May the future  bring many more years of success as we continue to celebrate the legacy  of their exceptional cross country program.                            ____________________
