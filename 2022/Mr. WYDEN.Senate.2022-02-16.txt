 Mr. President, it has been 11 years since the people of  Bahrain gathered in the streets of Manama to urge their leaders to  grant them stronger economic, social, and human rights. Bahrainis of  all backgrounds called upon their leaders for meaningful change, for a  voice at the table in the matters that affected their everyday lives.  But their activism was met with brutal repression from the Kingdom of  Bahrain.   Journalists and human rights activists have shared with the world how  Bahrain's national security forces violently beat unarmed protestors in  the crowds, severely injuring and even killing protestors with tear  gas, rubber bullets, and other live ammunition. The forces arbitrarily  arrested and detained journalists, pursued volunteers who were helping  the injured, and spared no one, not even children. This anniversary is  stained by the blood of the Bahraini people, and it pains me that  despite over a decade of asking for  [[Page S751]]  accountability and reform, there has been little change from their  government.   The country's leadership continues to commit and permit appalling  human rights violations. Past reports from the U.S. State Department  have highlighted the mistreatment of prisoners, including torture,  inhumane punishment, and lack of proper access to medical care.  Conditions have been further exacerbated by COVID-19, with two major  outbreaks in overcrowded prisons last year. Yet the government  continues to deny access to human rights experts, including the U.N.  Special Rapporteur on torture.   The Bahrain Government has also attempted to silence dissent by  imprisoning opposition leaders, outlawing opposition parties, and  banning online content as they see fit. The government restricts free  speech on social media from their people and requires news and  broadcasting outlets to be government-sanctioned, effectively stifling  all independent journalism and healthy discourse. Additionally, reports  indicate that the Bahrain Government monitors activists and other  targets of interest by hacking into their phones.   My father was a journalist, so I know how vital freedom of speech and  freedom of press are to a flourishing, stable country. As a staunch  defender against government overreach and unwarranted surveillance, I  cannot stand idly by as the people of Bahrain live in constant fear of  surveillance, arrest, and imprisonment for simply voicing their  thoughts.   America must hold Bahrain to a high standard, as we do with all our  allies. The United States maintains a strategic relationship with  Bahrain, as the country cooperates on U.S. defense initiatives in the  region and hosts the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet. The United States  represents a beacon of hope and democracy to the rest of the world, and  we cannot remain silent in the face of over a decade of human rights  violations and repression.   This is a key year for change; Bahrain is slated to hold its  parliamentary elections later this year. I strongly urge the Bahrain  Government to allow peaceful demonstration and dissent, open their  doors to independent oversight and international election observers,  address their violations of human rights, and cease their attacks on  free speech and free press. And during this pivotal year, I also urge  the Biden administration to hold the Bahrain Government accountable for  their overdue promises of reform.                            ____________________
