 Mr. Speaker, I have been involved for 28 years on the  Natural Resources Committee on these issues.   What we are talking about today is simple here. Yes, it is cheaper.  If you blow the top off a mountain and you dump it in the valley and  you bury a stream, it is cheaper. Okay.   Is that what we are all about here? The most destructive, least  environmentally responsible, but cheapest way of doing things?   If we are going to set the precedent here, I can think of a whole lot  of other areas that relate to clean water, clean air, and things that  are important to the American people and the sustainability of our  environment that will go away because it would be cheaper. If we can  just dump the waste out the back door of the factory, that is cheaper.                                time  1500    If we can just put whatever we want up the stack and people wear gas  masks, that is cheaper. That is the major argument we are hearing  today. This rule, a 100-foot buffer--a 100-foot buffer--for toxic  materials around streams is too expensive. It is cheaper to blow the  top off the mountain, get the coal out, and take all the overburden and  other assorted stuff and dump it in the valley and bury the stream.   The only problem is then it rains. What happens when it rains? Well,  you can either cap that whole thing and make it impermeable and then  have big runoff downstream or, as it generally happens, the water  percolates down through all the waste and becomes a toxic flow.   Now, you say, well, these are only seasonal streams. Well, seasonal  streams run into other streams. What happens when you get those toxic  flows is you kill the other streams. I am seeing this actually in my  district, not from a coal mine, but from a foreign corporation which  improperly mined and went bankrupt and left us with the waste. I have  seen the miles of stream that are killed from the toxics that are  leaching out from the overburden from the mining that is done. This is  an absurd place to say we are overregulated.    Madam Speaker, the clock is ticking. Not that clock, but  the new clock that I put up on the Democratic side of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which is the cost of  congestion clock.   The President has proposed $1 trillion investment in infrastructure.  He went to the Republican Conference last week and said: Fix it first,  and we want it in the first 100 days. I am with him on that, we should  do that, and I have proposals to actually fund a way to get there. Not  to $1 trillion, but a good part of the way.   So this clock indicates, from the day he was sworn in, noon a week  ago Friday to today, the cost of congestion for American commerce, the  movement of goods, and the American people. It is $438 million per day.   So the clock is ticking. Let's get America moving again, and let's  invest in our infrastructure.                            ____________________
