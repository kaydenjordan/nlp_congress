 Mr. President, one of the outstanding programs  offered in the U.S. Senate recognizes the best of America's high school  juniors and seniors. Since 1963, the U.S. Senate Youth Program has  selected two students from each State who rank high academically, excel  in leadership and volunteerism, and have a passion for public service.  They also receive a $10,000 college scholarship.   These young delegates have come to Washington, DC, every spring for a  week of education and tours highlighting all three branches of  government. This year's 59th annual Washington Week gathering last week  was conducted in a virtual online format, and I know it was a memorable  experience for the 104 student delegates from across the Nation who  attended.   As one of the eight Senators serving on the Senate Youth Program's  Advisory Committee, I congratulate all who were selected to be  delegates this year. I had the recent opportunity to have an online  conversation with North Dakota's two delegates, Athalia Haughton and  Micah Schlittenhardt.   Athalia is a junior at Century High School in Bismarck and is the  local chair and State programs director of the High School Democrats of  America. She is an AP Scholar with honor, a student council  representative, student congress member, and is the cofounder and  president of Student Advocates of North Dakota. She was a semifinalist  in State debate, nationally qualified in the Lincoln Douglas debate, is  a two-time State qualifier in speech, a One Act Play State champion,  and was a member of the first-ever North Dakota team to become a World  Schools Debate national qualifier. She crafts blankets for local  immigrants, volunteers at Heaven's Helpers soup kitchen, and raises  money for the Alzheimer's Association. Athalia has prepared testimony  advocating for international cultural diversity classes in North Dakota  public schools and is passionate about reducing the stigma surrounding  mental health, especially for students. After graduation, Athalia  intends to attend Howard University to pursue political science and law  degrees. She would like to become a politician and a policy writer at  either a State or national level.   Micah, a senior at Legacy High School in Bismarck, is president of  the North Dakota Association of Student Councils. She ranks first in  her class of 320 students, is an AP Scholar, and a Presidential  Citizenship Award recipient. She is president of the Legacy Concert  Choir and a member of the National Honor Society and the Bismarck- Mandan Student Chamber. She is involved in varsity cheerleading, All- State Jazz Choir, Central Dakota Children's Choir, and Academic  Allstate. She has been an advocate for Parkinson's disease and  Alzheimer's awareness and support within her community and has  partnered with a locally-owned bakery to pioneer an annual fundraiser  to raise money for respite care. She has been recognized as the 2021  Distinguished Young Woman of North Dakota and Miss North Dakota's  Outstanding Teen 2018. After graduation, Micah plans to attend the  University of Mary in Bismarck to study philosophy. She would like to  study abroad in Vatican City and eventually pursue a career in  academia.   I congratulate both Athalia and Micah for this honor and welcome them  to an alumni group of Senate Youth Program delegates, which is 5,500  individuals strong. Many of them have gone on to distinguish themselves  in every area of public service. I fully expect that we will hear much  more about Athalia and Micah in the future as they continue to excel in  academic and professional arenas throughout their lives.                            ____________________
