 Mr. President, everyone sworn law enforcement  officer knows full well that he or she is never truly off-duty. On  February 27, 2022, Louisville Metro Department of Corrections officer,  Maranda Grayson, was relaxing at home when she heard gunshots. She  immediately retrieved her duty weapon, called for emergency services,  and ran toward the gunfire outside, where she discovered a badly  injured neighbor and saw a bleeding child being carried inside. Unable  to locate the source of the gunfire, Officer Grayson focused her  initial actions on the wounded child. A trained first responder, she  applied a dressing to his hand and then returned outside, where she  performed CPR on the adult victim until additional emergency services  arrived.   These were moments of true heroism, which probably seemed like hours  to Officer Grayson and the victims. For these actions, she has been  recognized with her department's Award of Valor for ``bravery above and  beyond the call of duty when facing grave and imminent danger to her  own life.''   Louisville Metro Department of Corrections director Dwayne Clark said  that ``she represents the neighbor we all want.'' I couldn't agree  more, and I am proud to honor Officer Grayson for her professionalism  and tremendous bravery.                            ____________________
