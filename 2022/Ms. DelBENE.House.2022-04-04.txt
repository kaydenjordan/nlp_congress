 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for pulling  everyone together.   Earlier today, family, friends, colleagues, loved ones, and the  community of Snohomish County gathered to honor the life and sacrifice  of Everett Police Officer Dan Rocha.   Officer Rocha was fatally shot while protecting and serving our  community. He is survived by his wife and his two sons. Our hearts are  with his family and his loved ones.   Officer Rocha served with the department since 2017, and lived in the  community for more than a decade. He worked his way up the ranks after  starting in parking enforcement, before becoming a fully commissioned  officer with the department.   Police officers and first responders put their lives on the line  every day to keep our communities safe and, sadly, our State has lost  far too many officers.                                time  2000    There is more we must do to support police and first responders  across the country. We often ask police to do too much for our  communities when other proven alternatives exist.   We need to invest in mental health services so those suffering  behavioral issues get the appropriate care that they need. We need to  invest in gun violence prevention to limit risk to officers and  families. We need to invest in community-based policing to build trust  between law enforcement and the communities that they serve.   Congress has a role here, and I will continue to work with my  colleagues to be part of the solution to protect those who put their  lives on the line and the communities that they serve.
