 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   The American people are asking: Is there any depravity too low? Is  there any outrage too far? Is there any blood and violence too much to  turn hearts and minds in this body instead of the usual justification,  rationalization, and enabling in false equivalence we have to hear?   This is a moment of truth, my friends. Are you on the side of chaos  and the mob, or on the side of constitutional democracy and our  freedom? It is that simple. That is what this vote for impeachment  represents.   Madam Speaker, I will not turn a blind eye to the President inciting  an armed insurrection against Congress.   In the leadup to the election and in its aftermath, the President  peddled outrageous lies to overturn a free and fair election.   When that didn't work, he launched an armed attack on a coequal  branch of government.   As the mob closed in, I will never forget it, the banging got louder.  (BANG)   The President watched the violence unfold on television. (BANG)   Republicans begged him to call off the mob. (BANG)   Instead, the President attacked his own Vice President whose life was  already in danger. (BANG)   Now five people are dead, and some of my colleagues are calling for  unity.   I support unity, but unity cannot be a subterfuge for avoiding  accountability.   And today, I vote for accountability.
