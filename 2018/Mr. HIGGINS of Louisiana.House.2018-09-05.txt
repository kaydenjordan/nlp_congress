 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  rule providing for consideration of H.R. 4606, the Ensuring Small Scale  LNG Certainty and Access Act.   Mr. Speaker, the United States is currently experiencing an energy  renaissance. Liquefied natural gas production, or LNG, in the United  States is playing a major role in the changing of the international  landscape, with America now leading the way in innovative new LNG  technologies and becoming a major energy exporter.   I am proud to say that much of this national accomplishment comes as  a result of the contributions of many LNG endeavors based in my  district in south Louisiana.   The success we are currently experiencing is just the beginning.  During this Congress, we have worked with the Trump administration to  roll back many of the previous administration's regulations that  injured American industry. In fact, the previous executive branch, in  many ways, actually weaponized Federal agencies against the oil and gas  industry. Conservatives in this Congress have worked to implement  commonsense reforms like the legislation we are considering today to  revive the American energy industry and bring energy security to our  Nation.   H.R. 4606 would provide for the expeditious consideration of NEPA  exclusion applications to import and export small quantities of natural  gas. This is a needed reform that will help encourage economic  development and create jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support today's combined rule that includes this legislation and to  support the full measure when it comes to the floor for a final vote.
