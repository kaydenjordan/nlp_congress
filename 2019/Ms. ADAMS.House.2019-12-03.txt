 Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to be here this evening to  address a very important topic. I rise to advocate, along with my  colleagues who have come, for the 300,000 students that attend our  Nation's historically Black colleges and universities, known as HBCUs.   As Congress looks to agree on a funding agreement for fiscal year  2020, we must keep in mind our Nation's 102 HBCUs that specialize in  providing opportunity for low-income, first-generation African American  students.   When I entered Congress, one of my first tasks when I got here was to  launch the Congressional Bipartisan HBCU Caucus to bring greater  attention to the issues that affect HBCUs and their students. I did so  because more than anything I know the importance of HBCUs, not only in  the African American community, but for our economy as a whole.   For more than 150 years, HBCUs have paved a way where there is no way  for America's most talented Black minds. Despite discrimination and  neglect, HBCUs have continued to pull above their weight. We know the  facts and the figures, but it never hurts to repeat them.   HBCUs produce 27 percent of all African American STEM graduates; 40  percent of all African American engineers; 50 percent of all African  American lawyers; 50 percent of all African American public school  teachers; and 80 percent of all African American judges; despite only  educating 10 percent of all African American college students.   In my home State of North Carolina, we have 10 HBCUs currently  operating and educating over 33,000 students: Bennett College;  Elizabeth City State University; Fayetteville State University; Johnson  C. Smith University--in my congressional district; Livingstone College;  the North Carolina A&T State University, which is my alma mater and the  largest public HBCU that produces African American engineers and the  largest public HBCU in the Nation; along with North Carolina Central  University; Saint Augustine's University; Shaw University; and last but  not least, Winston-Salem State University.   They make a total of $1.7 billion of economic impact in the State,  supporting over 15,000 jobs and guaranteeing for their graduates $20.7  billion in lifetime earnings.   They are more than a worthy investment for this body and for our  State legislatures back home. And over the last 50 years, Congress has  taken strides to correct for the historic lack of engagement and  investment in these schools that contribute so much.   When enacted in 1965, the Higher Education Act represented the  Federal Government's first recognition of the important mission that  HBCUs serve. The HEA of 1965 first authorized Title III Institutional  Aid, which is the key program that supports academic quality,  institutional management, and financial stability at HBCUs.   Through multiple reauthorizations, Congress has sought to strengthen  and to supplement this law by providing low-interest loans for schools  to make infrastructure improvements. And, yes, by authorizing mandatory  funding to help HBCUs prepare students for STEM careers, a mission that  is sorely needed in a workforce that screams for diversity and  inclusion.   So tonight, Madam Speaker, we will hear from this body's most  tireless advocates for HBCUs and our students, many of whom are members  of the HBCU Caucus, which now includes almost 100 Members of the House  and Senate, and many of whom are alums of our Nation's HBCUs, and many  of my colleagues from the Congressional Black Caucus, because we know  firsthand what these schools mean to an aspiring student of color  looking at education as a ticket to the middle class.    Madam Speaker, I stand tonight as a living testament to the necessity  and to the importance of HBCUs. My mother, who raised me, was not an  educated woman. She wasn't able to obtain a high school education and  certainly not to attend an HBCU or any CU for that matter. But she  understood how important education would be in my life.   My mom did domestic work. She cleaned other folks' houses for many  years so I wouldn't have to do that. But like those visionaries who  founded these schools after surviving the horrors of slavery, my mother  dreamed of a better future for me as her daughter. And when I could not  fully recognize the potential in myself, it was an HBCU in North  Carolina, North Carolina A&T State University, that saw something in me  and made a committed investment towards my success.   A&T gave a poor, Black girl from the ghetto of Newark, New Jersey, an  opportunity, because that school believed in opportunity and the  fundamental importance of education that W.E.B. Du Bois spoke about.  When he said, ``Of all of the civil rights for which the world has  struggled and fought for 500 years, the right to learn is undoubtedly  the most fundamental.''   That HBCU took me from where they found me and got me to where I  needed to be. They shaped and molded me into what they knew I could  become, just as all of our schools have for millions of Americans since  the founding of the first HBCU, Cheyney University of Pennsylvania in  1836.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.    David Scott).    Madam Speaker, I thank gentleman from Georgia.   And he is absolutely right, HBCUs take you where they find you and  mold and shape you.   I had the privilege to serve on the faculty and to serve as an  administrator at Bennett College in Greensboro, North Carolina, for 40  years. So the thousands of students that I had an opportunity to impact  certainly have made a lasting impact on me.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Clyburn), our very capable whip.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for that  not only inspiring but moving speech.   I would say, Madam Speaker, that I had the privilege of meeting Mr.  Clyburn's wife. Certainly, all of those tributes are really due to her.  We are not only proud of the work that she did but of the life that she  led.   Madam Speaker, I say to my colleagues who talked about getting  married, I got married at North Carolina A&T to my first spouse. It  didn't last all but 6 or so years, at least not that one. But you do  have an opportunity to not only interact but to meet folks for a  lifetime, and that is really, really important.   I want to mention as well that of all the universities, HBCUs are  about 3 percent, yet we educate 10 percent of all students of African  American descent. That means that we do a lot with a little. We don't  get the kind of equitable funding that we have needed, but clearly, we  have continued to press on. These are wonderful examples we have been  hearing tonight.  [[Page H9214]]    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott),  the chair of the Committee on Education and Labor, a gentleman who has  worked hard to make education valuable and important also.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for not  only his comments but for his labor and his support for these very fine  institutions.   Madam Speaker, I do want to acknowledge the chairwoman of the  Congressional Black Caucus, Karen Bass, who had to leave. She left her  comments and asked me to read them, so I am going to do that.   She begins by talking about the Special Order hour tonight and the  support that we need to give to our historically Black colleges and  universities and minority-serving institutions. Congress, she says,  must provide mandatory funding for these institutions.   Fighting for historically Black colleges and universities is one of  the Congressional Black Caucus' highest priorities because HBCUs are  critical contributors to the strength of the Black community and our  country.   Many members of our caucus, the CBC, have attended great HBCUs, such  as American Baptist College, Central State University, Clark Atlanta,  Fisk University, Florida A&M, Howard University, Jackson State  University, Morehouse College, North Carolina A&T, North Carolina  Central, Prairie View A&M University, South Carolina State, Texas  Southern University, Tougaloo College, Tuskegee University, Virginia  State University, Virginia Union University, and Wiley College, among  others.   In the 115th Congress, the CBC launched a tour of HBCUs called CBC on  the Yard. The goal of the tour was to listen, to involve and mobilize  students to effect change in their communities, and to get their  thoughts on the direction of the country and the issues that impact  their lives. The CBC hosted events at Morehouse College, Xavier  University, Bowie State University, and Howard University.   According to the Thurgood Marshall Foundation, HBCUs account for 22  percent of the current bachelor's degrees granted to African Americans.  Moreover, among African Americans, 13 percent of CEOs, 40 percent of  engineers, 40 percent of healthcare professionals, 50 percent of  teachers, 50 percent of non-HBCU professors, 50 percent of lawyers, 80  percent of judges, and 90 percent with bachelor's degrees in STEM  subjects graduated from HBCUs.   The economic impact of HBCUs, as the gentlewoman says, is equally  impressive. A report by UNCF called ``HBCUs Make America Strong'' said  the positive economic impact of historically Black colleges and  universities show that HBCUs generate $14.8 billion in economic impact  annually.   HBCUs are vital to the students who attend them and to the entire  country, which makes use of the valuable skills that these graduates  bring to the private and public sectors. Our Nation must continue to  invest in HBCUs and minority-serving institutions.                                time  2000    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K.  Davis).    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Davis very much for his  eloquent presentation. As I think about many of the songs that we sing  at our schools, they have a certain relevance, strength, and meaning  for the students that we serve.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee),  who has been out on this battlefield for a very long time. I am so  happy to share this hour with her and all of my colleagues.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California for  not only her contributions, but the contributions of her family.   I am a proud two-time graduate. My daughter is a graduate of North  Carolina A&T State University, as well, and my grandson decided he  wanted to be a Bison, so he is at Howard this year as a freshman. I am  just delighted that he has joined the HBCU family.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne).    Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New  Jersey--where I grew up--for not only his service there, but for his  contributions tonight.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Lawson).    Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Florida.   Madam Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon).    Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania. I know Cheyney very well. The gentlewoman is right. It  was the first university, and I want to congratulate Cheyney on that  accomplishment.   When we talk about that, it should not be funding that separates our  students in a way that they are not able to get the education that they  need. We have had since 1873 18 HBCUs that have closed. All of us who  have gotten together tonight and continue to work this area don't want  to see another school close, especially because of money.   When you look back at those who have had difficulty, it hasn't been  because the academics weren't in order. There are strong academic  programs at these colleges and universities, and we want to continue  that tradition. We want not only these schools to survive but to  thrive. That is really important, and that is where we need to go.   Having said that, I want to read a couple of letters because they are  very important. They are from two of my colleagues from the CBC.   The first is from Eddie Bernice Johnson who has been very involved  with HBCUs well before I got here, and I want to just thank her for her  leadership as well.   She writes, Madam Speaker:         Historically Black colleges and universities, HBCUs, have       played an important role in our Nation's history. These       places of higher education have given opportunities to       millions of young people to get a quality post-secondary       education. Many of these students are the first in their       family to attend college.        I am proud to say that one of these institutions, Paul       Quinn College, is located within my district.        Currently, the top priority for HBCUs is to ensure that       they have the resources needed to prepare students for a       competitive, globalized workforce. The FUTURE Act, which       passed in this Chamber some time ago, does exactly that. The       bill reauthorizes critical funding for all minority-serving       institutions for the next 2 years.        Sadly, like most of the legislation that has passed the       House of Representatives this Congress, the Senate refuses to       do their job and vote on this noncontroversial bipartisan       bill.        The College Affordability Act, which was introduced in       October, would go beyond what the FUTURE Act does and provide       HBCUs more flexibility, so that they can strengthen their       endowments, academic quality, and institutional management.        The College Affordability Act also provides States with       incentives to lower the cost for students to obtain a quality       college education by raising the maximum amount for Pell       grants and simplifying the student loan repayment program.        These two bills are great examples of what we should strive       for to guarantee the best outcome for students attending       HBCUs and other MSIs.        Madam Speaker, we need to make sure our higher education       system serves all the students that hope to receive a degree.       Historically Black colleges and universities, along with       other minority-serving institutions, play a vital role for       African Americans and other minority students. We need to       continue passing legislation that provides true educational       opportunities for those who desire to learn and who are       unable to afford it.    Madam Speaker, one of my colleagues from Ohio, Representative Marcia  Fudge, who is a former CBC chair, states the following:         Madam Speaker, more than one-quarter of all undergraduate       students in the United States attend historically Black       colleges and universities and other minority-serving       institutions. These schools play a critical role in unlocking       higher education opportunities for millions of degree       seekers, including students of color and low-income students       of which many are the first in their family to attend       college.        To protect these essential institutions from the threat of       closure and financial despair, we must continue to provide       them with the resources they need to prepare students for the       modern economy.        Title III, part F of the Higher Education Act authorizes       important mandatory funding for historically Black colleges       and universities, Tribal colleges and universities, and       minority-serving institutions to educate and prepare students       for professions in the sciences, technology, engineering, and       math, or STEM, fields.        Unfortunately, these critical sources of funding expired on       September 30, and this lapse jeopardizes the viability of       these institutions, as well as the STEM readiness of the  [[Page H9217]]       students they serve. At a time when diverse representation is       low in the STEM economy, Congress must immediately restore       mandatory funding to prevent permanent and irreversible       damage to STEM programs at these historical institutions that       give students from underserved communities an opportunity to       rise above their circumstances.        On September 17, 2019, the House passed the FUTURE Act, an       extension of the $255 million in essential mandatory funding       for HBCUs and MSIs. Despite receiving unanimous support in       the House, the bill has yet to be considered by the Senate,       and it was not included in the continuing resolution that       passed in November.        So as Congress considers spending bills for next year, we       must restore this vital resource of funding that expands       opportunities for underrepresented students. It is past time       to uphold our promise to support these historic institutions       and the students they serve.    Madam Speaker, I want to at this point close with these comments.   First of all, I thank all of my colleagues for their comments  tonight, those who have stood up tonight for our Nation's 102 HBCUs,  and MSIs.                                time  2030    We are at a critical crossroads tonight. We are in the midst of  negotiating a government spending agreement that can confer over $500  million to all HBCUs.   For too long, the schools have dedicated themselves to the futures of  low-income, first-generation students of color, like me, who have been  neglected by their government. Over the last 50 years, this body has  made strides to correct that lack of investment and engagement, but  none of those strides came easy. They were achieved in moments when  many still questioned the purpose of having schools dedicated to that  mission.   I have heard the question asked over and over: Why do we need HBCUs?  I will say that my response is: What in the world--and I use another  word--would we do without our HBCUs?   When we think about it, as has been stated by several of my  colleagues, our schools were achieved in moments when many still  questioned the purpose, when Federal and State investments in higher  education are still consistently under attack.   Our HBCUs, in particular, still suffer from impacts of historical  discrimination and underinvestment, low endowments, outdated  infrastructure, a lack of opportunities for growth compared to their  PWI counterparts.   The House of Representatives approved $375 million for title III,  part B, the Strengthening HBCUs program last summer, the first time  this program was appropriated at the authorization limit. It approved  $40 million of loan authority for the HBCU Capital Financing Program.  It also passed the FUTURE Act, which authorizes $85 million of  mandatory funding for HBCUs.   We illustrated our support for HBCUs, and now we need to guarantee  that it is in the negotiations with the Senate. We want to make sure,  as I said before, that our schools not only survive but that they  thrive. When we fight for these programs, we show our belief in the  futures of low-income, first-generation students of color.   Madam Speaker, I am proud that I had a mother who stood up for me, in  spite of the fact that we didn't have the funds. There was an HBCU in  North Carolina that allowed me to come and made that investment in me.  I was able to complete my bachelor's and master's degrees there at  North Carolina A&T, and then, I was able to go on to receive my Ph.D.  from The Ohio State University only because of the North Carolina A&T.   Madam Speaker, let's not give up the fight now. We are going to  continue to do it. I thank all of my colleagues, again, for being here  tonight.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Supporting Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and   Support of Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for                           Education (FUTURE) Act     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 32 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, December 4, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
