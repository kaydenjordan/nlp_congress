 Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators Perdue,  Heitkamp, Tillis, and Jones in introducing the bipartisan Corporate  Governance Fairness Act to ensure investors can continue to rely with  confidence on the advice of proxy advisory firms by requiring the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate all major proxy  advisory firms under the Investment Advisers Act (IAA). This advice is  critical for investors as they decide how to vote their shares on  important corporate governance matters, such as director elections or  whether to sell the company.   Indeed, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters has stated that  the ``independence of the research provided by proxy advisors is a  critical element of our right, as shareholders, to hold the board of  directors accountable and to cast informed proxy votes on corporate  governance and proxy voting policies.'' According to the Council of  Institutional Investors, ``ensuring unencumbered shareholder access to  independent research is a crucial underpinning of effective corporate  governance.'' And the National Association of State Treasurers has  emphasized the need to ``maintain the integrity and efficacy of the  relationship between institutional investors and proxy advisory  firms.'' In short, proxy advisory firms are clearly an essential tool  for investors.   Given the importance that investors have placed on continued access  to proxy advisory firms, it is critical that proxy advisory firms are  appropriately regulated and held accountable, and this is the purpose  of the bipartisan Corporate Governance Fairness Act. Under our  legislation, all major proxy  [[Page S6928]]  advisory firms would be required to register as investment advisers  under the IAA, and therefore have a fiduciary duty to their clients. So  as to not discourage new entrants into the proxy advisory business, our  bill provides smaller proxy advisory firms the choice to voluntarily  register under the IAA but does not require them to do so. The  legislation also directs the SEC to conduct periodic examinations,  which must include a serious review of the conflicts of interest  policies of registered proxy advisory firms and whether firms knowingly  made false statements to any of its clients. Lastly, our bill requires  the SEC to consult with all relevant stakeholders and report back  periodically to the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial  Services Committee with recommendations for any additional investor  protections beyond continued access to proxy advisory firms so that  investors have the tools to make informed investment decisions and  exercise their rights as shareholders. In short, the Congressional  intent of this legislation is to preserve the critical role played by  proxy advisory firms and to hold them accountable to investors.   I would like to thank Senators Perdue, Heitkamp, Tillis, and Jones  for working with me in crafting this bipartisan legislation, which is  supported by the Consumer Federation of America, Harvard Law School  Securities Regulation Professor John Coates, who is also a member of  the SEC Investor Advisory Committee, the New York Stock Exchange, and  the Society for Corporate Governance. I urge all of our Senate  colleagues to join us in working to pass the Corporate Governance  Fairness Act.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators Perdue,  Heitkamp, Tillis, and Jones in introducing the bipartisan Corporate  Governance Fairness Act to ensure investors can continue to rely with  confidence on the advice of proxy advisory firms by requiring the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate all major proxy  advisory firms under the Investment Advisers Act (IAA).
