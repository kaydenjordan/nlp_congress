Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Scanlon), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Last night, the Rules Committee met and reported House Resolution  463, providing for the consideration of four measures: H.R. 277, H.R.  288, H.R. 1615, and H.R. 1640.   The rule provides for H.R. 277, the Regulations from the Executive in  Need of Scrutiny Act, also known as the REINS Act, to be considered  under a structured rule, and provides for 1 hour of general debate  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member  of the Committee on the Judiciary or their respective designees. The  rule makes 15 amendments in order.   The rule provides further for H.R. 288, the Separation of Powers  Restoration Act, to be considered under a structured rule, and provides  for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary or  their respective designees. The rule makes one amendment in order.   Additionally, the rule provides for H.R. 1615, the Gas Stove  Protection and Freedom Act, to be considered under a structured rule  and provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and  controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Energy and Commerce or their respective designees. The rule makes two  amendments in order.   Finally, the rule provides for H.R. 1640, the Save Our Gas Stoves  Act, to be considered under a structured rule and provides for 1 hour  of general debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and  ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce or  their respective designees. The rule makes three amendments in order.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Our constituents didn't elect us to come here and eat fancy dinners  and go from one fundraiser to the next, take lavish trips, and rub  elbows with important and famous people. They sent us here for one job:  Pass laws or, in some cases, repeal laws. Set the rules under which  they will live under; and then we are accountable every 2 years.   The Founders were very wise. Some people complain, but every 2 years  our constituents have a chance to replace us if the rules we have set  aren't in their favor. They have no such choice with bureaucrats.   Our Founders didn't set this system up for bureaucrats to make the  laws. Excessive regulation stifles economic growth, hurts small  businesses, and raises consumer prices.   In fact, much of the inflation that we see in the sectors of food and  energy is due to overregulation. It is vital that Congress act to  reduce our regulatory burden now, which raises consumer prices, reduces  wages, and costs jobs.   I think the American people watching this debate are somewhat vexed  that the other side of the aisle says we need to give up more power to  the executive branch when they sent us here to do something, and they  wonder why we are so feckless so often.  [[Page H2753]]    They are probably shaking their heads. What are these other people  talking about that somebody else should make the rules that we live  under?   The REINS Act would require congressional approval for regulations  that have a major impact on our economy of more than $100 million, or  lead to a raise in consumer prices, or adversely affect employment.   If the REINS Act becomes law, every major regulation promulgated by  the administration will come back to Congress for our approval. These  regulations, they are not just regulations, these have the force of  law. You can go to prison for 10 years, as we have seen with the  regulation on pistol braces, just because some bureaucrat decided they  wanted to pass a regulation.   In fact, the jobs-crushing OSHA vaccine mandate was one of the things  that we should have voted on. If you are going to do that to your  constituents, vote on it. But we didn't. We let the executive branch do  it.   The idea behind the REINS Act isn't novel. It is enshrined in the  Constitution. Article I, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution says: ``All  legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the  United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of  Representatives.''   Does it say and a bureaucracy? No, it doesn't. Does is it say some  legislative powers herein granted? No, it says all legislative powers  herein granted are given to the Congress of the United States.   Congress has delegated its authority to unaccountable Federal  agencies over the past decades, and our constituents are feeling that  burden. Unelected bureaucrats do not have the constitutional authority  to write laws, nor are they accountable to the people. They are career  bureaucrats.   Our Congress has this power, and ceding it to the Federal agencies  undermines our representative form of government.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  McCormick), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, one of the arguments made from the other  side of the aisle that I find absolutely laughable is this notion that  the REINS Act might be unconstitutional, might have some constitutional  infirmity because it requires Congress to pass the laws instead of the  executive branch.   They reference a Supreme Court decision, INS v. Chadha, that doesn't  even read on this bill. The REINS Act does not violate the Presentment  Clause because it requires passage in the House, passage in the Senate,  and a signature of the President. It doesn't even apply to the Supreme  Court decision that was referenced.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy),  my good friend.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to include in the  Record a document titled: ``Gas stove use and respiratory health among  adults with asthma in NHANES III,'' the conclusion of which is: ``Among  adults with asthma, there was no apparent impact of gas stove use on  pulmonary function or respiratory symptoms.''    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell the story of how the REINS Act  originated. It is one of the most popular bills in Congress. It is the  one bill that would do the most to restore the constitutional balance  of government.   It was an idea from Lloyd Rogers. Lloyd is a constituent of mine. He  grew up in an orphanage where he met the girl who would later become  his wife. They were married for 65 years.   Lloyd served during the Korean war. Lloyd came home and ran for  county judge executive, where he served the people of Kentucky once  again. Time after time, when he was trying to do the right thing for  the people in Kentucky, he was frustrated by laws, but he dug into  them. They weren't laws. They were rules, and he couldn't talk to his  Congressman to get these things fixed so that he could govern locally.   He came up with the idea of the REINS Act, gave it to the Congressman  who represented the district before me, and then that Congressman  brought it here to Congress. That is the way laws are supposed to  happen, not by some bureaucrat.   Mr. Speaker, I want to move on to the gas stove act here. Despite  media gaslighting to the contrary, the Biden administration has  effectively declared war on gas stoves using varying rationales.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Langworthy), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, the other side of the aisle has said that  nobody's gas stove is going to be banned. Let me read you a statement  from Jeremy Ortiz, a spokesperson for the Department of Energy: Our  ``analysis is constructed so that the proposed standard would ensure  that products with at least one HIR burner and continuous grates can  continue to be available on the market.'' Here is the punch line: ``We  did go out of our way to make sure that these two features would remain  on the market in creating our analysis. Over half the market would  remain if this standard is finalized as proposed.''   Wow. They went out of their way. They bent over backward to make sure  they were only going to ban half of the gas stoves on the market for  now.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Cammack).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Make no mistake: This administration wants to ban gas stoves. They have  said it out loud.   Mr. Speaker, 38 to 40 percent of Americans use gas stoves. I asked  the ranking member of the committee of jurisdiction for these bills to  save our gas stoves if he owns a gas stove. In fact, he does. I asked  him: Does it meet the new standards? Would he be able to buy one in the  market? He has no idea. He was offended that I would ask such a  question.   We have two bills here to protect your gas stoves: The Gas Stove  Protection and Freedom Act and the Save Our Gas Stoves Act.   The Federal Interagency Committee on Indoor Air Quality has never  identified gas cooking stoves as contributing to asthma or respiratory  illness, nor has the Consumer Product Safety Commission nor the EPA  ever identified gas stoves as a significant contributor to adverse air  quality or as a health hazard.   The other side of the aisle just doesn't like gas stoves. They are  reaching for any reason to ban these things. They shouldn't. It is  shortsighted.   Number one, what if everybody had an electric stove, how would they  get the energy? Well, you would burn natural gas, as many States do-- most States do--in a turbine; you would generate electricity in a  process that is hardly 50 percent efficient; then you would transmit it  over power lines to the household, which could be hundreds of miles, at  an efficiency of maybe 70 percent by the time it goes through all of  the transformers, gets to the house, and then heats up the pot.   Why not take the natural gas to the house and burn it there directly?   Many consumers have identified that this is a lot more efficient, and  that is what they do and that is why they have gas stoves. They are 3.4  times more affordable than electric stoves. Those who use gas for  heating, cooking, and clothes drying on average save over $1,000 a year  in their household. When the electricity goes out, when you have  natural disasters, natural gas is there and usually available to offer  lifesaving heat and to boil water.    I spent about 3 hours yesterday delving into the Department of  Energy's regulations and their scientific basis for what they are doing  because I wanted to know: How can one appliance that burns gas be more  efficient than another appliance that burns gas?   If you expose CH4 in the presence of oxygen, you get a certain amount  of Btus. Unless you have got some science project with a catalyst, you  are going to get the same number of Btus from both stoves.   When I dug into it, here is what they want to do. They measured  efficiency by heating up a pot of water, and they found that stoves  with heavy grates or continuous grates that allow for more safety, they  said those are less efficient because the grate heats up and less of  your energy goes into your water.   Mr. Speaker, people aren't cooking water. They are cooking food.  Those grates provide more heat as the food sits there on the stove. The  continuous grates provide safety for somebody who is not strong enough  to pick up a pan, yet they are saying those are less efficient.   Then in their studies, if you dig deep enough, they admit that a  dogged pursuit of efficiency will result in stoves that are less  healthy, because to make it more efficient, you shorten the grates and  get the pan closer to the flame.   When the flame impinges on the pan, the gas doesn't combust  efficiently, and you get carbon monoxide. If all you care about is  efficiency, you get more carbon monoxide.   What are they doing? They are going after the high-end stoves. That  is where they are going first, the ones with the heavy grates, the ones  with the thick walls in the ovens that make it easier to cook good  food. They are saying they are less efficient, but they are heating up  water. They are not cooking food. They are making assumptions about  customer preferences.   In the realm of electric stoves, they say: Induction stoves are more  efficient. So we will just make everybody buy new pans because all of  your pans don't work on induction stoves. So what, says the Department  of Energy.   This is a war on stoves, and the war will be undone or stopped,  halted, by the Gas Stove Protection and Freedom Act and the Save Our  Gas Stoves Act.                                time  1315    I want to finish by talking about another bill in this rule, which is  to restore the separation of powers. It is pretty simple. This bill is  two pages long, and it is basically a legislative repeal of Chevron  deference.   Chevron deference may go away soon anyway because it is based on a  Supreme Court decision that said: Do you know what? If a regulatory  agency does their best and makes a good guess about what they think the  law is, then the court shouldn't second-guess the regulatory agency.   That is not the court's job. The court's job is to look at the law as  written by Congress, not to say: Stretch it as far as you want,  administrative branch.  [[Page H2758]]    The Separation of Powers Restoration Act would require the courts to  look at all questions of law de novo, including interpretation of  constitutional and statutory provisions.   Mr. Speaker, this is a wise bill. It should pass, and the rule for  this should pass.   I also want to note, just in closing, that the American people don't  understand why my colleagues want to give up power to the executive  branch. They elected us to come up here and represent them, to live by  the laws that we write, but also to be responsible for those laws when  our constituents have to live under them.   It sounds absurd to the American people that we would want to give up  that power that those people have entrusted to us.   Whether laws or the structure of government, if my colleagues just  follow common sense, they know banning gas stoves isn't going to save  the planet. It is going to increase prices. It is going to make it  harder for low-income and middle-income families to get by if they have  to buy more expensive appliances or if they have to cook their food  longer. That is the result of these regulations.   All of that could be reined in with the REINS Act. That is what we  need to do. We need to pass this resolution today and get these four  bills on the floor. We have allowed amendments, and everybody under  this rule has had 72 hours to read the bill. What a concept. Give the  American people the time to read the bill, as well. We have read it. We  know what these bills do. Put them on the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on all four bills and, most  explicitly, a ``yes'' vote on this resolution.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Scanlon is as follows:     An Amendment to H. Res. 463 Offered By Ms. Scanlon of Pennsylvania         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
