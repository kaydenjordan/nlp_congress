 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1219, the Supporting America's Innovators Act, is  legislation that certainly shows that sometimes we can get together and  we can support a good idea. This act is such a thing. It shows how well  we can work together to craft bipartisan solutions that support our  Nation's innovators and the jobs that they create.   Last Congress, Mr. McHenry came to me with a problem: Sophisticated  angel investors who fund promising startup businesses want to pool  their money together, but the law effectively caps them at 100  investors per fund. If more than 100 people want to invest, the fund is  forced to exclude some of them from the deal to avoid registration and  regulation as an ``investment company'' under the securities laws. That  means investors willing to commit capital are being turned away and  startups are losing out on important early-stage funding.   Because of Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez and Mr. Patrick McHenry  working together, working out any concerns that had been identified on  either side of the aisle, we now, today, have a piece of legislation, a  bill, that would narrowly increase the investor limitation from 100 to  250 persons for certain venture capital funds, provided that the fund  does not have more than $10 million in total investor capital.   This type of fund structure is used today by AngelList, an angel  investing platform that connects investors meeting certain income and  asset thresholds with one another so they can pool their money into  special-purpose funds which then invest them in a particular startup  company. Importantly, both the companies and the investors benefit from  this structure.   Compared with making hundreds of smaller direct investments, a  company, for example, only has as a single point of contact, the angel  fund advised by a fiduciary, rather than hundreds of investors who must  all individually approve corporate actions such as mergers and  acquisitions and expanding ownership.   Investors also like this structure because they can delegate  monitoring the startups they invest in to the investment adviser to the  fund. Such monitoring may be significant, considering that investors,  recognizing that most early-stage companies fail, typically diversify  their investments among 30 to 80 companies.   H.R. 1219 reasonably promotes this fund structure for startup  investments by providing a narrowly tailored exemption for certain  venture capital funds which must invest at least 80 percent of their  funds in small businesses. Under the bill, the venture capital funds  must have no more than 250 investors and no more than $10 million in  investor capital, ensuring that they are small enough that investors  are able to monitor and manage their investments.   The bill's limits also ensure that we aren't creating a loophole for  other investment companies, like mutual funds, to avoid regulation; nor  are we providing relief to other private funds, like hedge funds or  private equity funds, that have very little restriction and investor  protection.   Mr. Speaker, too often Congress seeks to help small businesses by  repealing sensible guardrails and rules of the road with little to no  thought of the impact on investors or market integrity. This is a  mistake since it is investors that provide the money necessary for  small businesses to grow. If investors don't trust the markets to  operate fairly, they will decline to invest or raise costs on the very  businesses we want to help. H.R. 1219 is different and reflects a  measured, bipartisan approach to promoting our Nation's startups and  the investors who take a chance on them.   I thank Mr. McHenry and Ms. Velazquez for their leadership on this  bill. I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as  she may consume to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to  the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the ranking  member of the Financial Services Committee's Subcommittee on Capital  Markets, Securities, and Investments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster), a member of the Subcommittee  on Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we have received tremendous support for this  legislation, and we are extremely hopeful that we will be able to come  together on both sides of the aisle and continue to give support to our  small businesses. As a matter of fact, we have a lot of those in the  Congress of the United States--a lot of Members, rather--who talk about  supporting small businesses, but we don't often see real legislation  that can do that. This is such legislation, and I cannot thank Ms.  Velazquez and Mr. McHenry enough for the way that they have worked on  this legislation together.                                time  0945    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record some of the letters of support  that we have received from the Center for American Entrepreneurship,  the Internet Association, TechNet, Angel Capital Association, and  AngelList.                                                          Center for                                       American Entrepreneurship,                                                     April 25, 2016.      Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters: On       behalf of the Center for American Entrepreneurship, I write       today to express our strong support for legislation offered       by Rep. Patrick McHenry: H.R. 4854, the ``Supporting       America's Innovators Act of 2016,'' and H.R. 4855, the ``Fix       Crowdfunding Act of 2016.'' Both bills will significantly       enhance American entrepreneurs' access to the capital they       need to launch and grow new businesses and, in doing so,       accelerate economic growth and job creation.        CAE is a nonpartisan policy and advocacy organization whose       mission is to engage policymakers in Washington and across       the nation regarding the critical importance of entrepreneurs       and start-ups to innovation, economic growth, and job       creation, and to pursue a comprehensive policy agenda       intended to significantly enhance the circumstances for new       business formation, survival, and growth.        As you may know, recent research has demonstrated that       start-ups are disproportionately responsible for the       innovations that drive economic growth and account for       virtually all net new job creation. Alarmingly, recent       research has also demonstrated that, despite impressive       strength in certain cities around the country, rates of new       business formation in America have been declining for 30       years, and the decline is occurring in all 50 states, in all       but a handful of the 360 metro areas examined, and across a       broad range of industry sectors, including high-technology.       Given the importance of thriving entrepreneurship to       innovation, economic growth, and job creation, such       circumstances amount to nothing less than a national       emergency.        When asked or surveyed, entrepreneurs across the country       report that access to sufficient capital on affordable terms       remains among their principal challenges. The legalization of       crowdfunding by way of the Jumpstart Our Business Start-ups       (JOBS) Act in 2012 was a major step forward in meaningfully       enhancing innovators' access to investment capital. But       further reforms are necessary to realize the Act's full       potential to promote entrepreneurship, growth, greater       opportunity, and job creation.        H.R. 4854, the ``Supporting America's Innovators Act''       would amend an exemption  [[Page H2763]]       under the Investment Company Act of 1940 by increasing the       investor limitation from 100 to 500 persons for qualifying       venture capital funds that purchase no more than $10 million       in securities in any one issuer, adjusted for inflation.       Lifting the current arbitrary cap would not only increase       entrepreneurs' access to additional investors, but will       protect investors through a greater diversification of risk.        H.R. 4855, the ``Fix Crowdfunding Act'' would amend the       crowdfunding aspects of the JOBS Act in a number of important       ways:        Raising the annual issuance amount from $1 million to $5       million;         Exempting the beneficial owners of crowdfunding securities       from counting towards the Exchange Act 12(g) requirement       triggering public reporting;        Exempting special purpose vehicles (SPVs) created for the       purpose of investing in a single issuer of crowdfunding       securities from registration as investment companies under       the Investment Company Act, and permitting SPVs considered as       ``venture capital funds'' to offer crowdfunding securities;        Revising the investment cap so that investors earning       $100,000 or less may invest up to 5 percent of their annual       income or net worth, and investors earning more than $100,000       to invest up to 10 percent of their annual income or net       worth;        Defining the requirements for a crowdfunding intermediary       to disqualify an issuer when the intermediary, through a       background check or other means, determines that the issuer       knowingly made untrue statements or omissions related to       material facts, or engaged in fraud;        Defining a crowdfunding intermediary's potential liability       to include only instances when the intermediary knowingly       makes untrue statements or omissions related to material       facts or knowingly engages in fraud;        Permitting an issuer to ``test the waters'' by soliciting       non-binding commitments of interest from potential investors       without filing information with the SEC, provided that no       funds are accepted by the issuer and any material changes       that occur between the solicitation and the offer are       highlighted to potential investors; and,        Providing a 5-year grace period for portals to make a good-      faith effort to comply with all crowdfunding rules, and       prohibits the SEC from bringing any enforcement actions       during that period.        Both bills help strike a more appropriate balance between       the twin priorities of capital formation and investor       protection. In doing so, these reforms significantly enhance       the prospects for new business formation, survival, and       growth at a time when faster economic growth is necessary to       address challenges such as underemployment, stagnant middle-      class wages, the income and wealth gaps, and alarmingly high       levels of poverty and dependence.        CAE commends you for your leadership to promote American       entrepreneurship and innovation and greatly appreciates your       thoughtful consideration of the reforms in H.R. 4854 and H.R.       4855. We look forward to continuing to work with you, the       bills' sponsors, and the Committee's distinguished members on       behalf of American entrepreneurs and start-ups.            Sincerely,                                                Robert E. Litan,                                       Chairman, Center for American      Entrepreneurship.                                   ____                                             Internet Association,                                                      June 10, 2016.      Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters: The       Internet Association appreciates your attention to the issues       impacting startups, and urges support for the Supporting       America's Inventors Act of 2016 (H.R. 4854) and Fix       Crowdfunding Act (H.R. 4855). Both bills are common-sense,       meaningful reforms that will improve startups' access to       capital across the United States. There are a number of       internet based funding platforms that will benefit directly       from this legislation as well as the broader internet       ecosystem.        The Internet Association works to advance policies that       foster innovation, promote economic growth, and empower       people through the free and open internet. Access to capital       funding is critical to internet companies as they scale       innovative business models that now account for six percent,       or nearly $1 billion, of our GDP. Empowering startups through       efficient mechanisms for investors and innovators to access       capital will ultimately grow our economy and help create the       internet industry leaders of tomorrow. The internet industry       is unique in the low barrier to entry for new ideas and       increased competition. Legislation that promotes growth       through internet platforms and for internet startups will       benefit the economy at large.        The Supporting America's Inventors Act of 2016 and Fix       Crowdfunding Act both take common sense steps to empower       innovators through access to capital. The Supporting       America's Inventors Act of 2016 raises the number of       investors permitted in qualifying venture capital funds from       100 to 500 persons, eliminating an arbitrary cap and instead       creating a more efficient environment for investors to grow       startups. The Fix Crowdfunding Act would make necessary       reforms to Title III of the JOBS Act allowing for more       efficient and attractive investment crowdfunding, including       raising the annual limit on issuers and clarifying certain       definitions.        We commend Representative McHenry for his commitment to       create a thriving startup ecosystem by enhancing the       opportunity for investment in our innovation economy. We urge       the Committee to support these bills.            Respectfully Submitted,                                                 Michael Beckerman,      President & CEO.                                   ____                                                          TechNet,                                      Washington, DC, June 10, 2016.      Hon. Patrick McHenry,      House Majority Chief Deputy Whip,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative McHenry: TechNet, the national,       bipartisan network of innovation economy CEOs and senior       executives, is pleased to offer our support for your efforts       to provide American innovators with the tools necessary to       launch, fund, and scale their companies.        In particular, we are pleased to support the Supporting       America's Innovators Act of 2016 (H.R. 4854) and the Fix       Crowdfunding Act (H.R. 4855), both of which provide much       needed reforms to the laws governing early stage financing of       dynamic startups.        The Supporting America's Innovators Act will expand the       pool of investors eligible to participate in venture capital       funds, creating a more robust venture funding marketplace and       increasing the amount of capital startups can potentially       raise.        The Fix Crowdfunding Act contains a number of sensible and       timely reforms to the recently finalized Title III       crowdfunding rules of the JOBS Act. In particular, the       legislation defines the requirements and authority by which       intermediaries can disqualify issuers who make untrue       statements or engage in fraud. The legislation also makes       important reforms that will allow more companies to ``test       the waters'' and solicit non-binding commitments from       potential crowdfunding investors without filing with the       Securities and Exchange Commission. Finally, the legislation       creates a powerful incentive for more crowdfunding portals to       enter the marketplace by providing a 5-year grace period for       portals to make a good-faith effort to comply with all       crowdfunding rules.        Taken together, these bills will expand access to early-      stage funding, improving the process by which innovators       scale their companies and create American jobs.        Thank you for your leadership on these important issues       affecting the innovation economy. TechNet looks forward to       working with you to advance this legislation.        Sincerely,                                                       Linda Moore,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                        Angel Capital Association,                                   Overland Park, KS, March 7, 2017.      Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Hensarling: On behalf of the 13,000 members       of the Angel Capital Association representing accredited       individual angel investors, accredited on-line platforms and       family offices, we write in support of H.R. 1219, Supporting       America's Innovators Act of 2017 sponsored by Reps. Patrick       T. McHenry (R-NC) and Nydia M. Velazquez (D-NY).        Angel investors are directly engaged in supporting American       startup companies and providing much needed early stage       capital and mentoring to emerging businesses and       entrepreneurs. Angel investors invest their capital in new       ways, with many now choosing to pool their money in an angel       fund or syndicate on an online investing platform for       accredited investors. Two of the most well-known are the       Golden Seeds fund which invests nationally in women-led       companies and AngelList, which supports numerous investor       syndicates on its platform. Changes created in the JOBS Act       have allowed angel funds and online platforms of accredited       investors to catalyze investors across the country to support       startups. Platforms such as AngelList, FundersClub and       CircleUp have opened opportunities for entrepreneurs to reach       more investors and have expanded the capital opportunities       for startups.        The ability of these venture funds has been limited by out-      of-date regulations which have restricted these funds to no       more than 99 investors. This 99-investor cap is in reality       more like 90 investors because fund managers need to take       into effect potential splitting of assets in divorce, death       or other unforeseen circumstances.        H.R. 1219 will allow up to 250 accredited investors--      investors with at least $200,000 in minimum income (or       $300,000 for a couple or $1,000,000 in net worth, not       including their residence--to invest in an angel fund or       syndicate with a maximum of $10 million in assets. This       change in legislation will allow more investors to invest in       these venture funds, creating more capital opportunities for       American entrepreneurs and more American jobs.        The Angel Capital Association worked closely with the       Investment Company Institute and other stakeholders to craft       what has become bi-partisan legislation by Representatives       McHenry and Velazquez. We  [[Page H2764]]       urge the Members of the Committee to support this legislation       and seek quick consideration by the broader House of       Representatives.            Sincerely,                                                   Marianne Hudson,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                        AngelList,                                    San Francisco, CA, June 9, 2016.      Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Ranking Member, Committee on Financial Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters: Thank       you for your recent hearings on ``The JOBS Act at Four:       Examining Its Impact and Proposals to Further Enhance Capital       Formation.'' I was honored to testify on the positive impacts       the JOBS Act has had on startup capital formation and the       potential improvements to the JOBS Act.        AngelList helps early stage companies raise financing based       on the statutes laid out in the JOBS Act and subsequent SEC       no-action letters. To date, we have helped over a quarter       billion dollars from accredited investors reach almost one       thousand companies using the online portal provisions to make       such financings much more efficient.        We have learned a great deal about the early stage capital       markets and how they function online. From that perspective,       we believe that several of the bills under consideration       would improve startup financing.        H.R. 4854, the ``Supporting America's Innovators Act of       2016'', lifts the investor limit on LLCs created to finance       companies. One very good outcome of the move online has been       that more investors can invest smaller amounts. This allows       diversification for investors and more access to capital for       companies. However, smaller investors often band together in       a formal vehicle (usually a limited liability company or       LLC). This means the company deals with a single investor       (the LLC) and the investors can rely on a trusted lead to       review the documents and make decisions on behalf of the       investors. The JOBS Act lifted the shareholder limit to       2,000, but left in place the 99 limit on organized investors       that the LLC is subject to. This act lifts that limit to 499       to allow more investors in and more capital be raised by the       companies.        As an online platform, most of our investors expect our       investments to be structured that way, and many angel groups       also form them to invest in startups. We believe this law       allows more sophisticated accredited investor activity.        H.R. 4855, the ``Fix Crowdfunding Act'', takes into account       much of what has been learned in the accredited investor       space in the last 3 years and applies it to the recently       released crowdfunding regulations. There are three areas in       particular this bill addresses that we believe are important.       First, it fixes the so-called ``12g'' problem by which       crowdfunded companies are subject to public reporting       requirements at a very low asset threshold. That issue makes       it difficult for crowdfunded companies to raise subsequent       financing rounds and would dissuade many high growth       companies from using the provision. Fixing that problem makes       it more likely that high growth companies will consider       crowdfunding as an option. Second, the act allows special       purpose vehicles (like those LLCs referred to above in the       paragraph on H.R. 4854) to be used for crowdfunded offerings.       These benefit both investors and the companies. Finally, we       believe the ``test the waters'' provision is critical. Most       companies do not know whether they will be attractive to       investors beforehand; imposing high costs prior to finding       that out serves as a deterrent without any offsetting       investor protection benefit. The ``test the waters''       provision will allow a crowdfunded company to incur the legal       costs only after it knows that it is likely to raise (but       still prior to accepting any investor funds).        Finally, we feel that H.R. 4852, the ``Private Placement       Improvement Act of 2016'' addresses several issues that       affect the startup community. It clarifies that the JOBS Act       was intended to remove burdensome filing requirements that       would be difficult for early stage startups without full-time       lawyers to help. We at AngelList believe transparency has a       very positive effect on markets. We have made several       suggestions in a letter to the SEC (https://www.sec.gov/ comments/s7-06-13/s70613-37.pdf) as to how this can be       achieved without significant burden through use of modern       technology. We believe this act would provide good guidelines       to the SEC about the intent of the JOBS Act in ways that       would encourage that avenue to transparency rather than       additional burden that we do not believe helps investors.        We look forward to engaging where we can to help further       both investor protections and capital formation.            Thank You,                                                        Kevin Laws,                                         Chief Investments Officer.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.  [[Page H2765]]         Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further  requests for time, and I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased that, for the first time this Congress,  committee Republicans have brought to the House floor a bill that has  broad bipartisan support. Oftentimes, the opposite side of the aisle on  our committee take a partisan approach to legislation and sometimes do  not express a lot of interest in the views of the opposite side of the  aisle or the millions of Americans whom they represent. However, in  contrast, this bill before us today is the product of thoughtful,  bipartisan compromise and will help startup companies and their  investors equally. Madam Speaker, this is how laws should be made.   Indeed, last Congress, Mr. McHenry and I worked together to promote  liquidity in the secondary market for startup company stock by creating  a clearer path for startup investors to resell their stock. The result  of our bipartisan efforts was the Reforming Access for Investments in  Startup Enterprises Act, which became law in 2015, along with seven  other bipartisan, financial services bills included in the Fixing  America's Surface Transportation Act.   Going forward, I hope that my friends on the opposite side of the  aisle will remember what we can achieve when we work together. So,  again, I thank both Mr. McHenry for reaching across the aisle and Ms.  Velazquez for working with me on H.R. 1219, the Supporting America's  Innovators Act of 2017. I urge all of my colleagues to join me and vote  ``yes.''   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
