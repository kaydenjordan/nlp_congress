 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor an  extraordinary individual whose legacy has left an unforgettable mark on  eastern North Carolina and the Nation--Dr. Nicholas F. Roberts, Sr.   Recently, we unveiled a historical marker, a testament to the  remarkable life of Dr. Roberts, a man of significant influence. Dr.  Roberts, a Shaw University alumnus, pastor, editor, and public servant,  hailed from the town of Seaboard in Northampton County, North Carolina.   His dedication to education, faith, and community service set a  standard that still inspires us today. I am glad to add that Dr.  Roberts is also the great-grandfather of my esteemed colleague, the  gentleman from Virginia, Representative  Bobby Scott.   As we commemorate Dr. Roberts, let us reflect on the tremendous  impact one individual can have on the community and a nation. His  contributions are a guiding light, reminding us that our community is  only as strong as its people and our future is shaped by those who came  before us.                            ____________________
