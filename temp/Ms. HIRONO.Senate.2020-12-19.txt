 Mr. President, I was absent for the rollcall vote No.  279, on the motion to invoke cloture on Calendar No. 757, the  nomination of Beth Harwell of Tennessee to be a Member of the Board of  Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Had I been present for the  vote, I would have voted nay.                            ____________________
