 Mr. President, today, I will vote to open debate on H.R.  350, the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act.   Should the Senate so proceed, however, I will insist on a thorough  and judicious debate and on a process that empowers Senators to offer  and vote on amendments.   Before I determine whether to support passage of this legislation, I  will weigh that debate, I will consider expert analysis and input from  executive agencies, and I will assess the merits and effects of  amendments that may be considered and adopted.   This legislative process must ensure that Federal law enforcement is  transparent, accountable, and apolitical.   The threat of domestic terrorism is real. The United States must  continue to confront it. We have sworn an oath to defend the  Constitution from all enemies foreign and domestic. We must do so in a  manner informed by objective threat assessments, consistent with our  Constitution, and attentive to civil liberties.   Any time we establish or codify Federal law enforcement offices  tasked with investigating and prosecuting crimes committed by Americans  or collecting and analyzing intelligence related to American citizens,  we must ensure safeguards are sufficiently robust to protect civil  rights and civil liberties. Consideration of such legislation may  present us with an opportunity to assess what Congress got right and  what Congress got wrong in the aftermath of 9/11, when the Department  of Homeland Security was established and Federal counterterrorism  efforts and authorities grew considerably, and to calibrate policy  accordingly.   In short, I vote today to open debate, but I do not yet commit to  voting for passage of this legislation while the process of review,  debate, and potential amendment continues.                                Cloture Motion
