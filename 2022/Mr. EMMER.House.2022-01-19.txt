 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 452, the Willie  O'Ree Congressional Gold Medal Act, and to recognize the incredible  impact that Willie O'Ree has had on the great sport of hockey.   Willie etched his name into the history books in 1958. When he became  one of the select few--and it is a very few--who got called up from the  minors to play in the National Hockey League for the Boston Bruins,  Willie broke down racial barriers for sure. He would go on  [[Page H237]]  to play more than 24 seasons as a professional hockey player, despite  facing countless challenges on and off the ice.    Willie O'Ree remains a trailblazer for many, but his contributions  certainly did not end after his retirement from his playing career in  1979. As we have heard, in 1996, he became the NHL's diversity  ambassador. In this capacity, he established the Hockey is for Everyone  initiative to create a culture of inclusivity and provide an  opportunity for disadvantaged children across this country and North  America to play the game. His work continues even to this day to  reinvigorate and grow the great sport of hockey while setting an  example for underrepresented communities here at home and on an  international level.   As the NHL and teams across the country finally recognized Willie  O'Ree's incredible contributions to hockey, today is Congress'  opportunity to honor a true legend of the game that is loved and  enjoyed by millions.   Remember, we know that hockey was given to us directly from God  because it is played on ice, which can only exist in Heaven.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to co-lead this long overdue effort, and I  urge all my colleagues in the House of Representatives to honor this  icon of our God-given sport by voting ``yes'' on S. 452.
