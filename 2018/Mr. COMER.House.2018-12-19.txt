 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a vote  on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. and Mrs.  Drew and Liz White of Union County, Kentucky, for recently being named  Kentucky Farm Bureau's 2018 Outstanding Young Farm Family. This award  recognizes young farmers between the ages of 18 and 35 who have shown  strong leadership potential and farm management skills and have  achieved consistent financial success in their farming operations.   Drew and Liz come from families with rich histories in farming. Drew  is the fourth generation to live and work on his family's farm,  established by his great-grandfather during the Great Depression. Under  Drew's management, the farm has grown and experienced success with  raising cattle and a multitude of crops.   Liz also grew up on a family farm and enjoyed showing saddlebred  horses during her youth. She worked at a local winery throughout her  high school and college years before becoming an occupational therapy  assistant.   The couple have both been extensively involved in the local  agricultural community through the Future Farmers of America  organization, the 4-H, and the Kentucky Farm Bureau. Their efforts have  not only benefited Union County, but are a model for other young  farmers throughout the Commonwealth.   On behalf of the First District of Kentucky, I congratulate Drew and  Liz White on their outstanding success and wish them the best as they  continue to grow their farming operation and their family.                            ____________________
