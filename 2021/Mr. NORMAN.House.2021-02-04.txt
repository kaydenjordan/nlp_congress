 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  accomplishments and life of a true family man and public servant, Maxy  Hugh Hammond. Maxy was born in Lancaster, South Carolina, on October  19, 1956.   Maxy was from a family that was heavily involved in every facet of  service. His father, Maxy Sr., was very active in serving in the  Lancaster community, having served on the Lancaster School Board and  Lancaster City Council for years and ``whetted the appetite'' for his  son to serve the public, which he did for many years, including serving  on the Lancaster County Council, United Way, Chamber of Commerce,  Rotary Club, Economic Development Board, Boy Scout Council, school  improvement councils, and many more boards and commissions.   Maxy began his work career 45 years ago, including 7 years with the  Catawba nuclear plant; Springs Industries for 12 years, where he worked  in the engineering department; Kanawha Insurance in sales for 15 years;  and vice president of Founders Federal Credit Union for 10 years,  retiring on December 31, 2020.   Maxy has been married for 42 years to Jennifer Starnes Hammond and  has two children, his son, Garrett, and his wife, Elizabeth; and his  daughter, Holly, who is married to Matthew Whitley.   The joys of Maxy and Jennifer's life are their two granddaughters,  Avery Oak, who will be 2 years old in June, and Maryn Reese, who will  be 1 year old in April.   I had the privilege of viewing and listening to a series of  testimonials posted on Facebook about Maxy and what he and his family  have meant to the greater Lancaster community, which included heartfelt  comments by his family, his friends, and his coworkers from all walks  of life.   Those who knew him the best had this to say:   ``Our office is like a six-pack, and Maxy is the plastic ring that  holds our office together.''   ``He never puts himself first. It is about everyone else.''   ``If this building was burning down, he would circle the building two  to three times before worrying about himself.''   ``Maxy doesn't care about titles, accolades, or recognition. It is  all about others.''   ``If Maxy can make everyone else happy, that is all he wants.''   Maxy Hammond is a true public servant who has lived his life for his  God, his family, and his country.   On behalf of the Members of the 117th United States Congress, I wish  you Godspeed in your retirement years as you spend time with your  family and your many friends on the heavenly beaches of the Carolinas.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, here we sit on this fourth day of February  and, here we go, we have a pandemic that is shutting down businesses  all across this country. We have schools shut down, causing havoc with  our children. We have a national debt of over $30 trillion. We have  seniors wondering if their Social Security payment will be suspended  due to anticipated bankruptcy. We have a Democratic Party focusing  today and yesterday on bypassing the legislative process and issuing  executive orders defunding our police departments, destroying our  energy independence by shutting off our production of oil and gas,  allowing men to identify as women and going to any bathroom of choice.   And what is the majority, who are spending the hard-earned tax  dollars, doing today?   Attempting to throw a member of our party, who was duly elected,  because of something purportedly to have been said before she got into  Congress.   Here is what I ask: Throw us all off the committees. Throw all of us  off.   God, I hope the American people see what you are doing and that this  is nothing more than an abuse of power by a party drunk with power.                                time  1730
