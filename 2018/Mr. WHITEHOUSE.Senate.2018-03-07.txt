 Mr. President, I am here for the happy task of moving  a piece of bipartisan legislation that has been cleared on both sides  of the aisle. I am particularly pleased to be doing it in front of the  Presiding Officer because the Presiding Officer and I and Senator  Heitkamp and others worked so hard on the Carbon Capture Utilization  and Storage Act, which provides a means of encouraging carbon capture  technologies to develop. This is a related bill that I joined with  Senator Crapo on to advance. Senator Crapo has been our lead on this  bill. The bill will encourage innovation in the nuclear industry. So it  is a great pleasure for me to be here, and I am very honored that my  distinguished colleague Senator Crapo has joined me on the floor.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the  immediate consideration of Calendar No. 153, S. 97.    Mr. President, it has been the Senator from Idaho  whose leadership has driven this bill forward more than anything else,  and I express my great appreciation to him for the opportunity to work  with him to accomplish this success.   Like Senator Crapo, I want to recognize our colleagues in this  effort, Senators Risch, Booker, Durbin, and Murkowski. I particularly  thank Senator Murkowski because she is the chair of the Senate Energy  Committee, and she and Senator Cantwell together cleared this bill, so  we could bring it to the floor, and gave it the blessing of their  committee.   I also thank Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma, who has been a strong  supporter of our efforts at nuclear modernization, and I ask unanimous  consent that a U.S. News & World Report editorial, which Senator Crapo  wrote with Senator Inhofe, Senator Booker, and me, be printed in the  Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   I thank Senator Alexander from Tennessee--the home of Oak Ridge, the  other National Lab that focuses so much in this area--who has been a  constant advocate and has been very interested in all things nuclear  for a very long time.   This bill, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act, has been  so well summarized by Senator Crapo that I will not go back and  resummarize it, but I will emphasize that it is our intention that it  provide an opening for nuclear innovation into next-generation, third- generation, even fourth-generation nuclear technologies, with the goal  that we can compete effectively internationally to be the producers of  clean and safe nuclear energy, with the hope--and at this point I think  it is somewhere between a hope and a prospect--that this technology  will develop to the point where we can begin to look at our existing  nuclear waste stockpile and use these new technologies to turn  hazardous and dangerous nuclear waste, for which we have no present  plan, into something that is valuable and can help create energy. We  need to work on how to price that because, at present, there is no  mechanism that provides any value to someone who might have a solution  to that problem for lifting this cost off of our books. But that is  something Senator Crapo, Senator Alexander, Senator Inhofe, Senator  Booker, Senator Murkowski, and I can continue to work on. That, I  think, is a really valuable prospect in all of this, and it is one of  the things that moves me to do this.   Let me close by thanking Senator Crapo for also working with me on  NEIMA, the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act, which we  are still working to get passed but which we hope will get passed. It  parallels very nicely with this legislation because what that would do  is get the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to update its permitting  process to accommodate new technologies.   When I am asked what I mean by that, I use a very rough example,  which is that the current light water reactor permitting process makes  about as much sense as the test for these new technologies as taking a  Tesla and having it pass the DMV carburetor requirements. It is a new  technology; it requires a different testing regime. Our other bill  would authorize and require the NRC to update and work with the  innovation community to make sure that when these things are ready for  permitting, permitting is, in fact, ready for them.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:               [From U.S. News & World Report, July 11, 2016]                        The New Nuclear Renaissance      (By Jim Inhofe, Sheldon Whitehouse, Mike Crapo and Cory Booker)         There has been a groundswell of activity and investment in       recent years surrounding advanced nuclear reactors. A dynamic       group of nuclear engineers and scientists are chasing the       future--and racing against China and Russia--to develop       innovative reactor designs. These technologies hold enormous       promise to provide clean, safe, affordable, and reliable       energy, not just for our country, but for the world. These       innovators have a vision for the future, and they charge       ahead backed by more than $1 billion in private capital. The       future of nuclear energy is bright.        Some would argue that we have been here before. In 2005,       Congress passed incentives to encourage a ``nuclear       renaissance'' amid high natural gas prices. The industry       stood ready to build a large number of modern light-water       reactors, improved versions of existing nuclear technology.        But reality fell short of expectations and the result was       only five new nuclear plants, with a price tag of $8 billion       to $10 billion each. Now, in an age of low-cost natural gas,       it is becoming harder for the nearly 100 existing reactors to       compete. The Energy Information Administration calculates       that electricity generation from a new nuclear plant would       cost about 25 percent more than electricity from a new gas-      fired combined-  [[Page S1423]]       cycle power plant. This is causing some nuclear energy       companies to scale back their operations. For instance,       Chicago-based Exelon Corporation announced just a few weeks       ago that it would shutter two of its nuclear plants in       Illinois in the coming years, citing pressure from natural       gas as a major factor.        So this begs the question: Will this new wave of innovative       reactors live up to its promise? Investors think so, and so       do we. For starters, these advanced reactors differ       significantly from their predecessors. Rather than water,       they use materials like molten salt or noble gasses as       coolants. Most are considered ``walk away safe,'' since they       are designed to use the laws of physics, rather than       equipment, to prevent accidents. If a natural disaster       strikes, for instance, these reactors would simply shut down,       substantially reducing the threat of a a meltdown. Many are       designed to be small and modular, so they could be built in       factories with construction costs that are a fraction of       their big, custom-built forerunners. Small reactors could       also be plugged into future micro-grid systems without       requiring extensive transmission infrastructure. Some of       these new reactor technologies could actually help to reduce       the amount of nuclear waste we've accumulated through the       years by using that waste as fuel. That could alleviate a       major challenge facing the industry. And of course, all of       this would be achieved without any air pollution.        Nuclear energy used to be just another partisan issue.       Thankfully, that is changing. The four of us represent       opposite ends of the political spectrum in the Senate, but we       are all pulling in the same direction, backing various pieces       of legislation to promote advanced nuclear innovation and       development. One bill would open the doors of our national       laboratories to entrepreneurs and their innovative new       companies to develop public-private partnerships with the       potential to bring new ideas to market. Another bill looks to       build a sensible regulatory framework to allow diverse       advanced reactor concepts to go from the drawing board to       reality.        These bills have been moving through Congress and are       garnering broad bipartisan support. The Nuclear Energy       Innovation Capabilities Act recently passed the Senate as       part of a bipartisan energy bill, on an 87-4 vote. The       Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act was approved       by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on a 17-      3 vote.        Though we may come to this issue for different reasons, our       end goal is the same. We want to promote new technologies       that provide cleaner energy and get them built by and for       Americans. We can't take a back seat as China and Russia       build test reactors and lure away American innovators. This       new nuclear renaissance is primed for success. It has broad       bipartisan support in Congress, serious private capital       investment and the ability to help address environmental       challenges--all while encouraging American innovation. The       world is heading into a new age of nuclear energy, and the       United States must lead the way.     Mr. President, with great appreciation to Senator  Crapo, the distinguished Senator from Idaho who has been my leader and  partner in all this, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the reason ``I came to speak on the  floor [right now is to talk] about an issue that many in Washington  would prefer to ignore; that is, [the] climate changes that are being  caused by our carbon pollution.''   That is how I began these speeches, with that sentence, on April 18,  2012, from this desk. I have returned week after week to try to make  sure there would not be silence in the Senate on the climate crisis.  This is my 199th weekly foray; next week will make it an even 200.   Back on that April Wednesday in 2012, debate about climate change had  all but died in Congress. Just a few years prior, the House of  Representatives had passed the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill, led by  our colleague, now the Senator from Massachusetts. In this body,  Republican colleagues had openly acknowledged the existence of climate  change and called for legislative action to cut carbon emissions. Since  John Chafee, climate change had been a bipartisan concern.   In 2010, came the Supreme Court's disastrous Citizens United  decision, which allowed the fossil fuel industry to unleash limitless  dark money on our elections. The polluters' money and threats cast a  shadow across any Republican who might work on carbon pollution, and it  ended that bipartisanship.   When I gave that first speech, even the White House had thrown in the  towel on climate change, after letting Waxman-Markey die on the vine.  You couldn't get them to put the words ``climate'' and ``change'' in  the same paragraph, at least not until the President engaged on this  issue in his speech in June of 2013. Washington had gone dark on  climate.   I knew I couldn't match the financial muscle of the big polluters,  but I believed if anything was going to change around here, we would  need to shine a little light on the facts and on the sophisticated  scheme of denial being perpetrated by the polluters. I decided to put  at least my little light to work, and I started these speeches.   The last 6 years, unfortunately, have offered no shortage of bad  climate news and dubious milestones. This chart shows the 4 hottest  years ever recorded have occurred since I began giving these speeches.  Global warming is, of course, driven by the buildup of carbon dioxide  and other greenhouse gases.   When I gave the first ``Time to Wake Up'' speech in April 2012, the  concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was 396 parts per  million. Today, it is at 408. It has never been so high in the history  of the human species. It is not just the carbon dioxide in the  atmosphere that has been rising. So has the sea, as warming seawater  expands and glaciers melt, making our coasts--particularly in my Ocean  State--ever more vulnerable to flooding and storms. The oceans are  becoming more acid, as ocean water reacts chemically with the  heightened carbon concentration in the atmosphere.   During the 6 years I have been giving these speeches, the United  States has experienced more and more extreme weather events, many of  which scientists tell us are linked to climate change: from deadly  storms, including 2012's Hurricane Sandy and 2017's Harvey, Irma, and  Maria, to California's record drought and wildfires, to temperatures so  warm in the Alaskan Arctic that the computer algorithms thought the  thermometer had broken.   In 2017 alone, the string of U.S. extreme weather disasters--six  major hurricanes, wildfires in the West, catastrophic mudslides,  temperature records breaking all over the country--caused well north of  $300 billion in damage and killed more than 300 people. The last 6  years provide us with a menacing preview of things to come.   Scientists, including scientists at all of our home State  universities, say these changes are driven by carbon pollution. Our  national security leaders warn of the increasing danger of  international strife caused by climate change, as well as the threat to  U.S. military facilities and force readiness.   Faith leaders urge us to protect creation and those less fortunate  than we are, led by Pope Francis, who, on this, has been magnificent.  The insurance and credit rating industries, whose business models  depend on accurate and responsible assessment of risk, warn us, as do  major American corporations and leading investors--folks who can't let  climate politics interfere with their bottom lines. I have spoken about  them all.   I also visited States across the country to see for myself and to  talk to people firsthand--folks who know climate change is real because  they see it  [[Page S1430]]  where they live, because they study it. In North Carolina, business  leaders were organizing to protect the local coastal economy from  climate change and associated sea level rise. In South Carolina, tide  gauges in Charleston were up over 10 inches since the 1920s. In  Georgia, I went out on the water with a clammer who showed me how  changes in climate are hurting his livelihood. In Florida, the Army  Corps of Engineers officials in Jacksonville gave a dire presentation  of what the sea level rise portends for the Sunshine State. In Ohio, I  saw the ice cores from faraway glaciers that record our looming climate  catastrophe.   In Utah, the ski resorts fear climate change will ruin their  ``greatest snow on Earth.'' I know the Presiding Officer takes pride in  Utah's greatest snow on Earth. In Pennsylvania, child health  specialists from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia see climate  change worsening children's asthma. In Iowa, Des Moines Water Works was  busy preparing the city for more frequent and severe climate-driven  flooding. In Arizona, they are changing the staffing for emergency  responders facing summer temperatures the human body cannot sustain.  New Hampshire is forecasting that its State bird may no longer be seen  as its range moves ever northward out of New Hampshire on our warming  planet.   I traveled on to Texas, Iowa, Nebraska, Delaware, and more. I brought  stories to this floor from every corner of the country, hoping  colleagues would heed the warnings from their own home States, to match  what I was hearing from Rhode Island, from Rhode Island's coastal towns  and scientists and fishermen: ``Sheldon, it's getting weird out  there,'' I was told. ``It's not my grandfather's ocean.''   Many Democratic colleagues joined me to discuss the changes they see  in their home States, including 30 colleagues who held the floor all  night long in 2014.   In July of 2016, 18 Senators and I took to the Senate floor for days  to expose the fossil fuel-funded front groups that were behind the  campaign to deny climate science and stymie legislative action. There  is a whole carefully built apparatus: phony-baloney front groups that  are designed to look and sound like they are real; messages honed by  public relations experts to sound like they are truthful; scientists on  the fossil fuel payroll whom polluters can trot out as needed.   This industry-fueled misinformation campaign has been a theme of  these speeches. I relayed the findings of researchers who study the  flow of money through the climate denial network and the journalists  who uncovered Exxon's coverup of what they knew of the climate dangers.  I compared the fossil fuel polluter playbook to the fraudulent tactics  of the tobacco industry to bury the truth about the health effects of  cigarettes.   I listened to conservative economists and offered market-based  solutions. Back in March 2013, I described the market failure of carbon  pollution's not being baked into the price of the product. Market  economics doesn't work when corporations can just offload their costs  onto the general public. It is called a negative externality in  economics jargon, and we see it all around us in storm-damaged homes  and flooded cities, in drought-stricken farms and raging wildfires. The  big oil companies and the coal barons have offloaded those costs onto  society.   Virtually every Republican who has thought the climate change problem  through to a solution comes to the same place: put a price on carbon  emissions; let the market work; and return the revenues to the American  public. This concept is supported by a who's who of former Republican  Cabinet officials and Presidential economic advisers. I listened, and,  in November 2014, I introduced with Senator Schatz the American  Opportunity Carbon Fee Act to establish an economywide fee on carbon  dioxide, return all of the revenue to the American public, correct the  market failure, promote energy innovation, and, of course, dramatically  reduce carbon pollution.   I have seen over the years of these speeches that the landscape is  shifting. The Senate has actually held votes that show that a majority  here believes climate change is real, not a hoax, and is driven by  human activity. It took years, but I guess that counts for progress  around here.   Outside of Congress, the Paris Agreement in 2015 committed the  nations of the world to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius by  reducing carbon emissions. America's part was the Clean Power Plan--to  reduce carbon emissions from the power sector by one-third by 2030 from  2005 levels.   Automakers adopted new fuel economy standards for cars and light  trucks in 2012. Vehicles would get nearly 55 miles per gallon by 2025,  saving consumers billions of dollars while eliminating billions of tons  of carbon emissions.   The EPA issued new rules in 2016 to limit the flaring of methane--a  much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide--at oil and gas  wells, and the Obama administration helped negotiate the Kigali  Amendment to phase out the use of hydrofluorocarbons, which have  powerful greenhouse gas heat-trapping properties in the atmosphere.  Secretary Kerry convened wildly successful international oceans  conferences, which are still ongoing and are scheduled for years ahead,  to address the warming and the acidification of the seas.   In sum, up through 2016, even if Congress had been trapped in fossil  fuel muck, the United States had still been making slow but steady  progress on climate policy. Then Trump was elected President, and he  decided to see if he could reverse all of this.   He announced that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris  Agreement. He put the three stooges of fossil fuel--Scott Pruitt, Ryan  Zinke, and Rick Perry--in charge of climate policy. Trump completely  forgot his and his family's own words from a full-page New York Times  advertisement in 2009, calling climate change ``irrefutable'' and  portending ``catastrophic and irreversible consequences.'' That was  Donald Trump and his family in 2009.   As bad as the news became coming out of Washington, we saw action  around the country to give us some reason for optimism. The leadership  void left by the Trump administration was filled by State and local  governments, businesses, academic institutions, and faith organizations  which pledged to honor the Paris Agreement. California and Washington  State joined with Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Mexico to  announce a plan to put a price on carbon that would reach virtually up  and down the entire west coast of the Americas.   Over management opposition, BlackRock, the great investment firm,  helped force ExxonMobil to report its climate risk to its shareholders.  Moody's announced it will start using climate risk in rating the bonds  of coastal communities. Companies like Microsoft and Unilever adopted  an internal carbon price to help them reduce the carbon intensity of  their operations.   At heart, this is a battle of truth versus lies, and courts are a  good forum for the truth. California municipalities as well as New York  City have sued fossil fuel companies, under State law, over the huge  adaptation costs they will have to bear from sea level rise and extreme  weather. The State attorneys general in Massachusetts and New York are  pursuing a fraud investigation into what ExxonMobil has been covering  up about its fossil fuels.   So there you have it. Over the last 6 years, we are ever more aware  of the accelerating pace of climate change and ever more aware of the  terrible threat that rising seas, increased temperatures, and more  frequent extreme weather events pose. It has become harder and harder  for the fossil fuel industry and the web of front groups and Trump  administration officials who do its bidding to claim there is nothing  to see here, folks, that it is all a hoax, and to move along.   Yet, despite all of the information and all of the evidence, this  great institution--the U.S. Senate--continues to sit silent, paralyzed  by the threats of retribution that come from the fossil fuel lobby.  When this started, I had hoped we would never get to 100--let alone  199--of these speeches. We ought to have solved this years ago. It is a  disgrace that we haven't, and it is a disgrace as to why we haven't. If  we remain as ineffective as we have been during the last 6 years, we  will have failed ourselves and all future generations.   America deserves better than this. A city on a hill, with the eyes of  the  [[Page S1431]]  world upon it, can ill afford to ignore such a problem--worse still  when the reason is one all-powerful industry that demands obedience.  America deserves better. The countries and people around the world who  rely on and look to American leadership deserve better. At long last,  it is time for us to wake up here and meet our responsibilities.                           Nuclear Innovation Bill    Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Natural  Resources Committee has come to the floor. While she is here, may I  thank her for her work in clearing the nuclear innovation bill that  Senator Crapo and I passed into law this afternoon by unanimous  consent. The chairman's work, along with the ranking member's, in  clearing that bill was essential to getting it passed, and she was a  cosponsor and a critical force in getting it done. I am grateful to  her.   I yield the floor.
