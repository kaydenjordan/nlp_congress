 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, through their work, inspectors general help improve  government efficiency and effectiveness. Their nonpartisan audits and  investigations work to root out waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement  in all Federal agencies. In fact, the Committee on Oversight and Reform  and IGs have this common mission, but IGs occupy a unique spot within  the Federal Government. They have a responsibility to their respective  agency and to Congress through the notice requirements.   When the political parties of the executive branch and Congress are  different, political fights can understandably erupt. Unfortunately,  this has recently led to a politicization of IG investigations.   That takes us to today's bill. Many provisions in this bill are a  step in the right direction to empower IGs to conduct robust oversight.  However, I remain concerned about some of the provisions in this bill.   Title I in this bill would unnecessarily constrain the President's  ability to remove an IG, shifting the delicate balance between the  executive branch and Congress. Maintaining the current balance would  enable Congress to use its own oversight authority if it believes there  is wrongdoing by the President or an agency head in the removal of an  IG.   Next, in title III, the majority has proposed to dramatically limit  who can be appointed as an acting inspector general if the IG has  voluntarily left office or been removed. In doing so, this hinders the  President's ability to appoint an IG with whom they have confidence.   While there are legitimate concerns about IGs serving at multiple  agencies, this provision goes too far in limiting the President's  authority over a subset of executive branch employees.   Finally, I have serious concerns with title V, the provision  authorizing an inspector general to issue testimonial subpoena  authorities to compel testimony from former Federal employees.   While it may be helpful for IGs to investigate certain allegations of  misconduct, it also provides IGs with a tool that can be easily abused  for political purposes. For example, this authority would enable new  Biden-appointed inspectors general to subpoena former Trump  administration officials under the guise of any investigation,  regardless of the real purpose for the investigation.   Finally, this provision does not provide the necessary protections  for former Federal employees who may be subjected to the legal fees of  dealing with a subpoena, instead forcing them to pay for counsel to  defend against and respond to these subpoenas. Without meaningful  protections to ensure that testimonial subpoena authority would not be  used to seek out political retribution, I cannot support this  provision.   Rooting out waste, fraud, abuse, mismanagement, and misconduct is one  of  [[Page H3281]]  the most important jobs of this committee, and inspectors general serve  on the front lines with us in this mission. We must ensure that all of  our inspectors general have the tools they need to conduct robust  oversight of their respective agencies.   That is why committee Republicans offered multiple amendments at the  markup to address these concerns but still empower our IGs. We again  offered compromise amendments at the Rules Committee yesterday, but my  Democrat colleagues have only allowed one of these amendments to be  made in order.   I am hopeful that Democrats will take the opportunity to pass a major  bipartisan bill by adopting this amendment. If they choose to continue  down their partisan path, I hope my Democrat colleagues can stop the  repeated attacks on the Trump administration.   Instead, we should focus on ensuring our inspectors general are  focused on and equipped to conduct robust oversight over agency  operations and spending.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am excited to listen to the enthusiasm from my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle and their newfound passion  for oversight. The Republicans on the Oversight Committee have been  asking for many hearings on many different areas of potential  oversight, potential waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement in the  Federal Government. But thus far, in this new Congress, my friends on  the other side of the aisle have only been interested in oversight of  the previous administration.  [[Page H3283]]    I am getting really excited for the taxpayers of America because I  feel like, today, I am hearing that my friends on the other side of the  aisle are interested in ensuring that there is good government, that we  have transparency.   One thing that I would like to mention in this bill is that the  Oversight Committee is responsible for oversight, and we want to work  with the inspectors general. We have a lot of agreement in this bill,  and I will talk about that during my closing remarks. But I do believe  there is the potential for us to compromise and have a bipartisan bill  that actually might have a chance to become law down the hall.   But I hope that this newfound enthusiasm for oversight will carry  over, and we can do what the Oversight Committee is supposed to do and  not rely as heavily on unelected bureaucrats.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Just a couple of things I want to make sure that everyone understands  with respect to this bill. This bill is a combination of 10 different  bills. Republicans support seven of the 10 bills. Seven of the 10 bills  we could pass pretty close to unanimously in this Chamber that would  strengthen the IGs and not hamper a President's ability to terminate an  IG that may not agree with their ideology.   No one in Congress would hire a staffer that adamantly opposed their  ideology. No one in the private sector would have a staffer be a  spokesperson or an employee that fundamentally disagreed with the  direction that person wanted to lead their company. And the same should  be true with the President of the United States.   With respect to President Trump's termination of inspectors general,  I want to mention a couple of terminations that the President did.  President Trump removed the Intelligence Community Inspector General  Michael Atkinson because he flaunted strict whistleblower procedures to  provide the Ukraine whistleblower report to Chairman Schiff.   Now, we support good government. We want to protect whistleblowers.  We want to encourage whistleblowers to come forward. Adam Schiff did  more to damage prospective whistleblowers than any Member of this body.  And the IG was complicit with him in that. That was a rightful  termination by President Trump.   Acting Inspector General Christi Grimm purposely released an outdated  and misleading report claiming there were shortages of medical  equipment at hospitals which was found to be entirely inaccurate and  likely was politically motivated. That is why President Trump  terminated her.   So there are examples of a President rightfully terminating an  inspector general, and I don't think that this bill is the right path  to move forward. This is overlegislating.   We are passing a lot of bills out of this Chamber that are dead upon  arrival in the Senate. When we pass a bill that has bipartisan support,  that makes a difference in the Senate. We  [[Page H3284]]  could achieve that, and I have an amendment that goes a long way  towards making this bill bipartisan.   So with respect to oversight, I think the American people are upset  over COVID-19. Speaker Pelosi created a Select Committee on the  Coronavirus Crisis, which is a subsidiary of the House Oversight  Committee, we share the same staff. We have been asking for hearings on  the origins of COVID-19 and had no response, no luck from my friends  across the aisle, so we had a hearing today. We had a forum. And it was  very productive. And I think the people of America appreciated that.  That is oversight.   So our committee can go a lot further with respect to oversight, and  I think that we could come to a bipartisan compromise to strengthen the  IGs without politicizing the IGs, without hampering a President's  ability to get rid of a bad IG.   I strongly oppose this bill. I hope through the amendment process it  can get better, that it can pass in a bipartisan manner, and we can  strengthen the IGs, and we can send a message to the Senate that we  have a bipartisan bill that you should take up and President Biden can  hopefully sign into law.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the amendments en bloc.   Madam Speaker, some of the amendments in the proposed package attempt  to be helpful and improve the bill, but most are just Band-Aids  attempting to cover up flawed provisions.   For example, one amendment attempts to paper over the flaws in title  I by expanding the requirement for the President to provide his or her  rationale to Congress detailing why an IG was removed.   Yes, understanding the President's rationale for removing an IG is  very important to Congress. This amendment, however, fails to address  the fundamental issue in the section, specifically limiting the reasons  for an IG's removal or transferred to only nine constraining reasons.   Another provision in this package seeks to amend title II, but title  II already passed earlier this Congress as a standalone bill by voice  vote under suspension. This amendment to title II would undermine that  broadly supported bill by creating an easy-to-abuse loophole for a  President to remove an IG immediately, rather than waiting the 30 days  for Congress to review the required notice of removal.   My Democrat colleagues have stated constantly that the goal of their  legislation is to ensure that it is incredibly difficult to remove an  IG, yet they support an amendment that would gut this and allow our  President to circumvent the will of Congress. This is what happens when  the majority decides to go it alone rather than seeking to work  together to craft strong bipartisan legislation.   This bloc of amendments is the perfect analog for this legislation-- many good provisions mixed with a few poison bills, which undermine the  intent of the legislation as a whole. Therefore, I must ask my  colleagues to vote against this package of amendments.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Speaker, this amendment strips out the three  provisions of this legislation that do not have bipartisan support in  order for the IG Independence and Empowerment Act to move forward with  the full support of the U.S. House. Both sides of the aisle can then  come back to the table to fix the remaining provisions in a manner that  addresses concerns on both sides of the aisle.   Specifically, my amendment strikes title I, which would artificially  constrain the President from removing or reassigning an IG to one of  nine specific reasons listed in the provision.   As drafted, title I would have the effect of prohibiting a President  from removing an IG who is acting in bad faith and undermining a duly  elected President's policies in a purely partisan manner.   My amendment also strikes title III, which strictly limits who the  President could name as the acting inspector general to the ``first  assistant.'' This provision does not include any commonsense  exceptions, creating unintended consequences.   For example, it could elevate an individual to acting IG who may be  engaged in the same misconduct which caused the original IG to have  been removed.   Lastly, my amendment strikes title V of the bill, which grants  inspectors general the authority to issue subpoenas to compel the  testimony of former Federal officials, including political appointees.   While I support granting IGs testimonial subpoena authority, the  current provision lacks necessary safeguards and could result in it  being used in a politically abusive manner.   Madam Speaker, I support the goals behind these provisions, as well  as the other seven titles of the bill, which have strong bipartisan  support. However, my amendment addresses the problematic language in  these three sections. That is why I ask my Republican and Democrat  colleagues to pass this amendment to enable us to negotiate a  bipartisan solution for the inspector general community that can be  signed into law.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The  SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 8,  the yeas and nays are ordered.   Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question  are postponed.                                time  1745    Amendments En Bloc Offered by Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney of New York
