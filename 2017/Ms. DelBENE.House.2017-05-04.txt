 Mr. Speaker, this destructive legislation hurts middle  class families and threatens massive disruption to our healthcare  system. And it has only gone from bad to worse.   Stripping protections from 133 million Americans with preexisting  conditions isn't just wrong, it is inhumane. Nobody in this country  should go bankrupt trying to afford the medical care they need to stay  alive.   This isn't about politics; it is about human decency and who we are  as Americans. It is about people like Jackie, a cancer survivor from  Snohomish who says the Affordable Care Act saved her life.   She wrote to me saying: ``My cancer recurred, but I was covered. I  was able to complete my treatments without having to worry about how to  put food on the table. Or being left to die. Because of the ACA, I  survived.''   We all have stories like this in our districts, but some of my  colleagues aren't listening. I hope they find the courage and the  wisdom to vote ``no'' on this dangerous legislation.
