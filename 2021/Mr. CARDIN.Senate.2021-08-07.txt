 Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Restaurant  Revitalization Fund, and then I will be asking unanimous consent to  consider legislation.   We included the Restaurant Revitalization Fund in our March  legislation on COVID relief. We did that because, of all of the  industries affected by COVID-19, restaurants have been some of the most  difficult businesses to survive COVID-19.   They were ordered by government, basically, to shut down at the  beginning of COVID-19. Then, as we started  [[Page S6008]]  to make progress, they were at much restricted operations. And to this  day, restaurants are still not up to their full capacity. Their  revenues have been very much decimated as a result of COVID-19.   We came together in March with bipartisan legislation in order to do  something about that, and we included that in our legislation--$28.6  billion of relief for restaurants. Now, what it did is cover some of  their revenue loss as a result of COVID-19. It gave them a lifeline to  be able to survive this pandemic.   We projected that $28.6 billion would be the need, but we were wrong.  We were wrong because COVID-19 was more severe than we thought,  restaurants were more badly damaged than we had anticipated, and there  was a great deal of more demand and need than the $28.6 billion. We are  now being told by the Small Business Administration that the right  number was $71.3 billion, or an additional $42.7 billion that is  needed.   I have introduced bipartisan legislation to provide this additional  authority to the SBA to complete this program. It is bipartisan. My  partner in this is Senator Wicker. We are joined by Senator Schumer,  Senator Murkowski, Senator Cantwell, Senator Ernst, Senator Sinema,  Senator Cassidy, Senator Stabenow, and Senator Hyde-Smith. And I might  add, there are many, many more Senators on both sides of the aisle who  very much support our efforts to live up to our commitment.   Now, why do we need to take this up right now?   This is a matter of life or death for many restaurants in our  community. There is also a matter of fairness.   We have two restaurants, side by side, in the exact same  circumstances, submitting their applications on the same day, having  the exact same need. Both were advised that they will get funding. One  got funding before the $28.6 billion was exhausted. The other that was  told they were going to get funding, they won't get funding unless we  act. That is not right.   There is a matter of the credibility of the U.S. Senate and of  Congress and of government. We say we are going to do something. We  should live up to our commitments. The urgency of getting this done is  now.   I don't think there is a Senator in this Chamber who hasn't heard  from restaurants in their State about how badly they need these funds  and how they thought these funds were going to be in their bank, and  they are no longer in the bank. I have heard from so many Senators  about this. The urgency is now.   Let me just anticipate one other argument that I might hear, and that  is: Well, where are we getting this money from?   Well, legislation before us takes $36 billion out of the small  business programs--$36 billion. So this is paid for by the rescissions  that have been made in this legislation that we are considering, that  is before us today. So for all of those reasons, this is a fiscally  responsible thing to do.   Lastly, before I yield the floor to the majority leader, let me say  that we made a commitment to help our small businesses. We did that-- Democrats and Republicans--working together. In some cases we  overestimated the dollars that we need. In some cases we underestimated  the dollars that we need. But we always came back and provided the full  funding for the programs we have authorized, and, in total, it is not  much different than has previously been authorized.   This is a matter of fairness and a matter of absolute need that we  provide the extra money now for the restaurants.   Before I make my unanimous consent request, I would yield the floor  so the majority leader can get the floor.    Mr. President, let me thank Senator Schumer for his  comments. I agree completely with everything the Senator said.   I would just make one additional point before I make my unanimous  consent request.   What I am asking for now has been what we have been following in  regard to small business relief. Let me remind our colleagues that we  work together, Democrats and Republicans, to craft the programs that  help small business and save so many small businesses in our community.   We misprojected the costs of the Paycheck Protection Program, not by  $30 or $40 billion, by over $300 billion when we set it up. And we came  back, Democrats and Republicans lived up to our commitment and made the  funds available that all small businesses could get fair treatment and  equitable treatment under the Paycheck Protection Program.   I am asking my colleagues to do the exact same thing we did for the  Paycheck Protection Program for the Restaurant Revitalization Program.   And as already has been pointed out, there have been funds taken away  from the small business programs under the bill we are considering on  the floor today to almost the same amount that we are asking in  supplemental funds.   With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2675 introduced earlier  today; that the bill be considered read three times and passed; and the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President.    Mr. President, I regret the decision of my colleague from  Kentucky.   I just really want to point out, we have had hearings in our  committee--Small Business Committee--in which the Restaurant  Revitalization Act was very much brought up during the hearing.   We have been receiving timely information about this program and how  it has been implemented and the need for additional funds. So our  committee has had ample opportunity to question how the program was  being administered and the need for different funds.   I also regret that my colleague is holding the restaurants pretty  much hostage and saying it is all right for us to give money to some  but not others, when the administration of this was compromised because  of a court case, and certain restaurants are now desperate as a result  of not having adequate funds.   I am encouraged by the comments of the majority leader, Senator  Schumer, that we will continue to focus on this issue. I can tell you,  it is urgent. We really need to deal with this immediately, and we will  be looking for every available opportunity to treat our restaurants  equitably and fairly and provide the money that is needed to implement  the Restaurant Revitalization Program.   I regret that we are not able to act today because of the Senator's  objection.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, my State of Maryland has a proud history  of innovation in satellite technology and space exploration. Greenbelt,  MD, is home to Goddard, the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration's first Space Flight Center Space Flight Center. The  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which operates a fleet  of weather satellites, has its headquarters in Silver Spring.  Additionally, the largest provider of residential satellite broadband  service, Hughes Network Systems, is headquartered in Germantown. Hughes  serves consumers in some of the most rural, hard-to-reach areas of the  country.   As the Senate considers the bipartisan infrastructure bill, I believe  there is broad agreement that the broadband deployment grants  established by the bill and administered by the Department of Commerce  would help bring broadband service to unserved and underserved  households in some of the most rural areas in the U.S. I also believe  that satellite technology can and should be one of the technological  options for achieving our broadband deployment goals. Because a geo- stationary satellite orbits at 22,500 miles above earth, however, even  signals traveling at the speed of light take a split-second longer to  reach their destination, causing ``latency''--or delay--in real-time  broadband applications. Fortunately, satellite innovators in Maryland  and elsewhere have designed measures to reduce latency by using a mix  of communications platforms, including low-earth orbit satellites and  fixed wireless networks.   I believe that where the broadband grants provision in division F,  title I of the infrastructure bill establishes a ``real-time,  interactive'' standard for permissible latency, residential satellite  broadband service providers may meet this standard by offering a hybrid  mix of geostationary and nongeostationary satellite networks or fixed  [[Page S6011]]  wireless networks. I look forward to working with Senator Cantwell in  her capacity as chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, Commerce  Secretary Raimondo, and the National Telecommunications and Information  Administration on this important issue.                            ____________________
