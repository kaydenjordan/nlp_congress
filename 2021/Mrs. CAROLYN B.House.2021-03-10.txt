 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, more than 90  percent of Americans support universal background checks for those  purchasing guns. Today, I urge my colleagues to do the same by  supporting H.R. 8 and H.R. 1446. These bills will keep guns out of the  hands of those who aren't allowed to have them in the first place.   For years, I have introduced a bill to prevent people from skirting  the background check process by purchasing guns at gun shows, and I am  very glad that H.R. 8 accomplishes this. If you can't buy a gun from a  licensed dealer, you shouldn't be able to buy a gun anywhere,  especially at a gun show.   H.R. 1446 closes the Charleston loophole, which allows individuals to  buy guns before their background check is completed. Ensuring community  safety shouldn't have a 72-hour clock.   With gun deaths and gun sales surging in 2020, we must act now to  close these loopholes and meaningfully combat gun violence.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on these two votes today.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support  this bill. The Oversight Committee, which I chair, is responsible for  the provisions in this package that provide funding to States, local  governments, Tribes, and territories.   When we began our work, hundreds upon hundreds of community leaders  reached out to us asking for help. They told us the relief in this bill  would mean recovery instead of recession. Democrats answered that call,  and, today, we are delivering $362 billion in dedicated aid to cities  and localities across this Nation, and they need it.   1.4 million essential workers have already been laid off due to State  and local budget shortfalls that threaten the very fabric of our  society.   This relief means that our first responders, our teachers, transit  workers, sanitation workers, other public servants, everybody who is  working continue serving our children, helping our neighbors, and  protecting our communities as we see the fight against the pandemic  through to the end.   This bill will provide local governments dedicated support for the  first time since the pandemic struck. It can be used for vaccines,  increased testing, and countless jobs. Cities and States across this  Nation have lost billions in expected tax revenue. This bill helps.   The Oversight Committee also delivered a provision providing  emergency paid leave for Federal employees to prevent the spread of the  virus, as well as critical oversight prevention to ensure transparency  of this full $1.9 trillion package.   The American Rescue Plan will rebuild our pandemic-torn Nation from  the ground up and stronger than ever. Everybody should vote for this  bill.
