 I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) is  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, last week, something happened here in the  Capitol which was unique. I am not sure it has ever happened before. It  was reported that an anonymous group of Capitol Police officers  published an open letter to Members of Congress.   I have been here a few years. I never heard of anything quite like  this. Here is what these Capitol Police officers, who are entrusted  with the responsibility of keeping us safe in the Capitol, wrote: ``On  Jan 6th where some officers served their last day in US Capitol Police  uniform, and not by choice, we would hope that Members whom we took an  oath to protect, would at the very minimum support an investigation to  get to the bottom of EVERYONE responsible and hold them 100 percent  accountable no matter the title of position they hold or held.''   A challenge from the Capitol Police to the Members of Congress not to  sweep under the carpet January 6 but to get to the bottom of it.  Capitol policemen were attacked and died as a result of that  insurrectionist mob on January 6, and these officers, who risk their  lives every day for us, are begging us not to ignore what happened.   Yesterday, in POLITICO, the mother of fallen Capitol Police Officer  Brian Sicknick wrote: ``Not having a January 6 Commission to look into  exactly what occurred is a slap in the faces of all the officers who  did their jobs that day.''   I met Gladys Sicknick when the memorial to her son was held in the  Rotunda. I talked to her and her husband about their son, how they were  worried when he decided to become a policeman, but they thought at  least if he worked in the U.S. Capitol, it is a pretty safe assignment.  Well, he died the day after January 6, many believe from complications  which occurred in the attacks of that day.   To Gladys Sicknick, to the Sicknick family, to all of our Capitol  Police officers to whom we entrust our lives every day, and to the  members of the DC Metro Police and the other heroes who defended the  Capitol on January 6, I say: We hear you, and you deserve justice.   It is hard to believe that before we adjourn today, we are likely to  consider a January 6 Commission proposal that is doomed to fail.  Imagine, the worst attack on this building since the War of 1812, and  sadly, it has become a  [[Page S3853]]  partisan issue. It is my understanding because of his public  announcement that Senator McConnell is going to oppose it, and I  understand that his caucus will follow his lead.   It is hard to imagine what is going on in the U.S. Congress these  days.   Earlier this week, a Member of the House of Representatives--I am  afraid she is already notorious for her inflammatory rhetoric--likened  coronavirus masking guidelines to the Holocaust--the Holocaust. I feel  no need to point out the absurdity, if not the anti-Semitic nature of  such a comparison, but I do want to point out that that comparison was  made by one of the lawmakers who were party to the January 6  insurrection attack on the Capitol.   The day before the insurrection, that same Congresswoman, a  Republican Congresswoman, tweeted: ``Tomorrow is an important day in  American history. The people will remember the Patriots who stood for  election integrity. Let's go #FightForTrump!''   And fight they did.   I remember being in the Chamber that day. I still remember the sound  of rioters banging on the doors and windows of this building, the sight  of hundreds of them lined up outside, the disgusting display of  Confederate flags. And the violence we saw that left 5 people dead and  139 law enforcement officers attacked.   So many shocking sights on January 6, 2021--a gallows was erected on  the Capitol lawn and rioters attacking police officers with flagpoles  bearing American flags or Trump flags.   One of the most painful images--and I am sure it was more painful to  some than even to me--is a photo of a middle-age White man standing in  the halls of our Capitol wearing a sweatshirt that read ``Camp  Auschwitz.'' Below those repugnant words was another set of words:  ``Work makes you free.'' That cruel slogan was emblazoned atop the  black iron gates in Germany leading into the Auschwitz concentration  camp. And one of the rioters--mobsters--on January 6 in the U.S.  Capitol boldly wore that shirt.   These are the people who stormed the Capitol on January 6. They  weren't Patriots by any measure. Included in their ranks were neo- Nazis, White supremacists, and clear enemies of the United States. They  were incited by the former President of the United States, Donald  Trump, at a rally earlier that day, and his allies in Congress, like  that Congresswoman I mentioned earlier, were party to the incitement as  well.   I agree with those who have said that an insurrection without  consequences--without even an examination--is a dress rehearsal for the  next insurrection. That is why we cannot sweep January 6 and the events  that led to it under the rug.   Incendiary rhetoric, especially from the mouths or the keyboards of  elected officials, has a cost.   Comparing mask requirements in a pandemic to the Holocaust has a cost  as well. It belittles the worst genocide in the history of the world.  And it encourages the kinds of anti-Semitic attacks we have seen in  recent days and weeks, like the vandalism in my home State at the  synagogue in Skokie, IL.   Baselessly claiming that the Presidential election of last year was  stolen and repeating that lie has a cost. It undermines the faith in  our government and legitimizes a radical, anti-government movement that  aims to overthrow this government.   It is time for us to tally up the costs, understand how the January 6  attack on our democracy happened and who incited it, and that  investigation should not be a matter of controversy. It is part of our  obligation, is it not? By our oath of office to defend this  Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic? Future generations  are counting on us to record in detail what did happen on January 6.  And we ought to do it on a bipartisan basis.   But why is it necessary? With all of the videotapes and all of the  photos and all of the statements of 400-plus people already arrested,  why do we need to keep asking questions about that day? Because just 2  weeks ago, two different Republican Congressmen proclaimed that those  who were in the Capitol that day were somehow peaceful patriots. That  was the phrase that was used--peaceful patriots. Another one talked  about them and believed the videotapes proved they were just orderly  tourists--orderly tourists. Attacking police officers; five people  died; crashing through the windows and doors; breaking down offices;  desecrating this Chamber with their antics captured on videotape, and  we have all seen them. Orderly tourists? Not by any measure.   We ought to investigate this on a bipartisan basis. Several  Republican Senators have agreed. Thirty-five Members of the House  Republican caucus thought so as well. Surely, all of us can appreciate  the importance of working together to investigate why, for the first  time in history, America was challenged when we were in the process of  the peaceful transfer of power.    Here is the thing that I don't understand. Several of us in  leadership were asked to leave the Capitol complex and go to a separate  place. The identity of that location is kept confidential and private.  But it was an interesting gathering of Democratic and Republican  leaders in the wake of the January 6 insurrection which was underway as  we were taken to the separate location.   And I looked around at the Democratic as well as the Republican  leaders from the Senate and the House who were gathered, and it was  clear to me--they say they felt the same feelings of anger and outrage  that this mob had desecrated this building. And they were determined-- we were all determined--that the mob would not have the last word. We  were determined to return to this Capitol that same day and finish our  work counting the electoral college votes that declared Joe Biden  President of the United States.   Calls were being made in every direction to police, to the military,  to political leaders: Resecure this Capitol. Make certain that you  remove those people who were responsible for the violence and  insurrection we have seen. Let us get back to our work. Let us prove to  the American people that the mob didn't have the last word.   I saw that bipartisan determination, and I felt damn good about it.  Of all the differences we have had, of all the debate we have had,  January 6, that afternoon, Democratic and Republican leaders were  standing shoulder to shoulder, passing cellphones back and forth, and  speaking to our leaders, talking about getting back into this Capitol  and throwing that mob out. And it happened.   By 8 o'clock that evening, we were back on the floor of the U.S.  Senate. By 2:30, we were gone, racing through the exit doors. At 8  o'clock, we were back to prove that they didn't have the last word.  But, sadly, we know now they may have the last word because the call  for a bipartisan commission to investigate this January 6 event and to  put on the record exactly what happened is being opposed on a partisan  basis.   There ought to be 100 Senate votes for investigating this attack and  making a clear record for history so that those who mock the danger of  the moment by calling this mob a peaceful, patriotic mob, or calling  the members orderly tourists don't have the last word; yet we may not  even have 60 votes today when the measure is called. Why? Let's get  down to basics here.   Many of the Republican Members are afraid of the man who incited this  mob. They are afraid of the former President and what he will say of  them if we call for an investigation. They are afraid of Donald Trump.  As a result, they are refusing to let this Commission move forward. Are  they worried that this investigation into what happened on January 6  will hurt Republicans in next year's election? I think the position  they are taking opposing an investigation will hurt them.   The events of that date are not fodder for political campaigns,  really. They are a stain on our history. If we ignore them or allow the  history of that day to be rewritten by deniers, shame on them.   The events of January 6 deserve and demand careful, thorough, and  principled examination. That is why the independent Commission we are  proposing is modeled after the same investigatory body that was created  after  9/11. It will be led by 10 commissioners, evenly divided between  Democrats and Republicans. Together, they would be called on to produce  a definitive account of what happened and led to January 6, 2021. This  is not an opportunity to score political points; it is an opportunity  to score national unity and reconciliation.  [[Page S3854]]    When Senator McConnell, the Republican Senate leader, announced his  opposition to this Commission last week, he said: ``It's not at all  clear what new facts or additional investigation yet another commission  can lay on top of the existing efforts by law enforcement and  Congress.''   My response to Senator McConnell is this, respectfully: The public  servants who lead this Commission will be charged with a different set  of responsibilities than law enforcement and Members of Congress. The  investigations being led by intelligence officials and members of law  enforcement are criminal investigations. They will determine how the  individuals who participated in the insurrection should be held legally  accountable. And the ongoing investigation in Congress have largely  been focused on our government's response to the violence of January 6,  not to what provoked it.   The Commission we are considering today is different. It will be  comprehensive by design, evenly divided on a partisan basis. It will  examine all of the factors that inspired that riotous mob. And this  Commission isn't just about uncovering truth. It goes back to the point  I made opening this statement. This Commission is designed to honor the  police officers who defended us and defended this Capitol on January 6,  some of whom gave their lives in the process.   That letter from the police officers to us is a reminder that we owe  them the same loyalty and the same dedication they give to us every  single day. Dismissing this January 6 Commission and the gravity of  this responsibility, sadly, does not honor the police officers who are  prepared to give their lives for us every single day.   Here is a chance for my Republican colleagues to prove that they  really care about law enforcement. So many speeches on the floor of the  Senate in the last several weeks have derided and criticized people for  calling on defunding the police. Well, I would tell them that the  failure to create a Commission to objectively determine what happened  when so many of our police officers were attacked on January 6, that  doesn't defund the police; failing to create that Commission, sadly,  defames them. And that is unacceptable by any standard.   Isn't it time we stand with the police officers and their request for  this Commission? Isn't it time we make sure that heroes like Brian  Sicknick and his family know that he did not die in vain? He paid the  ultimate sacrifice to protect us. Let's honor it by supporting the  creation of an independent Commission. His family, and all of America,  deserve nothing less than the truth                                 Memorial Day    Mr. PRESIDENT, this Memorial Day weekend, we pause to remember and  honor the patriots who paid for our freedoms with their lives. They  fell in battles from Bunker Hill to the Bulge to Baghdad. Today, they  are laid to rest throughout the world--from national cemeteries and  other hallowed grounds in America to the cliffs of Normandy and far  beyond.   Nearly 20 years ago, a new generation of American service members  went off to fight a war in an ancient land. They traveled to  Afghanistan to hunt down the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks and the  government that had given him sanctuary. Few imagined then that  Afghanistan would become America's longest war.   There are Americans serving today in Afghanistan who were not yet  born on 9/11. There are veterans who served in Afghanistan in the early  years who have seen their own children go off to fight in that war.   President Biden recently announced the last U.S. troops in  Afghanistan will be home by September 11th--the 20th anniversary of the  terrorist attacks on America that spurred the war.   I support the President's decision. While there are legitimate  concerns about protecting social gains made in Afghanistan, and we must  bring home Americans detained in Afghanistan, like Mark Frerichs from  my State, it is time for America's longest war to end.   On this final Memorial Day with U.S. troops in Afghanistan, we  remember especially the 2,312 U.S. servicemembers who died in that war  and the families they leave behind.   SSG Jacob Frazier is one of those fallen heroes. His friends called  him Jake.   He grew up in Ohio, and in St. Charles, the son of a Marine who  fought in Vietnam, and the eldest of five siblings.   He was 18 years old in 1997--just a few months out of high school-- when he enlisted in the Illinois Air National Guard and was assigned to  the 169th Air Support Operations Squadron of the 182nd Airlift Wing in  Peoria.   In 2003, he was in Afghanistan, working alongside Army Special  Forces. His job was to call in air cover to protect troops on the  ground. On March 29th of that year, Jake Frazier and Special Forces  soldiers were returning from a meeting with Tribal leaders in the  Helmand province when their convoy was attacked by Taliban fighters.  Staff Sergeant Frazier and a Special Forces solider were killed.   Jake Frazier was the 75th American service member--and the first  Illinois service member--to die in combat in Afghanistan. He was 24  years old and engaged to be married.   I want to tell you, also, about another fallen hero from an earlier  war. Army CPL Asa Vance grew up in Decatur, IL, one of 14 siblings. His  friends called him Bud.   He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1950 at the age of 18 and was sent to  Korea. On November 24 GEN MacArthur ordered what would become known as  the ``Home by Christmas'' offensive. U.N. forces, he said, would push  Chinese troops out of Korea, reunite North and South Korea, and be home  by Christmas. What happened was very different. Three days after  MacArthur's pronouncement, 120,000 Chinese troops surrounded 30,000 U.N  troops near North Korea's Chosin Reservoir. The next 2 weeks brought  some of the most brutal combat in modern warfare history. On December  2, at the height of the Battle of the Chosin Reservoir, CPL Asa Vance  was killed. He was 18 years old. For nearly 70 years, his remains  stayed in North Korea.    Following a 2018 meeting between the leaders of North Korea and the  United States, however, North Korea returned 55 boxes of remains of  U.S. servicemembers killed during war. DNA tests ultimately proved that  Corporal Vance's remains were among them. Two weeks ago, this son of  smalltown Illinois finally returned home. All 13 of his siblings had  already passed on. But Asa Vance was not alone.   As an honor guard of police officers, sheriffs deputies, State  troopers and members of the Illinois Patriot Honor Guard led his  remains from St. Louis's Lambert International Airport to a memorial  service in his hometown of Decatur and onto his final resting at Camp  Butler National Cemetery in Springfield. Hundreds of folks who never  knew CPL Asa Vance came out to pay their respects. They stood on street  corners and highway overpasses with their hands on their hearts. Many  held small American flags, some wiped away tears.   Archibald MacLeish was a son of Illinois, a poet laureate of the  United States, and a soldier in World War I. Decades after that war, he  wrote about the soldiers who do not come home:       The young dead soldiers do not speak.      Nevertheless, they are heard in the still houses:      Who has not heard them?      They have a silence that speaks for them at night and when             the clock counts.      They say: We were young. We have died. Remember us.      They say: Our deaths are not ours: they are yours,      They will mean what you make them.      We leave you our deaths. Give them their meaning.    SSG Jake Frazier's father, Jim Frazier, honors his son's sacrifice by  working with other Gold Star families who have lost loved ones in wars.   On this Memorial Day, we would do well to ask: How can we honor those  who gave all for our Nation? How can give meaning to their deaths?   In addition to keeping our promises to their families and to the  veterans who returned home, let us honor our fallen heroes by never  taking for granted the freedoms for which they died. Let us also  remember that our political differences must never make us enemies, and  let us search together in good faith to protect this Nation we all  love.                              Economic Recovery    Mr. President, let's turn the clocks back to the end of 2019. A novel  [[Page S3855]]  coronavirus is detected in the city of Wuhan. Little is known about the  pathogen, aside from the fact that it is highly contagious and  magnitudes more lethal than the flu. In just 3 months--3 months--that  virus causes a global pandemic, the likes of which none of us has seen  in our lifetimes. It grinds the global economy to a halt. Stay-at-home  orders become the new normal, and supply chains are disrupted at nearly  every stage in the production process.   Tragically, because of delay and denial by the former administration,  the United States experiences the world's highest rates of COVID  infections and deaths for all of 2020. Then comes a new year and a new  administration. Today, thanks to the Biden administration's competence  and the scientific community's relentless pursuit of a vaccine, America  is finally turning a corner in the fight against COVID-19. But the  damage was deep, and our scars are still fresh. While the coronavirus  raged, people lost their loved ones, and millions lost their  livelihoods.   Now, as we restart the engine of our economy, our Republican  colleagues would have you believe that the reason America's economy  hasn't bounced back fully is because American workers are lazy; they  would rather collect unemployment benefits than work. Republicans would  have you believe that the American people would rather binge-watch  ``The Office'' than return to it. They must not know many American  workers well--because Americans work longer and harder than workers in  nearly every advanced economy. And for the workers who have been laid  off over the past year, unemployment assistance has been lifesaving.   Here is what enhanced unemployment benefits have meant for my  constituents in Illinois. One Chicago resident reached out to my  office, saying that ``my sister has been out of work since the pandemic  hit Chicago . . . her husband works a full-time job during the day five  days a week and cleans offices three to four nights a week just to make  ends meet . . . unemployment assistance is essential.''   That constituent wrote to me out of concern for her family, not  herself--her sister, her brother-in-law, and her nieces and nephews.  Tell me, does that father--working a full-time day job and cleaning  offices at night--sound lazy to you? Does that family sound like they  are coasting through this pandemic on Easy Street? Not to me, they  don't.   Another constituent wrote to me out of concern for his wife. Because  of the pandemic, she was laid off from the job she had for 20 years. He  wrote, ``She is actively looking for work but so far there are hardly  any openings in her field.''   That sentiment was echoed by another constituent, who wrote, ``My 35  years of experience and outdated master's degree in marketing mean  nothing in this job market.''   I also heard from a single mother of three who lost her job as a  banquet server due to the pandemic. She has emptied her savings and is  3 months behind on mortgage payments. She worries that at 58 years old,  it will be difficult to find new work.   And one more story, my office received a letter from a 63-year-old  woman living with an autoimmune disease. She thought the job she had  before COVID-19 would be her last job ever. But then she got laid off.  Now, she relies on SNAP benefits to put food on the table and on  Medicaid for the doctors and medicines she needs to control her  disease. She wrote, ``What a horrible thing to rely on the government,  but we have no choice.'' Let me say that again: ``We have no choice.''   Do these sound like calculating con artists or loafs trying to scam  Uncle Sam for a quick buck? These are Americans, our neighbors, and  they are barely making their way through an unprecedented public health  crisis. And they made it because of unemployment assistance. And  jobless benefits don't just help the workers and families who receive  them. They help communities. They keep money circulating during hard  times. People are spending their enhanced unemployment benefits on  groceries, rent, mortgage, and other necessities.   Now, as we begin to recover, let's not bash the workers who have  borne the brunt of this pandemic. Let's focus on what is actually  holding our economy back. Let's look at the facts. On Thursday, the  Department of Labor published a report showing that new claims for  unemployment insurance have fallen to their lowest level since the  pandemic began. As more and more people get vaccinated, as we start  bringing this virus under control and the world starts opening up, it  is clear that Americans want to get back to work. They want to earn a  living. So what is preventing more Americans from returning to the  workforce?    For one, people are still concerned about safety. It was only 2 weeks  ago--May 13, to be exact--when the CDC announced that it is now safe  for fully vaccinated people to take off their masks and resume  activities that they had put on hold--May 13. The jobs report that our  Republican colleagues have been so eager to cite as proof that  unemployment benefits are keeping people from working was based on data  from early April. Remember what was happening in April? Lethal new  COVID variants were tearing through the U.K., India, and other nations,  and they were starting to show up in this Nation, too. Scientists  weren't yet sure whether the COVID vaccines would protect against the  new variants. Thankfully, we now have an answer. But back in April, is  it any wonder that some workers might have been uncertain about  returning to work under those conditions?   And then there are the continued challenges facing caregivers in  America.   Many parents--especially mothers--of young children still can't  return to work because so many schools and childcare programs remain  closed. You can't leave little kids home alone. Harry Truman used to  say that what he really needed was a one-handed economist because all  of the economists he knew told him, ``On one hand, this . . . and on  the other hand, that.'' A new report coauthored by an economist who  formerly worked in the Obama administration questions to what extent  the lack of childcare is preventing parents from returning to the  workforce. I expect to hear a lot about this report from our Republican  colleagues.   So I would point out that Mr. Furman and scores of other economists  continue to warn that our failure to invest in high-quality, affordable  childcare will undoubtedly impede America's future economic growth and  global competitiveness. There is no ``other hand'' about that. If we  want to cultivate the world's most educated, skilled workforce--a goal  I am sure we all share--we need to ensure our children are cared for-- because cultivating that workforce begins before kindergarten. Yet the  United States is the only advanced economy in the world that doesn't  guarantee parental leave for working parents.   And we are one of the only advanced economies that doesn't provide  some form of universal early childhood education. If you want to have a  child in America, guess what? You are on your own. This is a structural  problem in our economy that has existed for decades. The pandemic just  brought it into sharp relief.   The pandemic has also highlighted another structural problem for our  economy. While last month saw big job growth in the leisure and  hospitality industries, as restaurants, bakeries, and coffee shops  started opening back up, those gains are just one part of the story.  Jobs in manufacturing declined. Supply chain disruptions may account  for some of these losses.   But there is a bigger problem. Employers in high-skilled  manufacturing companies have had difficulty for years filling  positions. As a nation, we simply are not doing enough to train  American workers for the manufacturing jobs of the 21st century, jobs  like assembling electric car batteries or wind turbines. Workers who  want to make a career change and learn these skills often have to take  on thousands, even tens of thousands of dollars in student debt. We  treat worker training as a personal problem rather than a collective  good from which we all benefit.   As I said, America's childcare crisis and a shortage of high-skilled  workers existed long before COVID. Enhanced unemployment benefits have  been an economic lifeline for millions of Americans families during  this pandemic.   Severing that lifeline prematurely won't solve the long-term  structural challenges facing our economy. It will only make things  harder for already struggling families.  [[Page S3856]]    But we can address the challenge of childcare and take steps to help  workers develop new skills. In fact, President Biden and Senate  Democrats have a plan to do it. It starts by investing in our children.   With the American Families Plan, we can make childcare more  accessible and affordable, like nearly every other advanced economy in  the world.   With the American Jobs Plan, we can invest in workers. It would  direct billions of dollars toward helping dislocated workers develop  new skills and secure stable, well-paid jobs building wind turbines or  electric vehicles or making other American-made goods that will be in  high demand for years to come. The American Jobs Plan and the American  Family Plan are blueprints for building a sustainable, prosperous  economy that will create good jobs for decades to come. I commend  President Biden for meeting with my Republican colleague in hopes of  moving the country forward and urge Republicans to work with Democrats  to achieve these shared goals instead of rejecting our proposal  immediately.   We can remain the strongest, most dynamic economy in the world and  make the 21st century another American century, but we have precious  little time and a lot of competition. We can't waste that time wagging  our fingers at Americans who are struggling or ignoring the structural  challenges that have existed for decades and have only gotten worse  during the pandemic.   The American Rescue Plan saved our economy. Now, let's build it back  better than ever before with the American Jobs Plan and the American  Families Plan.   I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) is  necessarily absent.    I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1903         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. ETHYLENE OXIDE EMISSIONS STANDARDS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental       Protection Agency (referred to in this section as the       ``Administrator'') shall amend subpart O of part 63 of title       40, Code of Federal Regulations--        (1) to revise the standards for the emission of ethylene       oxide under that subpart based on the results described in       the report of the National Center for Environmental       Assessment of the Environmental Protection Agency entitled       ``Evaluation of the Inhalation Carcinogenicity of Ethylene       Oxide'' and dated December 2016;        (2) to apply maximum achievable control technology (within       the meaning of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.))       requirements to chamber exhaust vents; and        (3) to apply to area sources and major sources (as those       terms are defined in section 112(a) of the Clean Air Act (42       U.S.C. 7412(a))) of ethylene oxide.        (b) Residual Risk Review.--Not later than 180 days after       the date on which the Administrator finalizes the revised       standards required under subsection (a), the Administrator       shall carry out a residual risk assessment pursuant to       section 112(f)(2) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7412(f)(2))       with respect to the revised standards.        (c) Notification.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the       Administrator learns of a violation of the standards revised       under subsection (a), the Administrator shall notify the       public of the violation in a manner determined to be       appropriate by the Administrator.        (2) Failure to notify.--If the Administrator fails to       notify the public under paragraph (1) by the end of the       period described in that paragraph, the Inspector General of       the Environmental Protection Agency shall carry out an       investigation to determine--        (A) the reason or reasons for which the Administrator       failed to notify the public;        (B) the public health risks associated with the failure of       the Administrator to notify the public; and        (C) any steps the Administrator should take to ensure the       Administrator meets the requirements described in paragraph       (1) in the future.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Padilla):   S. 1906.
