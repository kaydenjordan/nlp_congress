 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on May 10, 1869, a golden spike was driven  into the last link joining the rails of the first transcontinental  railroad at Promontory Summit, UT. Made of 17-carat gold and driven  into a predrilled hole in the very last ceremonial tie, it bore the  inscription: ``May God continue the unity of our country as this  railroad unites the two great oceans of the world.'' Indeed, it did,  with the joining of the Union Pacific Railroad, stretching from the  Missouri River near the Iowa-Nebraska border, and the Central Pacific  Railroad, stretching from Sacramento, CA--east met west. The United  States became truly united.   As the spike was struck, a telegraph was sent around the Nation, and  bells rang out from coast to coast. This moment, you see, gave lots of  people throughout the United States and lots of people in my State of  Utah in particular access to what they needed to grow, to thrive, to  prosper, to feed their families; that is, access to other people.  [[Page S2764]]    Throughout the history of humanity, people have needed access to  other people. That is why great civilizations have sprung up along  great rivers and in areas where they had access to an ocean port. It is  one of the reasons why, throughout much of history, people in land- locked regions of any country, including our own, very often have a  hard time making a living. The introduction of the railroad started to  help to change that.   Tomorrow marks the 150th anniversary of this pivotal moment, and so  it is only right that we pause for just a minute to recognize it, for  this was a moment that changed the course of history in Utah and in our  Nation and ultimately the entire world. With the driving of that golden  spike, the arduous 6-month journey that used to be required to cross  the country--costing $1,000--had become a mere 10-day trip costing only  $150.   Thousands of miles of tracks were laid across the country, allowing  people to migrate west and to establish new settlements far more  quickly, safely, and easily. It transformed the economy across Utah and  throughout the Nation. Goods became efficiently transported across much  farther distances. Settlers found new markets, and buyers on the  frontier and in rural areas were able to purchase items that had  previously been completely unavailable to them in some cases or at  least very difficult to obtain. It spurred a boon in communications,  commerce, agriculture, construction, and mining. It started a  significant new chapter in our relationship with Asia and the Pacific  region, and it served as a model of innovation and prosperity for the  rest of the world.   All of this came about, it is important to note, from the  perseverance and efforts of many different people from different walks  of life working together. It required a clear-eyed vision from  President Lincoln and the Federal Government and a fruitful private- public partnership that allowed the engineers, railroad companies, and  local communities the freedom to do their jobs and to do them well and  without undo interference. It would not have been possible without the  work of the Chinese, Irish, Mormons, Civil War veterans, Native  Americans, and countless other laborers who toiled so long and so hard  with such a clear devotion to build these railroads.   Most of this is, of course, in the history books, as well it ought to  be. Most of us have a sense of the enormous achievement this moment  represented some 150 years ago tomorrow, of the great impact it had on  our Nation and the legacy it has left behind for us and for our  posterity. But what we often do not know are some of the stories of the  ordinary men and women behind these achievements and the ones who have  worked so hard to preserve this great legacy. There are, in fact,  hidden heroes who make history and unseen efforts of people who worked  so hard to keep that history alive. The doors of history sometimes turn  on small and often unseen hinges, and so I would like to take a moment  to honor a few of those people today who helped move history forward.    Some of us might know the name of Theodore Judah--a railroad and  civil engineer who was key to the original idea and design of  connecting these railroads and who advocated for the so-called Central  Route for the first transcontinental railroad, the Central Route marked  in red in this picture. But less familiar is the name of Theodore's  wife, Anna Judah.   While many routes were surveyed as possible paths for the railroad,  Theodore Judah had an often-scoffed-at dream of laying rails through  the mountains of the Sierra Nevada, from California going eastward.  Anna Judah shared Theodore's dream of connecting the first  transcontinental railroad. When Theodore hiked and surveyed the Sierra  Nevadas, Anna hiked and worked right alongside of him. She sketched and  did water colors and even oil paintings of the terrain, plants, and the  foliage. She gathered and labeled the various fossils and minerals. She  took copious notes all the while, taking into account different things  she and her husband observed as they were traveling.   After their time in the Sierra Nevadas, Theodore and Anna, like  Brigham Young, knew: This is the place. Together they fell in love with  the idea of the railroad taking the Central Route across the Sierra  Nevadas, believing that it would provide the perfect path for what they  wanted to accomplish. So they began traveling back and forth from  California, dedicating their efforts to lobbying for their dream in  Washington.   Anna was sharp, charming, tenacious, and undoubtedly she was  Theodore's biggest booster. She had the idea to display an exhibit  right here in the Capitol showcasing her notes and her clippings from  their travels in the area, her drawings and her paintings, samples of  mineral and ore she had collected, and charts and graphs that she was  able to present in a way that made them understandable to laymen, that  helped other people understand why this area was so important and the  significant role it could play in our Nation's development.   Literally hundreds of Senators, Congressmen, lobbyists, and  government clerks visited her display, which helped convince the  eastern legislators of the beauty of the western mountains--which many  of them had never seen or at least not experienced anything like the  way she had--and turned their hearts to the possibility of building a  railroad over them and through them to unite a country.   Ultimately, Congress was persuaded--to everyone's benefit--to choose  Judah's proposal for the Central Route and did so in large part because  of Anna Judah's efforts.   Tragically, Anna's husband Theodore contracted yellow fever. As a  result, he died before seeing the railroad completed and, in fact, even  before the project was started in earnest. But Anna lived to see their  dream to fruition. In fact, the driving of the last spike took place on  what would have been the couple's 22nd wedding anniversary. On the date  of the ceremony, Anna visited her husband's grave, and she wrote that  there her husband's spirit--so long dedicated to the railroad--felt  somehow near to her once again.   Years later, another young woman fell in love with the history of the  Golden Spike and the beginning of the first transcontinental railroad.  Bernice Gibbs Anderson, known to some as the Mother of the Golden  Spike, was born in Colorado in 1900 and lived the majority of her life  in Corinne, UT.   As a little girl, Bernice helped trail cattle near Promontory Summit  and grew up hearing cowboy stories around the campfire, including  stories about the Golden Spike, and, as her granddaughter put it, ``She  just plain fell in love with it.'' From the time she was 19 up until  the moment of her death, she tirelessly dedicated her life to  recognizing and preserving the history surrounding Golden Spike.   Bernice conceived the idea that the area around Promontory Summit  ought to be set aside to commemorate the completion of the  transcontinental railroad. For years, she campaigned to make Promontory  Summit a national historic monument.   She visited countless legislators, Governors, commissioners, and  railroad officers to raise support and raise funds for a monument at  Promontory Summit.   A mother of six children, she also worked as a correspondent and as a  staff writer for the Salt Lake Tribune, where she wrote historic  articles and poetry about the Golden Spike. She sent letters and  invitations to Members of Congress, U.S. Presidents, and Park Service  officials--all in hopes that they might come to recognize the  importance of the site.   As President of the Golden Spike Association, she coordinated  reenactment ceremonies and anniversary programs, encouraging local  communities to participate in those celebrations every year. While some  viewed her mission as somewhat unimportant--or, at least, less  important than other things--and, therefore, dismissed her efforts, she  never gave up.   Thankfully, Bernice lived to see the fruits of her labors. After  years of devoting her life to this case, Promontory Summit was declared  a national historic site on July 30, 1965. Just this past March, it was  redesignated as a national historic park--the first in Utah--allowing  even more of the railroad and the surrounding area to be preserved for  history going forward.   Fast forward to 2019. We now reached the 150th anniversary of the  Golden  [[Page S2765]]  Spike. Today, another dedicated woman has been behind its  sesquicentennial celebration, Spike 150. Aimee McConkie, carrying the  banner previously carried by Anna Judah and Bernice Gibbs Anderson, has  been a driving force in our State and in her community. A BYU graduate,  a wife, and mother of four daughters, Aimee has worked for 15 years in  professional association management.   In 2005 she founded Utah Venture Outdoors, a summer festival series  in Millcreek, UT. For 14 years, she volunteered her time and her  resources to this event, seeking to bring the community together  through recreational opportunities.   In 2017 she also launched LABELED, a 4-day film festival that seeks  to break the stigma around mental health issues. Now she has once again  brought her community together for an important cause--this time, to  celebrate and commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Golden Spike.   Under her leadership as director of Spike 150, there are events  taking place not only around Promontory Summit but also around the  entire State of Utah--events to highlight the history and legacy of the  Golden Spike, events for children and families, and events for music,  art, and train enthusiasts.   It has taken tremendous amounts of organization, coordination, and  perseverance, and it would no doubt make Bernice Gibbs Anderson proud.  At the 1957 celebration of the Golden Spike, she said:         This is sacred soil, dedicated to the sacrifices of the       thousands who labored in the great race to build the first       transcontinental railway in the shortest possible time. . . .       The destiny of this nation rode triumphant upon the rails       that met at Promontory Station! The future of this site       depends on you, my friends. Will it take its rightful place       in the heritage and traditions of America . . . or will it       remain desolate and forgotten to sink into oblivion[?]    Thanks to the work of people like Aimee McConkie, we know that the  Golden Spike will not sink into oblivion but will indeed take its  rightful place in history.   Anna Judah, Bernice Gibbs Anderson, and Aimee McConkie might have  lived at different times, but there is a common thread that runs  throughout their stories: the triumph of ordinary people, of the hidden  heroes behind so many of our great achievements in history.   Without the work of these ordinary Americans and Utahns, we never  could have achieved one of the most transformative events in our Nation  thus far: the driving of the Golden Spike and the completion of the  first transcontinental railroad. And without the work of these hidden  heroes, we could never reasonably hope and expect to be able to keep  this legacy alive.   It is our task now to take up the banner that these women have  carried--the banner of innovation, perseverance, and unity--and to  ensure that our remarkable heritage lives on. If we do, there is no  telling what Utah and our great Nation can achieve together.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
