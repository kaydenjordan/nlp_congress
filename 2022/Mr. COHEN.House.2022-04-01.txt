 Mr. Speaker, this past week, we celebrated the life of Don  Young, the dean of the House with 49 years here representing the State  of Alaska. He was a Republican. But before he was a Republican, he was  an American. He wanted this House to work and this House to work  together.   Don Young voted for the bipartisan infrastructure bill because he  knew infrastructure, roads, airports, river ports, and trains made this  country move and made business happen.   I hope we will not forget Don Young, not just because of his  oversized and loveable personality and the warmth that he exuded to all  of us, but for the fact that he was bipartisan and wanted this House to  work.   There is a motto up there, above the Speaker's lectern, that says:  Get something done while you are here that is memorable and important.   Look at that and remember Don Young.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for my time.   I rise in support of the MORE Act which would finally reform how we  deal with marijuana laws and how we should. Mr. Bentz said we should  put more money into law enforcement. That is the opposite of what we  should do.   Decriminalizing means cops spend less time busting people for  marijuana possession and more time looking for people committing  violent crime. That is a better use of law enforcement time.  [[Page H4091]]    Maurice Hinchey and Sam Farr on this side of the aisle knew it when  they were here. They sponsored bills, as did Don Young and Dana  Rohrabacher on the other side of the aisle, because it was a  Libertarian freedom issue.   It is no secret the war on drugs failed. Harry Anslinger started it  in the 1930s, and he vilified Hispanic Americans and said this was a  way to get them.   Then Richard Nixon even had a commission that said we should  decriminalize marijuana but then decided, because of Ehrlichman and  Haldeman, that, no, the Nixon strategy was better designed at going  after marijuana because Blacks and hippies who protested the war were  his opponents, and we needed to go after them.   So they turned it around, they never legalized it as the commission  said they should, and they made the war on drugs worse. It then went on  and on.   Marijuana is less dangerous than alcohol. People do not smoke  marijuana and beat up their wives or get angry and beat up others or  drive their cars in wildly dangerous conditions at fast speeds and kill  others.   Congress has been out of step on this issue. It is called cultural  lag. We are finally coming around to rescheduling it from Schedule I  where it is in a class with heroin and methamphetamines, which is  absurd. We should have research.   We must deschedule marijuana. We must decriminalize it at the Federal  level. Now is the time to do some remedies to our Federal marijuana  laws. This is an historic time.   I thank Mr. Nadler, Ms. Lee, and the others who have championed this  bill, Mr. Blumenauer, and let's move forward and do the right thing.
