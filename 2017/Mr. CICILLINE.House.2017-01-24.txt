 Madam Speaker, I was proud to join thousands of women  in the Women's March, both here in DC and in my home state of Rhode  Island.   We marched to demand that women's rights be respected and that women  should be trusted to make their own decisions.   However, a mere three days later, the GOP seeks to trample on women's  rights by considering H.R. 7, a bill that will deny access to basic  healthcare to millions of women.   This bill is also just another pathetic attempt by some politicians  in this town to get between a woman and her doctor.   Under current law, no federal money can be used to fund abortion. And  it's been that way since 1976.   This bill is a Trojan horse that effectively bans abortion coverage  even for women who use their own money to pay for health insurance.   It penalizes small business owners who offer their employees health  care coverage for abortion.   And it tells doctors who are employed by the federal government that  they can't provide the care that is in the best interests of their  patients.   Madam Speaker, the women of this country do not need Congress telling  them how to make their health care decisions.   Having an abortion is a decision that should be left between a woman  and her doctor.   None of us has a license to legislate our own personal morality in  this chamber.  [[Page H646]]    I urge my colleagues to vote no on H.R. 7.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 55, the previous question is ordered on  the bill.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.                              Motion to Recommit
