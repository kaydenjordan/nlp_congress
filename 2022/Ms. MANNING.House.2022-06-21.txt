 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1934) to direct the Federal Government to provide assistance  and technical expertise to enhance the representation and leadership of  the United States at international standards-setting bodies that set  standards for equipment, systems, software, and virtually defined  networks that support 5th and future generations mobile  telecommunications systems and infrastructure, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1934         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting United States       International Leadership in 5G Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the United States and its allies and partners should       maintain participation and leadership at international       standards-setting bodies for 5th and future generations       mobile telecommunications systems and infrastructure;        (2) the United States should work with its allies and       partners to encourage and facilitate the development of       secure supply chains  [[Page H5708]]       and networks for 5th and future generations mobile       telecommunications systems and infrastructure; and        (3) the maintenance of a high standard of security in       telecommunications and cyberspace between the United States       and its allies and partners is a national security interest       of the United States.       SEC. 3. ENHANCING REPRESENTATION AND LEADERSHIP OF THE UNITED                     STATES AT INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS-SETTING                     BODIES.         (a) In General.--The President shall establish an       interagency working group to work with allies and       international partners to increase and align their engagement       at multilateral international organizations, such as the       International Telecommunications Union (ITU), that address       communications networks, standards, and security, including       5th and future generations mobile telecommunications and       infrastructure.        (b) Interagency Working Group.--The interagency working       group described in subsection (a) shall--        (1) be chaired by the Secretary of State or a designee of       the Secretary of State; and        (2) consist of the head (or designee) of the Department of       Commerce and each Federal department or agency the President       determines appropriate.        (c) Function.--The Secretary of State shall coordinate with       the members of the interagency working group to develop and       implement a strategy for diplomatic engagement with allies       and partners and monitor engagement by the Government of the       People's Republic of China and entities under its ownership,       control, or influence at multilateral international       organizations described in subsection (a).        (d) Briefing.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the interagency working group       shall provide to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the       Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations and       the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the       Senate a briefing that includes--        (1) a strategy for diplomatic engagement with allies and       partners to share security risk information and findings       pertaining to equipment that supports or is used in 5th and       future generations mobile telecommunications systems and       infrastructure and cooperation on mitigating such risks; and        (2) a discussion of China's presence and activities at       multilateral international organizations described in       subsection (a) relevant to 5th and future generation mobile       telecommunications systems and infrastructure, including       information on the differences in the scope and scale of       China's engagement, as well as the success rate of proposals       by Chinese entities adopted into standards at such       organizations compared to the engagement and success rate of       proposals adopted by the United States or its allies and       partners, and noting any mandatory domestic Chinese standards       that are adopted at such organizations.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1934, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1934, the Promoting  United States International Leadership in 5G Act.   Let me start by thanking Ranking Member McCaul, who has been an  important advocate in advancing U.S. leadership in global telecoms and  5G technology. Countering China's and Russia's malign influence in this  industry is critical for protecting our national security, and I thank  him for his bipartisan work in furtherance of these ends.   A big part of advancing U.S. 5G leadership is ensuring that America  and allied countries are in the room, at the table, and leading the  charge to set next-generation technology standards.   No organization is more critical to that process than a little-known  U.N. organization called the International Telecommunication Union, or  ITU.   For years, China and Russia have quietly targeted the ITU as a  central battleground to advance their strategic technology interests.  They have sought to use the ITU to unfairly advantage their telecom  companies, giving Putin and the PRC power over critical communications  infrastructure worldwide.   For the past 8 years, a Chinese national has served as Secretary  General of the ITU. China has used this perch to favor its own  companies and make the rules of the digital road more favorable to  authoritarians. The Secretary General has defended Huawei against  critics and promoted the PRC's Belt and Road campaign. With the ITU as  its forum, Beijing has worked to unfairly promote Chinese companies'  technical standards.   Now, a pivotal election for the next ITU Secretary General is set to  take place in September between a fantastic American candidate, Doreen  Bogdan-Martin, and former Huawei executive and Russian deputy telecom  minister, Rashid Ismailov, whom China and Russia back.   Should the United States and its allies across the world fail to win  this election, the ITU's technical integrity would be endangered and  authoritarian governments around the globe would be empowered. A  Russian Secretary General would extend Putin's ability to exert  influence in the rules-based international system for which he has  shown the utmost contempt.   This bill is important because the U.S. must increase its engagement  at the ITU and work with our allies and partners to counter China's and  Russia's malign influence. H.R. 1934 would do just that, by forming an  interagency working group to align our strategy at the ITU with our  allies and monitor China's influence in the organization. It would also  strengthen much-needed coordination with Congress so we can be  supportive partners in this strategic competition.   We cannot be complacent about the coming election. The battle for  influence playing out at the ITU is one we cannot afford to lose, and  H.R. 1934 is an essential tool for advancing U.S. leadership in this  powerful organization.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this effort by voting  for this legislation today, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 59) condemning the October 25,  2021, military coup in Sudan and standing with the people of Sudan.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.   The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                              H. Con. Res. 59         Whereas the people of the Republic of Sudan suffered for       three decades under the despotic rule of President Omar       Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir, whose government was responsible for       the suppression of civil liberties, grand corruption, support       for international terrorism, and the commission of crimes       against humanity and genocide;        Whereas, throughout 2019, a coalition of Sudanese civic       groups, including professional associations, labor unions,       community groups, democracy activists, and opposition       parties, led a mass protest movement to demand the end of       Bashir's reign and the transition to democracy in Sudan;        Whereas, on April 11, 2019, Sudanese military officers       deposed Bashir, and, following continued protests, agreed to       form a transitional government in partnership with a civilian       pro-democracy coalition on July 17, 2019;        Whereas, on June 3, 2019, Sudanese forces led by the Rapid       Support Forces (RSF), largely comprised of Janjaweed militia       involved in genocidal campaigns across Darfur for decades,       opened fire on protesters at an army command headquarters in       Khartoum, killing at least 127 people, at least 40 of whom       were found in the Nile River;        Whereas the military and civilian elements agreed to a 39-      month transition to democracy, with a Civilian-Led       Transitional Government (CLTG) comprised of a predominantly       civilian cabinet led by Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok, a       Sovereign Council, an executive body with civilian and       military members chaired for the first half of the       transitional period by Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-      Burhan, and a Transitional Legislative Council, which has yet       to be formed;        Whereas the United States and the international community       supported Sudan's transition to democracy, with the United       States identifying more than $1,000,000,000 in foreign       assistance, and the multilateral Friends of Sudan group       pledging $1,800,000,000 from roughly 50 countries and       international organizations;        Whereas the CLTG made progress in human rights reforms,       including guaranteeing the people of Sudan freedom of       religion and gender equality under the transitional       constitution, banning female genital mutilation, and       decriminalizing apostasy;        Whereas, in August 2021, when the Sudanese Cabinet ratified       the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC),       the CLTG made progress towards ending impunity for abusers of       human rights, stating its intention to deliver Omar al-Bashir       to the ICC to stand trial for genocide, war crimes, and       crimes against humanity, and formed civilian committees to       investigate corruption and crimes against humanity       perpetrated by the Bashir regime;        Whereas the transitional government negotiated a peace       agreement with several rebel groups, a step towards ending       decades of conflict in the regions of Darfur, South Kordofan,       and Blue Nile, which killed hundreds of thousands of       civilians and left more than 3,000,000 people displaced       within Sudan;        Whereas Sudan continues to face a serious humanitarian       situation, with an estimated 13,400,000 people, or 29 percent       of the population, in need of humanitarian assistance in       2021;        Whereas Sudan faces a severe economic crisis, exacerbated       by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused the price of food and       consumer goods to increase significantly, while austerity       measures imposed to stabilize the economy resulted in the       reduction or elimination of subsidies for commodities       including wheat and fuel;        Whereas the political tensions between the civilian and       military elements and within factions of the civilian       coalition undermined the CLTG and contributed to widespread       unrest within the Sudanese population relating to a range of       issues, including the economic crisis, ethnic and tribal       conflict in peripheral regions, and the unsatisfactory pace       of reforms;        Whereas, on September 21, 2021, some members of the       military reportedly attempted a coup d'etat against the       transitional government, which failed to depose the       government but succeeded in precipitating the most serious       political crisis of the transition period;        Whereas, on October 21, 2021, hundreds of thousands of       people across Sudan demonstrated in support of democratic       civilian rule, to counter a smaller protest days prior       demanding the military take complete control of the       government;        Whereas, on October 25, 2021, Lieutenant General Burhan,       with the support of General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known       as ``Hemedti'', seized control of the government, deployed       the military to the streets of Khartoum and Omdurman, and       arrested and detained Prime Minister Hamdok and other       civilian officials;        Whereas the African Union Peace and Security Council       convened on October 27, 2021, strongly condemned the coup,       reaffirmed the mandate of the CLTG, and subsequently       suspended Sudan from the regional body ``with immediate       effect . . . until the effective restoration'' of the CLTG;        Whereas the actions of Lieutenant General Burhan and the       Sudanese military violate Sudan's Constitutional Charter and       threaten to plunge Sudan into isolation and instability;        Whereas the United States Government publicly condemned the       coup, suspended its foreign assistance to Sudan, and urged       Lieutenant General Burhan and his accomplices to restore the       CLTG and return Sudan to the path to democracy; and        Whereas, the Troika (the United States, United Kingdom,       Norway), the European Union, and Switzerland ``continue to       recognize the Prime Minister and his cabinet as the       constitutional leaders of the transitional government'' and       ``confirm once again the international calls for the       immediate return to the roadmap for democratic transition of       Sudan'': Now, therefore, be it        Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring), That Congress--        (1) condemns the October 25, 2021, coup in Sudan;        (2) stands with the people of Sudan in their democratic       aspirations;        (3) recognizes the Prime Minister and his cabinet as the       constitutional leaders of Sudan's transitional government;        (4) calls for Sudan's military junta to--        (A) immediately release all civilian government officials,       civil society members, and other individuals detained in       connection with the coup;        (B) return to constitutional rule under the transitional       constitution as the starting point for negotiations with       civilians toward full civilian rule;        (C) lift the state of emergency, including complete       restoration of all means of communication;        (D) remove all roadblocks and checkpoints, and order the       Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and RSF to stand down and comply       with international recognized rules of engagement;        (E) ensure security forces respect the right to peaceful       protest and hold those who used excessive force and committed       other abuses accountable in a transparent, credible process;        (F) cease all attempts to change the civilian composition       of the cabinet, Sovereign Council, and other government       bodies; and        (G) transfer leadership of the Sovereign Council to a       civilian member of the Sovereign Council in keeping with the       transitional constitution;        (5) calls on the Secretary of State to--        (A) immediately identify coup leaders, their accomplices,       and enablers for consideration for targeted sanctions;        (B) urge junta leaders to return immediately to the rule of       law as set forth by the transitional constitution;        (C) monitor, discourage, and deter any effort by external       parties to support the coup and the military junta;        (D) coordinate with--        (i) the Administrator of the United States Agency for       International Development and other Federal Government       agencies to pause all non-humanitarian bilateral assistance       to Sudan until restoration of the transitional constitutional       order;        (ii) the Department of the Treasury to use the voice and       vote of the United States in  [[Page H5710]]       international financial institutions to suspend all actions       related to non-humanitarian loans or debt relief to Sudan       until restoration of the transitional constitutional order;       and        (iii) the United States Permanent Representative to the       United Nations to ensure the United Nations Security Council       is seized of the matter on an ongoing basis; and        (E) work with the Troika to engage members of the       international community to join these United States actions;       and        (6) calls on international partners to--        (A) join United States efforts to impose targeted sanctions       on the junta and other accomplices to the coup, monitor,       discourage, and deter any effort by external parties to       support the junta, and urge junta leaders to return to the       rule of law as set forth by the transitional constitution;       and        (B) suspend Sudan's participation in all regional       multilateral organizations until Sudan is returned to       constitutional rule under the transitional constitution.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 59, condemning the  October 25, 2021, military coup in Sudan and standing with the people  of Sudan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 59. I would first like  to thank my colleague, Chairman Meeks, for drafting this important  resolution.   On October 25, 2021, Sudan's military leaders launched a coup that  essentially dissolved nearly 2 years of progress toward establishing a  civilian-led transitional government that would be accountable to the  people of Sudan.   Since then, the military junta has undertaken a campaign involving  serious human rights violations, including the unlawful detention of  the recognized Prime Minister, senior government officials, and members  of civil society. Civilian protestors have been maimed, detained, and  killed arbitrarily.   Now, the military junta has brazenly aligned itself with the Kremlin  and provided Putin access to its mining sector at a time when Russia is  seeking funds to wage its own brutal, illegal war in Ukraine.   For these reasons, Congress needs to send a unified message to  Sudan's military junta by strongly condemning the October 25 coup and  reaffirming our support for the Sudanese people.   This resolution will also signal to the world that the international  community must take a stand against the antidemocratic trends sweeping  Sudan and the region. We must continue championing multilateral efforts  to bring peace and stability to Sudan.   While clearly imperfect, I believe the U.N.-mediated process to  advance Sudan's political transition and reestablish the path to peace  could be viable with the right leadership and inclusive representation.   In passing this resolution and a companion resolution recently passed  by our colleagues in the Senate, I ask you to support this call to  stand with the people of Sudan and urge Sudan's military junta to  restore the civilian-led transition as the best hope for peace and  prosperity in Sudan.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                      U.S. House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                      Washington, DC, June 17, 2022.      Hon. Gregory Meeks,      Chairman, House Foreign Affairs Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Meeks: I am writing to acknowledge your       letter dated June 17, 2022, regarding the waiver by the       Committee on Financial Services of any Rule X jurisdiction       claims over the matters contained in H. Con. Res. 59, the       ``Condemning the October 25, 2021, military coup in Sudan and       standing with the people of Sudan.'' The Committee on       Financial Services confirms our mutual understanding that our       Committee does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our       Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues within our jurisdiction.

We request that you ensure that this exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during Floor       consideration of the bill. We look forward to continuing to       work with you as this measure moves through the legislative       process.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                      Washington, DC, June 21, 2022.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chair, Committee on Financial Services, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Waters: I am writing to you concerning H. Con.       Res. 59, Condemning the October 25, 2021, military coup in       Sudan and standing with the people of Sudan. I appreciate       your willingness to work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the resolution fall within       the jurisdiction of the Committee on Financial Services under       House Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H.       Con. Res. 59 to expedite floor consideration. I further       acknowledge that the inaction of your Committee with respect       to the measure does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       over the matters contained in the resolution that fall within       your jurisdiction. I also acknowledge that your Committee       will be appropriately consulted and involved as this or       similar legislation moves forward, and will support the       appointment of Committee on Financial Services conferees       during any House-Senate conference convened on this       legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Gregory W. Meeks,                                                             Chair.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, the October 25 military coup in Sudan represents a dark  day for the people in Sudan. It put Sudan and its people on a  regressive path that has eroded their human rights and their  aspirations for a civilian-led transition. This transition, with  historic support from the United States, augured peace, stability, and  democratic governance in Sudan for the first time in decades. Instead,  the military junta decided to seize power without regard for the will  of Sudan's people.   This resolution will echo the voice of the international community by  condemning the coup, standing up for Sudan's people, and calling for  full accountability for the junta leaders who have abused their power  and their people. The passage of this concurrent resolution is a step  in the right direction.   I again thank Chairman Meeks for his leadership on this resolution,  and I urge all my colleagues to join us by voting in the affirmative.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 720) calling for stability and the cessation of  violence and condemning ISIS-affiliated terrorist activity in northern  Mozambique, including the Cabo Delgado Province, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 720         Whereas, in August 2019, Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi,       of the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO), and the       Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) President Ossufo       Momade signed the Peace and Reconciliation Accord in Maputo,       ending several years of resurgent armed conflict between       RENAMO and FRELIMO before RENAMO's rebel leader Mariano       Nhongo was killed by Mozambican forces in October 2021;        Whereas, in October 2017, violent extremists locally known       as al-Shabab or Ahlu al-Sunnah wal-Jamaah targeted civilians       in the Cabo Delgado Province and eventually took up arms       against the Mozambican state, launching an armed insurgency       that has had dire consequences for human rights, security,       and socioeconomic welfare in the Cabo Delgado Province;        Whereas, since 2017, Ahlu al-Sunnah wal-Jamaah has killed       thousands of civilians and brutalized communities in Cabo       Delgado Province, including through mass beheadings of men       and boys, abductions, including of children who are forced to       take up arms, and attacks against transportation, supply       convoys, government facilities, and other buildings, such as       homes, schools, and hospitals;        Whereas, in 2018, the Cabo Delgado-based violent extremist       group reportedly pledged allegiance to the Islamic State in       Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and was acknowledged by ISIS as an       affiliate in August 2019;        Whereas, on March 10, 2021, the Department of State       designated Ahlu al-Sunnah wal-Jamaah, also known as ISIS-      Mozambique, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization under the       Immigration and Nationality Act, and as Specially Designated       Global Terrorists under Executive Order 13224, and identified       Tanzanian national Abu Yasir Hassan as the leader of the       organization;        Whereas, in late March 2021, ISIS-Mozambique launched a       complex attack against the northern Mozambican town of Palma       over several days, overwhelming Mozambican forces, killing       and abducting dozens of people, and destroying       infrastructure, leading TotalEnergies to declare force       majeure in relation to its partially United States       Government-financed $20,000,000 liquified natural gas project       near Palma;        Whereas, in May 2021, the United States Holocaust Memorial       Museum reported a high risk of new mass killings in       Mozambique as part of the Early Warning Project risk       assessment for 2020-2021;        Whereas the United States Government announced in March       2021 its segment training of the Mozambican armed forces to       help build their counterterrorism capacities, and the       European Union announced in July 2021 that it would establish       a military training mission in Mozambique;        Whereas, on June 23, 2021, the Southern African Development       Community (SADC) heads of state issued a communique approving       the deployment of the SADC Standby Force Mission to combat       ``acts of terrorism and violent extremism in Cabo Delgado'';        Whereas, on July 10, 2021, Mozambican President Filipe       Nyusi confirmed that 1,000 Rwandan forces had begun deploying       to the Cabo Delgado Province and that a SADC standby force       would follow, and on August 8, 2021, Rwandan forces announced       they had retaken a strategic provincial port from ISIS-      Mozambique;        Whereas grievances fueling terrorist recruitment reportedly       include allegations of state corruption and exploitation,       including by security forces, and historical socioeconomic       and political marginalization of the Cabo Delgado Province       and other northern regions, which has constrained development       and brought about high rates of poverty, youth unemployment,       and socioeconomic inequality;        Whereas international development of northern Mozambique's       natural resources has the potential to yield economic benefit       to the Cabo Delgado Province's local populations through job       creation, increased private investment, and expanded       development initiatives, yet in some cases resource       development has reportedly displaced local communities and       some have been inadequately compensated for lost land, homes,       and disrupted livelihoods;        Whereas international human rights monitors have reported       human rights violations perpetrated by Mozambican security       forces during counterterrorism operations in the Cabo Delgado       Province, including arbitrary arrests, abductions, torture of       detainees, excessive force against unarmed civilians,       intimidation, and extrajudicial killings;        Whereas, as of June 2021, ISIS-Mozambique's attacks and       resulting clashes with government forces throughout the Cabo       Delgado Province have killed over 3,000 people and displaced       nearly 800,000, left 1,300,000 people in need of humanitarian       assistance, including approximately 900,000, primarily women       and children, in emergency-levels of food insecurity, and in       July 2021, the World Food Program warned that insufficient       funding could lead to famine in the region;        Whereas the United States, through the United States Agency       for International Development, is the single largest donor of       humanitarian assistance in Mozambique; and        Whereas, in April 2021, the World Bank approved a       $100,000,000 grant to Mozambique's Agency for Integrated       Development of the North for the ``restoration of livelihoods       and economic opportunities, building of social cohesion, and       improving access to basic services as well as the       rehabilitation of selected public infrastructure intended to       benefit internally displaced persons (IDPs) and host       communities in targeted areas of Northern Mozambique'', and       has determined Mozambique is eligible for its Prevention and       Resilience Allocation, granting potential access of up to       $700,000,000 in additional assistance for similar projects:       Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns the violence, targeting of civilians, and       terrorist attacks carried out by ISIS-Mozambique in the Cabo       Delgado Province;        (2) urges the Mozambican Government to--        (A) continue to work with international partners to restore       security in the Cabo Delgado Province and counter violent       extremism and terrorism in a manner that prioritizes the       protection of civilians and their human rights;  [[Page H5712]]         (B) take steps to protect children from abduction, forced       conscription, and other forms of exploitation;        (C) ensure humanitarian workers have access to vulnerable       populations in the Cabo Delgado Province, including by       reducing bureaucratic constraints on travel documents,       humanitarian aid, and related equipment;        (D) hold to account any government official who sought to       disrupt the equitable provision of humanitarian assistance,       or who diverted such assistance, profited from its       distribution, or otherwise engage in exploitative or corrupt       acts relating to the acquisition or provision of humanitarian       aid;        (E) work with the international community to document,       investigate, and prosecute human rights abuses and other       crimes committed by state security forces, militias,       terrorists, and other armed actors, and to build government       capacities to accomplish such outcomes; and        (F) develop comprehensive national strategies and       implementation plans to address underlying social, political,       and economic grievances of local populations in the Cabo       Delgado Province and neighboring provinces;        (3) calls on Mozambican community leaders and civil society       members in the Cabo Delgado Province to strengthen local       resiliencies and prevent targeting and other forms of       intercommunal violence and conflict;        (4) calls on the United States Government and other donor       governments to appropriately coordinate diplomatic, defense,       and development resources and continue to expand, where       possible, efforts to provide humanitarian assistance, promote       good governance, spur economic growth, and build the capacity       of the Government of Mozambique to counter terrorism and       violent extremism and address conflict through existing       programs, such as the Partnership for Regional East Africa       Counterterrorism (PREACT), and future interagency       initiatives, while ensuring respect for human rights and       protection of civilians;        (5) urges the Mozambican Northern Integrated Development       Agency to consult with local populations and civil society       groups in the Cabo Delgado Province and to ensure       transparency and accountability in the provision of       development assistance; and        (6) calls on the international donor community to support       continued humanitarian assistance, particularly in support of       Mozambique's Humanitarian Response Plan and local and       national aid organizations providing aid to populations in       the Cabo Delgado Province or other conflict-affected areas in       Mozambique.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 720, calling for stability and  cessation of violence and condemning ISIS-affiliated terrorist activity  in northern Mozambique, including the Cabo Delgado Province, and for  other purposes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Resolution 720 calling for  stability and the cessation of violence and condemning ISIS-affiliated  terrorist activity in northern Mozambique, including the Cabo Delgado  Province, and for other purposes.   Let me start by thanking Representative Sara Jacobs for her work on  this critical resolution.   Since 2017, terrorists operating under the ISIS banner have laid  waste to a large part of the Cabo Delgado Province in northern  Mozambique, killing thousands of civilians, displacing millions, and  grinding almost all economic activity in the region to a halt. The  devastation these terrorists inflicted on the people spurred an  unprecedented humanitarian crisis in northern Mozambique that continues  to unfold.   With the support of the United States, Rwanda, the European Union,  South Africa, and other Southern African Development Community members,  the terrorist threat in northern Mozambique has been largely  neutralized. There is more work to do, including those efforts underway  to stabilize the region, return refugees and IDPs to their homes, and  revitalize livelihoods and the regional economy.   To effectively address these issues, including the underlying drivers  of violent extremism, the Government of the Republic of Mozambique must  spearhead a strong, comprehensive plan to implement a national security  strategy and establish an inclusive process for economic growth and  development in the north.   The United States remains committed to supporting Mozambique's  efforts to strengthen democracy, improve transparency and other good  governance measures, and stimulate its economy.   This resolution condemns the violence against civilians in the Cabo  Delgado Province, including the terrorist attacks carried out by ISIS- Mozambique, and calls on the Government of the Republic of Mozambique  to end the conflict and increase its humanitarian support effort.   The United States stands with the people of Mozambique and will  continue to counter the spread of violent extremism there and around  the world.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Jacobs), the vice chair of the International  Development, International Organizations, and Global Corporate Social  Impact Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, the terrorist activity that has destabilized parts of  northern Mozambique is a symptom of a larger issue at hand. The United  States is working closely with the Mozambican Government to help  address the drivers of terrorist recruitment by supporting governance  reforms, providing humanitarian assistance, and promoting other  stabilization efforts in the country.   This resolution underscores that commitment and urges the Mozambican  Government to create a centralized and comprehensive strategy to  counter violent extremism and restore security in its northern region.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Jacobs for her leadership on this  resolution, and I urge all my colleagues to join us by voting in the  affirmative.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 45) expressing the sense of  Congress regarding the execution-style murders of United States  citizens Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi in the Republic of Serbia in  July 1999.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.   The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                              H. Con. Res. 45         Whereas brothers Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi were       citizens of the United States, born in Chicago, Illinois, to       ethnic Albanian parents from what is today the Republic of       Kosovo, and who subsequently lived in Hampton Bays, New York;        Whereas the three Bytyqi brothers responded to the       brutality of the conflict associated with Kosovo's separation       from the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of       Yugoslavia of which Serbia was a constituent republic by       joining the so-called ``Atlantic Brigade'' of the Kosovo       Liberation Army in April 1999;        Whereas a Military-Technical Agreement between the       Government of Yugoslavia and the North Atlantic Council came       into effect on June 10, 1999, leading to a cessation of       hostilities;        Whereas the Bytyqi brothers were arrested on June 23, 1999,       by Serbian police within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia       when the brothers accidently crossed what was then an       unmarked administrative border while escorting an ethnic       Romani family who had been neighbors to safety outside       Kosovo;        Whereas the Bytyqi brothers were jailed for 15 days for       illegal entry into the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in       Prokuplje, Serbia, until a judge ordered their release on       July 8, 1999;        Whereas, instead of being released, the Bytyqi brothers       were taken by a special operations unit of the Serbian       Ministry of Internal Affairs to a training facility near       Petrovo Selo, Serbia, where all three were executed;        Whereas, at the time of their murders, Ylli was 25, Agron       was 23, and Mehmet was 21 years of age;        Whereas Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was removed       from office on October 5, 2000, following massive       demonstrations protesting his refusal to acknowledge and       accept election results the month before;        Whereas, in the following years, the political leadership       of Serbia has worked to strengthen democratic institutions,       to develop stronger adherence to the rule of law, and to       ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms,       including as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia evolved into       a State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in February 2003,       which itself dissolved when both republics proclaimed their       respective independence in June 2006;        Whereas the United States Embassy in Belgrade, Serbia, was       informed on July 17, 2001, that the bodies of Ylli, Agron,       and Mehmet Bytyqi were found with their hands bound and       gunshot wounds to the back of their heads, buried atop an       earlier mass grave of approximately 70 bodies of murdered       civilians from Kosovo;        Whereas Serbian authorities subsequently investigated but       never charged those individuals who were part of the Ministry       of Internal Affairs chain of command related to this crime,       including former Minister of Internal Affairs Vlajko       Stojilkovic, Assistant Minister and Chief of the Public       Security Department Vlastimir Djordjevic, and special       operations training camp commander Goran ``Guri''       Radosavljevic;        Whereas Vlajko Stojilkovic died of a self-inflicted gunshot       wound in April 2002 prior to being transferred to the custody       of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former       Yugoslavia where he had been charged with crimes against       humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war during       the Kosovo conflict;        Whereas Vlastimir Djordjevic was arrested and transferred       to the custody of the International Criminal Tribunal for the       former Yugoslavia in June 2007, and sentenced in February       2011 to 27 years imprisonment (later reduced to 18 years) for       crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs       of war committed during the Kosovo conflict;        Whereas Goran ``Guri'' Radosavljevic is reported to reside       in Serbia, working as director of a security consulting firm       in Belgrade, and is a prominent member of the governing       political party;  [[Page H5714]]         Whereas the Secretary of State designated Goran       Radosavljevic of Serbia under section 7031(c) of the       Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs       Appropriations Act, 2018 as ineligible for entry into the       United States due to his involvement in gross violations of       human rights;        Whereas two Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs officers,       Sretan Popovic and Milos Stojanovic, were charged in 2006 for       crimes associated with their involvement in the detention and       transport of the Bytyqi brothers from Prokuplje to Petrovo       Selo, but acquitted in May 2012 with an appeals court       confirming the verdict in March 2013;        Whereas the Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic promised       several high ranking United States officials to deliver       justice in the cases of the deaths of Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet       Bytyqi;        Whereas no individual has ever been found guilty for the       murders of Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi or of any other       crimes associated with their deaths; and        Whereas no individual is currently facing criminal charges       regarding the murder of the Bytyqi brothers despite many       promises by Serbian officials to resolve the case: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--        (1) those individuals responsible for the murders in July       1999 of United States citizens Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi       in Serbia should be brought to justice;        (2) it is reprehensible that no individual has ever been       found guilty for executing the Bytyqi brothers, or of any       other crimes associated with their deaths, and that no       individual is even facing charges for these horrible crimes;        (3) the Government of Serbia and its relevant ministries       and offices, including the Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor's       Office, should make it a priority to investigate and       prosecute as soon as possible those current or former       officials believed to be responsible for their deaths,       directly or indirectly;        (4) the United States should devote sufficient resources to       fully assist and properly monitor efforts by the Government       of Serbia and its relevant ministries and offices to       investigate and prosecute as soon as possible those       individuals believed to be responsible for their deaths,       directly or indirectly; and        (5) progress in resolving this case, or the lack thereof,       should remain a significant factor determining the further       development of relations between the United States and the       Republic of Serbia.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 45.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 45, a resolution  condemning the execution-style murders of the U.S. citizen Bytyqi  brothers in the Republic of Serbia in July 1999.   Let me start by thanking Representative Lee Zeldin for his bipartisan  work in bringing their murderers to justice.   These three brave brothers, whose family hails from what is now  Kosovo, were simply trying to help a Romanian family find safety  outside Kosovo when they were trapped at an unmarked administrative  border. After 15 days of jail, the brothers were taken by a special  operations unit of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs, where they  lost their lives at the hands of Serbian officials.   The brothers were in their early twenties. Their bodies were not  found until 2 years later, buried atop a mass grave of Kosovo  civilians. In the 23 years since, the United States has been promised  that justice will be delivered, yet not one person has been found  guilty of their murder.   This measure would call on the Serbian Government to prioritize the  investigation and prosecution of their murders, and on the United  States to devote the resources necessary to assist in bringing them to  justice.   The 116th Congress passed this resolution, and it is my hope that  this Congress does the same. These three young men deserve justice and  accountability.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 45 will ensure that the United States is  doing everything in our power to bring the murderers of United States  citizens Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi to justice.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Lee Zeldin for his leadership on  this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to join us by voting in the  affirmative.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 892) calling on the Government of the Republic  of Rwanda to release Paul Rusesabagina on humanitarian grounds, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 892         Whereas, in August 2020, Rwandan political activist Paul       Rusesabagina, a United States lawful permanent resident and a       Presidential Medal of Freedom Honoree, was extrajudicially       transferred from Texas to Kigali, Rwanda, by way of the       United Arab  [[Page H5715]]       Emirates, and subjected to an enforced disappearance for       three days before the Government of the Republic of Rwanda       acknowledged his detention, during which time he was       reportedly tortured;        Whereas, in December 2020, more than 36 Members of Congress       wrote to President Paul Kagame to urge him to return Paul       Rusesabagina to the United States and expressed grave concern       with the manner in which the Government of Rwanda       extrajudicially transferred Mr. Rusesabagina from the United       Arab Emirates to Rwanda and then immediately placed him in       solitary confinement and charged him with multiple crimes;        Whereas, on February 11, 2021, the European Parliament       adopted a resolution on ``Rwanda, the case of Paul       Rusesabagina'', which in part ``[e]xpresses deep concern       about the violations of Mr Rusesabagina's rights; urges the       Rwandan authorities to allow Mr Rusesabagina to undergo a       fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and       impartial tribunal applying international human rights       standards . . .'';        Whereas the American Bar Association's Center for Human       Rights' June 2021 report ``The Case of Paul Rusesabagina''       concluded that, ``it is clear that Mr. Rusesabagina's fair       trial rights - in particular his right to confidential       communication, his right to the presumption of innocence, and       his right to prepare his defense - have been violated,       potentially to the irreparable prejudice of the defense,       calling into question the fairness of any potential       convicting verdict'';        Whereas, on September 20, 2021, the High Court of Rwanda       convicted Paul Rusesabagina of terrorism-related offences and       he was sentenced to 25 years in prison;        Whereas United States Department of State Spokesman Ned       Price announced on September 20, 2021, that the United States       Government is ``concerned by the Government of Rwanda's       conviction of U.S. lawful permanent resident Paul       Rusesabagina'' and stated that the ``reported lack of fair       trial guarantees calls into question the fairness of the       verdict'';        Whereas, on October 7, 2021, the European Parliament       adopted a resolution on ``The case of Paul Rusesabagina in       Rwanda'', which ``[c]alls for the immediate release of Mr       Rusesabagina on humanitarian grounds and for his repatriation       without prejudice to his guilt or innocence; demands that the       EU Delegation to Rwanda and the diplomatic representations of       the Member States strongly convey this request in their       exchanges with the Rwandan authorities'';        Whereas on May 19, 2022, the Department of State determined       that Paul Rusesabagina was ``wrongfully detained'', and that       ``the determination took into account the totality of the       circumstances, notably the lack of fair trial guarantees       during his trial'', pursuant to the Robert Levinson Hostage       Recovery and Hostage-Taking Accountability Act (Public Law       116-260); and        Whereas Paul Rusesabagina is a cancer survivor and suffers       from a cardiovascular disorder and his family states that he       has missed multiple medical appointments, including cancer       screenings: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) calls on the Government of Rwanda to immediately       release Paul Rusesabagina on humanitarian grounds and permit       him to return safely to the United States;        (2) calls on the Government of Rwanda to ensure Paul       Rusesabagina receives access to appropriate, qualified       medical professionals and all medical care necessary to       guarantee his physical integrity and psychological well-      being;        (3) urges the United States Government in all interactions       with the Government of Rwanda to raise the case of Paul       Rusesabagina and to press for his immediate release on       humanitarian grounds; and        (4) expresses support to the family of Paul Rusesabagina       and their commitment to bringing Paul Rusesabagina home.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 892, as amended, calling on the  Government of the Republic of Rwanda to release Paul Rusesabagina on  humanitarian grounds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 892, which calls for the  release of Paul Rusesabagina on humanitarian grounds.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Chairman Castro, for drafting this  important measure.   Nearly 30 years ago, Paul Rusesabagina, a Belgian citizen and  permanent resident of the United States, risked his life to protect  more than a thousand people during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In honor  of his singular and valiant actions during one of the worst human  rights crises and mass murders in history, he was given the  Presidential Medal of Freedom.   In August 2020, Paul Rusesabagina boarded a plane in the UAE that he  believed was headed to Burundi only to arrive in the capital of Rwanda  and be arrested by Rwandan authorities under dubious terrorism-related  charges.   In September, despite a lack of due process and fair trial, he was  sentenced to 25 years in prison. He has been placed in solitary  confinement and charged with numerous crimes of no credence.   The Rwandan Government's unlawful actions, including the  extrajudicial transfer of Mr. Rusesabagina from the UAE to Rwanda and  his deteriorating medical condition while detained, are of great  concern.   The Department of State has now determined that he was wrongfully  detained pursuant to the Robert Levinson Hostage Recovery and Hostage- Taking Accountability Act. As such, this resolution calls for the  immediate release and return of Mr. Rusesabagina on humanitarian  grounds.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the administration to raise the case of Mr.  Rusesabagina in all interactions with the Rwandan Government and  continue to press for his immediate release on humanitarian grounds.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Castro), who is the chair of the Subcommittee on  International Development, International Organizations, and Global  Corporate Social Impact.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, Paul Rusesabagina's history and circumstances as a war  hero wrongfully detained and denied adequate medical care is one that  we cannot ignore. Congress must stand with Paul Rusesabagina's family  who have not wavered in championing his legacy and calling attention to  his plight to call for his immediate release and return to the United  States on humanitarian grounds.   Mr. Speaker, I, again, thank Chairman Castro for his leadership on  this resolution. I urge all my colleagues to join us by voting in the  affirmative, and I yield back the balance of my time.
