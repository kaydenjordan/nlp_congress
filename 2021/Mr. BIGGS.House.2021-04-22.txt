 Mr. Speaker, let me tell you what Democrat support is  really about on H.R. 51: Democratic partisanship, Democrat power,  Democrat policy, Democrat progressive issues.   No State has been admitted by the Constitution. No State was created  from a territory, which was crafted in the Constitution. That is what  you want to obviate.   Even our Founders understood this very clearly, as they iterated, in  Federalist No. 43, ``The indispensable necessity of complete authority  at the seat of government carries its own evidence with it. It is a  power exercised by every legislature of the Union, I might say of the  world, by virtue of its general supremacy. Without it, not only the  public authority might be insulted and its proceedings interrupted with  impunity; but a dependence of the members of the general government on  the State comprehending the seat of the government, for protection in  the exercise of their duty, might bring on the national councils an  imputation of awe or influence. . . . `'   That is what is at stake here. H.R. 51 is bad, according to the  Founders, but it also violates the 23rd Amendment. That is clear as  well.   It is time that the Democrats realize it and quit trying this power  grab and vote this thing down.
