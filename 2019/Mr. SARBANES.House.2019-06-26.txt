 Mr. Speaker, on June 28, 2018, a gunman shot and killed  five employees of the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Maryland.  The Annapolis community, which I have the privilege of representing,  was shaken to its core and will continue to grieve for years to come.  But that same community also reached deep within itself to find an  amazing resiliency which helped lift up the families who were  victimized by this unconscionable act of violence.   On this anniversary and in solidarity with those families as well as  hundreds of friends, coworkers, and acquaintances, we honor the memory  of Rob Hiaasen, Wendi Winters, Gerald Fischman, John McNamara, and  Rebecca Smith.   We must also confront the fact that those targeted by this cowardly  assault were members of our valued local press corps. In America we  cherish our free and independent press. We honor our journalists who  follow the facts and find the truth. This terrible tragedy struck at  the heart of newsrooms large and small across the country.   The day after this tragedy the Capital Gazette went to press--an  inspiring act of courage and determination that rallied the Annapolis  community.   Today, as we remember Rob, Wendi, Gerald, John, and Rebecca, let us  also honor the courage of the whole Capital Gazette staff. Their  dedication, their service to our community, and their commitment to a  vibrant free press are a tribute to the journalism profession.
