 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2.   For decades, the U.S. immigration system has needed to be fixed.  Every step of the way, Republicans failed to work with Democrats on  effective solutions, instead blocking meaningful reform efforts for the  past 20 years. The crisis we face now is in large part because of that.  H.R. 2 is not the solution.   As my colleague from Texas Rep. Cuellar has said, Republican attempts  to solve immigration by building a wall ``is a 14th century solution to  a 21st century problem.'' A wall is not a solution to a complex issue.   H.R. 2 takes away critical asylum protections for those fleeing  domestic violence and people whose lives are in imminent danger.   Secondly, the bill reinstitutes Trump-era detention centers that rip  families apart, separating children from their parents. As of February  2023, nearly 1,000 migrant children separated at the U.S.-Mexico border  by the Trump administration have yet to be reunited with their  parents--more than two years after the former president left office.  [[Page H2281]]    Finally, H.R. 2 removes crucial funding for legal representation for  unaccompanied children--depriving them of trusted counsel in  immigration proceedings. Vulnerable children deserve reliable legal  representation to reunite them safely with their families.   Mr. Speaker, extreme MAGA Republicans want to take us back to the  failed illegal and immoral policies of the Trump administration. Those  cruel and extreme immigration actions weakened the U.S. economy,  undermined our nation's stance in protecting human rights, and  threatened the potential of immigrants who come here seeking a better  life.   I stand ready to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle,  business leaders, faith leaders, community leaders, and law enforcement  on meaningful immigration reform. Just as we cannot forget the  DREAMers, we cannot cast aside those seeking a better future for  themselves and their families.
