 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5323, which  provides funding for Israel's Iron Dome system.   I have a long record of supporting Israel and am proud to support  this bill today.   We originally secured funding for Iron Dome in the continuing  resolution that was filed Tuesday morning. Unfortunately, that funding  was then stripped out to address concerns on the Democrat side, and a  new CR was introduced.   In addition, Republicans voted for my motion to recommit, which could  have addressed this issue, but the majority party was united in voting  against it.   Let me explain why this bill is important to pass as quickly as  possible. Four months ago, Israel was under attack from terrorists. The  rocket fire into Israel was unprecedented. Countless civilian lives  were saved because of the Iron Dome system that the United States has  supported year after year.   Due to the attacks this last spring, Iron Dome rocket interceptors  need to be replenished. This funding is critical and time-sensitive. We  must ensure Israel has what it needs to defend itself in the face of  real and growing threats.   Providing this funding sends an important message to Israel and those  who wish them harm, that the United States stands with Israel and  against terrorists. We must reassure our ally that America will never  turn its back on the great State of Israel.   I urge passage and reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Womack), the ranking member of the Financial Services and  General Government Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fleischmann), and I ask unanimous consent  that he control the remainder of the time.
