 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Foxx) for yielding.   I rise today in opposition to the PRO Act.   I have heard some things from the other side of the aisle about how  workers earn more in States that are not right-to-work.   Of the right-to-work States, according to the U.S. Department of  Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, 7 of the top 10 States in wage  increases are right-to-work States. The highest right-to-work State,  number one, saw an increase in wages over the period of time from 2001  to 2019 of 20 percentage points, which is 20 percentage points more  than the closest right-to-work State.   This is not a bill about helping workers. This is a bill about  getting in the way of the relationship between the employee and  employer.                                time  1615    This is just another Democrat messaging bill that is nothing short of  a special interest giveaway. The PRO Act needlessly inserts more  government control into the employee-employer relationships.   At a roundtable I held with businessowners in Pennsylvania's 12th  Congressional District, I heard firsthand how legislation like this  would negatively impact their ability to grow and raise wages.   One of the many onerous provisions in this legislation is the  allowance for intermittent strikes and banning permanent replacements.  I am offering an amendment today to remove the intermittent striking  provisions of this bill.   Intermittent striking would cripple the ability of job creators to do  business and raise prices on consumers. Even if this amendment were  adopted, I still have significant reservations about the bill. That is  because the PRO Act is also terrible for employees.   Cloaked in the language of employee protection, the real result of  the PRO Act is providing workers with fewer choices, fewer rights, and  the inability to speak for themselves.    Strikingly, the PRO Act would destroy employee privacy  rights by requiring employers to give away employee identifying  information to union bosses.   If Congress really cares about jobs, the economy, and workers'  rights, it should say ``no'' to the PRO Act.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 2474.  This amendment would maintain current law, which protects the ability  of employers to continue to do business and provide for their customers  during a labor relations dispute.   One of the purposes of the National Labor Relations Act was to  ``eliminate . . . substantial obstructions to the free flow of  commerce.'' After the economic chaos of the 1930s, Congress passed the  NLRA.   The NLRA struck a careful balance by protecting workers' ability to  strike while outlawing intermittent strikes that create upheaval and  uncertainty in the absence of a genuine commitment by the employees to  abandon their work.                                time  1800    Similarly, the Supreme Court has upheld the right of employers to  replace striking workers permanently in order to keep their business  running.   H.R. 2474 discards more than 80 years of precedent by weaponizing the  pain of economic conflict in order to empower union bosses. The bill  aims to make it impossible for employers to continue to do business in  the event of a labor dispute, a death sentence for thousands of small  businesses.   In 1937, there were nearly 5,000 strikes in the United States, a  nightmare for employers, customers, and the economy as a whole. H.R.  2474 seeks to resurrect this chaotic time in America's history. Imagine  what a system that allows for intermittent strikes and bans on the  replacement of striking workers would do to our economy, our global  competitiveness, and the incentive to invest in American workers.   Allowing intermittent strikes and banning permanent replacements is  great for union bosses, but a raw deal for workers, consumers, and  small businesses.   Having worked in the manufacturing sector for over 25 years, I know  it is critically important for the overall health of a business to be  reliable and keep the doors open so employees can keep their jobs.   You cannot be pro-jobs and antibusiness. If a business cannot do its  work, then its purpose no longer exists. Competition will inherently  force businesses to close.   Allowing intermittent strikes and banning permanent replacements  could force businesses to close their doors permanently. I urge my  colleagues to adopt this amendment to protect small businesses and to  prevent unnecessary disruptions of our economy.   Madam Chairwoman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, I yield back the balance of my time.
