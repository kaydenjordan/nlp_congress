 Madam Speaker, like many Americans, chills  ran through my spine when I heard Governor Northam casually endorse  killing a baby after it was born. It has been over a week since those  comments, and I ask, Why are our Democrat colleagues still silent?   Killing a baby, once born, is infanticide, pure and simple.   It is 2019, and we live in the most advanced country in the world.  Surely, every Member of this body can agree that, at the very least,  babies, once born, should be protected.   That is why I come to the floor today to urge Speaker Pelosi to allow  a vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill that  would require medical care for infants born alive during an abortion  procedure.   I urge my colleagues across the aisle to join us to end infanticide.                            ____________________
