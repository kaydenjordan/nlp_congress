 Madam President, I am delighted to join my colleagues  today from the Finance Committee. Our chairman is here. We did, I  think, remarkable work to expand the  [[Page S5665]]  child tax credit during the COVID epidemic, and it made a truly  remarkable difference in children's lives--nearly 50 percent reduction  in child poverty. Why would you not want more of that? Yet we let it  expire in 2021, and, sure enough, child poverty climbed back up again.   There was a lot of fearmongering, when we did it, that this was going  to discourage people from working, that they would sit at home and sop  up the tax credit. But the fact of the matter is, if you can't get  childcare, you can't get to work. And if you can't get reliable,  quality childcare, you can't move up into the kind of job where you  don't have to worry about being called away because your childcare just  fell apart.   So in Rhode Island at least, we saw families do more work as a result  of this, and 174,000 Rhode Island children benefited. Families got $264  million--low-income families--to pay for childcare, get to work, or  step up to a better job.   At the same time, we also provided additional funding for childcare  providers in that same American rescue plan, and that was another win.  And you put the two together, and it really lifted families.   Right now, without Congressional action, 3 million children are  projected to lose access to childcare, and 70,000 childcare programs  could close.   Bring that to Rhode Island, and it is 21,000 kids in my State who  could lose access to childcare, 680 childcare workers could lose their  jobs, and 419 different childcare providers could close.   We simply cannot let that happen. It is wrong. It is dumb. It is  penny-wise and pound-foolish.   We need to do three simple things: Make childcare a priority,  encourage work and earning, and reduce child poverty. We can do those  three things by reestablishing the child tax credit and continuing to  support childcare providers.    Madam President, H.R. 6363, a continuing resolution  to avoid a shutdown, was enacted into law this month. Division B of the  bill contains several authorizing provisions, such as a 1-year  extension of the farm bill and a 2-month extension of Federal funding  for community health centers that are paid for over 10 years. Section  121(c) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 contains a reserve fund  that authorizes the Budget Committee chairman to revise budget  aggregates, committee allocations, and the pay-as-you-go ledger for  legislation that would not increase the deficit over the period of  fiscal years 2024 to 2033. Division B of H.R. 6363 meets the conditions  of that reserve fund. However, the legislation directs that these  budgetary effects are not to be entered on the PAYGO scorecard. As  such, I am revising only the budget aggregates and committee  allocations to accommodate H.R. 6363.   I previously revised the pay-as-you-go ledger for H.R. 5860, the  September continuing resolution. As the legislation has now been signed  into law and directs that its budgetary effects are not to be entered  on the PAYGO scorecard, I am reversing the PAYGO adjustment I made in  October.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                   PAY-AS-YOU-GO SCORECARD FOR THE SENATE   (Pursuant to Section 121(c) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023)                              ($ in billions) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                Balances ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Balances:     Fiscal Year 2024.......................................        0.257     Fiscal Years 2024-2028.................................        0.438     Fiscal Years 2024-2033.................................       -0.002 Revisions:     Fiscal Year 2024.......................................       -0.257     Fiscal Years 2024-2028.................................       -0.438     Fiscal Years 2024-2033.................................        0.002 Revised Balances:     Fiscal Year 2024.......................................            0     Fiscal Years 2024-2028.................................            0     Fiscal Years 2024-2033.................................            0 ------------------------------------------------------------------------         REVISIONS TO BUDGET AGGREGATES--BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAYS   (Pursuant to Section 121(c) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023)                              ($ in billions) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  2024 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority.......................................    4,957.066  [[Page S5670]]        Outlays................................................    5,081.501 Adjustment:     Budget Authority.......................................        1.589     Outlays................................................        0.954 Revised Aggregates:     Budget Authority.......................................    4,958.655     Outlays................................................    5,082.455 ------------------------------------------------------------------------                 REVISIONS TO ALLOCATIONS TO SENATE COMMITTEES   (Pursuant to Section 121(c) of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023)                              ($ in billions) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                        2024      2024-2028    2024-2033 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture, Nutrition, and  Forestry:     Budget Authority.............      190.758    1,002.518    2,088.798     Outlays......................      191.517      972.954    1,974.649 Adjustments:     Budget Authority.............            0            0            0     Outlays......................        0.159        0.048            0 Revised Allocation:     Budget Authority.............      190.758    1,002.518    2,088.798     Outlays......................      191.676      973.002    1,974.649 Finance:     Budget Authority.............    3,449.542   19,587.359   46,205.293     Outlays......................    3,458.396   19,589.773   46,198.480 Adjustments:     Budget Authority.............        0.771       -1.818       -0.818     Outlays......................        0.484       -1.434       -0.818 Revised Allocation:     Budget Authority.............    3,450.313   19,585.541   46,204.475     Outlays......................    3,458.880   19,588.339   46,197.662 Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions:     Budget Authority.............       59.797      255.274      505.369     Outlays......................       85.647      295.807      521.863 Adjustments:     Budget Authority.............        0.818        0.818        0.818     Outlays......................        0.311        0.818        0.818 Revised Allocation:     Budget Authority.............       60.615      256.092      506.187     Outlays......................       85.958      296.625      522.681 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note: The adjustments represent the direct spending effects of Division   B of H.R. 6363.
