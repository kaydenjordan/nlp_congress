The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) and the Senator from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Toomey).    I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum  call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this week marks the continuation of a  bipartisan effort to actually do the work we were elected to do.   The New York Times recently published an article that said the Senate  got its groove back. I don't know if I would go that far, but certainly  we are making some progress when it comes to these important funding  bills.   These two appropriation bills are two of the largest ones in the  Federal Government. One, of course, is for the Department of Defense  which, appropriately, is the No. 1 priority of the Federal Government-- to maintain the peace and keep our Nation safe. The other funds the  Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.   After we pass these bills this week, which we will, we will have  passed 9 of the 12 appropriations bills, which cover 87 percent of  discretionary spending.   I might add that when I mention discretionary spending, it is  noteworthy that about 70 percent of what the Federal Government spends  is not discretionary spending. It is mandatory spending, which is  another story in and of itself.   But insofar as the Congress's responsibility to appropriate the funds  in discretionary spending, we will have covered about 87 percent of  that.   I want to express my gratitude again to Chairman Shelby and Vice  Chairman Leahy for their efforts in facilitating such a relatively  smooth process on all of our appropriations bills so far. They have  done a good job of managing the bills and, even more importantly, of  managing the people and preventing this process from devolving into a  quagmire, as it occasionally does.   To give you an idea of how difficult this can be, it bears mentioning  that it has been 15 years since the Senate last passed the Labor- Health-Education bill in time for the start of the fiscal year. So hats  off to Mr. Shelby and Mr. Leahy. As the majority leader, Senator  McConnell, said yesterday, these two bills represent big strides toward  avoiding another omnibus, which the President said he wanted to do, and  appropriating the taxpayers' money the right way.   The funding bills we are working on this week are important, but they  are not the only developments worth noting. Remember, recently we heard  that in the second quarter of this year--the second 3-month period of  this year--our economy grew at an astounding 4.1 percent after years of  economic stagnation and wages that never seemed to go up. We were able  to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act at the end of last year, which helped  provide a needed stimulus to the economy by putting more money into the  pockets of the people who earned it. We were successful in lowering  rates across the board and doubled the child tax credit and standard  deduction.   Over the last 9 months, my constituents in Texas have been writing to  me about the effect it has had on their lives. These are men and women  like Virginia Davis, a small business owner who said the changes will  help keep expenses down and help her company buy new equipment. Then  there is Suzan Casey, a widow in New Braunfels, TX, which is north of  San Antonio, who is working part time even when facing health issues.  She wrote and said that she appreciated our efforts at reforming our  outdated Tax Code and that every little bit helps, especially when she  has been saving up the money to go visit her grandson in California.   In Texas, our economy has been robust for a long time now. We heard  that last month, more than 23,000 jobs were added--the 25th consecutive  month of job growth in my home State. In some places, such as Midland  in the Permian Basin, which is the center of the universe when it comes  to oil and gas production, it seems, the unemployment rate was as low  as 2.2 percent. It is hard to find anybody who will work in the Permian  Basin, in the  [[Page S5752]]  Midland-Odessa area, because the economy is so strong that every able- bodied, willing worker is essentially employed. These are positive  signs, although obviously there are stresses and strains that go along  with it.   Tax reform and the good economic news are complemented by other  legislative victories we have had on behalf of the American people  during this Congress.   We funded rebuilding efforts following natural disasters, such as  Hurricane Harvey.   We enacted the Fix NICS Act and the STOP School Violence Act to help  protect Americans from gun violence.   We delivered real healthcare choices to American veterans with the VA  MISSION Act.   We passed occupational licensing reform, as well as banking reform,  which helped our small banks, credit unions, and community banks get  rid of some of the rules that never should have been applied to them in  the first place because they weren't the cause of the huge crisis that  led to the great recession just a few short years ago. It wasn't the  community banks--it was Wall Street and some of the overreach there-- but community banks in small towns in and around Texas and elsewhere  were the collateral damage.   This last year and a half, we fought sex trafficking by passing  legislation targeting internet predators, and we have worked hard and I  think helped to reduce the rape kit backlog.   We have confirmed a total of 53 judges this Congress, including 26  circuit court judges, 26 district judges, and a Supreme Court Justice,  Neil Gorsuch.                        Nomination of Brett Kavanaugh    Mr. President, 2 weeks from today, we will start the confirmation  hearing of the next Supreme Court Justice we will consider, and that is  Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated to succeed Justice  Anthony Kennedy as an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.   As I said, his hearing is set for the first week of September, and I  hope we will move quickly to vote on his confirmation after the  hearing. His confirmation process includes the largest production of  documents ever in the Senate's consideration of a Supreme Court  nominee. I appreciate Chairman Chuck Grassley's spearheading the effort  in such a transparent, efficient, and thorough manner.   To see how a judge will behave once elevated to the Supreme Court,  the best evidence of how they will perform their job is how they have  performed as a lower court judge, as Judge Kavanaugh has been over the  last 12 years in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. The best way to find  out about his judicial philosophy, his temperament, and how he actually  handles cases is to look at how he has done each of those things during  the 12 years he has served on the DC Circuit. Yet we have heard some of  our colleagues on the other side, including the minority leader and the  former Judiciary chairman, Senator Leahy, who actually used to agree  with us that the best way to evaluate a nominee--for example, during  Justice Sotomayor's hearing--was by looking at their judicial record,  but now they have changed their tune.   In Judge Kavanaugh's case, what the rulings show consistently is that  he is a diligent and thoughtful judge. His rulings are clear, they are  impartial, and he strives to achieve justice in each one.   Yesterday, I mentioned some of the cases in which Judge Kavanaugh's  opinions, whether written as part of the majority opinion or the  dissent, were vindicated by an adoption of that position and that  opinion, essentially, by the Supreme Court on a 9-to-0 basis, but I  would like to talk about another couple of arguments that have now  started to bubble up.   As I like to say, a false charge unrebutted is sometimes a charge  believed, so we have to work hard to remind people that just because  someone says something about Judge Kavanaugh's record, it is not  necessarily true.   The first claim that has now popped up is that he is somehow an  ``anti-worker radical.'' This is a phrase coined by the pundit Paul  Krugman of the New York Times. It sounds pretty ugly. I guess it means  that the judge is predisposed, when deciding cases, to find against  employees and hard-working men and women in favor of management and big  business. But the fact is, Judge Kavanaugh's record indicates exactly  the opposite.   In one case, a pro se litigant had been terminated after filing a  discrimination complaint. Judge Kavanaugh joined the majority in a  ruling for the employee, finding that a reasonable jury could have  found unlawful discrimination, harassment, and retaliation against the  plaintiff. That doesn't sound like an anti-worker radical to me.   Judge Kavanaugh wrote a separate concurrence that a racial epithet  that may have been used could create a hostile work environment, even  if uttered a single time.   In another case, involving a terrible accident involving a trainer of  a killer whale at a theme park, Judge Kavanaugh did not simply defer to  large corporate interests. In fact, the strict question of liability,  which would have implicated State and Federal tort law, was not even  before him, nor was the question of whether the work environment at the  theme park was unreasonably dangerous. Instead, the question before the  court and before Judge Kavanaugh was one of administrative law.   Judge Kavanaugh argued persuasively that a Federal agency had ignored  congressional intent when interpreting a statute in self-serving ways  to give itself, the Federal agency, authority that Congress had not  conferred. He argued that this agency had made arbitrary distinctions  between different kinds of sporting and entertainment events and  departed from longstanding agency precedent. That actually was the crux  of his decision, despite the mischaracterization from some of the  critics.   We can count on Judge Kavanaugh to appropriately consider overreach  by the administrative state and to enforce the rule of law that  protects both corporations and individual workers. I think we have  plenty evidence of that.   One additional line of attack is that the judge has somehow been  insufficiently protective of Fourth Amendment privacy rights, but one  expert at the libertarian Cato Institute who has analyzed the judge's  record in detail found that Judge Kavanaugh is a ``big step forward for  constitutional liberty.'' Among other things, this expert noted that  Judge Kavanaugh had been a leading advocate of interpreting statutes to  include robust mens rea protection. In other words, in criminal  statutes, before you can be convicted of a crime, you have to have  criminal intent. That is mens rea.   Judge Kavanaugh has authored 307 opinions on the DC Circuit and has  attracted praise from across the ideological spectrum for the clarity  of his thought and expression and the precision of his legal reasoning.  He respects the roles and responsibilities that are assigned to the  different branches of our government by the Constitution, and he sees  the proper role of the judiciary as a narrow one, albeit an important  one. It does not make policy. It interprets the law and applies it to  individual cases, one at a time, impartially, with no eye toward the  outcome or the politics of the case.   The truth is, I believe that after the hearing we will have the week  of September 4, the American people will conclude, as I have concluded  based on my knowledge of Judge Kavanaugh for the last 18 years, that he  is an eminently qualified and well-respected jurist by all those who  know him and are familiar with his work. I look forward to confirming  him as a Justice early this fall, hopefully in time for the October  term of the Supreme Court, the first Monday in October.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
