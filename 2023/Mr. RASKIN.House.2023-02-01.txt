 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We strongly oppose this bill, which is an assault on all the progress  we have made over the last several years in telework policy. Telework  has strengthened private and public workplaces across the land,  enhanced productivity, increased efficiency, improved the morale and  satisfaction of the workforce, reduced traffic congestion, and made  positive environmental changes.   When the chairman says it is time to return to work, I believe this  is a misnomer because people who participate in telework are working.  They are already working, and so they don't need to return to work.   This bill would take a sledgehammer to Federal telework policy and  law, which the sponsors seem completely oblivious to, and you can  hardly blame them because the leadership brings this measure forward  without the benefit of even a single hearing in the Oversight  Committee, which means Congress has not heard from the Office of  Personnel Management or any of the Federal agency chiefs, and it has  not heard from any Federal workers or their collective bargaining  representatives. It hasn't heard from any of the stakeholders other  than secondhand, I guess,  [[Page H601]]  through hearsay the Mayor of Washington, D.C., who not surprisingly  seems to be resistant, at least according to that report, to telework  policy.   This is an arbitrary effort to roll back all of the progress that has  been made under legislation and administrative rules over the last  decade without any participation at all of the key stakeholders.   The bill falsely equates the development of telework as part of a  balanced Federal workplace policy by OPM and the agencies with the  sudden and near complete shift to virtual work in certain sectors  because of the pandemic. Those are two completely different things.   This conflation produces nothing but confusion, and the bill is a  wrecking ball against telework policy, which has been a critical  success in so many workplaces.   Colleagues, the workplace is changing because of extraordinary new  technology and a new focus on productivity and efficiency as opposed to  industrial-age assembly-line seating and command-and-control work  relations.   Before the pandemic, hybrid and remote work were already growing far  more prevalent across professions, particularly for jobs performed in  an office setting. The pandemic accelerated these dynamics not only in  the Federal workplace but even more dramatically in the private sector.   From fiscal year 2019 to 2020, as we entered the pandemic, Federal  telework doubled from roughly 500,000 people to more than a million.  Practically overnight, traditional barriers to telework, such as  technological obstacles and management resistance, began to disappear.  Federal agencies implemented sweeping new guidelines as an essential  tool for the continuity of government operations.   The pandemic, of course, will not last forever. Indeed, the President  announced that he plans to end the public health emergency on May 11.  The Federal Government will not maintain a pandemic-level telework  posture in perpetuity, but we cannot ignore the lessons that we have  learned over the last several years.   As OPM put it in its 2021 annual report on the status of telework,  ``there is no going back.'' Enhanced demand in the national workforce  and among Federal employees will continue as workers and supervisors  report greatly enhanced productivity and focus from flexible work  practices that reduce time wasted in endless in-person meetings,  watercooler gossip sessions, and the proverbial BS sessions that  overcome so many people's offices.   According to a survey by The Conference Board, 82 percent of  companies are going to offer hybrid work options to employees going  forward, and the number of private companies willing to let at least  some portion of their workforce go fully remote has tripled to an  astonishing 36 percent.   In another survey, 63 percent of employees rated the value of 2 to 3  days being able to work from home as equivalent to a pay raise.   To remain competitive with the private sector with which we compete,  the Federal Government must offer reasonable telework options. OPM says  it will, observing that we must appreciate the sea change in the  American labor market.   Telework saves money, helps the government recruit top talent,  reduces traffic gridlock, makes environmental sense, and ensures a  continuity of operations at agencies that Americans rely on every  single day. It is a lifeline for people who have disabilities or are  immunocompromised, and it offers dramatically expanded opportunities  for people living in more rural areas to enter and sustain a career in  the Federal service.   We cannot enter a time machine and simply wish away the utility of  telework in recruiting and retaining new generations of Federal  workers. We should embrace telework as part of a balanced workplace  policy to promote employee satisfaction and overall mission outcome.   OPM Director Kiran Ahuja offers a clear-eyed vision for the future in  her annual report saying, ``Federal agencies must continue to embrace  workplace flexibilities, such as telework, to remain competitive for  top talent. Decisions about telework, however, must be driven by  delivery of mission. We all work for the American public, and how we  best serve them needs to be the paramount consideration.''   That means telework does not make sense for every worker in every  office or every activity. If you are guarding the Capitol, obviously  you need to be present. If you are researching groups that were  involved in the insurrection against the Capitol, you might be able to  work part of that time virtually. Processing paper tax returns at the  IRS may indeed require in-person work.   I will note that although people are blaming the problems with IRS  responsiveness on telework, that does not make sense to me. Telephone  work is something that can be done from the office, home office, or  somewhere else, which is why we have been, on our side of the aisle,  invested in increasing staff at the IRS because our constituents are so  frustrated with being left on the phone and not getting answers  returned about when they will be getting their IRS refund.   In the Inflation Reduction Act, we added 5,000 new positions for  people on the phones to respond to our constituents. I know that some  of our colleagues across the aisle have opposed additional funding for  IRS positions, and that is surely a far more likely culprit than  whatever telework policies are in place over at the IRS.   The Biden administration's telework guidance seeks to strike a  balance between getting people who need to be in person back in the  office safely and helping agencies design their post-pandemic telework  plans to build off the prior successes of this policy.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I will tell you a story about a couple that both work for the Federal  Government. Earlier this month, the spouse of an Army servicemember,  seeking approval to go work overseas for the State Department,  contacted the Oversight Committee because she was being forced to  decide between quitting her very successful Federal career for the  State Department or returning to Washington, D.C., to continue her  Federal service without her husband and her two children.   Her agency was fighting desperately to maintain her expertise and was  perfectly fine with her performing her duties from overseas with her  husband, who is in the Army who was being relocated over there.   Luckily, we were able to help make sure that her overseas telework  request was approved.   Now, is that someone who is not really working? Do we want to tell  her to get back to work?  [[Page H602]]    Her situation is common for thousands of families in the Federal  workforce where you have one member who is in the military who is being  relocated, the other who might be working at a site in Washington who  is now able to work out the terms of service under the telework policy,  but that is precisely an element of the policy that will be crushed by  the legislation that has been brought forward without the benefit of a  single hearing in the Oversight and Accountability Committee.   Despite the fact that our colleagues have said that they will only  bring legislation to the floor after there has been a hearing--and we  are just a few weeks into the session--this legislation comes forward  without hearing from anybody like this constituent who was being put in  such a tough posture or the Directors of the agencies or the head of  the Office of Personnel Management who is in charge of actually  supervising and coordinating overall telework policy and making the  annual report to Congress.    Telework is a vital tool for the government to recruit and retain and  grow the talented workforce we need to make the Federal Government  work. It ensures that Federal workers can serve the Nation even during  disasters. Again, it was the preexisting telework policy that  established the infrastructure that made for such a relatively smooth  transition when we got into the pandemic.   I have to say that denials of telework for the spouses of military  personnel are still common, and they are consequential, and they would  be pervasive if the legislation passed. I hope that all our colleagues  will reject this and at the very least send it back to the Oversight  Committee for some real hearings so we can talk about what this really  means.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  address two points. One, let's grab the bull by the horns with this IRS  point. The President's budget included $80 billion to increase staffing  and to update technology at the IRS so our constituents can get their  calls returned. If you are waiting for your IRS tax refund, that is  something that you have planned on. That is part of your family budget.  If it is stuck somehow, it is extremely frustrating for people not to  be able to get through.   Now they, bizarrely to my mind, blame telework for this, and they  oppose the $80 billion. I think they say that will create 75,000 or  100,000 new IRS agents who will be chasing working-class people around  the country.   On the contrary, we have a report showing the $80 billion will  produce $200 billion in new revenue and it is rich people who are the  ones who are being protected by the refusal of my colleagues to invest  in the IRS.   Telework is a complete distraction. It is an absolute red herring. It  has nothing to do with whether or not you want to invest in the IRS or  not.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Mfume), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, they complain about delays at the IRS and then they  oppose funding to assist the overwhelmed workforce at the IRS, which is  staggering under the weight of all of these obligations.   This is the first time I have heard that telework was the source of  the problem, but apparently, that is what it is this week. Of course,  we haven't had a real hearing so we have had no witnesses on it;  somebody has apparently just dreamed that up.   It has just been linked to the debt ceiling. Interesting that my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle has voted to lift the debt  ceiling three different times under Donald Trump, who increased the  debt of the United States single-handedly by more than 20 percent. All  of the debt of the United States under one President. More than 20  percent.   Mr. Speaker, let's get back to the issue at hand.   Members of Congress make very strange opponents of telework policy,  not because we don't work hard, because I think we do work hard, but we  use telework all the time.   Members of Congress might be in their district office working. They  might be at a town hall meeting working. They might be here on the  floor. They might be in a committee meeting, a subcommittee meeting.  They might be meeting with constituents somewhere else.   And I dare say the vast majority, if not all of us, engage in  telework. We wouldn't say to them, ``Get back to work and stop  teleworking.'' We understand that that is part of an overall telework  policy.   If people have employees who they think are abusing telework, well,  they have got a problem with that employee or they have a problem with  their supervisor. But to my experience and knowledge, as someone who, I  admit, may have been a little curmudgeonly, in the way we are hearing  some of the Members are today, when the COVID-19 crisis started, the  employees who are super productive at work will be super productive at  home.   In my case, that is almost all of them. In fact, I think it is all of  them. If you have an employee who blows off their assignments at work  and doesn't turn them in, they will do the same thing if they are  working from home. That is a question of supervision. The real issue  is, why all of a sudden they want to turn against a decade of progress  on telework policy and start affixing to it all of these other  problems.    For that, I don't understand, other than people seem to want to blame  the Federal workers for everything. Those workers belong to all of our  districts. They are all across the country. Eighty percent of Federal  workers are not in Washington, D.C., Maryland, or Virginia. They are  all over the country, working everywhere from military bases to Indian  reservations to public health service. You name it.   These are our people. These are American citizens, and they deserve  something a lot more than the implied contempt of suggesting that if  they use telework, they are not really working.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The gentlewoman makes an interesting argument. Of course, if physical  presence in Washington is necessary, then that agency never should have  been stripped from Washington and relocated in Colorado in the first  place.   One could say that entire workforce is calling in or not really  working because the entire office has a telework policy.   Obviously, she has carved out an exception for that. She thinks they  can be effective, even though they are not in Washington, D.C.   Look, Mr. Speaker, this has been not just a closed rule but a closed  process. There was no hearing in the Oversight and Accountability  Committee. Despite the fact that those hearings have been promised,  there has been no hearing about it.   Let me tell you one of the things we would learn if we actually had a  hearing about it. The bill contemplates rolling the clock back to 2019  for every Federal agency. Well, what would that mean for one small  agency, the Federal Communications Commission, which has decided upon a  plan to reduce its leased office space with a savings of  [[Page H606]]  $119 million precisely because of the existence of telework, saying we  don't need all that space?   Now, since we rolled the clock back and presumptively say you can't  do that, we are going to be costing the taxpayers $119 million a year  because they have to go back to their prepandemic plan simply because  we have this one-size-fits-all, categorical, cookie-cutter approach  undertaken without any hearings.   The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office similarly would be forced to  abandon its $12.5 million a year in savings in leasing costs made  possible because of reduced consumption of office space by telework.   Do we really want to say that we hate telework so much, that we  distrust our own workers so much, even though the studies show that it  is yielding benefits in office productivity, that we are going to force  the taxpayers to pay more money for more expensive office space in  downtown Washington, D.C.?   We haven't even looked at the question because there was no hearing  because there was just a rush to get this to the floor so we could tell  workers who are already at work to get back to work.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, some of my colleagues seem to betray no understanding at  all of what Federal telework policy is.   To say that the workforce is not going to the office and it is time  to get back to work simply suggests they don't know that every agency,  every commission, every department makes its own decisions about this  as part of the complete workplace policy, going job classification by  job classification, defining when it makes sense and when it doesn't  make sense.   That is the way that it works, but they want to have a broad-brush,  one-size-fits-all, straitjacket policy where they just decapitate a  decade of progress, using the pandemic or the end of the pandemic as  the excuse for doing that.   To repeat: This is not a Washington problem. The vast majority of the  Federal workforce is spread out across the country.   The hardworking people we see in front of us today who work for the  Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives and for the House are just a  small example of the workforce located in Washington, which is a tiny  minority of the Federal workforce which is all over America.   That flexibility has been given to Federal workforce supervisors all  over the country to deal with. They would clearly try to elevate what I  think is a frivolous talking point over the cost savings that have been  created because of telework policies. They would elevate it over the  increased job performance and job satisfaction that is being  demonstrated in studies around the country. They would elevate it over  the clear success of telework within the private sector.                                time  1500    Oftentimes, my colleagues will say we have to be more like the  private sector. It is the private sector that has been leading the way  here. The Federal workforce has been very much in the rear guard doing  it.   In any event, remember that they are conflating two completely  different things. One is the Federal telework policy that has evolved  over the last decade, and the other is the pandemic.   It is true that the pandemic response was made far more efficient  because there was an infrastructure in place in order to make telework  possible. Those pandemic policies can be reversed without destroying  all the policies that have developed over the last decade.   There are an incredible number of unintended consequences that are  exacerbated by the fact we have not had a single hearing on this  question, which is of fundamental importance to hundreds of thousands  and millions of people across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The title of this bill, the SHOW UP Act, consists of the Stopping  Home Office Work's Unproductive Problems Act. I understand that in  Washington--this really is a Washington problem--there is always a  search for the perfect acronym over the actual meaning of the language,  but this title does some real violence to the English language.   I don't know what an ``unproductive problem'' is. I certainly don't  know what a ``productive problem'' is. I wonder whether the person who  wrote that was working on telework or wrote it at the office. To me, it  makes no difference. Somebody should have said that doesn't really make  any sense for a title for Federal legislation.   In any event, the point is that Members of Congress, as everyone  should know, are able to be very effective, often being in two places  at the same time. You might be at your district office, or you might be  at a townhall meeting in your district, but you call into a meeting  with your chief of staff and your legislative staff, or you call in to  have a meeting with subcommittee staff or what have you. I don't  understand the sudden effort to demonize technology and all the  advances that we have made.   I don't take this to be serious legislation. There was no hearing on  it. There seems to be no effort to convince anyone that it is serious.  I hope we can do better in the days ahead.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
