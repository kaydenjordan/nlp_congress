 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address this  for a minute.    I just want to join with Senator Carper in opposition to  this amendment. While I think it is well-meaning for the State of  Florida, and I think that both Senator Rubio and Senator Scott have  made us aware of this issue, I think that in order to update these  formulas, we should have hearings. We should actually do this in a more  studied, more detailed way than this amendment presents for us to do.   With that, I join my colleague and my chair in opposition to this  amendment.                   Vote on Amendment No. 1471, as Modified     Mr. President, I would also join in the positive  comments to say this meets two issues that I care deeply about and  certainly hit my State, which is the PFAS issue and also small and  disadvantaged communities. It very much helps with safe and clean  drinking water    Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy for this. I pull  up my local newspaper, and the first thing that comes up is listing the  boil water advisories. This is absolutely needed. I think it is a great  idea. I am very much in support of this.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1469     Mr. President, we yield back our time.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1472     I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, this week on the Senate floor, my  colleagues and I have explained how the Drinking Water and Wastewater  Infrastructure Act of 2021 would make significant improvements to our  country's water infrastructure.   After a bipartisan, regular order legislative and amendment process,  we move to final consideration.   This legislation makes meaningful progress on our drinking water and  wastewater challenges that will benefit the States represented by every  single one of us.   It invests heavily in the State revolving loan funds to give our  States that flexibility they need in their funding.   It creates a new grant program specifically for small and  disadvantaged communities to upgrade their systems, fix leaky pipes,  and prevent water loss.   It helps connect low-income households to public water systems or  helps them to get new and better septic tanks.   It supports water infrastructure projects on Indian reservation lands  and in Alaskan Native villages.   It provides assistance to remove and replace lead pipes, as well as  lead testing in schools and childcare centers.   It encourages the next generation to be a part of that water  infrastructure workforce that is so critical.   All of the investments represent the EPW's shared goals of improving  public health and fostering economic growth in all of our communities.   These are just a few of the provisions which I wanted to highlight  and which are informed by particular challenges facing our water  systems in the State of West Virginia, but based on the feedback from  all of our colleagues in both parties and the groundswell of support we  have seen from various water advocacy groups, it is clear that these  provisions will have broad applicability to help communities all across  the United States. It is why we have such a diverse and growing  coalition of more than 70 supporters, from water systems to local  governments, to industry, to labor, to environmental organizations.   Before I wrap up, I would like to thank my colleague and chairman of  our committee and West Virginia-born Chairman Tom Carper.   This legislation represents, I think, a fantastic first effort for  our ongoing work together to address the major concerns of the American  people when it comes to infrastructure and the environment, and in a  thoughtful and fiscally responsible fashion.   His staff has been engaged and candid with mine throughout this  entire process. So, in particular, I would like to thank John Kane, the  lead for Chairman Carper's water team, and his colleague Annie D'Amato,  as well as Tyler Hoffman-Reardon and Mackie McIntosh, who provided  support throughout these negotiations. So thank you. Chairman Carper's  team is led by staff director Mary Frances Repko, who brought her  wealth of experience to bear on this process as well.   I would certainly like to take time to highlight the members of my  team, who worked long hours, nights and weekends, to deliver this  legislation--Jess Kramer, EPW Republican water counsel, and Travis  Cone, who is here with me today, my Republican deputy staff director  and lead for our environmental team. They led the negotiations on our  side and brought us to where we are today.   They had strong assistance from our staff director, Adam Tomlinson,  as well as chief counsel Elizabeth Horner, as well as Max Hyman, one of  our policy staff who contributed to the language we see today in this  bill.   I would like to also thank and congratulate Fisheries, Water, and  Wildlife Subcommittee Chair Tammy Duckworth and Ranking Member Cynthia  Lummis and their staffs for their hard work on this bill. They are two  of my colleagues from my House days, and I am so glad that all of us  are working together again on the same committee, no less, here in the  U.S. Senate   I also appreciate Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee  Chair Ben Cardin, whom I have worked with on a lot of these issues  previously, and also my good friend Ranking Member Kevin Cramer for  providing a lot of input into this legislation.   This has absolutely been a team effort. It is what we are here for,  to work together. I look forward to our team racking up a lot more wins  in infrastructure and beyond over the course of the 117th Congress.   In closing, I just want to reiterate again that passing this  bipartisan bill in a bipartisan way is also very important. We know it  is more than symbolic, but there is symbolism, I think, here because it  shows the American people what we hear all the time when we go home:  that their elected officials in Congress can work together and  collaboratively on issues such as infrastructure. The bill represents  the solid work that comes out of good-faith negotiations.   Chairman Carper and I worked together and never took our eye off of  the mutual goal--a bipartisan bill that can pass both Chambers and be  signed into law. We are here today with that bill. I am proud to be  Chairman Carper's partner, and I appreciate his leadership.  [[Page S2326]]    I hope that as we move forward with other infrastructure packages, we  remember this moment. We know the next couple of weeks and months are  going to be tough, but we can do tough things to deliver for the  American people. That is what we were sent here to do.   So, again, I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this legislation, and  I hope we continue in this spirit.   I yield the floor, or I yield to my partner, Chairman Carper.
