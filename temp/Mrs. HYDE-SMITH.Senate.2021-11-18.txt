 Madam President, the U.S. Supreme Court is set to  hear the most anticipated abortion case in nearly 30 years when it  considers Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization in oral argument  on December 1, 2021. This development allows us to consider the many  people whose dedication to the pro-life cause has led us to this point.  One of those people is former President Donald J. Trump. The pro-life  movement would not be where it is today absent his advocacy for pro- life policies and for conservative judges.   In January 2016, Presidential candidate Trump said, ``America, when  it is at its best, follows a set of rules that have worked since our  Founding. One of those rules is that we, as Americans, revere life and  have done so since our Founders made it the first, and most important,  of our `unalienable' rights.''   He continued, ``Over time, our culture of life in this country has  started sliding toward a culture of death. Perhaps the most significant  piece of evidence to support this assertion is that since Roe v. Wade  was decided by the Supreme Count 43 years ago, over 50 million  Americans never had the chance to enjoy the opportunities offered by  this country. They never had the chance to become doctors, musicians,  farmers, teachers, husbands, fathers, sons or daughters. They never had  the chance to enrich the culture of this nation or to bring their  skills, lives, loves or passions into the fabric of this country. They  are missing, and they are missed.''  [[Page S8439]]    These words helped guide President Trump's actions in office as he  advocated for pro-life policies both domestically and abroad.  Domestically, President Trump fought to defund Planned Parenthood and  other abortion providers from receiving Federal funding. He prohibited  such entities from receiving title X funding and permitted States to  prohibit them from participating in Medicaid as well. In 2018,  President Trump issued a rule requiring health insurers to specify  whether plans cover abortion. He also issued rules to protect religious  objectors and moral objectors from the Department of Health and Human  Services contraceptive mandate. In addition, the President established  a new Conscience and Religious Freedom division of the Office for Civil  Rights to protect healthcare providers who object to participating in  abortions.   President Trump's commitment to the unborn was just as strong abroad.  Just days after his inauguration, President Trump ended Federal funding  of abortion overseas by reinstating the Mexico City Policy, which  prohibits nongovernment organizations receiving U.S. aid grants from  performing and promoting abortions overseas. He directed the Secretary  of State to implement the ban on taxpayer funds for overseas abortions  across most U.S. global health programs through his Protecting Life in  Global Health Assistance policy.   In addition, President Trump also defunded the United Nations  Population Fund, a program long tied to China's forced abortion one- child policy. To further underline this, the Trump administration in  2020 declared to the United Nations that abortion is not a human right  and signed the Geneva Consensus Declaration, where 33 nations joined  together to reaffirm the value of unborn life. Finally, in January  2021, the Trump administration and called for the Chinese Communist  Party to immediately end its system of forced abortions.   In addition to his work within the executive branch, President Trump  also showed his commitment to the pro-life cause by nominating  constitutional conservative and originalist judges to the Federal  judiciary. He nominated three originalist Justices to the U.S. Supreme  Court: Justice Neil Gorsuch in 2017, Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018,  and Justice Amy Coney Barrett in 2020. More broadly, President Trump  nominated 234 new article III judges who share this commitment to  upholding our Constitution as written.   As the pro-life movement advances, it is important for us to  recognize how we got here. Former President Trump deserves praise for  all his administration did over the past 4 years to advance the cause  of the unborn. I am gratitude for that work and recognize the tireless  advocacy of the Trump administration to protect both women and their  babies.                            ____________________     Madam President, for many years, thousands of  members of the Intercessors for America--IFA--have been devoted to  prayer and fasting in the name of protecting the unborn and of ending  abortion. The IFA was founded in 1973 in an era when our Nation  experienced turmoil within the political, moral, and traditional values  that are the cornerstone of our Nation.   In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its divisive landmark decision  in Roe v. Wade, legalizing abortion and shocking the majority of  Americans. IFA has worked since then to mobilize our Nation to pray for  the protection of innocent life and to find unity among the cultural  conflicts in our country. Today, IFA is a national organization of  millions of like-minded people who are steadfast in praying for God's  support and guidance for our Nation's executive, legislative, and  judicial branches of government.   I thank the members of IFA for their dedication, prayers, and fasting  in support of the sanctity of life. Their work has helped increase  awareness for the pro-life movement and its overarching goal to defend  the unborn. It is the decades of prayer and hard work of so many pro- life advocates that has led us to this moment in history in which the  Supreme Court will be hearing oral arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson  Women's Health Organization. This case, which focuses on the  constitutionality of a Mississippi law that bars abortion after 15  weeks, could reset the abortion issue and return it to elected leaders,  who are more directly accountable to the people than Federal judges.   Today, I recognize and pay tribute to the role of the IFA in the  nearly 50-year fight to protect innocent life in the womb. I also join  with the IFA in praying for the members of our Supreme Court, who are  now preparing to hear the Dobbs case. May God grant each Justice wisdom  for the task and mercy for the unborn.                            ____________________     Madam President, it is an honor to pay tribute to my  fellow public servant Sam Brownback of Kansas. During his service both  as Governor of Kansas and as a U.S. Senator, he advocated tirelessly  for the right to life. More recently, during the last administration,  he served as the U.S. Ambassador at Large for International Religious  Freedom, fighting for the free exercise of religion abroad.   After a couple years in the House of Representatives, Ambassador  Brown- back represented Kansas in the Senate from 1996 to 2011. He came to the  Capitol with a background similar to mine. I served as the Mississippi  Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce prior to coming to the Senate,  and Ambassador Brownback served as Kansas's Secretary of Agriculture  before coming to DC.   Upon joining the Senate, Ambassador Brownback consistently supported  pro-life legislation and voted in defense of the sanctity of life.  Through his 15 years in the Senate, he supported pro-life legislation  including the Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act, the Born Alive Infants  Protection Act, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, the Partial Birth  Abortion Ban Act, and the Hyde amendment.   This support for unborn life continued when the people of Kansas  elected Sam Brownback to be their Governor, a position in which he  served from 2011 to 2018. As Governor, he signed numerous laws  protecting unborn human life, including a measure that made Kansas the  first State to ban dismemberment abortions. Furthermore, during his  tenure, Kansas passed laws restricting funding to abortion providers  and banning sex-selective abortions, among many others.   Sam Brownback's steadfast efforts paid off. By the time he became an  Ambassador in 2018, Kansas had become the second most pro-life State in  the Nation, as ranked by the Americans United for Life. In fact, the  number of abortions in Kansas dropped by nearly 30 percent, a testimony  to the success of his policies promoting a culture of life.   But his efforts did not stop there. Upon his confirmation in 2018 as  the U.S. Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom, he  continued the fight to protect life and stand up against injustice  abroad. He worked hand-in-hand with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in  condemning the Chinese Communist Party for its regime of forced  abortions and sterilizations.   Throughout his long and commendable career in public service,  Ambassador Brownback has shown a remarkable commitment to the sanctity  of life. As the Supreme Court prepares to hear the Dobbs v. Jackson  Women's Health Organization case, I am pleased to rise to recognize  leaders in the pro-life movement who have advanced the cause to this  point. Ambassador Brownback is definitely among those leaders for his  many years as a champion for life.                            ____________________     Madam President, as the U.S. Supreme Court prepares  to hear oral arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization  case, I am taking time to recognize leaders in the pro-life movement  who have helped bring us to this point. Today, I pay tribute to former  Congressman Sean Duffy, who represented the pro-life values of the  Seventh District of Wisconsin for five terms from 2011-2019.   Throughout his time in the House, Representative Duffy remained  unwavering in his commitment to the sanctity of life. Whatever pro-life  issue  [[Page S8440]]  arose, Representative Duffy was there to defend the unborn and the  value of all life.   As religious liberty issues entered in the debate over the Affordable  Care Act--ACA--Representative Duffy fought to keep taxpayer funding  from covering abortions in ACA health plans. His opposition was part of  his larger effort to oppose taxpayer funding for abortion in any arena,  a fight embodied in his support of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion  Act.   As our Nation a few years later learned of the horrors perpetrated by  notorious abortionist Kermit Gosnell, Representative Duffy took to the  House floor to highlight the evil of abortion as shown in Gosnell's  case.   When videos revealed that Planned Parenthood was illegally selling  fetal tissue from aborted babies, Representative Duffy joined his  colleagues in calling for an investigation into this travesty. His pro- life leadership role led to an appointment to the House Energy and  Commerce Committee's Select Investigative Panel on Planned Parenthood  that investigated that organization's illegal fetal tissue sales.   A true pro-life hero, Representative Duffy leads by example in living  out his pro-life values. On August 2019, Representative Duffy announced  his resignation to focus on his ninth child who was born with heart  defects and Down's syndrome.   Representative Duffy, along with his wife Rachel Campos-Duffy, stands  as an inspirational example of how to champion pro-life and pro-family  values in both public roles and in private lives.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to recognize Bethany Kozma,  former Deputy Chief of Staff at the United States Agency for  International Development--USAID. She deserves to be honored for her  tireless work during the last administration to execute pro-life, pro- family, and pro-religious freedom policies across USAID.   While her efforts in this regard garnered criticism, Mrs. Kozma  remained resolute in advancing the Agency's firm pro-life positions.  Her courage is an example to us all to cling tightly to our strongly  held values, even in face of criticism.   Standing strong, Mrs. Kozma played an integral role in helping the  U.S. Department of State, USAID, and the U.S. Department of Health and  Human Services better synchronize their efforts in countless  multilateral negotiations. This synergy helped ensure that the  agreements formed by those negotiations did not promote or permit  abortion.   In my own work here in the Senate, I know staff members toiling  behind the scenes do important work that allows me to do my job  successfully. No doubt, that is also true in the executive branch.   The work of dedicated agency staff like Mrs. Kozma was integral to  the many pro-life successes of the past administration. Her tireless  work helped ensure the United States could lead in pro-life policies  abroad. Mrs. Kozma and others like her deserve recognition and our  gratitude.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to former  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. During Mr. Pompeo's time at the State  Department, he worked tirelessly to defend unborn children around the  world. Under then-Secretary Pompeo's leadership, the United States  stood as a nation that values all human rights, including the right to  life. His bold leadership encouraged other world leaders to join the  United States in standing against efforts by some within the United  Nations to make abortion on demand an international right.   Mr. Pompeo established his pro-life bona fides during his four terms  in the U.S. House of Representatives. During that time, he supported  numerous pieces of pro-life legislation, such as the No Taxpayer  Funding for Abortion Act and the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection  Act.   His commitment to the pro-life cause continued in his role as our  Nation's top diplomat. A few particular successes stand out.   First, Secretary Pompeo initiated a new compliance mechanism to  ensure enforcement of the Mexico City Policy, which prohibits taxpayer  dollars from being used for abortion overseas. Under the Protecting  Life in Global Health Assistance policy, the State Department would  refuse to partner with any foreign organizations involved in supporting  abortions. Additionally, these nongovernment organizations will also  have to provide certification to the State Department that they are not  involved with abortions. This highly successful policy closed an  overwhelming proportion of the loopholes that had previously allowed  organizations to skirt compliance with the Mexico City Policy.   Second, Secretary Pompeo ensured full enforcement of the Siljander  amendment, an annual rider in the State and foreign operations  appropriations bill to prohibit the use of U.S. funds, including  foreign assistance, to lobby for or against abortion abroad.   Third, the Department of State led the United States to sign the  Geneva Consensus Declaration in 2020, which reaffirmed ``that there is  no international right to abortion.'' Thirty-three other nations,  representing more than 1.6 billion people, also signed the declaration,  an achievement that would not have been possible without American  leadership on the issue.   Finally, Pompeo's Department of State in 2020 also sanctioned China  for its many human rights abuses, including forced abortions and forced  sterilizations.   These accomplishments make clear that former Secretary of State Mike  Pompeo made true strides in vigorously defending the right to life of  the unborn babies around the globe. His endeavors deserve our applause  and gratitude.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to Morse Tan,  former Ambassador at Large for Global Criminal Justice, whose  dedication to the legal defense of human rights and the rights of the  unborn is commendable.   Morse Tan's work to promote these values has spanned the globe. As an  expert on North Korea, he has written extensively about the human  rights abuses occurring in that country and how those responsible can  be held accountable. In his book, ``North Korea, International Law and  the Dual Crises: Narrative and Constructive Engagement,'' Tan sheds  light on the genocide of Christians in North Korea, focusing  specifically on the forced abortions imposed on many North Korean  women.   As Ambassador at Large for Global Criminal Justice during the last  administration, Ambassador Tan worked to gather evidence of China's  repressive treatment of the Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities,  including forced abortions and forced sterilizations. Based in part on  the Ambassador's work, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in July 2020  imposed sanctions on Chinese officials because of human rights abuses.  Furthermore, Secretary Pompeo determined that China had committed  crimes against humanity and genocide against the Uyghurs and other  ethnic minority groups, based on the findings of an internal review led  by Ambassador Tan.   Ambassador Tan has also undertaken significant work on behalf of the  sanctity of life in the United States as well. He has filed amicus  briefs in two Supreme Court cases regarding pro-life issues. In  McCorvey v. Hill, Ambassador Tan coordinated, researched, and edited  some 24 amicus briefs on behalf of Norma McCorvey, who was the  plaintiff ``Jane Roe'' in Roe v. Wade. In Cano v. Baker, he  coordinated, researched, and edited 22 amicus briefs on behalf of  Sandra Cano, who was the plaintiff ``Mary Doe'' in Doe v. Bolton.   Finally, I hope that Ambassador Tan's work as a law professor in  courses such as bioethics, international human rights, and  constitutional law will inspire a new generation to take up the legal  fight to protect the sanctity of life.   It is an honor to recognize Ambassador Morse Tan for his  uncompromising work to defend the right of the unborn babies in courts  and to bring justice and accountability for perpetrators of forced  abortions around the world.  [[Page S8441]]                                ____________________     Madam President, I rise to recognize Congresswoman  Ann Wagner, who represents the Second Congressional District of  Missouri in the U.S. House of Representatives. Throughout her tenure in  the House; Representative Wagner has remained an outspoken champion for  life. Representative Wagner has worked to protect unborn life, through  her vocal support of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act and  so many other pieces of pro-life legisltaion. Additionally, she has  helped lead the charge to prevent taxpayer funding of abortion on- demand.   This public servant's efforts to protect vulnerable children from  sexual exploitation and trafficking are particularly inspirational. She  has fought hard for legislation that would increase the penalties for  criminals who profit from sexual exploitation of innocent children.   Representative Wagner's commitment to children both inside and  outside the womb is commendable. I know I take inspiration from her  years of work on behalf of vulnerable children. Therefore, I offer my  praise and gratitude for that work as the U.S. Supreme Court takes up  Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, a case that could  significantly change the landscape in terms of protecting young lives.                            ____________________     Madam President, with the U.S. Supreme Court  set to consider Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization in oral  arguments on December 1, 2021, I am taking time to recognize  individuals whose dedication to the pro-life cause has led us to this  point. In this case, I pay tribute to Mr. John D. Beckett from Elyria,  OH. His activities have been intertwined with championing pro-life and  religious freedom.   Mr. Beckett graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  in 1960, after which he initially worked as an engineer in the  aerospace industry. In 1963, he joined his father's small manufacturing  business, R.W. Beckett Corporation, and 2 years later became president  following his father's death. Under Mr. Beckett's leadership, this  small company grew over time to become a worldwide leader in producing  engineered components for residential and commercial heating. With its  affiliates, the company employs nearly 1,000 people.   In addition to his business endeavors, Mr. Beckett has long been  active in both church and community-related activities. This is where  he has established himself as a champion of the pro-life movement.   In 1973, Mr. Beckett became a founding member of the Intercessors for  America, a national prayer organization, and he continues to serve on  the board today. The Intercessors for America has helped lead  grassroots efforts for people of faith to unite in prayer for the pro- life movement and for the unborn. In addition, he also became a  founding board member of King's College in New York City, a Christian  university, and he also serves on the board of Cru--Campus Crusade for  Christ International. Alongside  [[Page S8443]]  these community activities, Mr. Beckett also found time to become a  published author, writing two books about faith in the workplace.   For these business and community activities, Mr. Beckett has received  numerous accolades. He received an honorary doctor of law degree from  both Spring Arbor University in 2002 and also from King's College in  2008. He was also named Christian Businessman of the Year by the  Christian Broadcasting Network in 1999 and the Entrepreneur of the Year  by Ernst & Young in 2003.   Today, he resides in Elyria, OH, with his wife, Wendy, to whom he has  been married since 1961.   I am thankful to John D. Beckett for his support of many nonprofit  organizations that defend the rights of the unborn and religious  freedom. His work in helping establish the Intercessors for America has  led to untold numbers of prayers being raised for the pro-life  movement. I am pleased to honor his work through that organization as  well as his lifetime of service to so many worthy causes.                            ____________________     Madam President, I am honored to pay tribute  to former Governor Phil Bryant of Mississippi. While there are many  things for which the Governor deserves praise, today I specifically  want to speak about Governor Bryant's stalwart work during his term of  office from 2012-2020 to protect and defend the most vulnerable of our  society: unborn children.   While running for office, Phil Bryant promised Mississippians that he  would work tirelessly as Governor to protect the rights of the unborn.  He fulfilled that promise. Throughout two terms in office, Governor  Bryant was a driving force behind legislative efforts to protect life  in Mississippi.   In April 2012, Governor Bryant signed Mississippi House Bill 1390.  This bill required abortion practitioners to be certified as  obstetrician-gynecologists and to maintain admitting privileges at a  local hospital. Through these requirements, this legislation sought to  strengthen abortion regulations and ensure that women receive quality  care for any complications following an abortion.   In April 2014, Governor Bryant signed Mississippi House Bill 1400,  banning abortions performed after 20 weeks. This legislation cited a  plethora of medical evidence, showing that a baby can feel pain at this  stage, and that pregnant women are at increased health risks, even  death, when undergoing later-term abortion procedures.   Additionally, Governor Bryant signed into law the Unborn Child  Protection from Dismemberment Abortion Act in 2016, banning  dismemberment abortions or those involving the practice known as D&E or  ``dilation and evacuation.'' Dismemberment is the most prevalent method  of second trimester abortion, accounting for 96 percent of all second  trimester abortions. With the enactment of this law, Governor Bryant  not only banned these violent dismemberment procedures from taking  place in the Mississippi, he also prohibited the illegal trafficking of  the bodies of aborted babies in Mississippi.   Governor Bryant did not stop there and continued working to keep his  promise to make Mississippi ``the safest place in America'' for unborn  babies. In 2018, he signed the Gestational Age Act, which banned  abortions after 15 weeks in most cases. It is this law being challenged  at the U.S. Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health.   Throughout all of these laws, Governor Bryant maintained steadfast  courage and held tightly to his promise to the people of Mississippi to  fight continuously to protect the unborn. I love what he once said when  groups threatened legal action against our State's pro-life  legislation. He said, ``We will all answer to the good Lord one day. I  will say in this instance, `I fought for the lives of innocent babies,  even under threat of legal action.' ''   That is indeed true. When his time comes, Governor Bryant can stand  tall before the Lord, having fought the good fight to protect the  unborn. And indeed, when the Supreme Court hears oral arguments in the  Dobbs case on December 1, Governor Bryant can smile in the knowledge  that his work was not in vain.   For all these reasons, I call attention to Governor Phil Bryant. He  deserves laudable recognition for his 8-year fight to protect and  defend the right to life for the unborn babies in the womb, reflecting  the character and values of the people of our State,  Mississippi.                            ____________________     Madam President, it is an honor to pay  tribute to Representative Becky Currie, a member of the Mississippi  House of Representatives, who authored the Gestational Age Act. It is  this State law that underlies the U.S. Supreme Court's consideration of  Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization this term.   When the Supreme Court hears oral arguments on Dobbs on December 1,  2021, it will hear a defense of the pro-life cause generating from the  work of Becky Currie, my friend and my representative. In the  Mississippi House, she represents district 92, which covers my hometown  of Brookhaven.   Becky's forethought in introducing this bill and shepherding it  through the State legislature has led us to the point where the Supreme  Court is considering a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade. By prohibiting  most abortions after 15 weeks, the Gestational Age Act presents  directly the question of whether Roe's viability standard remains good  law.   Becky's background as a nurse, her tenacious personality, and her  heart for the unborn made her the perfect person to sponsor this  important bill. She knows how to fight and isn't afraid of criticism.  Her stubborn persistence in promoting policies to protect the unborn  has made Mississippi a safer place for women and their babies. Through  the Supreme Court's consideration of her bill, Becky Currie has the  potential to do that for our entire Nation.   As the Supreme Court prepares to hear oral arguments in the Dobbs  case, we are all indebted to Representative Currie's her courage and  tenacity in sponsoring the Gestational Age Act. Praise God for bringing  us this far. I also pray that He will continue to work through  Representative Currie, using her law to overrule Roe v. Wade and make  our Nation a safer place for the unborn and their mothers.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to  Pastor Mark Lee Dickson of Longview, TX, who founded the Sanctuary  Cities for the Unborn Initiative in 2019. This innovative organization  works to encourage cities and towns to adopt ordinances declaring  themselves as Sanctuary Cities for the Unborn.   Under Pastor Dickson's leadership, this grassroots Sanctuary Cities  for the Unborn movement has saved many babies throughout the Nation in  41 towns and cities that have adopted these ordinances.   This is not the only way that Pastor Dickson has dedicated himself to  championing the pro-life movement. He also serves as the director of  Grassroots for Right to Life of East Texas and as the senior pastor of  Sovereign Love Church in Longview.   Across our Nation, pro-life citizens of all ages and backgrounds  represent the backbone of the grassroots movement to protect the  unborn. Individuals like Pastor Dickson who take it on themselves to  help promote life and prevent abortion in their own communities drive  the passion in this movement.   The Pastor Dickson and millions of other Americans have kept this  issue salient for our political discourse and has led us to the place  where the U.S. Supreme Court will be reconsidering its misguided  abortion jurisprudence established by Roe v. Wade when it takes up a  challenge to a Mississippi law banning most abortions after 15 weeks  gestation. In Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the stage  is set for the potential overturning of Roe and returning the issue of  abortion to the States.   I pray for Pastor Dickson and that God would raise up more like him.  Pastor Dickson's example shows that the courage of one person can make  a difference.  [[Page S8444]]                                ____________________     Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to  Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch.   My State has much to be proud of in Attorney General Fitch as the  first Republican to hold this office in almost 150 years and as  Mississippi's first female attorney general ever.   Specifically today, I rise to honor her for her unwavering fight to  defend Mississippi's pro-life laws. Attorney General Fitch is  representing the State of Mississippi in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's  Health Organization at the U.S. Supreme Court this term. This case is  the most anticipated abortion case to reach the Court since Casey v.  Planned Parenthood in 1992, nearly 30 years ago.   In the Dobbs case, Attorney General Fitch is defending a challenge to  Mississippi House bill 1510, the Gestational Age Act Enacted in 2018,  this legislation bans most abortions after 15 weeks gestation. By  consistently defending this law all the way up to the Supreme Court,  Attorney General Fitch has set the stage for the Court to consider  overturning Roe v. Wade and return the issue of abortion to the States.   The Dobbs case presents the strongest challenge to Roe in our  lifetime. It is encouraging that the Supreme Court, with its first  conservative majority in many years, will hear arguments on the merits  of this Mississippi law. I am so proud that our female Mississippi  Attorney General will be in the courtroom to defend our law in this  case.   In arguing for the Court to reconsider Roe in the State's brief in  the case, Attorney General Fitch said, ``There are those who would like  to believe that Roe v. Wade settled the issue of abortion once and for  all. But all it did was establish a special-rules regime for abortion  jurisprudence that has left these cases out of step with other Court  decisions and neutral principles of law applied by the Court. As a  result, state legislatures, and the people they represent, have lacked  clarity in passing laws to protect legitimate public interests, and  artificial guideposts have stunted important public debate on how we,  as a society, care for the dignity of women and their children.''   I wholeheartedly agree. The unlimited-abortion regime created by the  Roe decision was wrong when it was handed down, and it is wrong now. It  is bad for the unborn, and it is bad for women. I hope the Supreme  Court recognizes that when it hears oral arguments in the Dobbs case on  December 1.   I am confident Attorney General Fitch will make our State proud by  steadfastly defending Mississippi's law to protect unborn.  Mississippians are proud to have this champion for life representing  our State in this landmark case. I am praying for General Fitch and for  her staff as they prepare to continue the fight to defend life before  the highest court in the land.                            ____________________
