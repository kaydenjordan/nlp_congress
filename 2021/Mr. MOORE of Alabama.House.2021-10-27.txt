 Madam Speaker, President Biden's energy  policies have triggered 7-year high gas prices that are hammering  American families and small business owners. Today gas prices are 50  percent higher than a year ago. In Montgomery, folks are paying $3.09 a  gallon, Enterprise $3.21, and Eufaula and Troy $3.29.   At these prices, the average Alabamian will pay about $23 more each  week on gasoline. That is more than $100 a month and $1,200 a year.   Gas prices impact small businesses, too. I am a small business owner,  and countless small businesses like mine that are highly dependent on  gas prices are being hammered right now by these high prices.   Almost all goods and services must be delivered via gas at some  point. So it is basic economics. When the price of gas goes up, the  price of everything goes up. That is on top of near-record inflation  being driven by our out-of-control government spending. This insanity  has to stop or the pain at the pump will continue.   Biden must end his war on American energy, and we must defeat his  socialist tax-and-spend agenda.                            ____________________
