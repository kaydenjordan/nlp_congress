 Mr. Speaker, today, I recognize Daniel Paolello from  Mullica Hills in south Jersey on his attainment of an Eagle Scout rank.   Eagle Scout is the highest rank obtainable from the Boy Scouts of  America. Only a very small percentage of all Boy Scouts will ever make  it to this prestigious recognition.   Eagle Scouts continue to be more likely to dedicate their lives to  service throughout their entire lives, becoming future leaders in  military, business, or politics, and joining the ranks of other Eagle  Scouts like Neil Armstrong, Steven Spielberg, and Gerald Ford, just to  name a very few.   I was proud to attend Daniel's Court of Honor ceremony earlier this  month.   Mr. Speaker, I extend congratulations to Daniel, and we look forward  to big things from him in the future.  [[Page H558]]    We all look for heroes. We look to Washington. We look to  celebrities. I know where my heroes are, and one of them, without a  doubt, is Daniel. May God bless him.                            ____________________
