 Amendment III:   ``No soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house,  without the consent of the owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner  to be prescribed by law.''    Mr. Speaker, a little over a month ago, I attended the  funeral of Javon Wilson. Javon was the grandson of my good friend,  Congressman Danny Davis, and he was just 15 years old when he was shot  and killed in Chicago.   At the funeral, Javon's best friend remembered their talks. ``We were  going to be the ones that never died . . . if we get shot, we were  never going to die,'' he said.   No child should grow up in a world where gun violence is so common  that this talk seems normal.  [[Page H111]]    This week, we turn the page to a new Congress. There is no reason  that commonsense measures like universal background checks, making gun  trafficking a Federal crime, and reinstating the ban on military-style  assault weapons should fall victim to partisan gridlock.   Together, we have the opportunity to save lives and make our  communities safer. This is a priority for me and my constituents, and I  look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to make progress on reducing gun violence and building a safer future  for all our children.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, for 19 years, when Jordan occupied East  Jerusalem and the West Bank, Jews could not visit the Western Wall or  the Jewish Quarter of the Old City. They were denied access to places  where, for 2,000 years, they have continuously made a personal  connection to their faith and their history.   It is impossible to separate Jewish identity from the Western Wall or  the Western Wall from its Jewish identity or Jerusalem from the Jewish  State of Israel, yet this is exactly what has been happening in the  United Nations for years and exactly what Security Council Resolution  2334 sought to do.   In addition, the resolution overwhelmingly assigns blame to Israel,  while avoiding direct criticism of Palestinian incitement and violence.  That is why, last month, I strongly urged President Obama to veto the  resolution.   The U.S. has and must continue to seek a sustainable two-state  solution with a democratic, Jewish State of Israel and a demilitarized  democratic Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security.  But the only path to two states is through direct negotiations by the  two parties. Efforts to force a solution at the U.N. or  internationalize the issues are misguided and risk moving peace further  away.   As an original cosponsor, I call on my colleagues to join me in  supporting H. Res. 11.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of the  bipartisan House Resolution 11 expressing opposition to UNSCR 2334.   In the summer of 1983 I visited the Western Wall in Jerusalem,  Judaism's most holy site, for the first time. Merely 17 years earlier I  could not have gone to the Wall, or for that matter anywhere in the  Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem.   From 1949 to 1967, when Jordan occupied Jerusalem, Jews could not  visit the one place where for nearly 2000 years, they had continuously  made a personal connection to their faith and their history.   It is impossible to separate Jewish identity from the Western Wall,  just as it is impossible to separate the Western Wall from its Jewish  identity, or Jerusalem from the Jewish State of Israel.   Yet this is exactly what has been happening in the United Nations for  years, and exactly what the one-sided UN Resolution sought to do.   In addition to seeking to declare the eastern part of Jerusalem a  settlement, the resolution overwhelmingly assigns blame to Israel,  while averting direct criticism of Palestinian incitement and violence.   That is why last month I strongly urged President Obama to veto the  resolution.   The U.S. has, and must continue to seek a sustainable two-state  solution with a democratic, Jewish state of Israel and a demilitarized,  democratic Palestinian state living side-by-side in peace and security.   But the only path to two states is through direct, bilateral  negotiations between the two parties. Efforts to force a solution at  the U.N. or to internationalize the issue are misguided, and risk  moving peace further away, not closer.   Israel is our most important strategic ally in a most important and  chaotic region of the world. The United States always has and always  will ensure the security of Israel.   As an original co-sponsor, I call on my colleagues to join me in  supporting House Resolution 11.
