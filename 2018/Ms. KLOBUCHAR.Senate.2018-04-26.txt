 Madam President, I rise today to discuss the  nomination of Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State.   After closely reviewing Mr. Pompeo's record and past statements, I  have concluded that he is not the right person to serve as Secretary of  State. While I respect him and will work closely with him, I cannot  support his nomination.   The world continues to look to America for our leadership on  diplomacy and bringing our allies together. That includes upholding  international agreements, such as the Paris accord, which Mr. Pompeo  has opposed. It also includes respect for people of different ethnic  and religious backgrounds, and Mr. Pompeo's past statements about  Muslims and immigrants greatly concern me.   While I voted in favor of confirming Mr. Pompeo to be the Director of  the CIA and thank him for his service, Secretary of State is a  different job with different responsibilities.   Thank you.
