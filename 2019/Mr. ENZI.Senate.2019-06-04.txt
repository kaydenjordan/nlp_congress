 Madam President, today I wish to honor the life and legacy  of the late Senator Thad Cochran.   I appreciate having this opportunity to celebrate the life and  accomplishments of Senator Cochran. His loss will be deeply felt by all  of us here in the Senate, not only by those of us who served with him,  but also by the many staff and individuals he has worked with over  time. Elected to the House of Representatives in 1972, Senator Cochran  touched many lives in his 46 years faithfully serving his State of  Mississippi in Congress.   As the son of a school principal and a math teacher, Senator Cochran  understood the value of hard work and dedication. He emerged as a  leader among his peers from a young age. He was an Eagle Scout who  helped establish a new troop and valedictorian of his class in high  school where he earned varsity letters in football, basketball,  baseball, and tennis. At the University of Mississippi, Senator Cochran  was a fraternity president, student body vice president, and a member  of Omicron Delta Kappa, a national honorary leadership fraternity.  Senator Cochran began his service to our country while at the  University of Mississippi as a company commander in the Navy ROTC and,  once graduated, was commissioned an ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve  and assigned to duty aboard the USS Macon.   As a fellow Eagle Scout, Senator Cochran demonstrated core scouting  values like trust, loyalty, courtesy, and reverence. He displayed these  values not only in his nearly five-decade-long career in Congress, but  also as a father to his two children, Kate and Clayton.   Described as gentle and soft-spoken, Senator Cochran was a defender  of Senate procedure and often worked across the aisle. Senator Cochran  was known to hold strong opinions; yet he developed close working  relationships with members of both parties. Senator Cochran was  determined that, if you look hard enough, there is common ground to be  found with everyone. He earned his nickname of the Quiet Persuader  through a determined yet respectful approach to negotiations.   I had the honor of working with Senator Cochran in his role as  chairman of the Appropriations Committee while I was chairmen of the  Budget Committee. He was a hard worker and always guided by his core  values. As a good statesman, he didn't let party politics get in the  way and always did what he thought was right.   In a nearly five-decade-long career in Congress, it is difficult to  pinpoint Senator Cochran's single greatest achievement. Following  Hurricane Katrina's devastation, Senator Cochran played a central role  in security relief funds for Gulf States, especially for his home State  of Mississippi. During his tenure as chairman of the Agriculture  Committee, Senator Cochran was a champion of the farm bill's nutrition  programs. Senator Cochran served as a tireless advocate for farm  families and America's agricultural industry.   Senator Cochran authored the Mississippi Wilderness Act, which was  the first Federal legislation ever passed for the perpetual protection  of lands in the State of Mississippi. He was greatly involved in land  and wildlife conservation in Mississippi, a legacy of his that will  endure for future generations to enjoy.   Senator Cochran was an effective lawmaker who was a tireless advocate  for his constituents. His model of public service was that the  constituents are always right. He said we are in Congress to serve, not  to be served. Senator Cochran's model of public service is one to look  up to and his style of leadership will serve as an inspiration for  future generations to come.   Senator Cochran was a committed man of faith. A member of the  Southern Baptist Church, he was always one to do what he thought was  right rather than what was easiest.   My wife Diana joins me in sending our deepest condolences to his  loved ones and know he will find eternal peace and happiness knowing he  had a profound effect on all that knew him a colleague, as a father,  and as a friend.                            ____________________
