So (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the rules were suspended and  the bills were passed.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.   Stated against:    Mr. Speaker, a lot of people have been speaking a lot  of wonderful high praise about Louie.   I will tell you, I met Louie before I arrived in Congress. I am a  freshman, so I haven't had the opportunity to spend as much time with  him as many of you have. Before I got here, Louie sat me down, and he  told me a story.   He was out in Montana doing an event for another Member of Congress.  He told me this story: I used to be a judge. I was a judge there in  east Texas, and one of the big cases that I had come before me when it  was right before an election.   He said every other judge that had this case presented to them had  recused themselves because they didn't want to have their fingerprints  on it because it was a big problem. It was a man and a wife. There was  a domestic problem. There was a murder involved. Half the town  supported the husband, half the town supported the wife, and there  wasn't a judge around that wanted to get involved in the situation.   Louie said: I thought about it. I thought about it, and I went to  prayer that evening. I was really struggling with whether I needed to  pick this case up or not, whether I needed to pick that fight or not.   He said: The next morning, I got up and knew what I had to do. It  came to me, the words from the Holy Spirit came to me, ``You can't run  from what you ran for.''   You can't run from what you ran for. I have carried that message with  me as I walk into this Chamber on a daily basis because there are so  many people who are afraid to do the right thing. They know what is  right, and they walk away and hide. They get other people to help them  explain their way out of it.   But there is a right and a wrong in what we do up here, and Louie  Gohmert personifies a man who is willing to stand up and say this is  what is right, and this is what is wrong. We don't need a deep  explanation about it. It is really rather simple: Don't run from what  you ran for. It is difficult  [[Page H8789]]  issues that we are addressing every single day, and this is why we were  sent here.   They tell us all that we are honorable when we get here. You get  letters in the mail, the Honorable Matt Rosendale, the Honorable Randy  Weber, the Honorable Clay Higgins, and, yes, the Honorable Andy Biggs.  It is not so important when you get here to be called honorable as it  is to still be addressed as honorable when you leave.   I will stand here and tell everyone that Louie Gohmert will be  considered honorable when he leaves this place, and I am honored to  call him my friend.   God bless you. Please come and kill a turkey on my place next year.
